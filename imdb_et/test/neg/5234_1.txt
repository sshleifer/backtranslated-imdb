** May include spoiler ** Dreadful. Just terrible. I loved Stephen King's novel and it's just a terrible customization. They change the end. They change the plot. They turned Alan Pangborne's character into a sad spouse happy to be a groom. If you're a fan of Stephen King's novel, stay away. Even if you are not, leave it. <br /> <br /> The book was even dark, even for Steve King. 11-year-old kills himself in a novel. In Rome, there is a director of secondary education with child pornography. It's not nearly as good as the novel. <br /> <br /> This movie is my least favorite movie all the time. I hate this movie with revenge.
