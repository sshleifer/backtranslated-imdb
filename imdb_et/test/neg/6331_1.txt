La Ragazza del Vagone Letto or Terror Express! As I saw, it starts on a long-distance train with different passengers. Three thuggish idiots, Dave, Phil & Ernie (Carlo De Mejo) aboard and it is clear that they are there to cause trouble because they intimidate and orally abuse other travelers and staff. As the speed of the train along the way becomes unattractive when the prostitute Juliette (Silvia Dionisio) refuses to sex with Dave, she and her companions decide to host the whole train so that they can be orgy with Juliette and, in fact, not much hero and her prisoner who saved the day. Erm, it's really ... <br /> <br /> This Italian production was led by Ferdinando Baldi & is a complete complete and perfect mess from start to finish. George Eastman's Luigi Montefior script could just as easily be described as really boring porn as a horror / thriller. It is annoyingly slow, it is 35 minutes before something happens that far slips and the whole film lacks the elements of exploitation that Italian sleaze & horror gave at that time. The movie can be compared to the second Italian production of the same Italian year in the end of the House of the Park of the Park, although it is quite a comparison compared to everything that made the house a notorious movie at La Ragazza del Vagone Letto, blood is not, there is no idea, almost no violence, there is only a couple of truly rape rape, the story is not twisted or turned and as it is incredibly boring to look at. The Italian sleaze & horror from the late 1970s and early 80s is not known for its strong story or large scripts, but this film draws the bottom of the barrel from all the stories. The characters are terrible, the movie spends the first 30 plus minutes, keeping them up and giving the background why they're on the train, but it's all forgotten quickly and doesn't get anything. I hated the end of the lame and I don't know if I missed something, but what was a reasonable explanation of why these three lamb trains would hijack? I don't think there was, was it? Sorry, but because your angry prostitute is not enough reason, filmmakers would certainly have had something more important and interesting, if not more credible. In my opinion, this film stinks, it's as simple and straight as I fear. <br /> <br /> Director Baldi is doing the right job to be fair, he has only one corridor and some train chambers to work so I created some relaxation for him, saying that the movie becomes very repetitive. There's no style and she's filming sex scenes like a bad soft core full of terrible romantic sounding piano music. There is no one-off blood in the whole movie, it's not right. Forget about any gore or violence because you're very disappointed when you do. There are a couple of rapes, but they are amateurly staged and have zero impact, disgusting and reluctant to say that I spit on my grave (1978) or the last house on the left (1972) is not here. <br /> La Ragazza del Vagone Letto is technically and well done for what has been a small budget, but this provision obviously helped keep costs to a minimum. Action is weak as usual, although since it was duplicated, the original performances have disappeared. Italian horror fans have many voices here. <br /> <br /> La Ragazza del Vagone Letto is a terrible movie, it's just my opinion, but I wanted tears to wait for something to happen and when I never knew it, I want those 80 minutes of my life back. This cute piece does not even fit your local Blockbuster 99p VHS discount table, one to avoid.
