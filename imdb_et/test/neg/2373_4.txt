Danny De Vito shows us here that he is definitely, indeed infinitely, better off the screen than off. She plays Owen's part, an unhappy old mother with a happy writer who has played beautifully with Anne Ramsey. He'd like to see him dead. Billy Crystal is Larry, a very frustrated writer with a stranger she knows the same way. So, Owen suggests following Hitchcock's "stranger train" that they exchange murders. <br /> <br /> As De Vito's leader, it is inconsistent because he wastes this wise idea, while his film is very humorous for very blissful. He and Crystal are in the lead, but the exhibition belongs to Anne Ramsey as Mrs. Lift. <br /> <br /> Saturday, June 20, 1992 - Video
