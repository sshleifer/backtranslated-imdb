I was watching this movie erroneously, thinking it was the second radio station zombie. The value of Shonky's production and the small number of rentals soon made it another of these cheap styles of sci-fi channels. <br /> <br /> Bill Moseley's central performance is initially quite interesting as a dubious radio shock jock, but when the movie goes, it becomes less and less convincing because it is actually required to act. The rest of the cast is little other than to look and have no depth. <br /> <br /> Cinematic art is boring, flat and completely endless, like many of these films. It doesn't even get a good bit of convincing gore, the zombie is literally pathetic, except for one remarkable exception at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The film attempts to inject originality and message it is a semi-baked and ripped idea that equates this outbreak to intolerance against Islam and the war on terror. This is regrettably treated with the intellectual effect of all 6-year-olds. Like characters and seemingly writers, there is no difference between race and religion - describing all people with a certain skin color as "Muslims". Most importantly, one sign is only Muslim. At the same time, the outbreak is caused by "psychopathic stereotype" of "Muslim" terrorists. <br /> <br /> Probably the far right Pontypool had a similar budget to Dead Air, but it looks everywhere this movie fails.
