Code 46 is one of the sci-fi movies where the government controls who you love, and is actually punished when you try to create the wrong person. Beaches and the old do not live in completely separate areas that can remove your memories, etc. We've seen this stuff before, but it's OK- there's no 100% original movie. This assumption is always conceivable. Unfortunately, it is more interesting to see such a future than looking at code 46. The characters are boring and rarely say anything interesting. Perhaps this comment is dehumanized about the future, but it is still boring to look at. This is sloooow. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the images are beautiful, but usually (with their "emotional" soundtrack) it looks just like a glorified perfume van. Code 46 is sometimes also used for television camera work that I find annoying. You know that two characters speak when the camera moves to one side. Two seconds later, their other side swims in vain, trying to keep their attention. <br /> <br /> My friends liked this movie. If they tried to look at me again, they probably won't do it unless they agree to pay me $ 50.
