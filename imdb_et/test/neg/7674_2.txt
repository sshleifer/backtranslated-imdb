This happens when the franchise becomes lazy and no one can think of a new addition. Remember what happened to the "Childs Play" series? The first three played horror films that have real fears (though predictable) that stuck to the film's theme. Then the people went to the puppet and decided to laugh. The next two were black comedies ..... <br /> <br /> Well, it happened here, but I think it wasn't like that. Similarly, "I wanted to make pancakes for dessert! I did it for a purpose!" if your soufflé accidentally limbs. But milk flowed and in theaters it was somewhat valuable as goof. <br /> <br /> When the floor was hanging under passenger seats, I waited for passengers to extend their legs through the hole to start Flintstones-Style to safely land the aircraft into the Alps. I did. It would have fit the rest of the exhibition into the foolish chamber world. <br /> <br /> Instead of the obvious physical impossibility of a film that is socially unlikely? Like George Kennedy's character, he responds calmly to the news that his date was a whore? Even in 1979, one could not easily accept the idea that he had just poured out his heart on a paid companion. He thought he made a connection with a tribal spirit, who was later referred to as a mercenary of a mercenary. Who doesn't feel the experience cheated? And he still tears and wraps his friend's belt around when they are happily walking. Which slippery scene is cheap? Okay. <br /> <br /> I had an appetite for soufflé and I got pancakes without served cliché. And no, you didn't do it for a purpose!
