In addition to some very crude violence, this painful film is the most remarkable after 68 minutes, which seems to be two hours. <br /> <br /> It starts with a long intro with the introduction of the Leeds family, including two precarious guns and their adult brother and sister, completely clich√©d Pa and Ma, and an incredibly annoying grandfather (played by Charles "Chic" Sales). When sitting at dinner, the family disturbs the sounds of the fire and radiates into the window in time to see how two mobile phones collided on the street. Mobsters flee through family life, leaving them a witness to a crime. The rest of the film is made up of Walter Huston as a cross-racer DA, who occasionally interrupts long-lasting anti-crime calls to make half-hearted attempts to protect the family from the mobile. It all comes up in a predictable way. <br /> <br /> The good points of the movie are a couple of decent shootouts and really nasty beating, Nat Pendleton as one of the mobsters and a great Sue Blane in the small as Leeds daughter. <br /> <br /> If you want to look at Huston as your early trademark crusading lawyer, try the "Beast of the Birds" in 1932. Avoid this as much as possible.
