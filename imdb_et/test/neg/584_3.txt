Although our Gang comedies are still their followers, I have to say that their attempt to end the feature films, Hal Roach politely, was short. Why Roach had to choose a civil war subjected to all subsequent racism. <br /> <br /> South Cavalier Phillips Holmes involuntarily takes on the young orphans Spanky McFarland and his new black friend, Tatar Thomas, is unveiling a cardboard boat. In the old southern part, everything is calm and peaceful, and then the civil war will destroy it for everyone. <br /> <br /> But even the kids get the worst magic in the world and are no worse than the fucking Yankees. They just come south and destroy it all. <br /> <br /> Criticized, even though it was from its southern perspective, Gone With The Wind made a good case for the southern cause and blacks, though on the edge they'd like. be irrelevant, there are still three-dimensional characters. Hattie McDaniel could not have won her Oscar if it wasn't. Butterfly McQueen's Prissy character is so stupid and empty when he had some dimension. <br /> <br /> There are perhaps some of the worst racial stereotypes that ever emerged in Hollywood. Spanky and buckwheat have proven that children are coming, racial feelings are acquired not inbred. It is not a negligence of black people, which is reluctant, but its full acceptance. Directly from this terrible watermelon song that was sung over the title credit, General Spanky's message is bad. <br /> <br /> Yet he got an Oscar nomination for sound recording, probably one of the few Hal Roachs ever went out on a short topic. <br /> <br /> General Spanky is far from wind.
