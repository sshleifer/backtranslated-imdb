I was waiting for a part of my Independence Day weekend to watch a good movie about Jefferson. This movie wasn't it. It was quite long, drawn, boring and unbalanced. It took too much time to study Jefferson's relationship with Cosway and his time with Sally Hemmings didn't take enough time. The woman who played Sally, Thandie Newton, was absolutely terrible. His behavior was so bad that it was like looking at the A1 airhead to write Shakespeare. His constant whining voice nerves nerves! Nolte's accent made Jefferson a more ignorant person than a genius. Jefferson's relations with her daughters and their feelings of slavery were also underdeveloped, but her oldest daughter's rebellion (Patsy) is the main event of the film. The film was too long and the script lacked energy and excitement. On the positive side, the costumes were pretty beautiful and Greta Scacchi played Cosway well. If you want to watch a movie about the revolutionary era and / or Jefferson, check out 1776, it's much better than Jefferson in Paris.
