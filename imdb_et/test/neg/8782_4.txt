Lone Ranger's Uncovered Origin. It shows who he was and how and why he became a Ranger. <br /> <br /> The legendary bomb. The idea was not bad - to invent and introduce Lone Ranger to the audience of the 1980s. Right, though there were problems. The studio ordered Clayton Moore (the original Ranger) to finish everywhere at Lone Ranger. This led to a nasty little battle that made headlines. I know people who refused to watch the movie because of Moore's handling. They also hired Ranger to play awesomely untalented Klinton Spilsbury. Spilsbury was very beautiful and muscular, but he had absolutely no charisma and just couldn't act. Actually, his entire vocal performance was played by another actor! Also, his off screen shot (public drinking and beating people) didn't help. The omitted script is boring and slow. Also, Ranger itself doesn't appear until HOUR in! At the time when the film was too violent with PG, there were complaints. But I don't think it was so bad. <br /> <br /> Here are some (very few) things - photography was really beautiful; Michael Horse was great as Tonto; Christopher Lloyd has a lot of fun as a villain and when Lone Ranger finally comes out (along with William Tell Overture, who succeeds on the soundtrack), it's really rushing. All in all, this boring and terrible attempt to bring Lone Ranger back. It's easy to understand why it was bombarded. A 4 - mainly for photography.
