A version of Dragonball's live action through Taiwan. There are many activities and bad comedies resulting from this. I do not know. It's really bad, but funny, that really bad movies can be. Come on, this is one of the few martial arts I've ever seen where you actually see the wires. This is a live action movie that hasn't been so far from this show that it makes me scare in filming big American movies. choose a movie to watch this movie. If you see that it is sober (like me) then avoid it.
