For a truly wonderful movie, you might want to try to see a movie about Saint Francis of Assisi - good for everyone. The best thing I liked about this movie was the Mexican landscape, and it will be a movie until 2. I was surprised that they didn't have a terrible sunburn, they weren't living in the desert. And Moses has a talkable obstacle, but certainly not here. Even "miracle" scenes were created and incredible. And what's the point if you could believe the TV story? Talk about fooling, I thought this film made by Hallmark was pathetic, and I see why others hate Hollywood. I do not want, but some of these companies' profit players. You do not have to be religious in any way to benefit from "Jesus Nazareth," but for this cellulose waste you have to be bored, do something, buggy and religious. And to get a true movie experience, try "Short Cut to Nirvana", a highly rated movie.
