Koyaanisquatsi is just the best movie I've ever seen. This is a masterpiece where everything is in the right place. Some scenes are not "nice" or "beautiful", but the camera never burns or invades. This is what is happening here. The camera is used as a habit, a shame and a ridicule. There is no magic flow here, no sense of size or respect. Instead, some scenes are woven together without a larger goal or plan. Music is disturbing. Just as I ever appreciated Koyaanisquats' best movie, it's the worst. It is also a "clean" film, but it is a negative form, exactly what should be done *.
