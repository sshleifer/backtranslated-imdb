This is a great example of a delightfully bad b-movie. Such films are much worse (for example, Titanic), but it definitely shares a steam evening with a bunch of movies. <br /> <br /> OK it was probably in Kansas City, explaining why everything is so flat. The main boy looks like Steve Guttenberg, and it's even worse than him! I didn't even think it was possible! In fact, he and the main girl in the film are responsible for WORST DRAMA EVER! It's not just that it was a dramatic effect, in fact it was that the script was terrible, combining a deadly one-two-stroke bad terrible, totally unobtrusive drama. <br /> <br /> Scarecrow, let's talk about him. The jump you hear every time it is is stupid and obviously duplicated. Now in her costume, I can't get over it - it's a boy who wears bags and stupid mask! I'm just stupid, maybe if your 3-year-old with brain damage would be scared of him. <br /> <br /> One of the characters, a symbolic black man, actually used the line: "It may be an opportunity to earn my red wings" when I refer to the quest with one girl during my period. Oh, yes, this is the kind of dialogue you expect. <br /> <br /> Oh, at first, when a little clad girl runs through corn, why is it ripped? I'm pretty sure it shouldn't be obvious, but one of the many obvious mistakes made under this "movie." The other is bad copying to the musical number (yup thats right), there's all the beach and one dorkaziod rises the courage to sing the song and play the guitar for everyone, and that's so obviously funny. Fortunately, the scarecrow responds to all our prayers and throws the spear through the boy's chest as he sings. Generally, such a gore is pretty good, it's one of those movies when you kill those people. <br /> <br /> OK, there is a scene where two men bury one of their friends in the sand, then stand up, whip their penis and urinate all over the sand. Who does it? Really imagine, "Hey, let's bury in the sand, get up and take out our genitals like it's not a big deal and pee him!" In fact, this movie brings gay-eroticism, what the hell? A good part of the beginning of this film is the clothes that stand in the changing room around the underwear and the cornfield, while the threat is taking place. What the hell is that? Traditionally, in movies and in real life, don't let jocks for girls and nerds. It really doesn't make sense because all nerds think of being girls and sex, and probably all jocks are thinking of being a sport and being around each other in their underwear, I can't get it. <br /> <br /> Lets get sex. Like someone who watched this movie with me, it said, "I've never been so outraged by heterosexual sex." If you like hot cups or ugly old boobs, this movie is for you. I swear they found the girl with the smallest breast and this is the one with whom they can make a naked scene? Then the ugly old woman's sister shows her bounces a few times and the man I just didn't want to see. it is actually odd. It starts during the day, then they all go to the landmark and in 2 minutes their instant dark in the night when they leave, saying that they go to the beach - his immediate day again and apparently they stay again once more and until the day of the next day . Basically, these events are on the movie for 4 days, without any characters having to sleep or anything, it's very strange. and apparently none of these people care that they saw their friends brutally murdered! Surviving people literally a pop campaign! And when I realized that the budget did not go into the script, did not run or act, it all went to this fraudulent bottle. </p> Stop reading now, if you don't want the end to end for you, it's really enjoyable. <br /> <br /> OK, so the end is in the church, and the scarecrow put his soul's diabetes into the body of the child. , he fights with the appearance of steve guttenberg, and he is fighting with the b-movie version of the emperor's star wars! I'm not kidding, it's so stupid! So somehow, amidst the struggle, the scarecrow's soul pops bodies guttenberg jr. boy, and then with the will of his own, he predicts on the cross on the church! It's awesome! Blood, but what's better is that the cross is probably a cardboard! See that the bottom moves out of the ground! Wow, yes it's fun to watch.
