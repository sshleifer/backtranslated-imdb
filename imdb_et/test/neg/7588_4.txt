So it happens that both had IVAN THE TERRIBLE, PARTS I and II both in Harry Medved's 50 worst movie books. I think their announcement among the worst films is superfluous, though they are still both pretty poor movies - especially the first, because it showed more eye-catching and "googly eyed looks" than I've ever seen before !! Director Eisenstein and terribly many other people thought it made the film "artistic and deep" - and since I am legally reasonable, I have to say that I hated this first movie !! The second, though still very incomplete, is an enormous improvement because the roll of the eye is minimal, though the superfluous and long boring scene is in this movie like Part 1! Although the second part seems quite incomplete and at least an hour more (especially since he never gets to Ivan's crazy behavior later in life - like killing his son and heir during anger). Since both parts 1 and 2 were commissioned by Stalin to apologize for their murderous government and their glorification, it is not surprising that Ivan's biography is very incomplete. Even without the terrible behavior of Ivan, apparently, the ultimate evil movie didn't like Stalin's film and didn't allow it to be released during his lifetime. Maybe he did not promise it because he was more concerned that people would see how much money and waste of resources the movie was instead of seeing Stalin as a crazy man like Ivan! By the way, there was one segment of this annoying movie that was just so cool that the film deserves 4 (without it, 2) - and it's a scene with Prince Vladimir's banquet! It's well done and funny in the dark. And the scene took place in the Russian version of the 2-color Technicolor. By the way, it is very strange because by the mid-1930s, Technicolor has developed a remarkably advanced real color process that no longer made everything orange-red and greenish-blue. So this film looks like a silent or early sound film during the color sequences. Very strange indeed in the 1940s.
