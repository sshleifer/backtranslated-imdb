Did Beavis and Butthead make this movie? It's just so bad. A really uneven and unfair image of "bad" vs. "good" in the wine world. Have you noticed that the filmmaker is catching any wine from the protective layers of individual wines and terriers. The work of the camera is best if the content can sleep at bedtime. This is not a sensible press. From this film, I found that the filmmaker tried to mark the issue of the globalization of wine, for example, showing that the Mondavi family owned wine producers are all over the world. Okay, that's a good start. So how do you compare these wines? Is Mondavi Napa's cabin like Italian wines. We will never know, because no one in the movie commented on it. Instead, there is a lot of inspiration for the Nazis and Fascism. Well, these things do not grow grapes. Hmmmm.
