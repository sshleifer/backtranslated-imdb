I'm really surprised that it got 88% of Rotten Tomatoes and was named the Best Foreign Movie by Oscar. 7.3 rating on IMDb ... it's not so much a surprise to see how IMDb users recently voted. I can't just get into a movie where the actual facts about this main character are obviously distorted and in no way to make the film artistic, but rather melodramatic and less boring. From this it turns out that it really is boring for everyone who had been waiting to see a serious and reliable interpretation of the life of Genghis Khan. Mongolian, drawn and over dramatized, often reproduces 300 pleasant films that cannot be happier to be ridiculously inaccurate; but unlike 300, Mongol is serious. This is a stoic seriousness that is mixed with obvious inaccuracies, making it the most boring film I saw this year; maybe the most action or biological movie I've seen. The characters were pathetically written. Frankly, I doubt that Genghis Khan was as boring and passive as shown in this film. What is funny to me, because if there was something I should change for the sake of theatricality, it would make a dull person an interesting person. The romance of Khan and Borte is also boring, simple and stupid. Also, the Mongolian does not contain any stupus scene that I have seen in the LONG TIME, without giving up anything - where there should be a 20-minute plot development, the film simply leaves without explanation. It looked like something that was on Saturday night living skits that parody epic action films with a terrible pace. (Did I mention how serious Mongol is taking himself?) Meanwhile, it's like a movie ever seen. Even now I can swear that it was three hours. After about 45 minutes, I checked the time, pretty sure it was almost finished. In addition to some of the real landscapes and quality that Asano (of course) works, the Mongolian is simply a disaster. It could never attract me or enlighten me. I never give this film a second chance. And not for racist or patriotic or anything else, but to give me a Mongolian daily and meaningless American epic. At least then I know what I do, unlike Mongolia, where reviews and assessments believed it was really worth something. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about how much Mongol I hated. I have friends who I know will definitely love it.
