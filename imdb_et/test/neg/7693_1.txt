This film, as the first CSR film, should be active and good for its people. Otherwise, we see that Rotana's cast wants to show religious people as a terrorist and stupid in Saudi Arabia, in fact they are not very calm and intelligent. The director is not even less good. The grandfather in the film is very younger than his father. And girls who are not Saudi Arabia show their girls that they want people to meet their needs. Hasham was just one part of a piece of furniture that he didn't do when he imagined only when he told his lover that I loved you and his friend wasn't talking to strange girls >>>>>>> really funny or really stupid < br Isaiah was not only moving his own, and he watched this movie as the only word he said "A5zo Al Shai6an". That's the movie Weird Thing is when the girls were in a family-related restaurant, the young man told his girlfriends to "kiss me" several times >>>>> Did it happen in Saudi Arabia when girls and boys grow up and Muslem is not bitch and adulterers. Every Saudi is a patriot in his heart that does not allow this stupid movie to be seen
