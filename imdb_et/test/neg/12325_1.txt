If you liked the Grinch movie ... look, look at it again, because it was not so close to the translation of the Seussian movie. The Mike Myers cat is probably the most annoying sign to grace the screen in recent times. His voice / accent is terrible and he laughs with his jokes with a terrible piss, which is the only smile I heard in the theater. Even the kids didn't like this person, and the kids laugh at something. Save your money and see Looney Tunes: Back in action if you are looking for a fun holiday movie.
