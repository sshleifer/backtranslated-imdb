I usually praise a movie that tries to do something different or original in the genre. It is obvious that this film is a parody in ninja films. And I really did my best to enjoy the movie. But I just couldn't. Jokes are not enough fun! (I've seen my part of Japanese movies. And most of the times I like and understand the humor used in these films. "The red shadow is just a stupid! Serious movie and shows that everything is fun. Look at parodies like" Hot Shots "or" Scary Movie " Everything they do on the screen is done with a straight face and never leaves out of character! That's why certain scenes become funny and fun. "Red Shadow" will never get it, the ninja of the shadow should be very experienced and deadly. to make us feel good about their talents. They don't do things in a straight face. The jokes would have worked better if they did! The bad choreography of the action plans also harmed my viewing experience. I like humor in martial arts if that's good. "Red shadow" just in this department Well, the music (techno) was uplifting. It was supposed to be like it's never exciting. And there are some short dramatic scenes, which is good but simple. The use of humor, the story and the lack of depth believe that this film is for children. But I don't know if the kids really want this movie. Waste of time!
