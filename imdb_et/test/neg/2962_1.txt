This film was produced by Producers Releasing Corp. (PRC), the so-called "Poverty Row" 1930s and 40s film studios. So you can imagine how little money it took to make it. <br /> <br /> Music is forgotten. Actress member Gerra Young exhibits operative quality sound, but is a kind of discount for Deanna Durbin. The IMDb database doesn't show him another movie, so we hope he managed to move on to some position in the Grand Opera. <br /> <br /> The credit for opening a recent edition of Turner, a classic film, shows that this film has been preserved by the National Film Museum. Is this an immediate question? WHY? <br /> <br /> Are their resources so large that they can keep their lives? Some of the low-budget or B-musicals of this era have redeemed the qualities that make them valuable. There is no one in this movie. <br /> <br /> I think skip this movie. In fact, it wastes an hour.
