The latest documentary "The Adventures of Errol Flynn" is a comprehensive look at the Ultimate Hollywood hero. Bogart, Cagney, Wayne, and others were basically blue collars in their screen shots, but Flynn was an aristocrat with his style and style, a younger son, who cast out his way of thinking, thunder and romance. if he had not been contracted to Warner Bros, he would have been perfect in the role of Cary Grant in doubt: a good-looking wizard whose 1000-watt smiles, that he is a predator. And she could have celebrated her best lead lady with Joan Fontaine. It was Flynn's problem, which he was Ultimate Screen Hero until his own habits and bad timing arrested him. Grant and Flynn are similar in nature, but Flynn was more of these two men, Grant can be seen as Captain Blood, but Flynn's Philadelphia story. Blanding builds his dream house or Monkey Business or Operation Petticoat, having changed these roles on his collective ears, because he is too legs and the devil he would naturally bring would have made the story terrible. But this amazing biography is just a plasticized view of Flynn and his era. There are times when I was half-laughing or "Ahhh" at some point. It doesn't go deep into Flynn's life just in a magazine view. It does not dig in his struggle to be considered more than a robber. Like the purified biographies of Lon Chaney (father, not Wolfman or Lenny "Of Mice and Men") and Buster Keaton made in the 50s, this is just a time-kill piece.
