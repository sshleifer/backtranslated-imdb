Flatland is one of my favorite books, so I was expecting this movie. Unfortunately, the movie is totally terrible. The dialogue is so bad that it sounds like half the time. The new story forces me to think that they took a book and a couple of newspapers, threw them into a blender and used what had come out for the scenario. It is a disgrace to making a book and making an independent film. The only reason I even managed to get through the movie was my hopes that it would improve. Unfortunately, it only got worse at the slowdown. <br /> <br /> It doesn't mean that everything on the film is bad. CG is acceptable, the "Reboot" of the 1990s in a way that I assume they went. And I think you can't go wrong with the "people" who started to cut in half and bleed all over the place.
