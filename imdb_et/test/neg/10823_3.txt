I borrowed this movie from Blockbust due to cover and title! I heard intriguing !! This film suffered from writing, it needed more tension. "Monsters" needed more face time. We needed to have some special strength and definitely "Oh Sh--" moments. Photography did not bother me, except for the scene where breathing was blowing again. There were too many close-ups. But besides that the film seemed to be dragging and heroes did not work for their freedom. In general, I would say that everyone even put writers a lot of time. However, this movie is definitely below the average rent. <br /> <br /> Certainly there are better choices. I recommend Anacondas 1 or 2 over this option.
