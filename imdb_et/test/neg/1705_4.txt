Except for the appearance of talented Austin Powers, Richard Halpern, this picture was an attack on your mill film. The date's movie references do not help target audiences in the future who are confronted with this endeavor. Check out Groovy's Austin Force in the Jacuzzi. It's clean and half. <br /> <br /> Bad special effects exceed the appearance of numerous stars in dirty equipment, so at least it should keep one entertained (if you like it). <br /> <br /> For my money, I rented classic spoofs like "Airplane" or "Mars Man".
