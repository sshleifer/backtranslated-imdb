I was really ready to watch two of the best film critics mark this movie as a "laugh". But the film turned out to be disappointing. <br /> <br /> You are advised to watch this movie to keep your brain at home, but you cannot simply ignore mistakes and flaws. <br /> <br /> 1. The missile scene was total stupidity. <br /> <br /> 2. The pair of Katrina Kaif and Govinda looked awful. (She is 49 years old and she is only 24 ... more than twice as big as her age) <br /> <br /> 4. The songs are good, but they break the pace of the movie. <br /> <br /> 5. Some of the scenes were deliberately made by the filmmakers to be funny and 6. Poor and flawed. <br /> <br /> However, there are some advantages - 1. Govinda. Excellent individual performance. <br /> <br /> 2. Some scenes are really funny. <br /> <br /> 3. Kattrina Kaif. The appearance and behavior of each film will improve. <br /> <br /> 4. Rajpal Yadav's Don sequences. Although undervalued, but fun. <br /> <br /> So 4 good points, 6 bad ones. It will be 4/10.
