A good ol 'boyfriend is almost required to have a six-layer, car-search, story with a vague similarity to a "plot" and at least one very beautiful earth gal, barefoot short shorts and low. Pretty gal is here (designed with jeans) - but redneck assumptions stop there. Jimmy Dean is natural as a sausage spokesman, but when a tough guy is a former sheriff, he'll be brief. Big John is great, but he's not convincing with his moniker's "bad" part. Bug-eyed Jack Elam is a hoot as always and Bo Hopkins has been playing this part for decades; Ned Beatty also plays a role in a small role ... but there is no NATURE. It smells like In The Heat Of The Night rather than a feature film. Cornball cornpone with easily predictable sentiment. Perhaps the most prominent issue in this movie is the singing of this theme by Charlie Daniels. You know it; it became famous ... Jimmy Dean.
