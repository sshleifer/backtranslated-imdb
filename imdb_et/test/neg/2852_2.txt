This is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. The only reason I gave her 2 stars out of 10 is the beautiful Lydie Denier in some scenes. She is an amazing woman in every aspect, her naked scene with Armand Assante in the bathroom is as hot as hell. <br /> <br /> Anything about this movie is very interesting, Neonazi and the Turkish gang fight scenes from Berlin that contain people on the street in daylight and inside the club, where 30-40 people come with each other at a machine gun bigger than my house and amazingly after a few hours when I burned only three die ten is injured LOL. <br /> <br /> Although the gangs fight over the Berlin teretorias, the killer kills infants and then digs painted white in different places in the city. <br /> <br /> Armand Assante appears when a Turkish detective who is now working for the police was a former Turkish gang leader and now the film is obviously a very poor displacement of the classic M-movie. The killing of children, the involvement of the underworld, the character of the serum killer and the scene with a classic film that has a "trial" of the serum killer will be more affected. <br /> <br /> The actor is terrible, the script is just stupid, production of the lowest possible standard, and in general it was a waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> Don't even bother to rent it.
