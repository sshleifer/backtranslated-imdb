Has anyone noticed that this version is essentially a repetition of the 1933 version, with some scenes being taken out? It makes me think less about the film that does it, showing a definite will of creativity. In all justice, I tend to be inclined towards Katharine Hepburn, but this version of the film seems to be kinematic plagiarism. The 1933 version was nice and cute, though from time to time somewhat uncomfortable in presentation and transition, and then it took the script, music and even the right amount that blocked the previous version. I don't understand the idea of ​​making a movie again if the method of reprocessing was basically the same thing as editing the George Cukor movie, except the people working on it.
