this movie is said to be comedy.so where everyone laughs go.did forget to put them, version i watched.as a soccer movie, it's lightly entertaining, i think i'm just sticking to mud with no noticeable sense of humor. Maybe this movie isn't just funny. it is also annoying, so the top "you are the winner" musical result. and the strange thing is, the team sucked through most seasons, only the last two games won, and the last game did not mean anything because they weren't in the playoffs. do they mean mediocrity? I can't see it. if anyone knows, please let me know. This movie is not big or very good.
