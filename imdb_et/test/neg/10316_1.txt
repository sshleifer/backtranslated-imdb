I broke my rule by buying this movie from a $ 5.88 trash bin from Walmart. Basically, if a movie has a big star in it and you haven't heard of it before, it's usually for a reason. Well for this movie, the reason is that it is SUCKED! They tend to feed Sandra Bullock's photo and name on the entire DVD cover and pulled that small fishmark straight in. I thought the board would be donated to charity or I gave it to the library, but I don't think I'd like someone else to put the film down the world. Worst lines: "What do you mean by army mates?" "What do you mean by your father?"
