When ever a film that could be considered a missed opportunity, this film is a Galaxy. What could be the wrong sci-fi movie with sexual android? Surely such a film would never be a waste of time? Well, unfortunately, this movie is useless. There are a number of flaws in this production that have to be said, but there are two major problems that completely destroy the whole company. First of all, it is a comedy with no funny bits at all, or at least a movie where potentially fun aspects are presented in an incredibly unamusing way. Second, title characters are not used. This may be because Dorothy Stratten was not really an actor, but if it was, it was a terrible decision, because she's still the best thing for the film. I don't think he had to be very big to pull the sexual android role completely honest. Anyway, what we are leaving is the relief of a plethora of desperate comedy, often comprised of ages such as Alien, Star Wars, and the 2001 big sci-fi strikes without rumors. it is written and not funny, and it doesn't even have a lot to do with the plot. In principle, the story is that a police-space rider is sent to get a stone. That's it! Steven Spielberg once said that a high-conceptual film was one whose plot lines could be described in one sentence. What he did not define was what you call a film that can be described as less than a sentence - meaningless? It seemed to me a winner of a solid fire, but it failed. He seems to have been trying to shoot Star Wars and combine it with adult comedy situations. All that it does is leave you cold and upset that it was not close to what it should have been. That's not the case with Barbarella's 80s. <br /> <br /> Shortly after this movie ended, Dorothy Stratten was murdered in a terribly violent and terrible way. That is why Galaxina has brought a significant amount of its cultural interest. I just think it's a big shame that Dorothy didn't have a better movie to immortalize her.
