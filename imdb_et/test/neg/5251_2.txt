What. Uh ... <br /> <br /> This film is so dissociative and confusing that literally I lost my sense of thought after he was gone. I can never be the same person. I'm trying my finger on what's so crazy ... It's not just fun techno-music or medieval "Blade Runner / wild west / Highlander" or "out of time" or weird CGI "Grendel" monster that looks like like a man made of animated sausages, or even a "Grendel mother" monster that looks like some Alabama board sensors who grew up as candles and tentacles while staying in the tanning bed for too long. All these things are strange, but what is the strangest thing in this movie is the actor. I just can't explain. This script is probably hellishly silly, but the actors are misleading the deadly seriousness throughout. Lambert is always strange and usually boring, but for that he has gone to Dolph Lundgrin's territory: I can't laugh any time he speaks. <br /> <br /> I give credit to this film for being completely scattered and crazy, not conservative and boring. I always take the film out of a strange catastrophe completely mediocre. <br /> <br /> Warning: If you plan to look at Christopher Lambert as Beowulf, be prepared to spend several hours after you travel on some streets. sort of terrible, hyperactive-catatonic intimidation. It is true. When I made my Beowwell spiritual journey, I woke up in the middle of the Siberian tundra in blood and milk. Next to me was a dead wolf and later I found that I had a pair of human teeth in my shirt pocket. My VHS copy of Beowulf sat on a fast-built stone altar surrounded by candles and succulent flowers. The tape told me to walk. I got up and I walked.
