I've seen this movie 3 times. Mostly because I was thinking about watching it, "Am I missing something here?". Is there any reason for this movie? Did it try to say something and I just missed it? Well after 3 views I couldn't find the answer. <br /> <br /> I think the worst thing I can say about each movie is that it missed me and I didn't finish it. I testify that there are lots of eye candy and fast editing and hip music to keep my attention all the way to the end, but should all the film be? <br /> <br /> I am not against extreme violence, it is almost endless, but it seems that there should be some inspiration. Something that's been highlighted. The word is free, but it is worse than that. The first part of the film gives us an overview of the motivation of the characters. And yes, these three principles are very good in their roles. But the roles are absolutely staggering. So in the first part we get to know the character and in the second half most em dying and using sadistic fear to kill others. It seems to be the whole movie. And the first half has nothing to do with another. For example, <br /> <br /> How could a nice intelligent man like Zed agree to join spammers and amateurs to do such work? It's not logical. She is so smart, but she continues this suicide mission. The fact that he lives is completely in conflict with the rest of the hyper-real violence and chaos. What are we going to look at Hollywood romance with a happy ending or a super real, extremely violent blood bath? I remember that I have the same reaction to two other films with which this director participated: True Romance and Reservior Dogs. <br /> <br /> A dreck is needed!
