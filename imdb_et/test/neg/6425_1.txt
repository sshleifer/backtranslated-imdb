Bad plot, bad performance, bad direction. <br /> <br /> It was possible, but it just didn't get anything. <br /> <br /> This movie looks like someone started with the idea, googled a bit of info and then tried for one and a half and one and a half flesh to bring a lot of night-time and bad music. <br /> <br /> Others had to look at them because they were afraid of 2/3 of the way - I had to take a break just because I didn't care anymore. <br /> <br /> I was reminded of the episode of our life days, with a little more tension. <br /> <br /> Just bad.
