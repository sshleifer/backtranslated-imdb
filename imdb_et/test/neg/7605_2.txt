This sequel is honest. I'm a fan of kung-fu movies and it's by far the worst. The bride with white hair 1 was actually pretty good and it is a big disappointment. BWWH 1 was in some ways brilliant, with unique odd evil evil. Instead, the film revolves around interesting characters trying to get its fallen clan. But there is no antagonist in this movie, so revenge is silenced. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie is kung-fu or the lack of it. They literally had a street style fight. The character at the end refused to fight because there was no choreography.
