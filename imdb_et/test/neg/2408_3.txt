When I tried to awake awake during this boron festival, I fought during my short trip to discover some foolish plot of schmucks with a brotherhood, quite incredibly irritating annoying, getting into trouble with a psychotic, radioactively damaged half-person / half cyborg called Splatter who sends his soldiers for these, for their prestigious, politically vocal leader (.. for whom Splatter killed himself, putting them to blame for becoming a leader). These facial-colored freaks form a group that expresses their feelings anarchically, though not violently, by living in the broken streets that the "civilized world" gave up, expressing its concern about nuclear disarmament. Anyway, in most of the films, these are five frat goons running through the dark streets with graffiti walls like Splatter and his trousers pursuing them. Fortunately for these men, they find punk chic to help them with their journey out of this pretty ugly landscape with which they are unknown. The territory where the frat guys are immersed is a real maze of streets and alleys, the idea of ​​which is the hardest way out, especially when the madness and the Splatter cluster occupy almost every time. <br /> <br /> Yes, I was like others thanks to the HR Giger poster, which is the most excellent. If only he was the creator of that creator, then this is not the case, and we, the viewer, are left with the film that is modeled after all the films, except Walter Hill's WARRIORS, except this film is the style or film that this film has. The film has a lot of inaccurate bits and flat confrontations between frates and tongues to often fight ridiculous. The provision is quite interesting and there are some atmospheric uses in neon light, but it is not an environment that is a problem. My eye saddles weighed harder every minute. Yes, the Texas CHAINSAW stars Edwin Neal (.. quite a funny voice guy who had an entertaining interview with the DVD that I rented for the burning turf of this movie) and Marilyn Burns have a "key" role as opposing members of their group in the final result in the building complex. Neal's Splatter uses those metal spikes that emerge from his metal to kill his victims.
