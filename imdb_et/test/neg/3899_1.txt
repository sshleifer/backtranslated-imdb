I know that Jesse Franco is responsible for many different films and I am going to mainly focus on my horror films, both terrible and at times. I think it was a curious curiosity that drew me to it and I wasn't even curious enough to finish it. Maybe it finally got better, but if you are not in lesbian sex scenes (there is a lot of it), you might want to go. What exactly do you say about a movie that contains a woman who reflects a bowl in a kitchen combination (ascending)? Just never think about what you will use later, you probably don't want to know. If this seems interesting to you, then this is your problem, but maybe just like this movie. I myself, I'm not a bride, I've seen many days of filthy movies, but at least they were well done and that's not the case. Sometimes too much is too much. Bleah.
