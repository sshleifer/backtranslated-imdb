Another Lo Wei production that completely wastes the talents of young Jackie Chan to kill Intrigue is a strange mixture of wuxia, melodrama, supernatural action and the usual old school kung fu fight, which is quite boring despite several surreal WTF moments and a lot of ridiculously bad dialogue. <br /> <br /> As he tries to protect his pregnant girlfriend Chin Chin from the killer bees, she sees a ruthless killer attacking her home, Cao Lei (Jackie Chan). be a heartless framer who drives him away and thus saves him from danger. <br /> <br /> During the attack, Cao's relatives all die, but he is a relatively intact gang whose leader, a woman in a state of grace, seems to be destined for him. Then Cao is looking for Chin Chin, whose security has trusted his close friend Chu Chuk. <br /> <br /> When you find your true love, Cao communicates with the head of the courier company, whose precious material is the leader of the exhausted "evil" prison. Finally, after injuring the nasty clan members (a fun scene with lots of stupid weapons), and then taking care of the hurtful Killer Bee (who shows his love by burning his face!), Ultimately, Cao learns that he is a terrible judge : His friend Chu Chuk is nothing more than the hungry head jump of the "Bloody Rain" clan who is planning to marry Chin himself. <br /> <br /> Cue pulled the climatic battle, where Cao began to see him repeatedly before he finally stifled his cunning ex-death. <br /> <br /> Even the dead Chan fans will find this one chore to sit through, only the last fight can show some of the stars' amazing acrobatic abilities. Fans of general Asian wonder can complain about the horrible appearance of the hero in the beginning of the movie (one letter inexplicably demanding their own separated hand!) Or from the moment three men swim through the window to attack our hero, but in most cases this film is very limited.
