I had not read any books or seen the first film, so I had no expectations after receiving the previews. <br /> <br /> “Angels and Demons” was a confusing, complicated film that lacked direction or any credibility. The character formation was very small and I never took care of the situation of the main characters; the opposite was true, I was more interested in seeing how the antagonists would succeed because in the first half of the film almost exclusively focused on why the illuminati are the ones they are. <br /> <br /> The film jumps from location to location with little explanation or reason, and hopes that the viewer believes that all the participants in the movie will be the first ally at the meeting. Every analytical mind understands that it is very unlikely. <br /> <br /> The climax is an extremely cliché and leaves you with questions about what happened and wondering why no one thought about any of these points. Participants are not particularly credible in their roles, mainly because I found it hard to believe that the Church's scientists, professors and men would act in the way they do without taking into account the consequences of their actions. The events that happen are not the least believable and the pace of the film is questionable when the characters jump in a short time and I had to ask how the main characters succeed in time, every time, from place to place. /> <br /> The most enjoyable part of the movie is cinematography, I found it to be a beautiful movie to watch, but it was a mess that I found it not worth it in theaters.
