... If you have been laughing for too long and have to pause. <br /> <br /> After reading about 25 unfavorable reviews, I decided to turn it on and check it myself. Everything that every person has said about this exhibition is absolutely true. Mencia's mind is like Mad TV's half-hour version, but somehow with worse jokes. <br /> <br /> One skit that I enjoyed watching was "The Second Annual Stereotype Olympics". What's funny about a black man having a problem with swimming, or a gay boy called "Sparkles" that wins a banana eating competition? Neither of these concepts is particularly novel, incomprehensible or fun. Do we really need fun from Star Wars for every episode? This movie came out 30 years ago. The Mencia solution for funny things is throwing some stereotypes out of the Spaniards and throwing some "beaners" there; and call it a day to go home to ride around your money packet. Exquisite comedy genius. Then he spoke to Jeff Foxworthy on another show, which I watched, "his gay as ...". You could just imagine how a fluttering laughter he got Ryan-Seacrest-on-gay joke. It's not like none of them is dead. <br /> <br /> If you're not a big fan of Jason Friedberg's and Adam Seltzer's movies, please stay away from this show. Especially when there are authentic comedians like Dave Chappelle, who can joke about race and racism and are still attentive.
