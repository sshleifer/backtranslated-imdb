Wow, it's pretty amazing that something like that could actually be done. I'll give this movie 2 because it's so bad that it has a certain "car wreck" type of complaint. It is so bad that it is comic and has some value for entertainment. Plus is a bit of free free nudity and it is always welcome. <br /> <br /> So where do I start. Action is terrifying, it is like watching a high school game that is being filmed. Theresa Russell must have done something really bad that she would be forced to make this film and her actor reflects how happy she must be in this mess. Casting Dan Cortes as an FBI agent on a cherry on that chick. His behavior made me laugh out loud.
