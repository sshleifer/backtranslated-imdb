The best thing I can say about "Quintet" is that it is not quite as bad as I remember it at my first viewing. <br /> <br /> But that doesn't mean it's good. <br /> <br /> This strange, sci-fi thriller is not quite like any other movie I've ever seen, which at least feels like giving him new news. But this is the borderline disaster of the film and one of the worst Robert Altman ever made. On the DVD, it is clear from the specificity of "Quintet" that even Altman did not know what hell this film should be. <br /> <br /> It's set to the far future when the world is gripping with another ice age. The movie was shot at the abandoned site of the Montreal Expo67, and I have to admit that it gives the film some interesting product development elements, even how much it seems to have been filmed in an ice-cream center. Paul Newman, looking at the zoned and absolutely uninterested in what is happening around him, and Brigitte Fossey, are playing drifters who are traveling in this futuristic city, looking for a Newman brother. Soon, Newman will catch a "Quintet" deadly game that all eternal residents will play to do something better and the rules will never be clear to the public. We all know that the goal of the game is to kill everyone else you play with, and you will be the only living person. It gives these nihilistic inhabitants a unique excitement because, as one of them says, at one point of the psychobabban soliloquy, only death can be alive. <br /> <br /> The film is slow, ugly and really inconvenient to watch because it is a relentless darkness. It's almost like Altman deliberately making a movie that nobody would like to sit down. There are no signs - oh sure, the actors are walking on the lines they are talking about, but none of these lines really mean a lot and impressive list of international actors Altman, who is not for this register. Only Bibi Andersson gives the most memorable action to the things that could be found in such a movie. However, it does succeed in creating an atmosphere, even if this atmosphere is pure fright, and it is strange exciting that looking at the man slowly starving himself to death would be interesting. <br /> <br /> Altman has been struggling for almost ten years of great movies. "Quintet" was followed by a brilliant "Wedding", followed in short order by not bad ones, but mostly forgotten by "Perfect Couples". seen because it is nowhere to be seen) and catastrophic "Popeye". Thank God for his rebound. <br /> <br /> Rating: D-
