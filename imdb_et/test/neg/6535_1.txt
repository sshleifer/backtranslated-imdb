IMDb lists this movie as a comedy. I have no idea what genre this movie belongs to, but it is definitely not a comedy. a tragedy maybe. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it's a good movie or not. I know it's not comedy. I wanted to laugh today and what I got was a bit of a strange idea that somebody binds some ugly chairs. <br /> <br /> This movie is not what is advertised. It is a film educational institution that I can only assume that it is meant to "think people". I don't recommend this movie to anyone I know, or even what I don't know. It's a ridiculous generation that doesn't make any sense. <br /> <br /> It made me think. It made me think, "I wish I had those ninety minutes back in my life." <br /> <br /> I'm sure the world is full of armchair critics who have a liberal curve in their worldview. this movie is worth something for them. <br /> <br /> I'm not one of them.
