The perfect 6-step recipe for the boring center of the journey movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Get one burnt, rogue ex-policeman with a bad attitude, but also a sensitive touch (a cabinet concert with a pianist pet cat); <br /> <br /> 2. Add some cool cool widgets, such as the potty Porsche 356, the roaring bike, the heavily positioned leather jacket and a couple of pockets with holes in the soles. <br /> <br /> 3. Mix a couple of "free-education" locations, e.g. trendy seaside apartments and a special cab for the office; <br /> <br /> 4. Spice it up with "deep" socio-romantic topics like divorce-traumatized-but-end-remarry-ex-spouse, secretly admiring, and thus-forgiving-waitress, former pair-of-police only-one-of-a-really-complete-jerk and best-friend-get-ice-over-a-suitcase-full-of-illegal - $$$; > <br /> 5. Let it boil for about 90 minutes at a "fast pace", though not necessarily logically or internally consistently with mediocre steps, cheap bidding moments, and slow smart cracks. <br /> <br /> 6. Serve either with a comfortable pillow to sleep right through it or something interesting (don't worry: even the yellow pages do!).
