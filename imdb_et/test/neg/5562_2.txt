Yes, absolutely terrible, and it comes from someone who loves bad movies - but there's a limit. I enjoy all kinds of horror / temporary movies and I've seen some great works by European filmmakers. Unfortunately, Brocelian is not a wonderful cinematic art among them. Camera work is worse than amateur. Not fashionable, the shaky MTV "cameraman needs a Ritalini" camera that works with so many filmmakers to hide their talent shortage. It's just a bad frame composition and a terrible picture composition. Operation is pharmaceutical if it is not completely two-dimensional. Dialogues are stylish and unnatural - all the more so than your usual mill-horizontal film that gets into the pseudo-mystery. I think what made me the most was a terribly choreographed fighting scene at the end of the movie. They were bad for being ridiculous. I've seen what a small budget can do, and it can do a miracle. It was just a bad film. Very very sad.
