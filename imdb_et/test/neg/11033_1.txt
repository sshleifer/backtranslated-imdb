Avoid this movie if you are looking for entertainment. <br /> <br /> It is full of wannabets who are trying to be something they are not, and Emran is just wasted as a travel guide, who rests with a newcomer who needs to act in a showroom. Seriously, where do they get these people? Just because you're pretty, it doesn't mean you can act or be an actor. <br /> <br /> Asmit Patel must send an apology to everyone who accidentally watches him, making him a fool for the film with this poor pretext. He plays a strange wannabe gangster who heals girls and forces them to fall in love with him and sells them to the highest bidder.
