It was one of the most seen films. All the things in the film seemed to be related to justify some other element that was glued. There are even talking buffs who want their wet nose to rub to make the magic happen. Even the brutal father seems to be stuck to give the children an excuse to fly on the wagon. It was ridiculous but uncomfortable because of the serious issues that seemed to be usable for creating the plot.
