The College Professor is working on creating zombies, and you don't know, things are going awfully wrong. The next thing you know is the entire campus is over. Thanks for the goodness there are a few uber-commandos who have been trained for this particular situation. Too bad that they have to be accompanied by rappers who have been run by a rapper (he does not even have to struggle to play the military, he just reacts to his superiors as if he was a rappel's homies in the hood). The high point of this part of the movie is the dressing room scene. Men's and women's moron squads share the same dressing room, and apparently military rules require all women to wear black bras and panties. Hey, if you can't make a good movie, at least it is possible for women to have their underwear. My hat is in front of the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> So, after many discussions about how well these moral commanders were prepared for work (Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq), they all get in quite a short order. Their biggest decline seems to be that they should never turn on any fire. A typical meeting is walking in the room for them and seeing someone far away. Man or zombie? Can't say. Turn the lights on? No, the Moron Commando protocol requires them to go with a person to make sure they keep their arms so that they can be easily knocked out and well, you know the exercise. The death of Sergeant Major Sticky Fingaz is especially fun - my favorite scene, which includes a rapper in any movie I've ever seen. Luckily (and again, hats for filmmakers), the hottest baby in communal commands will survive. He and the woman uber-commando finished the rest of the film for tight T-shirts. Now you have to do a military operation! There's a bunch of running rounds, dragged by my humorous things like uber-commandos, who just can't pass through the fan rack (obviously, this is a thin aluminum piece that you could easily carry with your fist). It requires a plan to rub the zombie's courage all over himself, and although we haven't seen anything in the film that shows that the zombies are smelling their catch, they're good enough to start zombie courage and let our heroes go on <br /> > Some other funny bits - Paris Hilton gag, "Can you hear me now?" gag and the fact that although zombies bite secondary signs immediately, the main characters are able to fight their way through dozens of them without being slept. Another woman is given by Mr Fingaz, who doesn't seem to pronounce the word 'tourniquet' (toe-no-kit?). <br /> <br /> In general, it's a little fun. Could some interesting signs have been used, but I was slightly impressed with the Sci-Fi Channel original.
