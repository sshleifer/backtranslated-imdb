First of all, let me say that those who voted "10" will only joke themselves and try to get a respectable level ... something that this film does not deserve. (The only movie that deserves 10 IMO is classic ... Godfather, Shawshank, etc. See the best movies of all time for the complete list.) cave inside. Although I should agree with them about the surrounding environment, they are not just an evaluation of the film as a whole ... they are surrounded by the surrounding environment, but no general overview is used. It would be like I would vote for 10 "Justin Kelly" movies because I think the beach events remind me of what is in the Florida keys ... although this may be true, it doesn't deserve a movie 10 because the film as a whole was dirty. <br /> <br /> I want to tell you that something was saved by this movie, as usual, when one thing stinks from the glow of horror, something else picks up or compensates for weakness. (Eg - bad actors overshadow a big plot and / or great camera work and landscape.) We started the DVD and it all started quite normal. We started joking, who would be the first to die ... after a short ride and hiking, they camped overnight. At this point I put in some things that really made my other movie tune. I had two main problems: bad effects and even worse story. The first thing we all noticed was that the bonfires were not real ... you can clearly see the "cgi" or the fake flame they all sat down. In order for the horror film to have such a blatant effect, the mistake would have been to tell me what I was in the next hour. <br /> <br /> In just a few minutes, it was shown how the film was badly written. I do not remember exactly how they reached the point, but in principle we find that the "symbol Nerd" writes a book on the study of caves, and so on. Another group member wants to talk about the experience, but hesitates, saying, "I don't want this story in my book." The author persuades and breaks the other that he does not put the story in his book and that he can trust him. (Direct quotation: "If I tell you this story, you will definitely want to see it in your book.") I was expecting a full 5-minute story here with complete setbacks and cordial behavior. What I got was a short, badly spoken (and acted) statement. I say a statement because what he was talking about was about 10 seconds and 5 sentences. I don't remember the exact price offer, but basically he says, "We were in a cave, flooded in a cave, a girl died when our friend looked at her drowning." You may think that I'm over-exaggerated and really critical, but it is far from being a direct quote, a series of movie scenes. <br /> <br /> Over the next 50 minutes, the film will be in caves and while lighting is what I imagine as a cave, I could have really done without a movie with a truly fuzzy / blurry look and camera shake is just one that I can done to go. (I really have a good vision, and after watching the main parts of the film, I felt I was legally blind.) I was emotionally separated from this movie, so it was probably not scary. Perhaps I would have been able to look at the film very slowly and badly from the beginning, at least I would be scared, but I do not remember anyone in a dark room, even in any "action" scene. The last scene was probably one I never forget, and that's not good. Basically, two women are trapped in the room. "Monster" comes to attack / kill women ... she's stopped when she sees a little boy's picture. Return comes when we find that the "monster" got a little boy injured and spent his whole life in the cave. Cut back to the present time and he will take his "mask" (a big skeleton that seems to be a deer). He looks at the picture and the two women seem to have found the cave man's weakness / soft spot. At this point, he stabs and kills one girl, then continues rape of another woman more graphically. After about 30 seconds, looking at the camera and shaking when he rapes, roll the credit over the film. <br /> <br /> Frankly, if I had to do it everywhere and I was wasting money on renting this movie, I would have been able to record for one hour and watch the first scene and the last scene of this movie, and still leave the same thoughts as I currently have is. <br /> <br /> Those who compared you to Blair Witch are on the way ... if any of you had read how the director and writer Blair was filming, he would understand how revolutionary it was ... delivering a cast to every cast member day / night without the other members knowing what the other actor was doing with the genius. <br /> <br /> If IMDb allowed me, this would be a negative score ... I don't understand how someone in your right mind can recommend this movie.
