ALL GROWN UP is basically the original Nickalodeon RUGRATS comic, performed by toddlers Tommy Pickles, Chucky Finster, Lil and Phil DeVille, Angelica, Susie and (later) Kimi (Chuckies sister) and Dill (Brother Tommy). ). I grew up with RUGRATS and thought it was a great comic. It was great humor, nice stories and creators of the exhibition, Klasky & Csupo, were probably very original and creative about infant adventures. The new show ALL GROWN UP tries to restore the magic of the original comic books. I was disappointed when I saw it. I found "adult" Chuckie just annoying and all "pre-teen-mature-mature / trying-to-be-popular" that applied (unfortunately) * all * characters boring and washed. Scenes and jokes are still funny in the new series, and it was interesting how artists change the whole RUGRATS baby's power from their original show for ten years from their age. In general, this exhibition is "fair" and only traceable if: a) you are a RUGRATS hard fan, b) have never seen the original show, c) you are a pre-teen who has nothing to do, or d) you are so bored that you someone is forced to see this exhibition. This exhibition is not so good. It is not comparable to older RUGRATS episodes of high quality, humor and everything else.
