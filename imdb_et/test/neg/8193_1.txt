^ ^ contains a spoiler ^ ^ <br /> <br /> This movie is perfect. Don't look. <br /> <br /> There is no one in this movie that you like or even like, except the woman, and she defeats by default. Everyone is selfish and many things happen that make no sense. <br /> <br /> Action is at best mediocre and everyone breathes too much. Nobody can believe incredibly. <br /> <br /> If you leave the room even for a second, something will go out from the left and it will make NO SENSE WHATSOEVER. <br /> <br /> For example, I left the room for a second while Jennie Garth's character stood with her leader. I'll be back, seriously about 4 minutes later (and I'm pretty sure there was a commercial one) and he sleeps with that Berko guy. <br /> <br /> I gave up this movie about the time Berko was in his car, because he didn't want to call the wedding. <br /> <br /> I wasted 2 hours of my life. You shouldn't do that.
