The only reason I didn't delete this movie after 20 minutes is that we wasted it for 20 minutes ... <br /> <br /> The only one I repeat is the effect they used to have a strange kapoer (from India ?) Jump half a meter to the wall / trash, I think the effects will not make the movie, but ... sheesh .... I and my friend hoped for the full effect of the movie (big wolf?! Something!?>!?!) But noooooooooooooooo ... all we have is jump! 0.5 meters on the wall + they used a pharmacy ..... and they found weapons?! pharmacy! I mean, what the hell? oh i forgot, there was another effect - contact wires as green eyes! every 10 minutes we shouted: "the only thing that can save a movie from shame is a giant wolf who kills them all! Besides being scary so you don't know who you would first die for. I mean PRAY!) that "good?!" man dies, hopefully in the beginning. <br /> <br /> make yourself a favor and send letters to delete the movie from all the world's archives.
