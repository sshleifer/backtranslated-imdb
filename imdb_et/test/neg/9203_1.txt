1) Bad action. 2) For a number of attacks on a foreign planet, it seemed to be at home, especially in the background of the house and the roads that can be mocked in the background. <br /> <br /> 3) A terrible plot with foolish characters who make idiotic decisions and lose valuable survival equipment and clothes left, right and center. <br /> <br /> 4) Cool the 70's sci-fi jumps (maybe the only good thing about this movie) <br /> <br /> 5) An interesting ship in the beginning (this team must have looked at Space 1999 a lot). Too bad it blows so early. Also, the escape ship broke up too quickly. * sigh * <br /> <br /> 6) Anthropologists can find some aspects of the film in terms of primate group behavior.
