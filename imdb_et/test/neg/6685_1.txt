What a nasty cynical movie. Apparently, this sad excuse for the dramatic urban design that 20-year-olds do when they explore the nightlife of Sydney is somehow connected to their target market. Some people and some pals created by some industries who saw that they could hit young people with their hand and poured it into multiplexes, SAMPLE PEOPLE failed at the Australian ticket office. It is so attacking on the image of clear and simple targets clich√©s when that audience was completely rejected. Dirty and cruel and without trying to offer a high quality or resonance to a young audience who could be attracted to marketing or casting SAMPLE PEOPLE could have been interesting or even informative, if not violated by its exploitative view of "what teenagers want to see in Film". Particularly offensive character is played by Ben Mendelsohn and Kylie Minogue is once again wasting poor materials and uninvited filmmakers. That's exactly what the manufacturers would have thought, that teenagers would look foolish in the trash and just sliding composition and signs that were lower and less soulful. Well, they were very wrong. The 1983 mini-budget film, called GOING DOWN, got this issue right and is a great antidote to its poison.
