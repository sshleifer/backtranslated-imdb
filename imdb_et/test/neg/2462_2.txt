"JB" (Jack Black) runs away from home after his father (Meat Loaf) has received it. Years later, he finally ends up in Hollywood and reaches the biggest guitar player he has ever heard, "KG" (Kyle Glass). Open Mic Night, which seems to be a less popular bar. They don't do that good for their shock. <br /> <br /> Back at their less than remarkable apartment, they are trying to find out what rock legends are, so they don't see some old magazines. Only then will they realize that the canon guitarists have the same guitar choice. <br /> <br /> In an effort to find a similar choice, the music shop worker (Ben Stiller, who is also an Executive Producer), tells him the ancient story of the "Fate" they are looking for. This employee, who has long gray hair and thick glasses, also tells them that a satanic tooth stick is in the history of a stone museum. great delusions go to a music-filled adventure to steal picking. you must skip it. I'm not the fan of these two and I just watched it because it was suggested by Flixter.com. <br /> <br /> Jokes mostly produce more than silence. I laughed at maybe three jokes and laughed at another. Tenacious D is just for a certain audience that I don't do. <br /> <br /> This movie is lagging behind in many places, and this is where the worst jokes appear. And let me tell you that if black and glass don't work out, they're completely lost on the screen. <br /> <br /> All the songs in this movie are and play Tenacious D. Many Songs Perfectly progressing the story by describing their adventures during the film. But I felt the songs sound too similar to talk to each other. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this movie is that the language turns off many people. There are many four-point words in this movie. There are also some drug references. I wouldn't recommend it to children. <br /> <br /> Part of the Tenacious D schtick is that Black is on your face and Glass is mostly in your shadows. That's how they are in this movie, and it doesn't really work. Now it might have been part of it, but I felt the glass just didn't want to be there. In one scene, she fills her (background) lyrics party and she just can't work alone. , I lost the count because I was so bored with this movie. Personally, I would have liked to see more rock legends and icons in the film. But we don't get it. <br /> <br /> What we get is a movie full of completely flat jokes, a lot of unpleasant language, a weak script. You also get terrible action and an unholy story. But you get pretty good songs that are pretty much the same. <br /> <br /> The story could have been promising, but many scenes seemed to have been added in the last second of the movie. It is somewhat similar to Blues Brothers' film years ago, but Blues Brothers had much bigger and two songs on Billboard's music cards. Tenacious D has only a small number of HBO offers. And unlike Blues Brothers, comedy is not well thought out. <br /> <br /> If you are a strong fan of Tenacious D, I suggest you check it out. But like most movie listeners, when this movie appeared in theaters, I would say to avoid it. Save your money on it, people.
