This is a painfully slow story from the last days of 1999, when a strange disease erupts and ... I stopped care. This is expected to be about two people living in an apartment complex above or below. There's a leak and the plumber puts the man in the floor so you can see the apartment below. Also, because there is a lot of dialogue going on in the crisis, the news is actually ... <br /> <br /> Sounds promising? <br /> <br /> Not really. <br /> <br /> I started to mix and start doing other things that are dead in the subtitled movie. Basically, I didn't start looking at what made the events even more surreal. <br /> <br /> It might work for you, it wasn't for me.
