I wouldn't want anyone to look at this "true story" as an inspiration for the movie and draw conclusions about the real event. The few things they got to the right were overshadowed by things that were simply not true. Ed Gein did not drag anyone behind the car, never met anyone at the graveyard, nor killed them, no evidence that he returned parts of the body to the graveyard. The things he did were awful, why try to make it worse? <br /> <br /> This movie is a waste of my worst eye strain. "In the light of the moon" is a much better film on this subject, it is more factual and functioning is better than that.
