Owen (David Krumholtz) and Chloe (Denise Richards) are a young couple living in Manhattan. Owen is a moderately successful journalist, while Chloe is an ambitious actor. Luckily, Chloe gets a big role in sitcom and temporarily takes Hollywood. In his absence, Owen writes a surprise to LaLa Land. When he arrives in his trailer, the "house" shakes like Chloe and his hunky star is a little romantic. The writer and the actor are over. Damn and angry like angry, Owen goes back to NYC. The lively friends decide to put Nadine (Milla Yovovich) in the dark for her sulky out of the funk. But it goes bad when the duo mixes like oil and water, mainly because they have a strong personality and Owen's huge shoulder chip. But in the next few months it has been amazing to say that Nadine and Owen will have sons who trust each other and hang. Can it change anything more? Well, who the hell cares about! This movie is so STUPID that most people will put it out of the DVD player in the first ten minutes. The script is also pathetic, frustrating and also, stupid. Moreover, Krumholtz also gives a very unpleasant and offensive result. Yovovich is not much better, but who could look good? William Baldwin also reaches the bottom of his career as his role is Owen's brother. The only cast member who is any good is Richards, but he must force him to look back. Okay, suits and production values ​​are enough. Then there is one wise element that sometimes the characters speak their lines, but the comic bubbles appear on their heads with the words they actually think. This will not save the movie from the "bomb" state. Don't be a fool, an expensive movie and romcom lovers. Don't rent, buy, or borrow this giant turkey. I am the stupid person today looking at the bitter end.
