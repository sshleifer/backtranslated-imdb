I agree with one commentator who says it is really impossible to see Glen or Glenda? objectively. If this is the case, the film has to be judged in terms of its advantages quite awfully, given the fun, complex dialogue, generally mediocre poor, who operate both cast and zero value. Such an evaluation does not reflect the absolutely rabid experience of watching this movie when it appears. It is not the fact that the theme of the film is transvestitism and that it was a controversial lifestyle choice in the 1950s. It is not even an allegation of tolerance for people who have alternative lifestyles that are fascinating, except as a historical remnant. <br /> <br /> No, what makes Glen or Glenda? still a fascinating film after 50 years is that Ed Wood put his psyche empty so that the so-called author's leaders, such as Hitchcock or Godard, never did it, despite their supreme talent. In Glen or Glendas, Wood is not afraid to express his deeply contradictory feelings about being transvestite, despite the fact that tolerance through the film is. Indeed, to summarize the film, it can be said that Ed Wood's Glen character can "kill" his Glenda female colleague by wearing the feelings of love and affection with Glen, his female colleague, for his future wife Barbara. The psychiatrist even assures Glen and Barbara that Glen is doing this psychic transmission, Glenda disappears. So, while Wood can generally seek tolerance for transvestites, he was not so sure he wanted it. on the screen. He did it with any stock footage he got. If not, what? What the spectator saw in Glen or Glendas was, in particular, the imaginary world of Ed Wood in all its strange faces. the objective evaluation criteria referred to in the first subparagraph. The strange memorial effect that the film has, despite the technically frightening qualities I don't think, has been appreciated.
