The label for this exhibition is: "He speaks his mind. We hire additional lawyers." If you look back in time, any classic messy comedian may never be controversial. Richard Pryor's comment was not, "I'm raw, racist and bold." This is basically how Comedy Central markets this exhibition - its face, non-computer, and "honest" - but how can television be proud of this way? Where is humility and humility? And maybe Carlos Mencia is the center of comedy of this huge figure? Let's start from the beginning - Dave Chappelle cancels her exhibition (which became UNEXPECTEDLY popular and controversial) and Comedy Central is looking around for someone new to push. They hire a guy named Ned who claims to be Mexico, though he is not. They sprinkle their faces on some TV commercials and see that they are "bold" when they discourage the public. <br /> <br /> I've seen many hateful topics in the forum, and I don't agree with the "Mencia" detectors. This is not a terrible show. I had a laugh a few times. If it's funny, it's very, very funny. Yeah, it's a minor - but it was Chappelle. <br /> <br /> Carlos has the problem of using the same material. And he's too clear. In open marketing, "Carlos" has now said so many times that I have lost the census. He's trying to make it the next famous thing (like "I'm Rick James, b ****!"), But it's too clear. <br /> <br /> Carlos repeats himself repeatedly. same jokes over and over again. For example, he said in one episode that he would love it when all the Mexicans disappeared from America overnight. He woke up and the American man said, "Room ser'vuce!" South accent. <br /> <br /> He used that same joke - literally, when he appeared as a guest at Adam Carolla's storyline. The second time was much less funny because he seemed desperate. <br /> <br /> Is "Carlos" funny? I think so. His show has some awful moments. But he concentrates too much on TRYING to be more controversial than just flowing and letting. Repeatedly repeated foolish little sentences over and over again with the silly faces and loud vocal shocks getting older quickly ... I hope Carlos - or his writers - can give a new edge to this exhibition, because right now it will begin to diminish in hell.
