This flick is so bad that it is beyond belief. For an independent low budget movie ... it just, well, sucks. I can't even believe that even Troma would make such a mess. years (Toxic Avenger, Squeeze Play, Rockabilly Vampire to name a few). But LLoy, come on, it goes beyond the limits of any taste. It contains some of the worst imaginable imaginations. I think it would have been possible to find unemployed street people who might have been so good ... oh, wait, that's what they did. I mean, these characters have negative charisma. For any luck, the producer and director of this film has a great karmic debt because of its extraordinary impact. But beyond the terrible action and terrible special effects, the dialogue is completely traumatic to the ears. The script is full of Alaska-sized plot holes and has serious consistency issues. The worst thing is that it is not fun even in the smallest way. And that's the most unforgivable sin in making a movie. But don't take my word for it. Go out and waste four bucks for rent. Just don't say I didn't warn you.
