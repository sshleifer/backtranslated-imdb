First, I saw another reviewer saying that this movie was "fantastic". Well something could be farther from the truth! This movie is a complete garbage !!! Moral horror comedy that is not even a little funny !! Do not take it so bad that it is good because it is not. It is a waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> Here's what I see in this DVD waste. A group of friends get together at the weekend, breaks and then decides to make a home video. They capture the mother and father video camera and start scenes on the spot. They all have a big challenge to look at the camera. They think that if they think it's funny, everyone thinks it's funny. Well, they're wrong. This homemade home video is a waste. "Functional" and comedic gore effects are bad, but I think it's expected because it's nothing more than home video. <br /> <br /> On the bright side, I think this mess got there hoping for anyone who wants to make a movie. If these people could make and release their movie on DVD, then everyone can! <br /> <br /> 0 / 10-- Save your money.
