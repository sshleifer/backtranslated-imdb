I was watching this movie and I was quite disappointed. I did not expect much to start, because the premise of the film does not refer to such greatness. Unfortunately, it doesn't even offer the same stupid entertainment. The main problem is probably action. Although I have seen much worse actors in much worse films, the story of some people would require violent maniacs, some others when people have really emphasized, and they can't. While I looked at the German edition I looked at with the original sound, it is certainly not just a bad voice transmission or something else. In addition, the German DVD release seems to have been cut off, the killings are pretty much omitted, which means that apart from some semi-scenes that are coming to an end, the German press release does not release the gore- hounds. There are some foolish moments in the plot that are here and thrown there and the start is just fun (never heard of a demon visiting a psychiatrist)? Too bad that the film is too serious when it was filmed as horror comedy and changed a bit here and there there is a lot of disappointment. <br /> <br /> If you have nothing better to do and just can't tolerate boredom (and it is really weak "may"), find this movie If you look or do something else: choose this alternative.
