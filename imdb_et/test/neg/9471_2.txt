This film was definitely a boring side. The action was decent and the film looks pretty nice, the soundtrack is definitely for fans of Kenny G and Michael Bolton. Speaking of the musical instrument, I found very ironically that it was decided to use a song that was Paul Simon Simon "You could call me the Source" in the headlines of the film that tells the truth and not theft, except that they don't admit it at all. Isn't there a little hypocrisy there? My favorite was the scene where the main child was where his game host was. 10 lines? Do I have to add ten lines to this movie? With ripoff, I don't think it's too fair to write to FORCE if they just add it!
