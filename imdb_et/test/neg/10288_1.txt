After a very scary opening that gives you that creepy "Chainsaw massacre" - it all breaks down. real killers. Anyone who has seen these "petta-ya" movies enough can think of it. <br /> <br /> This movie is one thing to remember: portraying brutal murders. So why isn't a little girl tortured or murdered? Is this next for our filmmakers? Child Torture and Abuse? What's wrong with you? Lynch is really nasty, ugly.
