I felt compelled to write a review after seeing the only review that gave this film a suspiciously high rating of 9/10. I say suspicious because it looks like a review, but rather a disclosure statement. Maybe the filmmaker, or one of his companions, has written this review? Naughty, naughty. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on a propeller channel on Sky TV, waiting for it to be really terrible. The special effects used were very good for the very low budget movie, and some actors were not so bad, but most of the actors were really terrible, but well tried because I expected most of them were filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I think the filmmaker has done really well when he tried to overcome his weight. I found some movies funny because he tried to be very cool when it wasn't. <br /> <br /> If you don't take this movie too seriously and look at it with some companions, you may be in a good time, but probably not in the way it was intended. This film is by no means 9/10, but it is worth looking at the smile, bearing in mind that it is made with a very low budget and fairly fair credit to its producers.
