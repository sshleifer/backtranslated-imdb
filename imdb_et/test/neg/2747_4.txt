AfterLife is a somewhat arrogant, reasonably wealthy man who discovers that his mother is dying and finds himself in his sister with Down's syndrome. He can't be bothered with him and he wants to get him basically; he has better things. At one point he finds he has to take him by car (he doesn't want to drive) all over the country. <br /> <br /> If all this seems familiar to you, it's probably because you've seen it. Rainman, a movie that is much better than his imitator, AfterLife. The main problem with the movie is that it copies the basic principle (hell, a couple of characters and even scenes). The main problem is that I didn't care about these signs. <br /> <br /> Brother Kenny (Kevin McKidd) is a little female. She has a girlfriend who comes and goes and learns like a sister of Down's syndrome (again, she's taken from Rainman). He is a journalist trying to get an interview with a doctor who is facing a scandal. When he arrives after his sister Roberta, he does not have much time for him and sometimes leaves him alone for too long. When he travels, he gets even sharper with him. Will I spoil anything by saying that at the end of the film she becomes a nicer, loving person? <br /> <br /> Roberta is not "normal"; he is "normal" and wants people to stop his different treatment. He has played Paula Sage, an actor with Down's syndrome, and his performance is the best for the film; why didn't the scriptwriter write more about his character? Well, probably because it would mean that the characters would get the story. When we definitely know the story, the filmmakers didn't see the problem they created? <br /> <br /> A movie about a dead mother and her disabled daughter (father missing, I think she's dead, but I'm not sure), it's surprising how little the film has on the viewer's emotions. Scenes are performed in a conventional, everyday way, with a standard and predictable dialogue that I found myself in rolls of eyes. take care of the characters. Here the characters are so uninteresting and two-dimensional that I really didn't think much to care for. "Umbrella" is the emotional climax, but it took me because I cared about the characters. <br /> <br /> Speaking of deviation, this film has a haiser. At the end of the movie, there is a sequence that begins as an incredible situation and reaches even worse territory; an unforgettable cruel trick is played in front of the audience. The sequence is meant to move the audience, but in the end it is terribly manipulative and offensive to the viewer's intelligence. Target audiences are not stupid and they know when a movie is cheating. What a cheap lot. <br /> <br /> There are no scenes in this movie that would have an effect. There are some funny sequences, yes, but when the characters talk to each other, I see practically seeing a scenario in front of me, moving in a predictive and interesting way, never hitting anything that touches the mind or heart. There are those that are hidden in the movies, where the second character knows exactly what the answer is. Why aren't supposedly "realistic" movies realizing that in real life anger can be irrational and sometimes people can't express their emotions and they can say things that aren't reasonable or can't say anything? All the participants in this film deserve better material. This film is not based on fact, but I think the documentary of a family with a Down syndrome would be much more interesting. That way we would have got the truth and emotions. For some reason, the characters in this film think that emotion involves nothing but loud and appropriate facial expression. <br /> <br /> ** (from 5)
