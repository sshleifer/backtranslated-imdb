I've seen worse, which is a modest way to tell how tough this film was. The plot is ridiculous: does the student let the policeman go and take him to the hostage? Darkly lit, smoky New York school - and somehow this clich√© hostage situation solves 24 hours? Are you serious? Daily hostage situation - Wounded NYPD officer doesn't take less time all day? I understand that this movie was made before 9/11 but still. I watched the clock and wondered how they could drag this excess plot for another hour and 10 minutes. Graders. Child Abuse Child, Pregnant Frightened Girl, Violent Rabbit, Confused Unfortunate Victim, Wise, Splitting White Man. Please try to make this hostage a "more textbook" and better school conditions mission? Please - this is a weak attempt to justify writing a movie about a child who puts the police. They are confused, the unknown idiots who are involved in a fool - far-drawn - situation. Do not try to paint them suddenly, as noble, the most laughable is Ziggy, who lives in the attic of the school and admires Michaelangelo so much that he paints these striking scenes on the walls. You have to make me joke. <br /> <br /> "The lack of racism" shows a protesting crowd? The black boy takes the black policeman and the black negotiator tries to put all this together. This is a random message. <br /> <br /> I understand the general message that was badly portrayed, though some participants who have gone on to a respectable career. <br /> <br /> Was it a joke red sniper lasers on the roof? The worst scene was a boy, fake snow falling, dead on his friend's roof, "promise to me" and so on. How the original. <br /> <br /> "I went to jail, but now I have the privilege of XYZ University" ... a good way to finish the movie.
