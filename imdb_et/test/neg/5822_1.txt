A terrible direction from a terrible script. Even the DVD seemed muddy and out of focus. The whole map has ridiculous accents. Unlike most of the other commentators, I had no idea that it was about boys in love with mud, but that fact was immediately apparent from the opening and all the beloved excerpts that were naked or poorly covered by young men, usually wet or glowing by sweating, looking for each other longing for one another.
