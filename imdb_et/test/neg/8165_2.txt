Maybe it's getting better. I do not know. I did it in the first twenty minutes or before I cut it off and got into mourning. It was obvious that the plot itself was familiar. One man, Paul LeMatt, Professor of Enzymology, Columbia, drives a small town in Ohio, looking for his former wife Diana Scarwidi. There he meets people who either ignore him or are hostile. Oh, they can smile, but below is something. <br /> <br /> This kind of agreement is for home filmmakers as well as viewers, and it is for pregnant women. You can point out a nice drawn commercial success like "Bad Day in Black Rock". Or he would have done, and probably DID do, a great "Twilight Zone" episode. Kenneth Toby, a veteran of scientific literature, is a superficially pleasant motel keeper. Diana Scarwid can deliver impressive performance as she did, saying "Silkwood". For some others, their scope is limited. <br /> <br /> But it is poorly managed and written. <br /> <br /> Example of Rags. Kenneth Toby does not know this LeMat dog, right from the bat. So when LeMatt goes to the street, Toby slides into his room, with his dogs, with his companions, and something staggering. Cut to LeMatt on the street. He hears his dog away. Then the POV picture probably went to LeMatt when he pulled it, then he went past the wind and the LeMatt camera. Cut the same stroke - from the other direction! No matter what the camera represents, whatever LeMatt looks like, it will never be shown. Maybe there was nothing because suddenly the wind stopped and LeMatt was alone on the street, looking a little confused. "You should never bring this dog first," says Toby, smiling from the porch. Question: What the hell is that? <br /> <br /> Example of bouncing writing. Well, two examples. (1) If you sit and write a stereotypical reporter for a small town dinner, without any kind of craft practice, you will come out with an expressionless baby with your hair that is peeled on the head, chewing gum, striking the tables. Right. (2) For the sake of active effect, any similarity to credibility is excluded from the window. LeMatt's cars stop, then explode when waiting for the garage to be fixed. Stopping: plausible. Explosive: Supernatural. Even Edgar Allan Poe does not support this event. <br /> <br /> And the invaders themselves? Think of a modest masterpiece, such as "Body Invasion". Dr Kevin McCarthy's small town goes wrong and it takes half of the film to get rid of the mystery, and the whole time the building is built and suspicion grows. Here, twenty minutes of film, a stranger in the motel's room walks and tears his plastic face, revealing a pulsating, light-emitting bare brain. Pregnancy is interrupted. <br /> <br /> I won't tell you the end, because I don't know what it is, and I don't care about it. I think it had something to do with insects, because why else would Paul LeMatt be an entymologist? (By the way, who deals with their classes?) But I'm not even sure the bugs were involved. It is quite possible that the troubleshooting was accidental. Writers can be her insect specialist and forgotten. It won't surprise me.
