I don't think this film has so much content, not even a worthy discussion. <br /> <br /> The first package is really nasty. Especially filming and shooting stereotypes. Definitely, Joe Dante's "Gremlins" and "Little Soldiers" artwork was interesting and interesting, I mean the imaginative and visual story of Spielberg-wunderkind (I really loved those movies), but "Homecoming" was a complete failure. Attacks of soldier soldiers and hairy creatures are not just comparable to zombie invasions (dead, stinky, rotten creatures who try to kill their livelihood - without logical reason, but because they hate them). <br /> <br /> Zombie flicks are typical for ordinary, direct, unusual and brutal cinematography. There's nothing to see about Joe Dante's debut. Another thing is tedious content: truly stupid dialogues between the two main characters, "the older brother dies and leaves the younger traumatized" and the bad behavior. And by the way, "Homecoming" is neither scary nor whore - and even less entertaining. You see, it's not even a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Zombie films in the decade of their birth - the late 60s / early 70s - had previously been revolutionary, provocative (at first glance through their terrible, explicit content) and subtle social critics. ORIGINAL Zombie film was actually a midnight film called "The Night of the Living Dead" (1968). It was a low-budget film that covered so many controversial topics, it is difficult to name them: Hitchcock / Raim's visual style, 70s American lifestyle, political unity, the future breakthrough of black people's human rights and even more conservative racism, which is the result of conservative Americans (remember that at the end of the movie there is a black main character). <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the creativity of midwives and want to know more about the most important ones, I suggest you "Midwives Movies: Marginal Mainstream". <br /> <br /> So beware of "Homecoming" and even being Romero "Land of the Dead".
