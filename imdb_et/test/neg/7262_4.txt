The giant prayer is awakened during this sleep in the artistic area and leads south, causing devastation. Boats, planes and trains correspond to the flying creature. Before the release of complete anger from NYC, the mantis meets the armed forces in the New York Tunnel. Special effects are, of course, crude oil according to today's standards, but for a decade-old boy it was very memorable in 1957. <br /> <br /> Starring William Hopper, Craig Stevens, Alix Talton and Pat Conway.
