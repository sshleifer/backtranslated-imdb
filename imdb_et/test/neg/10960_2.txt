I'm not a director or a writer or anything related to the film. But watching more than one movie on a daily basis has given me an idea that is a good movie or not. So here it is: Fast and Undead are Fast and Dead. I thought it might be a bit of a cool movie with lots of beginnings. But no, I was really very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Just this movie sucks. I'm a fan of big gore movies, but it gives you and gore, but they're not that consistent. a little scary. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of zombies, look at it. If you're not ... it's better to look for other kidnapped zombie movies.
