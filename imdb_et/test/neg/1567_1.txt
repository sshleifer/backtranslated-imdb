G&M started with an odd pair on top of Man About the House and continued to entertain the public with his sitcom. <br /> <br /> What a typical little charm of small-screen pairs chemistry was, G & M's big screen shots were just as terrible as the genuise Morcombe and Wise and countless fine TV shows. <br /> <br /> Unfunny. Dissatisfied and characteristic of the ill Yootha Joyce, who died before the release of the film.
