We see who are good guys. Union. And who are the bad guys, the rich man who steals the election and his spoiled son. The filmmaker forces us to see good evil. All the characters hate bad guys, so watching a movie can help us hate the bad guys. This is the worst thing about making a movie - manipulative and childish. The center of the plot is a policeman who is good and bad, and he is stuck in this ugly movie. It's boring and pointless. The story of Keach is really bad. And a good actor, Don Stroud, exaggerated his silence, playing whom no one likes and dislikes. It will take a long time for it to pass, and the title will prove itself; when he takes off, it crashes in a minute. Bored. One of the worst movies.
