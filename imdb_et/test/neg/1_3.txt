This is an unfortunate imitation of the "officer and gentleman". Kutcher and an unknown woman playing her love have no chemistry. Dialogue is wood, situations hackney. It is too long and the climax is anti-climactic (!). I love USCG, her men and women are fearless and harsh. Action scenes are awesome, but this movie doesn't do much to recruit, I'm afraid. The script is formal but confusing. The character of Kutcher is trying to redeem himself for an accident that was not his fault? Costner is angry at the death of light, but why? His "conflict" with his wife is about as deep as the mud palm. I saw this hidden preview for free and definitely felt that I was worth my money.
