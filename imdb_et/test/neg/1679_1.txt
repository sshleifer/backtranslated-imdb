I haven't watched the first scrap of this series yet, but luckily I was able to track a complicated and complicated plot with all the unexpected twists and thank them for the full originality of the concepts here. If confusion arises, let me leave no doubt that everything I just said is covered with pure, carefully maintained sarcasm that blooms and grows exponentially when it gets into such a flick. The clear indication that it is unimpressive is that it was led by the creator of visual effects, whose only other credit in this area is Henry Rooker's film, which was not well received. Action is at best average and I don't want to find anyone ... A Scottish computer-woman (come, seriously, what is its surname?) Russia's acclaimed ridiculous and / or irritating. There is a test or two in styling, and they are reasonable. The activity is not terrible. Movie art and editing are fine. The music is cool enough. The language is rare, even if it is. Violence is quite bloody. I only recommend it to fans of B movies and I say you can do it worse. 1/10
