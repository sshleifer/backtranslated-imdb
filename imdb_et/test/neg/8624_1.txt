This movie worked so badly. What was Jeff Bridges' accent, terrible and incredible. Was it supposed to be French, Scandinavian? In order for the heroine to travel over his son's grave during the character of Jeff Bridges, are you kidding me? How comfortable it is that Jeff brings his dirty shovel into the house after he throws off his lawn corpses. Do these people just not believe in calling the police? Okay ... I'm coming with you by car, why not? DUH! Why was Bridge's daughter obsessed with her father doing something, her mother's evil or just dumb? I didn't see the original, it would be hard to see the movie after that.
