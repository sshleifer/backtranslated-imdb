I bought this movie for a few dollars in the "Clearance Store Sale" one day when I looked around. Kate seemed pretty good (colored), but the film is B&W (I want them not to try to paint us in black and white films, but that's a common thing!). <Br>> <br /> When I looked at it, I was pleasantly surprised. It turned out better than I expected. I was disappointed that it was black and white, but the effects are pretty good, definitely better than saying, "Mars invaders", having a dirty effect, and it's nice to see John Banner other than Hogan heroes. <Br In general, this film is not too bad for a B-class and certainly worth two dollars from a nostalgic point of view. It's not my favorite sci-fi, but it's not my worst. It's OK.
