RAT RACE ads showed that I was too young, but because my boyfriend adores this movie (and the soundtrack), I finally looked and saw it with him today. I look at David Lynch's movies and all kinds of hidden indie stuff (I recently forced him to URBANIA), so I felt I would owe him a harmless Hollywood product. <br /> <br /> I didn't want to hurt her feelings, so I saved her friends. Yes, RAT RACE has its own moments, but much of it irritates me. Let's start from the beginning. RAT RACE was marketed as a "family movie", so I was a little surprised to find that the first scene focused around porn. (I hear it now, "Mommy, what does AFRO WHORES mean?") This scene has no purpose in this movie as a little bit of a PG-13 movie. <br /> <br /> And while we're still in the segment of the casino, it's quite convenient that all the characters played slots that hold the gold coins in the same time. What would have happened if they didn't? Are these millionaire players just sitting and waiting? And how did they get these gold coins into their nests first? <br /> <br /> But I am working on a plot point that is necessary for the movie to exist so I will continue. About Whoop and her long-lost daughter: they meet for the first time, but they don't talk to themselves about each other during their trial. Why make their relationship so difficult? Could they just say with their mother and daughter on vacation? Why has the business been long overdue? And why imagine a daughter's career as a heavy ride that is linked to her mobile phone, who never needs to contact her business again? Did the scenario forget the attribute of this sub-block and characters? <br /> <br /> This illustrates the main weakness of this movie - characters are controversial and interchangeable; it is tiring when everything is equally interesting and without any characteristic. And the second thing - the events are not plausible. Oh, sure, the characters can do some things, but the characters must be credible. Take NAKED GUN (another movie by Jerry Zucker). Frank Drebin has some quite exaggerated moments, but everything he does is theoretically possible in his world. (Jane is also funny, but it's a different kind of joke that makes all the difference.) A character attacking the RAT RACE Nature Law, which jumps on a speeding train, destroys any credibility a film may have; obviously they are not real people, so why should I care for them? <br /> <br /> Another problem I have with RAT RACE is moral. Characters get their modes almost completely due to theft. I know, I know, it's just a silly comedy, and the same activities didn't take me fifteen years ago when I saw MILLION DOLLAR MYSTERY, but there are many offenses at RAT RACE and it bothers me now. And I do not dig into the entire airport sabotage queue, unless I know whether the scripters did not take into account the real impact of such activity; was this scene funny before September 9? <br /> <br /> I leave over heart attacks, family and Nazi drugs (whose accumulation and profitability worked better in the "Seinfeld episode"). ") and go on to complain. Rowan Atkinson started tedious and ended up in uncertainty; I don't know when I liked the comic character. And the three Oscar winners need new agents. Whoop came out best but didn't have much work (loved copper perm and purple lipstick), the part of Kathy Bates was a bit, but gracefully short; Cuba was ... oh, man. Cuba, babe, please come your agent! INSTINCT and CHILL FACTOR is your third strike (please be glad I have not seen PEARL HARBOR or SNOW DOGS) - it's time to give your '97 best supporters an Oscar back to their rightful owner (Edward Norton, PRIMAL FEAR). Your natural actor has no half-naked companies controlled by the transvestite Lucille Ball Voice. you read scripts for your movies or get in your bag and pull out your next project at random? <br /> <br /> There are other small dots that disturb me (how Grisham and whore got robbed) but so basically RAT RACE is little more than your main type of package, obstructed by arbitrary obstacles to the quite underdeveloping and inexplicable end. They give money to charity? What is the end of it?!? Yes, it's a "noble" thing. Do not forget that the probability that whores Smash Mouth (will they ever say they don't sell it?) Are likely to use cross-licensing / licensing in the center of New Mexico desert, but who will honestly do it? Yes, they say it is a journey, not a destination that makes the trip worthwhile, but there is no way to get to the destination. If there had ever been an example of a false end, it would be. What a fun ending for a movie that, despite my nitpick here, I enjoyed the parts (I admit that I enjoy a little cow and some Lucy stuff with the language that comes with the language - at first I thought he wasn't explaining the speech would lead me to the wall, but he grew up my favorite.) <br /> <br /> But when my boyfriend knows I found RAT RACE pretty funny and charming. <br /> <br />
