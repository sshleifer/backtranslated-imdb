Producers of this film must be sued for misrepresenting the copyrighted material, namely the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Handbook. Fear and ignorance attract such frantic propaganda that inspires garbage like this film. If any of you have doubts about the innocence of Dungeons & Dragons, why don't you turn to your local hobby shop and see how you sit with a gambling group so you can see that D&D is not afraid.
