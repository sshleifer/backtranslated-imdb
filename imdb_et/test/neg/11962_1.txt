I knew I was in LONG 90 minutes when the opening voice declared the word "scarecrow" (it sounded like Scare Crew). And confident that 90 minutes later, after the fearful, annoying drama witnessed, the punches of the peacocks would not succeed near their target, but "hit" anyway, Ken Shamrock "acts" and the most foolish illogical end I saw in my life ( Ok, no, I'll take it in the last, about a week). After I got through it, I started to cry openly that I couldn't just go to Lacun a la Jim Carreys and just delete it completely from my mind. All the thoughts I might have had that Director Brian Katkin could have made an OK movie, taking into account the right facts I had after watching Slaughter Studios, have now completely and completely left me. <br /> <br /> My Class: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Tara Platt and Lisa Robert get topless <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz on demand (available until 22.
