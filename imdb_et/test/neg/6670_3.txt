By writing, Norman Wisdom is a very confused old man who spends most of his waking hours splitting up and helping old fishing statements with his own suicide. <br /> <br /> Indeed, by the time you read it, it is likely that you have joined the following, and the hypotheses record a hyperserious strange, almost 80-year-old career, with a nice funny and curved grid. What most of these obituaries don't remember is how Norman Wisdom had committed suicide in the late 1960s, with its astonishingly poor but strangely convincing endeavor in his film career. <br /> <br /> Are signs threatening off? "Tony Tenser presents" goes to titles. You scratch your head? "Where did I see this name before ...?"

I think it was for them <br /> <br /> Don't forget the real things, they thought, "Yes! That makes us what Blow Up did for Yardbirds "<br /> <br /> And so old Norman's leading crew career ended in freezing his small balls in Southport. <br /> <br /> I went there once. a depressing place.
