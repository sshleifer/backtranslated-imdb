Certainly this is not a bad little budget movie, this "Gorilla bride", but nothing special, and not enough memorable to be at the time of the essence of Sci-Fi efforts. Director Curt Siodmak was a prominent screenwriter of the 1930s and 1940s and gave stories to some real genres ("I Walked with Zombie", "Huntmees"), but the director apparently lacked the required skills. "The Gorilla Bride" is similar to the above-mentioned "The Wolf Man" story and atmosphere, but the film looks much more amateurish and bad. Both go around cursed men who become big animals at night, but the title of gorillas doesn't look half-threatening as a werewolf, although the film came out a decade later. During Cheesy's opening speech, actor Lon Chaney tries to convince us that the jungle is a malicious place and hides many secrets, but there is no real secret on the plot. It's just a plant manager who is jealous of his older colleague for such a beautiful young woman and she kills her. Native woman knows her crime and puts a spell on Barney, which causes her to become a terrible gorilla at night ... Or maybe she wants her to believe she is becoming a terrible gorilla? Lon Chaney himself plays a police commissioner whose task is to investigate the murder, while Raymond Burr (who was on a thousand Perry Mason television cameras) represents a greedy plant manager / night gorillas. Siodmak trying to make the movie a supernatural thriller? is it or not it all just happens to Barney's head? ? unsuccessfully and it causes too much talk and too little jungle action. Several jungle settings are nicely depicted, but the rest of the "special" effects are sticky and poorly made. Still acting pretty good, Barbara Payton is looking for a beautiful and? although very predictable? The story is strangely convincing until the end. Strange movie, probably voodoo-cursed?
