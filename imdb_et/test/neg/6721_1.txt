There are movies that are not published in theaters, but videos. It should be allowed to grow old and disintegrate the way the old nitrate material is. No story, incidental violence, over-acting, poorly written, and bad luck is that the star was not the only bad part of the movie. And I liked and enjoyed some of Siegel's other films.
