Paul Telfer, who plays Hercules on this television, must be the hottest thing on two feet EVER. Wow. <br /> <br /> But this movie is a 100% distorting Hercules story. Just like "Troy", this movie has nothing to do with the original story. Zero. It is particularly offensive that they actually made a homosexual character so that people could hate him by changing him from the history of evil and evil, like any television or cinema. It is triple offensive, as Hercules may have a woman because it was the expectation of these old days, but she also had at least a dozen males. So it is ironic that they should create a royal rival for this movie. No, not ironic. Bad. The creators of this travesty should hang their heads to shame.
