It could have been a good TV movie, but due to setbacks, understanding the film is not easier. As they give the viewer information (whether the film goes on), I found myself wondering why he never said or mentioned it. Then the whole path would probably not be necessary. <br /> <br /> When the movie ends, you understand why he shot, and of course he is not guilty. Too bad that the producer / director used the setbacks in this way, but on the other hand, the film would not have been worth it. <br /> <br /> A nice movie for a rainy day, a big bag to kill the evening.
