I bought this movie tape based on suggestions from other IMDb users and I have to say I was very disappointed. I'm a college professor and I showed this movie in my class; they voted unanimously that this is a terrible movie. I think if you like the old Dark Shadows series, maybe you like it. (I liked Dark Shadows when I was a child in the 70s, but now I think it's just terrible). In the first semester or at least it has a certain fidelity to Wilde's novel. After that, the story goes out of ferocity, at least compared to the 1945 MGM version (which won two Oscars). Nigel Davenport as Lord Henry is really the only thing that is being monitored throughout production. Many other actors are bad, the music is melodramatic, and the film's appearance is terrible. In fact, it is not a movie at all - it was obviously a video clip and it has a distinctive claustrophobic BBC. Open scenes are especially illuminated, women's costumes are terrible (men look all right) and many characters - including Dorian - seem to be 1970s rather than Victorian hairstyles. There is a lot of Wilde dialogue in the film, but Doria's voice command contains a lot of garbage that is directly in conflict with Wilde's character. I'm a big fan of Oscar Wilde, and I'm afraid he's going to roll out his grave violently when he does this horror. The only improvement over the 1945 version is that homosexual subtext is certainly more obvious without being difficult. I haven't seen any newer versions, but if someone is interested in telling the story well, I should recommend the 1945 MGM in black and white.
