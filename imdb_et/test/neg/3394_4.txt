A female friend invited me to see it in theaters. <br /> <br /> After half an hour we went out and went to the next multiplex (yes, we broke the rules) to get up against all odds. <br /> <br /> I remember too many monkeys dancing around saying "Oog, Og." Very little of the characters or the story was introduced to any of us or was even memorable. It just pulled in a painful place (and believe me that all the excuses were good enough to spend time with this particular friend). <br /> <br /> Production values ​​were excellent, good for photography and lighting, but it was a great studio edition and we came to watch a movie, not an art gallery. It seems that Ralph Richardson and Andie McDowell are going to waste in such a badly written film. <br /> <br /> Maybe if you do for another hour, it's worth it. I don't have so much patience with my time. 4 out of 10.
