A paranoid scholar creates a hunt man, carrying a wolf blood to prove the hypothesis of a quiet, but very large gardener. So the gardener starts rampage at night and the scientist tries to use him to reclaim his powers, but his former colleagues have created their own nature for violation. The films of Dr. Moreau, Frankenstein and various wolves mixed together were terribly dated, silly and moral. <br /> <br /> Although this topic is at best pedantic and irregular, this film is not too badly made, and it is interesting to look like a horror film representative of your time. Like most movies of mad scientists, this is a weak warning to fool the mother with nature. It has no Frankenstein power or intellectual challenges, but it never goes far. The way it works is satisfactory, as is cinematography, and the film moves with an entertaining clip. Some dialogues are completely ridiculous, but hey ... it's just a movie - and B minus one. There are also some nice shots of a wolf and humor that prevents the film from feeling too serious - always a plus for this genre.
