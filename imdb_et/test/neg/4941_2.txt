Don't choose it. **** Spoiler Alert ***** The plot of this aggravatingly bad movie has four friends who are being spoken by a very interesting driver. Shuttle with them is quite a milquetoast looking for a business type. Right next to his trip, the bus driver takes a ramp and some casual drivers try to drive them off the road. The end result is that they get a flat tire. The driver can get one on board the train to change the tire and sockets and the boys' fingers are broken between the tire and the truck. At this point, the leader shows that he is a kidnapper and has taken all the people hostage. <br /> <br /> Now the movie becomes very slow and annoying because the characters are followed by one flat. One of the men is being killed, trying to escape - even that he has no tension. Finally, it turns out that a milquetoast businessman is in the hands of a driver when a milquetoast guy kills another man by cutting his friend's throat. <br /> <br /> Women have a few attempts to escape. Milquetoast is beaten over the head by the iron - but he will survive. <br /> <br /> The driver is also beaten and somehow survived by the high speed fence of the collision head, kneeling beside the steering wheel. Somehow he did not go through the window or even seriously injured the windscreen in the event of a collision. At the same time, a shuttle woman is unconscious - however, she had a steering wheel to protect her and she had nothing between her and the windshield. <br /> <br /> He is finally able to subdue women and get an underground garage that is against human trafficking. One woman is killed. The other punctures the driver's foot with a good-sized piece of broken mirror and lets him head off, but he is capable (which should be in a severely weakened state - serious blood loss, two head injuries, and big leg skipping) to pull him out of the shuttle, drag him to a big box, throw He's in and get it locked up all the time with his fierce fight. <br /> <br /> Now, some people admire the message of human trafficking and how it is happening today. This is a serious problem. However, giving a very boring film about the subject does not give him the right to a higher rating.
