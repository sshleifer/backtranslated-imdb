So, it's Friday night and you want to watch the movie ... everything you want is something fun, not too artificial or something that may need philosophical discussions for a long night. So you pay $ 10 for Mod Squad. The trailer of this movie should have turned me off, but come ... it's three of Hollywood's most beautiful people - eye candies. But this is ... a series of moving Prada ads. And what did Hollywood manufacturers forget about? It hits. Why do these children run on the streets after an unknown enemy? Where are they? But don't worry, after a while you just have to take care. I was out of this movie because I thought I was sitting in my room and looked at the wall, could have been more productive (and free), but by that time it had ended (90 minutes - it's just saving grace). So, ready to waste 10 dollars? Go, take a nice hot meal.
