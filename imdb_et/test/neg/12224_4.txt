RKO tried to raise his letter to JOAN FONTAINE when he placed his sister on the airplane who wanted enough for the doctor (JOHN BEAL) to get out of responsibility. TCM gave it as Joan Fontaine's career jumping table. <br /> <br /> Fontaine is serious and does acceptable work, nothing more, and John Beal is fine than his love interest. But it is obvious that PHILIP HUSTON (who is young James Garner's appearance and storms) is an actor who should have shared a top-notch bill with Fontaine. What has this beautiful actor done? Why didn't RKO promote him with Fontaine? He showed skill as a light comedian. <br /> <br /> These are the thoughts that went through my head when I looked at this rather mild drama that was never quite a harsh promise of this title. The story itself is quite tiring, only occasionally because of Fontaine's heroic heroine. <br /> <br /> She gently shoots her sister and wears her serious expressions, suggesting that in the future it would be more useful to use the date. Beal never went to a career and his performance shows why. Strictly weak. <br /> <br /> But what happened to Philip Huston? The evidence here is that he should have been worth the film's career. <br /> <br /> Trivia Note: See if Dwight Frye ("Dracula") is a patient-controlled patient.
