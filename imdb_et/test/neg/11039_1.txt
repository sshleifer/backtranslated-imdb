... So some people may argue that this is not possible if it is the worst film, and it is not. I've seen movies with weaker plots, worse acting and so on. <br /> <br /> So why do I hate this movie? Well, it is basically a person who is kidnapped for many years and when he leaves, he tries to find out who did it and why, for revenge. The problem I have with this movie has nothing to do with gore or horror, but <br /> <br /> *** KEEPING THE MAIN SPOILERS IF YOU ARE NOT KNOWING *** <br /> <br /> our main character basically gets sex with his daughter and he wants to cut his tongue so his enemy doesn't tell him because he didn't know. It is so humiliating when he climbs on his knees like a dog. And why does he deserve it? Because many years ago he saw that his brother and sister were in the wrong way at the time of the offer. He went on and told some people and as a result he committed suicide. And viola, this is the brother who put our main game through it just for that. I've been thinking: maybe I hate this movie so much that I think his punishment is too harsh. Perhaps because I feel that this film does not perish from the Inca but somehow confuse it with love. Maybe it's because I was expecting something else. <br /> <br /> *** END OF SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Believe me, no one deserves what our main player will end up with, and I'm very serious; do you know how some movies just get under the skin and stay there? Well, I felt fucking after watching the movie and I really wish I had never seen it. It stayed with me for days, and some asked: Isn't a good movie goal? Can we influence us in such ways? Yes, it may be, but this movie didn't make me sick, it made me feel bad.
