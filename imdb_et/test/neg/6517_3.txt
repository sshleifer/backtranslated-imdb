This movie is about 7 pairs of meetings in Hampstead, one sunny Wednesday afternoon. escort service. They are not linked by geographical location, so it's a disappointment. Film is a collage of conversations without a noticeable plot. Film jumps from couple to other without logic. I find this film boring and purposeful. The only redemption function is the big weather in the whole movie. It is sad that films such as Ewan McGregor and Sophie Okonedo are wasted by this film.
