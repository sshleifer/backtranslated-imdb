This is a movie that should have been a mini series because it is trying to get too much information in too little space. The whole story is constantly bombarded with sub-plots, introduction of signs, and meaningless pieces that do not go anywhere. There is the underlying plot where the boy meets the girl, he has doubts, but he gets married in any case and then his suspicion and he goes to see if they are real. They can't, but her husband doesn't believe she was unfaithful and her almost boyfriend doesn't want her because she was not infidel with her husband. That said, there are at least 1000 sub-plot and character introductions that make this plot almost incomprehensible. In the first 15 minutes, you will have so many things and situations where you simply care. You don't care about any confusion and twisted pain that strikes the story inside and out, such as the crouchs that feed on the body. Everyone comes in and takes interest from the viewer. After half an hour and completely left, I stayed behind and watched the other two and a half hours of pure illness. I couldn't imagine where it was going, but as I looked at the fire, I just couldn't get up and turn it off. Production values ​​are excellent, but the film received is a waste of time; wash your socks.
