Let me be clear. I hate such movies. I don't like anything where the main characters are all English citizens. I find this kind of literature and film terrible. You can never read me Jane Austen's book. The only reason I read W. Somerset's Maugham book and watched the next film was in class. before World War II. One night after eating some of his friends with his wealthy friends, he deliberately wanted to get into an Austrian refugee, sex with him and ditches, and then kill himself. As the film goes further, you really want to like Mary. <br /> <br /> What was the load on this movie? First, the film found many sub-blocks and characters that were not even in the book. I very much doubt that the late Mr Maugham would have appreciated them. The characters, though rich, were some of the most superficial and self-centered people I've ever seen. the only thing that is redeemable. Always talented Kristin Scott Thomas is perfect for Mary's role. In fact, I was unable to carry someone else. Sean Penn and Anne Bancroft also had supporting roles that were as good as the leader. <br /> <br /> Save yourself the pain of watching this movie.
