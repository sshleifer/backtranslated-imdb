Is it just me or the fact that the evil team is Japanese and that their arrogant star fighter is German looks a little up? Perhaps it is so in an international race, but when all of them represent them, they are like Cody and his mechanic Chris (Peter Berg, who has yet to learn how to act), then I would take another country. Formula movies can be good, but characters must be nice and no one meets the criteria of this movie. It's short - a very bad movie.
