It was the first Chani movie made by Monogram. What comes from Fox's values ​​and standards! I was shocked when I saw my first monogram after seeing the big Fox movies. It's boring and it's not necessary if Chan runs peacefully across the street. Chan is currently working for the US secret service, not for the Honolulu Police Department. He is assisted by Benson Fong, who for the first time plays No. 3 Son Tommy. She also has a daughter, Iris Chan, played by Marianne Quon. Mantan Moreland also debuts in Birmingham Brown. He is a cab driver here in Washington, not a later film by later Chani drivers.
