Joe D'Amato was able to make other very important films in his very long and very fruitful career, of course, making very cheap Z-Class movies in the early 70s on the great exploitation curve of Italy, but the Holocaust of Porn is not one of them, or at least it shouldn't be. Allow me not to wait much for this title from the movie, but I thought that, given the explanation of this box, he might have funny horror scenes with "horny, mutant, cannibal zombie". It turns out that the zombie doesn't appear more than halfway before the movie, and each time we get a natural sex game, as you can imagine. What is good. But it is not very enjoyable, except for the most "what f *** is this BS". There is a ridiculous dialogue involving lobsters paying more for Japanese mail order than in Paris, hot, thin women playing with biologists and zoologists with special sexual hangings (let the door be freed from being raped, and two-way enjoyment) That's all that comes to the island, where the "main attraction" is a man who spends an absolutely miserable (forgetting ridiculous) time at an early age, staring at the newcomers to the radioactive waste on the island of the Caribbean Sea, one face like one of the Jabba palace guards and his main genealogical sweet potato. But much more unpleasant than anything before it is a "relationship" that develops between a monster and a dark-skinned woman who has an excessive time to escape, but just sits there, with an empty face, because the monster brings gifts and what must be racially motivated exploitation to move filmmakers who are ONLY the only rapes and kill white women, not her. And, of course, it ends with a "happy" ending. Of course, I use quotes that are somehow shocking that it may not be any legal end. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, this is not what you might expect, as it can be a bloody horror movie with plenty of sticky but cool-looking Italian monster-zombies that eat human meat. If anything that violence is in the film is done on a shoe-string; The face-hit log is immediately cut into a bloody aftermath similar to someone's hit tomato. So the last part of the title is more for the market. But even if the porn movie is a little to go on, unless the reason why cast and team members get paid for the Caribbean (as the interview refers to George Eastman, it was just one of the few hurries made on the island). Its got penny-bought schlocky camera work and similar actors, full of genitals about 3/4 all the time and sad lip-sync and music like Nino Rota forced gun-point to do something gentle bordello, and it's STILL the same celluloid color piece; it can all be a huge innocent pleasure, but it is not.
