This is a very bad movie! <br /> <br /> Plot is weak, functioning is bad and science is worse. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not convincing. Dramatic scenes are a joke. Every step you see miles away. The end is disappointing and there is no relationship. The best aspect of the film is the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The only reason why this smaller voice was not given is that it is a TV movie and I believe the budget was low from the start. <Br / I believe that Luke Parry's young female fans still see this movie, but she's done a better job. Again, it's terrible. Very very terrible. If you have a choice, look for something else.
