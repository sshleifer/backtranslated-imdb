This is probably the most irritating example I've seen in my whole life. This is the most annoying and idiotic exhibition I have ever seen. All this is just bad. <br /> <br /> Summary: Every week different situations arise for parents. <br /> <br /> I didn't understand what an idiot would bring about this confusion, not to mention several seasons first. The script is bad, very bad? it includes both joy and unethical jokes that you usually see in R or NC-17 rated movies. Especially in the case of the young boy's character, where everything he does is pleasant, is what one called the family to show humor? Casting is also terrible, everything you see is really a BAD actor, a period. <br /> <br /> Final word: This exhibition is a real torture! This exhibition gives an idea of ​​how an irresponsible parent can be (using power wrong, not understanding). This is the zillion times away from reality. Listen to Kenny G would be a god who sends it in comparison. Turning the washing machine around will not damage your eyes as much as this exhibition. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) <br /> <br /> Note: The show is so bad that even her mother has cast Pull in her daughter's show.
