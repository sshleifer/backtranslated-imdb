One of the worst films I've ever seen. Absolutely ridiculous. The story is bad. Animations are completely kids and displaced. Hologram physics is fun how much they are completely wrong. OMG, I even want to believe that this film has a Disney tag. Yuck. The actors are somewhat beautiful, but there are so many good movies with surprising actors that are much more valuable than this. Final note, bad movie. Don't bother to look at it. If you are looking for movies with your children, consider other alternatives, such as Ratattuile, Monster Inc or Enchanted Story. Seriously.
