Looking at this movie, you just have to ask: what did they mean? The movie has so many noticeably bad parts, you may feel that its intentionally bad, like some joke. <br /> <br /> I think driving is the worst part of the movie. The corners of the camera and other elements of the film are so bad as this film is ridiculously bad. The most fun example of this would be when the party's guests receive their invitations via email - the same camera's corner is used for each image (which lasts 2 seconds long) and the same computer screen appears on the same desktop / program etc. It even looks like this thing is the same set every time. The whole sequence was also quiet, without music or sound effects. In general, it was a bad way to convey the idea that email was sent across the city. It's not a surprise - most songs, including songs that open the movie, are actually small changes in the scores of other movies (see if you can guess what). I also noticed that the music was not played by a real orchestra. It seems to have been written and played through the lowest level midi keyboard. If you're familiar with LucasArts SCUM adventure games, each instrument's curve sounds like an IMUSE engine. <br /> <br /> Everything else about the movie just sucks. Operation is terrible. The script is a derivative (Ferris Beuller?). The movie is not funny from a distance if you don't see the whole movie as one big joke that is played for the paying audience. Don't try it. Don't look even when it's in the middle of comedy again. Just forget about it - it's terrible.
