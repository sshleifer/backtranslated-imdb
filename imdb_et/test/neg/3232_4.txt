Corey Haim plays a guy who competes with a dog to take out a gigantic troll and OSA (Michael Ironside) with 30/30 and homemade bombs (which is likely to play with Haim) Oh and he also protects his mother and girlfriend in this decent Create a watchable but disappointing. Of course, Corey Haim is terrible, but the film's momentum and the powerful presence of Ironside make it at least a modest film. However, the plot is ridiculous and it would have been more beautiful if we had seen a monster or at least more gore. At least this is something else. It is also quite likely that this film is the last teen movie for a while to show teenagers how to make bombs. <br /> <br /> Matt Bronson 2/5
