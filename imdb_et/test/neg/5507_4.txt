Jesus Franco is in his movies pretty much hit or missed and I would say that it was a shortage, that is, if you don't hit. I say the man is on the lookout for a good blow, even if it involves topless women with machine guns that are silhouetted against the ocean. In general, it is pretty ridiculous, and acting is terrible, but action is the least of what it is. And what is it? Well, it's about 102 minutes of lesbianism, women choose and shovel in the hot sun for no apparent reason and almost as much slease as you stand and maybe some. Most Notable (?) There is a scene that includes one young woman who is tied to a chair and apparently in love with a German Shepherd Dog, and while what is happening is just indirect (luckily) probably a scenario I could have done without. I'll put it into a Franco movie with Tender Flesh, which I wouldn't have in my collection, even though the music is jazz and fun. 4 out of 10, yecch.
