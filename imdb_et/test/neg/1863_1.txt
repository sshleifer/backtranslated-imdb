Ghoulies IV begins a museum storage facility where PVC and leather-clad blonde Alexandra (Stacie Randall) is looking for an old gem, after pulling different guards, she calls the demon Faust, whom she worships and wants to have sex, unfortunately she lost so she is not very happy and tells get him the last one ... What belongs to Jonathan Graves (returning from the original Ghoulies (1985) Peter Liapis) who has experienced demonic possession and such things after the original events of Ghoulies. Alexandra tries to find a jewel so she can bring Faust to Earth permanently from "the other side", and I don't really know. Erm, this is really ... <br /> <br /> Under Jim Wynorsk, whose name goes under my shadow when it is added to a movie I want to destroy 90 minutes of my life in Goulies IV is like I was waiting for a complete, complete and complete mess from start to finish and it is so simple and straightforward. Mark Sevi, ahem, 'script', cough, has virtually anything in common with another Ghoulies movie, except for its title, and they managed to convince Liap to repeat his role, which also has a great bonus that can also be used for video footage. original, although it does not matter. The story is almost non-existent, the whole movie is a real trick to look at, it's incredibly boring and moral, it's slow, it's predictable, clean is pure, when blood or gore goes and it has two comic reliefs I expect. should complete the Ghoulies quota, although they don't see anything they did in previous movies, and are actually just embarrassing to watch, actually I think they practiced being ventriloquist during most of the movie when they talk about their mouth don't move .. You know I don't want to talk or think about Ghoulies IV anymore, so please believe me when I say this is a big proportion of the size of Elephant, don't waste your time or money. br /> <br /> Dirctor Wynorski revolves around fairly high-quality movies at almost every level, with special effects as terrible as the film. Obviously, Ghoulies IV is meant to be some kind of horror comedy, but it is set aside for each target and is not funny or scary. The best thing about this film is the actor Randall in her PVC and leather gear that runs around trying to find a gemstone and what it is hardly worth seeing at this garbage. There's a half decent runaway car scene with a couple crash, but it seems that it was edited with a completely different movie and given Wynorski results I'm sure it was. Forget about any gore because there is no one. Liapis is cast back, although she probably wants her to stay away from PVC clad baby Randall on this movie that says a lot, the best thing. <br /> <br /> Ghoulies IV is a mess, nothing to say really. I do not see honestly that someone who enjoys such movies does not get it. I can't believe I suggest anything else about the original Ghoulies, but it happens now, because even though it is nonsense, it's much better than Ghoulies IV, one to prevent people and you can thank me later. Things I sit, so you don't have to, honestly ...
