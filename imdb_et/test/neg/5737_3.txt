Certainly not your typical Polizia, Redneck just didn't work for me. The film speaks of a juvenile who has gone wrong and a young boy who was inadvertently kidnapped during the process. In an attempt to escape, the robbers once again leave a bloody death when they intend to redeem the boy. The plan will never be dropped because the robbers intend to get to France and the boy is going to stay with them. While I could mention a number of problems I had with the film, would I focus on the most obvious? Mlythhis played Telly Savala. Saval was the winner who played Kojakina from his work at Dirty Dozen and from Kelley's heroes to other Italian films, such as Crime Boss. I've always thought of him as one cool client. Unfortunately, Savalas is almost invisible in Redneck. Did the director turn the camera on and instruct him to act as psychologically as possible? It may not have been too bad if his actions were done in the context of a well-maintained plot, but here it seems odd to be odd. This seems to be a casual lunacy. And what is that accent? There were many things in Savala, but South is not one of them. He's talking ridiculously even in accents. In addition, I found little interest in the rest of the film. As I pointed out, the plot never dropped me. I just don't care what's going on. And the notion that a boy has so quickly attracted a criminal lifestyle is not true. For other participants, Mark Lester is almost as bad as Savala and usually the trusted Franco Nero is not much better. Three "name" actors and not a good result between them. Worse still, I believe the director has filmed many night scenes, but nothing more than the glow of his watch to illuminate the frames. I couldn't tell what was going on. The characters I hate, the plot I don't care for, and the production values ​​that failed? a miracle I am on Redneck 3/10.
