I can't believe I watched this whole movie. Another "Ishtar" where I was waiting for it to get better, which never happened. The sound is terrible, talking too little about conversations to make a few seconds. The plot is absolutely unlikely to act mediocre, although Keaton does his usual good work as a mental event, although this role can also be negative. The director does not know absolutely about hospitals, medicines, science or anything of a technical nature. "Sociopath" ???? I don't know how they came with this diagnosis? There are so many mistakes, mischiefs and things about this movie that if you list them all, you could save it in some way. Demerol as a General Anesthetic? Motorcyclist on the road with a non-DOT / Snell scenic helmet. San Francisco ??? The walls of the paper move when the helmets move, the helmets appear in thin air, the guns point in one direction, but they strike things in another, the light appears and disappears, and there is hardly a scene that contains no error in the movement. My wife, who is RN of the Oncology unit, finally left the room after the end of the film, so that it irritated all the medical errors. I gave it to 2 only because of Keaton's behavior, otherwise he would definitely have 1.
