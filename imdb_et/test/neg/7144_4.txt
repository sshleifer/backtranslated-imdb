Finally I rented this video after searching for it for several months. At first I just wanted to see it, because I'm a fan of Neil Pearson (Patrick, boy of Isobel, leader). But the film is very good without Neil (although she does very well in this film, she is overshadowed by three main female characters). This is a terrible, intense film that the British do so well - definitely a "chick flick" house and its isolated device that gives the film an almost "Wuthering Heights" aura. The film is full of tension and end, shocking, but somehow inevitable. I'm glad I watched it, it was worth the wait
