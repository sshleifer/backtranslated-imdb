Although this must be the sixth of the season, this schmaltzy episode is not badly written or behaved. It's just that most of us looked at the tight, gripping horrors / thrillers of X-Files that ended without simple answers and moving against a blind but understandable conspiracy. The 6th season gave us language-in-cheek comedies that undermined the continuity of the show and, frankly, made the Simpsons' Halloween specials look great on the thrill TV. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Victoria Jackson's SNL is famous for his longtime girlfriend who puts himself in the rain. But his boss is the one who truly loves her, and Mulder is going to offer her advice to get out of town. <br /> <br /> The agencies have fun playful fun and some entertaining but Midwestern hicks aren't too complicated. It's not something you want to see more than once! <br /> <br /> It's hard to figure out for the 6th season. Chris Carter, the creator of X-Files, seems to be bored with the whole story of "Syndicate conspiracy" and gives up the responsibility of black comedy writers.
