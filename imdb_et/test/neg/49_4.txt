The frightening begins with a horror film icon that kills the director and then his servant before he breaks. This icon, which has some of Christopher Lee's characteristics for him, continues to haunt the people around him, as a group of horror film students steals his corpse's mausoleum that he has. <br /> <br /> The first ten minutes are well filmed, good writing and lots of chances for murderous chaos. But the movie drags in the middle (although fortunately not as much as the "House of Death"), and never gets back to the original energy run. <br /> <br /> Many deaths are confusing as they appear to be seeing floating coffins or other odd things, they are just frightened. Twice we see poisonous gas. But the box promises that this horror star is the embodiment of all the monsters he played. Boy, is this the wrong advertisement unless he spent his career with boring old men taking a sunset and watching "Matlock". dead icon. A contemporary equivalent (complaining of Vincent Price or Peter Cushing) would be a great film. Perhaps the remake is fine if it is not too disrespectful. Sometimes the theory is not reflected in the application, and this film offers this example. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming quality film (beginning) is the very young look of Jeffrey Combs. I saw him and thought "it's Jeffrey Combs," but I felt that I was wrong because the box didn't mention him. But certainly, combs were there. (Note to the filmmaker: mention the Combs on a DVD, sell more copies when you cheat on customers.) If you are dead at Jeffrey Combs, check out this early role. Otherwise, I cannot offer it as a great choice for a horror marathon. Allow me to suggest "Intruder" or "Popcorn" as they are both pretty decent and time-tested.
