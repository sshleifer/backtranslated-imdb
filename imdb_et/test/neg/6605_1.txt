Yes it is true. This movie is a terrible piece ... you know what. Almost all fans of Sapkowski books in Poland think the same. The truth is that Polish cinematography cannot afford to produce fantasy films. This is a shame when comparing, for example, "Wiedzmin" and "Conan the Barbarian". I hope no one outside Poland will see this nightmare.
