The only thing this film is romantic is the pain and anxiety of romance. If you expect another cinematic adaptation of Nicholas Sparks's novel to follow the formula of a predetermined selection of previous films, such as "Message in Bottle", "Night in Rodanthe" and "Walk in Mind," think again. No one will die anyone trying to save someone, and romance will not change those signs. If that is something, it will make it even more unhappy than they were. <br /> <br /> Army Sergeant John Tyree (Channing Tatum, "GI Joe") is a memorable two-week-long army vacation with an impressive college girl, Savannah Curtis (Amanda Seyfriend radiating from Mamma Mia) who spends South Carolina Spring Day. Savannah does not drink, smokes, but he tells John that his head is full of embarrassment. Inevitably, John and Savannah will fall in love with each other and will indefinitely trigger love letter exchange letters that create any sleep standard. Tyree is in a world where the army serves in some ungodly corner of the world when it is written in the classroom in college. As they are hot and heavy, suicide terrorists have flown into the world shopping center. John reenlists with his friends patriotism wavered without discussing Savannah. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, another boy, shaggy, but a pleasant family friend, Tim (Henry Thomas "ET: extraterritorial") who is a mother, an autistic child named Alan becomes the object of Savannah's mood. She is a girl who helps build houses to be less happy and wants to start a summer horseshoe for autistic children. He delays what seems to be forever before he finally contacts Tyree with that letter. Indeed, he casts a man for his illness! Later, he testified to John that he knew his voice would have violated his decision to marry Tim, so he wouldn't make that fatal speech. Predictably, John agonizes Savannah's lack of communication. During a routine mission, our hero takes a couple of terror bands on the back and the wind in Germany. Although all this is changing, Tyree is trying to get his coin collecting from his father, Mr. Tyree (Richard Jenkins, "Step Brothers") who suffers from Asperger's syndrome. His father seems to be on his last leg after John leaves the hospital. The leading female character has no sense of respect and her betrayal by Tyree is a pretty small blow. Keith Robinson, his father and commander of Tyree, are the only sympathetic characters in this long-range epistolic romance. <br /> <br /> "Dear John" gives a new meaning to the stories of unistic love. Yuck!
