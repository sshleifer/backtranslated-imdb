Play Macbeth has written William Shakespeare between 1604 and 1606. Since then, a number of other versions of the game have been produced, including those completed in 1930, 1971 and 2006. Akira Kurosawa even directed the Japanese version of Macbet in 1957, entitled "Kumonosu jô." The game begins with King Duncan, listening to the success of his two generals, Macbeth and Banquo, in a recent battle with Ireland and the Norwegians. After a quick promotion from Duncan, Macbeth gets a terrible feeling of lust, greed, and power, and does everything in his power to get into the crown: even if it involves murder. <br /> <br /> Geoffrey Wright tried to create his famous version of the game in 2006, setting it in the modern Melbourne underworld. Imagine the humble Macbeth killing hundreds of soldiers with AK-47 and stealing their "Low" transfer at the same time. Just the last joke, but one thing he does is proclaim the traditional Shakespeare. And he keeps it all over the film. This is correct! Shakespeare meets the ghetto. That's all you ever hope! Not ?? The newest Macbeth is harsh and violent enough to match any other contemporary movie, but it lacks proper action, the right lingo and good camera techniques. <br /> <br /> The upgraded movie begins with Macbeth (Sam Worthington), who works as Duncan (Gary Sweet), Melbourne, Australia drug dealer. After Duncan (when the three witches had predicted) brought Glamini Thanesse, the aspiration would take over Macbet when his eyes placed on his eyes. After introducing Macbeth, Duncan calls himself into Macbeth's house for the night of drugs and alcohol. Before the festive events began, Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hall) will talk about Macbeth to kill Duncan's power over the throne. After the bodyguards are drunk and everyone sleeps, Macbeth jumps into Duncan's room and puts him to death. After his murder, Macbeth takes all Duncan's stuff, including the hidden title and the crown. As soon as he thinks he has what he wants, he thinks that it takes more than a bribe and escape to solve his problems. <br /> <br /> One of the main movie bugs was the actor. Once seemingly terrible and empowered, Macbeth suddenly becomes wicked. And she looks like a sad puppy dog ​​on the whole movie. I really don't know if it was the fault of Worthington or Wright, but in either case one would have realized that Macbeth was a king, not a knot that took everything the woman had to say literally. As I said earlier, Macbeth should have been rude, arrogant and embarrassing. But when his character becomes a lord of the drug, he also changes personalities. On the other hand, Lady Macbeth really knew how to nip it when she felt and characterized her character. He didn't seem as ugly as in the game or in the 1971 version, but he reminds Macbet that, compared to the murder, he would have nothing else he could do, wouldn't be quite in conflict. Another thing I find was nudity. This fluke was supposed to be Wright's fault. Witches didn't work a little if you didn't call your birthday party. At one point in the movie, I started wondering if I was looking at Macbeth or Unique Positions Vol. 2. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong when I say you can't find Shakespeare's dialogue. It's spoken flawlessly, but when it comes to the Australian gangster, it's just very weird. When Macbeth starts killing people, he'll let them know first by talking to Ye Olde in English. Macbeth contains plenty of activities, blood, gore and nudity for everyone to live. You forget all the positive facts when you start thinking for yourself: "Okay, what the hell did he say in this last sentence?" At some points in the movie, I don't even believe that the actors themselves knew what they were saying. The new age limit for the movie could have been easily pulled out, it was not "You" and "Your". The work of the camera was just honest for me. One thing I couldn't do was the constant tempo between the characters back and forth. The camera technique used abandoned the fact that Blair Witch was a kind of vibe and threw me in a little mouth. Matt Reeves tried to catch the same concept of camera work in the Clover field, but it just didn't work. It makes me look out of my chair and look around the small bags they have comfortably planted in every place on the planes. Looking back, gangsta 'Macbeth has one positive thing: a lot of action. In addition, the film does not contain more than just unused, correct use of English and the work of a rotating camera. The sound track has one or two songs, but each song has been changed differently in each scene. Never use interesting or fascinating media. From now on, directors should leave the dangerous drug Al Pacino and Robert Deniro. Macbeth's future renditions should be created as Shakespeare planned to play 400 years ago. I would recommend using medieval clothes, Ye Olde English, swords and shields, and the soundtrack made by Enya. But in both cases, modern Macbeth will make you long for some good folk music, camp fire and bustier.
