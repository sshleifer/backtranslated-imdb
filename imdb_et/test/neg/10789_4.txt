I have to admit that I am in a worse position; if I can find out more about the other observers' movie than watching it myself, then this is the problem. While the example of "Man Who Knew Too Much" seems generally simple, the film allows too many secret elements to get on the path that could have been a satisfying secret. By the time we arrive at the scene where the witch woman sees the secrecy of the "first layer of the seven layers", I didn't know if I would laugh or go back to see if I missed something. <br /> <In retrospect, the secret note from Mr. Lawrence (Leslie Banks) from the shaving brush handle was a masterfully written message that resulted in a dentist named Barbor and finally Albert Hall, a place, not the person, as shown by "A. Hall". But all the intrigues have never made it clear why the purpose of the murder was eliminated. Okay, so Louis Bernard was killed because he knew the plot to kill a diplomat named Ropa, but why was Ropa's target? Think about why the writing was even written and fixed in the shaving brush? Did Bernard have to refer to it every time and then remember what happens? <br /> <br /> With this isolated scenes, "Man Who Knew Too Much" is hard to follow and a bit uncomfortable, but I give Alfred Hitchcock credit for this early effort. In the long run, I have to look at some of the other works of the same era, though this film can't really hold on to its later works like "Psycho" or "North by Northwest".
