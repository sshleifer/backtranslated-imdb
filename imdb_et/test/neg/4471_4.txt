Steve Martin has always been honored to be a very funny comedian and a pretty good actor, and I loved "planes, trains and cars" and "Bowfinger" --- but "House to the the house" is definitely not one of Martin's funniest jobs, and this it doesn't even look like it's just sad ... <br /> <br /> I don't know; maybe I didn't like this movie because I rented it with "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" and "Phone Cabinet", both of which are great movies or maybe because I'm used to it much better from Martin or maybe it's just that that I am in a bad mood tonight ... Despite the fact that this movie was not very funny or entertaining, and I never got more than a smile or a weak smile at the movie gags, which is really a shame because the previews of this comedy were so promising! I was expecting the House of Down House to be a bass comedy of all kinds, and I'd surely expect Martin to get more hit comedy and inter-racial smile. Instead, it has been "treated" to see that Queen Latifah has been beaten across the screen, trying to do her best if she is completely selfless. The funniest thing about this clunk is Eugene Levy, but even she doesn't get the time she deserves. <br /> <br /> I would really have liked to enjoy "House of Down House," but I didn't do it I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is the hardest Steve Martin fan. Leave it out and rent "planes, trains and cars" instead ... <br /> <br /> You have a much better time.
