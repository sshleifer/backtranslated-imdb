Why did the US repeat it on earth? the title actually says it all: the plot is as clear as the book that is read in a language you have never heard of and resembles something. <br /> <br /> You'll see a ninety minutes change of location, most of them rubbed in the movie later. At first, you can see Berry's nice little farm, located in a movie near Paris, but then the "transport" to Isle de France won't disappear very well: it explodes 1 minute later. there are also two gangsters who do not have languages, as if it were meaningful in the world of SMS and the Internet, not to mention the pencil and the paper. <br /> <br /> It's just like that, there's no point in it. story. my only credit goes to a cameraman, the camera is great.
