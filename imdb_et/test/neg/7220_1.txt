This TV show is an idiotic waste of time if you want to learn. <br /> <br /> Detection channels for animals. If you'd like to see a mutual understanding on television, just check out MTV. MTV stands for music television. <br /> <br /> Don't talk about D lists that make slow sketches or kids crying <br /> <br /> their hearts to get BMW's 16th birthday. I bet if you like this show, I bet you love viva la Bami and jackass? I think my IQ dropped ten points to this show. <br /> <br /> This is a combination of two: jackass and animal planet <br /> <br /> Some people think it's a good combination. <br /> <br /> I think it's slow. <br /> <br /> And if you notice a lot like a jackass <br /> <br /> and a viva la Bam <br /> <br /> just a note, this show is terrible
