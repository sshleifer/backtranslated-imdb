Like his close contemporary "The Great Race" and "These Magnificent Men in the Flying Machines", I always associate this film in childhood, especially at the New Year. On New Year's Eve, I would visit my grandmother and after lunch, when the adults spoke, the kids watched a television, always having one of those three crazy movies. <br /> <br /> For this reason, I really wanted to celebrate "Monte Carlo or Bust", but I'm afraid I can't do it because the child is not that man's father. What I mean is that I see my mistakes too clearly and although I was tempted to smile from time to time, I really wanted all competitors to finish the race long before they actually did. <br /> <br /> Of course, it comes from stereotypes of nations and women as a weaker sex, and I did not care about one or two strangers, though light vulgaris, that occasionally appeared. Nonetheless, the majority, despite being outraged, simply do not sell enough film. Tony Curtis, in his "Yank Abroad" trial in the TV series "The Persuaders", seems too old to play a young galant, Terry Thomas just isn't dirty, Eric Sykes is an incredibly dirty thought that Lothario, when Gert Frobe is overwhelmed by Teuton, is just strange if you remember he was Bond's best villain Goldfinger. If something that comes out the best in English - Susan Hampshire is at least a "bright young thing", the gamin is as good as it is, and while Pete and Dud are looted to the leash, they offer the most amusing rigid upper lip army Types, though even the "Carry On" team did it so much better than "Carry On Up The Khyber Pass". <br /> <br /> Director Annakin strives to bring forth "Golden Resins" with a hit. erroneous whim of identity, speeding up camera shots, possible dramatic stunts and some mild romance, but there is no real tension for such a famous contest and anyway it seems like racing at the end looks like another swizz. <br /> <br /> In fact, I would have given her another character if they had been left under the alternative title "These great men in their youth football", but in fact the animated series "Wacky Races" is so much better.
