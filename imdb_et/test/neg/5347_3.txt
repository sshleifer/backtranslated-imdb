Chip Foose is an absolute genius and the final result of the projects is truly amazing. Co-hosts are doing a good job. I am particularly pleased to see the project "together". The end results are much better than when they left the mechanical and cosmetic development today. However, I must somewhat bother that the "projects" seem to be the property of the rich and / or famous property. It is too bad for those who are upgraded to afford it. Let's see, Vince Neill Motley Crew gets his car over his friend. Hi! If he (Neill) was a real friend, he would have paid him to restore his friend's car. What a joke! The second episode shows the middle, who seems to be very good to get his '56 caddy called Betsy. The 30+-year-old wife was behind it. The couple seemed to have no money. What a shame. I think the girls I like to have have to save for a day that never comes. I happen to have your own '53 Ford Project Chip. Does anyone choose me?
