I'm a big fan of surreal art, but this Bunuel movie (with some Dali ideas) stayed cold. Bunuel had a life-long intimidation against the Catholic Church and rejoiced in the stupid way of insulting the Catholics. This is one of the worst; almost like what to expect from an 18-year-old smart-aleck in the film class. The last minutes of a movie that have nothing else are the last nose-jump of religion. <br /> <br /> When you read this slow-paced, occasionally amusing 'scientists' movie, it's all about how church and society are guilty of sexual repression. If this is indeed a point, Bunuel will express it as possible at the roundabout. A central male is a disgusting brute who loves beating dogs and tapping blind people on the street and mentally making stent ads into strange sexual fantasies. Is this behavior a fault of the church (for breaking her love) or is she just a jerk? I am voting for the latter. I think Bunuel must have many personal hangups and have chosen the Catholics who blame. <br /> <br /> There are a few moments when you can cry: "Aha! Surreal!" bed, giraffe that falls out of the window (bad model), the man who crushes the feathers cushion, the woman who rinses the toilet when we look at the pictures of the stage (or mud well ... hard to say B / W). The rest is forgotten self-sensitivity. Unfortunately, during his career (Viridiana, discreet charm), Bunuel again began to pursue the same bogey men. If you want to see the surrealism on the screen, check out Jean Cocteau's early work.
