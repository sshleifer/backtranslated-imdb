RIPPER HANDS <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Mono <br /> <br /> Edward's Doctor (Eric Porter) uses a young fixed Freud analysis young girl (Angharad Rees) who is Jack Ripper's daughter and the same deadly ... <br /> <br /> Unlikely Hammer Horror, where a respectable societal figure takes on a beautiful young waif without luring so much scandal, even when she takes and a variety of deadly tools (broken mirrors, caps, etc.)! L.W. Davidson's scenario goes from one murderer to another, sacrificing the natural subtext of the material (Porter's apparent attraction to Rees) for the benefit of commercial melodrama, and the tone remains subdued at all times. Some tooth scenes are surprisingly vivid, even for Hammer, and they were cut from the original US release (despite MPAA R rating), although the full version is now available in home video. Porter and Rees give great performances, and the climax of St. Paul's Cathedral is a definite highlight, but the rest of the film is strange and unaffected. Director Peter Sasdy.
