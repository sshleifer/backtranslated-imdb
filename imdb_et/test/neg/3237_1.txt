It is hard to believe that anyone could make such a big book and make such a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Imagine King King being recreated as an organ mill monkey and a Fay Wray part played by a young boy. How about Elton John as Rambo !!!! This film is even worse than the night-time transcription of the hunter's night. <br /> <br /> Using the title of Watchers and Dean Koontz, the makers of this movie should be the readers of this book to complain about fraud that required a sufficiently accurate adaptation of the book. <br /> <br /> Read the book, I've never talked to anyone who didn't like it. Another good book is David Baldach's winner.
