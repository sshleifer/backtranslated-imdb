A disturbing attack on the minds of the viewers. This is a varied Hindu and English mish-mash - badly done. The name bears over the seventies cast with several stars, which is the 2002 version. The story is taken from the 70s "Sunil Dutt / Reena Roy starrer -" Nagin "and visual effects (terrible experiment) from Matrix, Terminator 2, and Mission Impossible II. <br /> <br /> College Environment (Sunil Shetty, Akshaye Kumar, Manisha - College Children !!! ??? !!), Manisha Koirala is a victim who injures her due to two fatal attacks as a result of our joint efforts, as it turns out Manisha Cobra (Nag) snake born in this life as a girl and her companion from previous life, now is a superpowered-all-all-shape-assumption (Ichadhari Nag) - Munish Kohl, looking for her in this life.Manisha invites her to respect her violation and murder. <br /> <br /> This is where the madness of the mad killing begins, where the aving lover starts singing for each group of men with successive attempts with tricks and tricks, the effects are extremely cheap, computer-generated skeletons, morphing-bodies and bicycle stunts that fill the farce. <br /> <br /> Transfer to Naginis t also includes Raj Babbar, who plays a Catholic priest who gives temporary relief to our boys more faithfully the "multi-religion medallion (the original Nagin was only" Om "). Sunny Deol plays Manisha's love for his present life and supreme savior against all the mighty Munish Kohl. <br /> <br /> Music and songs are lower than average. <br /> <br /> Avoid if you do not do fancy cheap excitement.
