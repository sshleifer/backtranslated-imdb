Barney and friends are probably the worst kids I've ever seen. It teaches kids something, the songs are bright, it's not educating and the characters are just ordinary. I don't want those who hate the show. Frankly, I have seen more negative than positive comments for this exhibition. 75% of the values ​​are negative and some are really mature. This exhibition does not contain any educational value or educational material of age. The more reasons I don't want to show it are because they are clumsy plots, cheesy dialogues, terrible special effects and exhausting stories. In addition, he says you should eat junk food if you are sad and strangers are your friends. Saying that it is a "pre-school television model", as expressed by Yale scientists Dorothy and Jerome Singer, is a burden. They don't know what they're talking about. I'd never recommend Barney to anyone. The reason why some children cry or become addicted to junk is because it shows poisoning to the minds of children everywhere. For people (parents / children) looking for real pre-school material, contact Nick Jr. and see "Super Why!" instead of that. It is much better than that and five times the TV was nervous to put it in the "milk cake", but fortunately it took it away. I strongly urge everyone to keep this show as far away as possible. Parents, I suggest you keep your children as far away from this exhibition as possible. They will thank you later. <br /> <br /> LOWER LINE: Don't bother wasting your valuable time with this stupid exhibition. This is Utter Garbage. -10000000000000/10. Grade: Z. Avoid like a plague! <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading.
