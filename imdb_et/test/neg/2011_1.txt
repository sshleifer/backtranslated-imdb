... and it's a shame! Please make the sun rise and burn all copies of Dracula 3000. It must be the vampire of the new millennium WORST so far (I haven't seen REIGN IN DARKNESS yet, but they won't get much worse). Don't be fooled to be in the movie's cool H.R. Gigeresque cover. It's so bad, it's almost fun. I can't describe all the emotions that this movie created. I laughed at my ass, screamed on the screen, sat there dumb, nodding my head with disbelief, ... This movie is written everywhere "cheap and cheese". The best thing about this movie is open credits and opening shots, which are more or less okay with the two spacecraft CGI. But if Casper Van Dien sounds over, you will start to bury. Indeed, it all goes down quickly. <br /> <br /> The rescue field team finds an abandoned ship, Demeter, which seems to be in the capital. They enter it, closing their fate. This movie is primarily shameless with a low budget ALIEN rip-off mixed with vampires. As soon as the plot twisted, Erika Eleniaki's character, Aurora, was a robot. Coolio goes bad as a cup of smoking, 187 (pffff, code hood?!?!). Casper Van Dien's name is Captain Van Helsing (hahaha!) And he looks as good as Casper Van Dien. Udo Kier as Captain Varna, former Demeter Commander, is only shown on the screen and seems to have some difficulty reading his line automatically (poor Udo, what are you doing in this flick?). And then we have the Langley Kirkwood Census Orlock, one of the most pathetic and ridiculous Dracula, who is ever in love with the silver screen. Just look at her dress. Instead of some cool futuristic black suits or something like that, he wears a cheap old school Halloween suit. You thought Richard Roxburgh was not convincing when Dracula was in HIS? Then wait until you see Langley's performance! <br /> <br /> Set designers went over it. Demeter's interior looks like a cross from an oil tanker and an old steel factory decorated with terrible lights and colors like green, pink, blue and yellow. The master must forget that this film takes place in the year 3000 because the characters use weapons that look like a modern 0.45 magnet and "Prof" uses a non-automatic, floating wheelchair. You have to refute it to move. <br /> <br /> In addition to one dried body, some things and one break, there is no gore. And vampires and contact lenses look fake in hell. Add any flat, stupid and steep end to it: Humvee and Aurora are the only survivors. Instead of getting one final (bloody) show with Orlock, they lock in the control room. Then Aurora explains that before she upgraded her program and joined the drug, she was "Protheus 3.2 PB", in other words joyful. So he says, "Well, what are you waiting for?" Humvee answers "Don't have to talk to me twice. Come on, girl," she picks up and ... "BOOOOOOM !!!" The ship explodes and credits the roll. No sex scene, no Erika flashes her boobs, no bloody climax, ... Just another shot of reading Udo Kier on the monitor line and it's over. <br /> <br /> So this movie has to be seen by every bad-lover, but I have to warn them: it gets painful at times. And anyone who claims that VAN HELSING, UNDERWORLD, or even the CLAIM is the worst vampire film of the new millennium is obviously crazy, or just haven't seen Draculat 3000 yet.
