I can't express how bad this film was. First of all, the waste of some legendary stars, though they are quite old and quite convincing. Fred Astaire, I think he had to owe some big benefits because it was his last film. The script is confusing and the film seems terrible. I imagine that if I saw it back when it came out (1981), I would have thought it was decent. But seeing so many real good movies, it was one of the worst. The only real convincing thing in this confusion was the very young and cute sorting Alice Krige. The main young man tried to do the best, but was absolutely terrible. I wasn't sure how much it was about his lack of skills or the lack of an understandable script, but in both cases he was just bad. Don't look if you don't want to see a lot of old men scared.
