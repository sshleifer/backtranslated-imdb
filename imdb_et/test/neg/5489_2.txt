"Illuminati" has expanded the boundaries of mediocrity of John Turturro from another actor to a third course leader, writer, and producer. This movie was terrible. It is divorced and slides from scene to scene with little power or meaning associated with the main story line. <br /> <br /> We are offered a smorgasbord of fragmented scenes, each of which is not yet another for everyone. The only yarn that seems to be through them is that they happen in the lives of the members of the repertoire of the same theater. Few scenes that are important for the scene are so complex that it is often impossible to say whether a dialogue is a story or an actor who plays his rows inside the story. <br /> <br /> If this story were human, it would be schizophrenia with a multifunctional personality disorder. It couldn't decide whether it was a drama, a romance, a comedy, a tragedy, a sex farce or a theater parody. Turturro was inanimate and fascinating as Tuccio, an allegedly complicated and passionate writer whose game gets its great chance when the current show is to be canceled due to a managerial illness. Susan Sarandon gave a good result as an aging actor trying to attract Tuccio for her role. Unfortunately, he considered it necessary to go topless, which only shows that the hardware of the symbols of aging sex is much better for imagination. Christoher Walkin gave a joyful impression of a cosmic critic who is casting protests on cast members. Beverly D'Angelol and Ben Gazzara also had small roles. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie. 2. With the exception of Walken's vignette, there is not much to suggest, except that the dolls used for opening and closing Credits were phenomenally viable and beautiful. Avoid this movie like a plague that it is. <br /> <br />
