I generally loved Carry movies, but it's really terrible. There is very little laugh because the whole thing is so forced. There are many talents on the screen and some come better than others. June Whitfield, Kenneth Williams, Hatti Jaques and Peter Butterworth are good, but Barbara Windsor seems tired and Sid James is just sticky. Joan Sims comes out well, but usually for the wonderful Charles Hawtrey, it's just sad. If you think his career is sad, watching a movie is almost too frustrating. Homophobia is a nasty and very unpleasant experience. The set looks inexpensive and, unlike other films made in the series, the movie is very clearly set in England. The sea side is cold and there are few attempts to create illusions. It looks like it's cheap production. You'll be surprised how unhappy you look at it, especially if you love this series.
