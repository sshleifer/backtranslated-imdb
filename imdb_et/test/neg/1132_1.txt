Who gave these people money to make a movie? There was nothing funny there. The fact that the nose dog was more fun with this disease says it all. First, he has nothing to do with Christmas, it just took a name and counted all those people who liked Chevy Chase's original. They took Randy '' I have no talent, I'm just a greasy and sweaty pig 'Quaid (the only wrong thing in Part 1) and I made him a' movie '... His family has only a moor, but not' Are they not cute "but" does not touch me "moral. Tracking the shape of this dirt will help you hope that DIES will participate in it! They don't even bother to get the effects that ... when they come to the boat, the only thing that moves is the fake background ... when the Quaid's surface is in the water, which can be said with the illumination inside the studio. This movie was sexist (Uncle Nick), racist (Uncle Nick) and would never have been ... ever ... throwing money on a volcano would have been so much more usable. <br /> <br /> Well, I hope I got some of you ... No one warned me and now I'm scared of life Merry F * cking Christmas
