I can't believe absolutely positive about my colleagues' IMDb reviewers. All the praise for how this movie is "original" is like they've never seen a "circle" or millions of imitations that have come in ten years after this movie. And some of them say they are horror movies! I think not! "Shutter" is fine. Average, I would say. I give it to 5 out of 10, but it's not so original and big and "the most frightening thing I've ever seen", as one reviewer said. Tel-leeeze, people. It's easy. This is predictable. <br /> <br /> I swear when I see another ghost movie where the hero follows a ghost past to find out why he is so crazy and after them, yell. br /> <br /> "Original"? Leave me alone. You need to get out more. Or at least stop calling yourself "horror movie fans".
