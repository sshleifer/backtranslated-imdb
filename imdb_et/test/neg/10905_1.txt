I don't often write comments here, but I can't stand and let other people suffer this movie without trying to warn them at least. This movie is terrible and not because "I don't know what the director was trying to convey" or "I'm too stupid to understand the plot"; this movie is terrible thanks to bad direction, screen writing and display. This is the "trifecta" of making bad movements and the reason why the movie was video directly. He's trying to be something like "High Tension", "Hostel" and "TCSM", deleting some of these ideas, but it just doesn't work. I had no big expectations or even medium-sized expectations for the film, but I was still very disappointed. It might have been very good, nice setup and a good movie idea, but it was wasted.
