Sigh ... what can I say? <br /> <br /> Why is a terrible script like it first approved. It's not wrong if you have a complex plot, but it's not properly explained to the audience. <br /> <br /> For a woman to explain the plot through setbacks, it's bad bad bad. It's too bad for such close editing! This fancy editing will only appear on trailers. It reduces the overall look! <br /> <br /> And who are the Russian boys at the top of the movie? Who is the man being tortured? Is he a CIA? <br /> <br /> This movie didn't serve to release it in the theater. But it does not deserve to be produced first. It's fun for Hollywood.
