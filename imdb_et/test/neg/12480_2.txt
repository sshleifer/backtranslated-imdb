Lucio Fulci was famous for his Italian splatter film, mostly his undead films like Zombie or The Beyond. Here he drove black comedies, but there is only one problem: its nausea. I say this knowing that I like the City of the Walking Dead (which is gross, but doesn't like it). A compulsive gambler gets money for his habit, robbing ugly and deformed rich women, murdering them and stealing their money. The film makes this plan so easy. I think the women were too ugly to go to the bank so they always had cash in person. After murdering each other, I began to suspect what I've always heard of Fulci: he hated women. He must have. In any case, this film smells like it is not funny and Fulci should have been with giallo and supernatural zombie films. Avoid this movie at all costs.
