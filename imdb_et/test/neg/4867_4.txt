It all seemed pretty promising. The upcoming Presidential Adviser is designed for a number of murders because he is cast in a conspiracy in the White House. It marks the great Donald Sutherland among many capable players. But very few people have a good say. <br /> <br /> The whole thing was really deep. You can raise the idea that the President is too left with his ideas, and some in the government want him to die for the realization of these ideas. Conrad seems to be just wanting the country to lead his way, not the path of the chosen driver. <br /> <br /> But the action scenes had some logical holes - already mentioned sewers and elevators, and rather a random murder method - and the character of Linda Hamilton is absolutely endless. His "presidential my father" "deviation" was ridiculous - it would make the president about ten if it happened. Even worse was his predicted final scene with the bishop. <br /> <br /> They could have made a complicated, ingenious political thriller, but either a bottle or failed. They could have gone to the city with special effects, but they were wasted. They could have achieved so much more in general. It was hardly worth 1 pound that cost me.
