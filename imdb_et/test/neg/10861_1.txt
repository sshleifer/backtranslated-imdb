This is my first "terrible" rating that IMDb has ever had, and I couldn't think of that worthy movie. I was hoping to entertain the trash and find the trash bins of the most sad, bored. I found a movie that no one can obviously take care of, including its creator. <br /> <br /> "Hell Ride", directed, written and starred by Larry's "QT Friend's Friend", is a simple plot of a hidden treasure and key trio, two biker bands and a terrifying murder in 1976, which is still aveng. Larry seems to have fiercely decided not to say this story, focusing instead on putting on his admiration, the strange grimacing main character of situations where he can love women who pretend to be. He also has a dialog that contains enough terrible fires / metaphors to put the word "fire" alive. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hopper flees completely humiliated, others are not so happy. Sometimes they hit the road with their bikes, so Michael Madsen seems to be even more hurt because his high handles seem to add insult to the appearance of this film. There's a lot of silicon-reinforced nudity, but quite a bit of action and no humor, so it's a wonder what audience they meant. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the majority of people who are fans of the 60's biker movies watching this movie feel cheated. Make your preference and look at the actual thing instead.
