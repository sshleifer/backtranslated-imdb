It is a good plan to investigate the need for corporate power and the required public and private life. Robert Taylor has been headed by CEO Burl Ives as a substitute son who replaces him as a business manager. He sends him to England to negotiate an agreement where Taylor is both under the ethics and morals of men when he has dealt with it, and succeeds in falling in love with a refugee. He comes back to emtpy, having fulfilled his duty, but speaking his motives to English. She is trying to marry a refugee rather than a brother-in-law brother, and thus the attempt by Ivese begins to discriminate against a refugee as a suitable woman for the company's management. It could have been a gritter, a nastier, and a less romantic - the time spent on romance tends to move away from the points he tries to make from corporate ethics. <br /> <br /> In some way, costume art (unwanted) was nominated for the Oscar - all business suits and two women in the film are conservatively dressed - studio policy at work again without a doubt. <br /> <br /> But what is striking is the black and white CinemaScope cinematography, which is great - something worthy of Oscar nom. (This was MGM's first "Movie in Black and White"). <br /> <br /> Not as good as it could have been, but not terrible.
