I disagree with this stoner movie just because weed is also an appearance. I can't imagine it even when "stoner classic" approaches. It would be like calling the Singles a "grunge movie". The film is definitely a dull plot. Sometimes I wondered if the script was either dropped and mixed, or if they lost it completely and just tried to tighten it. Watching this movie reminded me that I was watching the children who were playing and the story up when they went. <br /> <br /> Characters are made of wood, the dialogue is taxed and the whole story seems to be completely disconnected. Who was killed? When? What? And this is how you behave when your friend overdoses? The perfect absence of emotions and leaving the reality. <br /> <br /> Whatever the drone guitar music that comes with each scene, enough! It was like looking at the open menu screen, where the same track endlessly in the background, does not move forward or backward. <br /> <br /> I watched and hoped that the plot would somehow fall into the order, and that the dialogue would improve or something that would somehow focus on this confusion on a cinematic film. After 112 minutes it never happened.
