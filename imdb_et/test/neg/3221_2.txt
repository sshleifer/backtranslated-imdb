One of my friends decided to rent this thing, happy that it wasn't my money. A story that might have been interesting has been completely wasted with incredibly bad behavior and terrible editing / management. Maybe it can become a classic thanks to all the strange overactive factors :) (for example, Gary Busey's character) All superfluous characters were actually the only thing that made this film a little interesting when they drew your attention (all obviously for the wrong reasons), where the film itself was in itself wrong failed. In short: wasting time and money <br /> <br /> 2/10
