I was expecting the film to move me, inspired me, shock me, somehow grieved me, but didn't interfere with any of my emotions. It just hit the end. No character seemed very unique or complicated, but they seemed to show their lines. I think it could have been a better film if the characters expressed more emotions. The only one who did and was credible was a veteran and he probably committed suicide to get out of the movie as soon as possible. It was a waste of talents, films, their time and mine. If there is a message or meaning or a genius in this story, it is definitely well hidden or I am very dense, which I doubt.
