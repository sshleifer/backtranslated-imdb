Great actors, good filming, a potentially interesting plot and should have been a good dialogue. Nothing else is good about this movie. Perhaps the writer or director thought they could make a thought provoking the film from irritating characters who are as deep as a cup of coffee. <br /> <br /> After 10 minutes, I didn't like Caroleen Feeney to portray Kim as much as it became annoying. Although Kim should be atypical, I'm not sure I would want to do physical violence to him. The first (many) odd things that happen are that Wes (David Strathairn) goes for about thirty seconds "I've lost $ 50.00" to "He stole $ 50". It was quite unlikely that he (Kim) could never access his wallet and he was not a master pocket - there was no rational reason to suspect him. Most people have lost / misplaced money, and that's exactly ... we lose it. The same goes for Kim later. All very unrealistic behavior in what should be (I think) to real people. The character of Kim was at least a BiPolar disorder. Wes had a massive inadequacy problem, Nancy was just bored and Matt was wrong (especially with music). In fact, I turned it off on about 2/3 of the way. However, to write a valid comment, I forced myself to rely on it again, hoping that there was something in this film. No, sorry, it was still bad. Make it a point to omit it.
