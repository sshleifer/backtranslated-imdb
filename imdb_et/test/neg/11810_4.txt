Ken Burns' baseball is a decent documentary ... it is a clear source of the game, a great image of the baseball years and the heroes. There are a lot of baseball fans in this movie ... that the film has several outstanding mistakes. <br /> <br /> 18 hours is just too long for human control. It is clear that Burns pulled out his film to fit his "nine inning" concept. It's not even tense for 18 hours ... the pace of each segment is slow, almost quiet ... music is always nostalgic and poor. Is baseball never exciting and fun? Why is every player and their achievements in the form of a tragedy? Speaking of the head, turn every pitch into an emotional heartbeat, baseball as a metaphor, baseball like Americana, baseball psychology and theology. It's syrup, mawkish drivel. Billy Crystal is here to sell us all the Yankee hockey that he sold us before. Ken Burns uses a national anthem as a series song song and manages to play "take me out of the ball" as many times as you could vomit. We get it, dude. <br /> <br /> It is clear that Burns is a neo-Hollywood faux-liberal, so he is likely to spend one-third of the Negro league ... these segments are spent yesterday white white is not as open as Kenny is today. Shame! He chides baseball in the thirties and forties, but doesn't realize that America was separated during those times! Burns falls above the head of Buck O'Neil, a former negro-league player, and drools over every film in which the elderly O'Neil waxes are poetic in their playing days. Nonsense ... <br /> <br /> Burns would have been better for adults to help them edit their creations. "Baseball" breezes like mushy, gushy, civil rights propaganda that is hidden in Americana. It is clear that Burns is not a baseball fan ... otherwise he would know that we look at the games to laugh and rejoice, not to cry and comfort soliloquies ... listen, Mr. Burns? Baseball isn't crying.
