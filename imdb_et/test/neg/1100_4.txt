Wicked Little Things (known in Australia as "zombies") is a rare find? a movie that allows one thing but gives another. This is one of the few genre films made for the European film Millennium Pictures, known for making a wide range of class B action films and thrillers, some of which are stars of Jean-Claude Van Damme. <br /> <br /> Karen Tunny and her two daughters, Sarah & Emma, ​​arrive at Addytown, Pennsylvania, to move into a large house that Karen's late husband acquired after finding the miners' actions in his aftermath. After arriving, they find that the house is very old and needs repairs. But the condition of the house is the least of their problems, because they discover that the area has a tendency to disappear. Karen is facing the owner of the area and ordered to go out. When the night falls, Tunnys explains what the reasons are: a group of zombie children who have been killed in a mine collapse in the area more than 85 years ago, come to kill everything that goes into the woods. With the help of Karen's neighbor, Karen is trying to stop the curse before she and her children become the next victim. <br /> <br /> I bought a movie on the DVD that had the meat eating zombies, but I ended up with one thing: the film is more like a ghost story than a normal zombief clap, with dead children being a curse that haunts the forest by taking revenge on something that night Moving around (though internal logic is somewhat faulty? kids can be dissatisfied only by sacrificing animals and being repelled by prisoners in the same way as garlic and mirrors repel vampires? Are these kids not supposed to be zombies?). The plot as such would not be a problem, and in fact it would be entertaining, but the main problem is that the manufacturers adjusted the script to make a zombie film, but lower their face with this effort. <br /> As such, a movie like a ghost story, but because of a bad script, it won't change anything but a completely routine effort. The greatest strength of the film is the actor whose casting gives better results than the film deserves. Particularly remarkable is Scout Taylor-Compton, who performs his role quite well? it is a shame that he will destroy his genre credit with a very bad result of HALLOWEEN's remake (or maybe it's just a Rob Zombie script).
