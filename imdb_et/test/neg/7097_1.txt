This is one fun flick. I suggest you rent it, buy a few quartz rums and invite the whole team for it. My favorite items were.1. the armed forces that were so choreographic that John Woo himself was jealous, .2. Wonderful special effects .3. Academy Award-winning actress and .4. The fact that every single gangsta movie seemed to be a bad scarface recognition. I mean, Master P, the godfather of a cube! This is a groundbreaking territory. And with a well-written dialogue that includes features such as "the only difference between you and me, I am alive and dead," this film is truly a masterpiece. Yeah, of course.
