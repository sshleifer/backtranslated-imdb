I know I have no idea how all the other teenagers were, but it does not reflect the people I knew and hung. And just in case you don't know if it's not .. we weren't pristine / clean cut / Pat Boone type teens. (If such a thing was ever !!!!) <br /> <br /> Look, I'm not saying the teenager is easy. Better, actually the best BEST movie of this time is "Fast Times at Ridgemont High". Now the kids I knew and were as realistic as they got back (and maybe now). <br /> <br /> It was a mess. It was a quick version of the Fast Times, and even then it didn't work for me. It was a few moments, but not enough to recommend it to me, or even to say that "this was how it was for teenagers in 1982". I couldn't relate to it. The leader girl (girls) didn't do anything for me, and if they really wanted to keep her virginity, they would have made that movie in that case. At the beginning of the 80s, the teen and young adults were left with a butt and a clean stapler.
