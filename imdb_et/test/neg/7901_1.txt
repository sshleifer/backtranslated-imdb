I gave Soul Plane the benefit of suspicion and thought it would actually have some comic value. I'm not black, but that doesn't mean I can't judge black comedy. I know this because I enjoy watching Wayans Brose, Good Times and other series. <br /> <br /> I've seen crap movies and im not easily rejected. As for Soul Plane, I don't even bother to finish it. Don't know if they were able to land the plane and I didn't care less. It would be unfair to say that I did not find some parts funny because I smiled, but I also laugh at Youtube videos of skaters who fall on their nuts, so it doesn't speak much. The men in the film were like a bunch of hornyheads during the mating season to look for when and wherever possible. And we do not know why all these stereotypes do not disappear. In summary: Soul Plane makes the Harold and Kumari series of godfather.
