The conversation about how Jan-Michael Vincent is lousy has made me foolish to visit the DTV in the mid-1990s. The child is traumatized when he sees a man with ice cream killed in the 1950s and grows up into a psychological ice cream (Clint Howard). Something happens and people disappear and stay on ice cream. Blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> Director Norman Apstein (credited as Paul Norman) made a career in pornography before and went back after that. You get this because all the murders are on the screen. And lean to cast a child as a fat child and wear a fat suit. Just throw a fat boy! There is also a scene in which Vincent reacts stoically to the group of escaped lions surrounding him. He was either completely drunk and was frightened for his life, or the filmmakers hit him "Am I really that low sunk?" full of shame. Despite being a low-budget trash, it had a few good names, including David Naughton, Olivia Hussey, David Warner, and HUMAN COURSE for their Doug Llewelyn. How can you make that eternal drilling that is beyond me.
