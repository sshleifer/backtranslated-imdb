I have to admit that many of the many thrillers I've seen have to be one of the worst. I was shocked to discover that the budget for this work was 1.5 million. When it started, I thought the opening sequence was pretty good, quite common for such a movie, but still pretty good. But as the film progressed, I began to feel clearly uncomfortable because of the lack of pace I saw, every sequence seemed like a feeling. The reason for this could be that the film is now boring to me, nothing but endless accusations that were confusing confusion and bad mood from time to time. Well ... after we had passed the lifetime of these scenes, we finally ended up ... all the songs, all the dances exhibitions about how the lack of imagination could completely destroy what might have been a good movie. In general, I found this film to be predictable and tedious, and I do not recommend this movie to anyone other than those I personally like, but if you have a few hours of waste and want to watch a thriller that is not even far scary, it's for you film.
