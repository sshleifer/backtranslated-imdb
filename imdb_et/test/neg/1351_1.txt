I really wish I had read everyone's review before watching the movie ... it was one of the most seen films. I was ready to leave the theater for 5 minutes; I should have followed my instincts. The film did not offer anything new or smart, it was boring and very clich√©. I was surprised to be led by a woman! The characters did not represent any woman I know they were bored, bitter and melodramatic. The film was unrealistic and depressing and a waste of time and money. And the actors saw tired, bad make-up and hair styling. It was recently compared to sex and the city movie; it wasn't even half good. My proposal, you can't see this movie!
