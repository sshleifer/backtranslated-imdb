When I first saw this movie, I said, "Hey, what the hell is a good movie, why not rent it?". So yes, I rented it and went home to see it. When I entered this DVD player, I was shocked. Another, it was naked, naked NUDE! Since I have no background in Mexican films, I saw it when I saw it. * GASP! Covering Virgo's Eyes, NOO * <br /> <br /> THIRD, probably insignificant, but in fact it's predictable that I didn't like movies because I don't seem to care if it's predictable if it's not the way above the top. Fourth, how Heidi and Kike reunited, so fun. <br /> <br /> LATEST how the movie ended. It was BAD, the end of BAD. How Mr Van der Linde's sudden approval of the mayor's election was because his daughter knew how to throw the party ... BLAH, Blah. I was hoping that it was not so easy to accept it, the director might be in a hurry. <br /> <br /> After all these bad things are full, good things come here. The film was really fun at some point, because Maribel was terrible for the kitchen and everything, Heidi's attitude, Valentina is literally poetic. What I really like was the song Valentina did with her girlfriend. That's all, and for other things I haven't mentioned, they were just that.
