And also a great start, a real quick start. It keeps you from longing and waiting. Unfortunately, high adrenaline dries quickly, but definitely after half the movie is over. <br /> <br /> And this is a shame, because this film really has good ideas and many of them are thoroughly studied. But it is also one of its mistakes. By studying too many things, it mixes with many things, so finally you're too confused to track some plot or sign. It is very dark and moody, but it doesn't help much if it is just jumping in the genre just to try to fit everything and all that story!
