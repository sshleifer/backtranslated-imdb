The film goes something like this: Run around, run around, kill someone, scare a lot, and one group worships "Get it together" or "Just relax!" Repeat this as many times as their stars are left. You can enjoy an empty, black screen between these things. They are not fast, but several seconds. I was still wondering what happened every time the film was wasted - yes, it happens more than once you can believe it. But this film takes it to the extreme. Every time the characters move the camera, it is bouncing, sometimes so much that you can't control or talk about what you're looking at. leads us to enlightenment: in some areas it is too dark, I think they are trying to feel like we are in a cave, but Helllloo ... I watch the movie here, it would be nice to look. <br /> <br /> Then there is an end. I screamed out loud: "Are you kidding me?!" (I also looked alone). Dick, stupid. I think the end was a purely effort on the people who caused this disaster to shock us after so much boredom so-called. "twisted". Really terrible. You have been warned.
