I saw an episode about living a minimum wage. It went as far as Oprah Winfrey appeared for this episode. It's bad enough that people are fighting over the end of the weekend. Then taking this hypocrisy to use the problem. I didn't appreciate him or his important second constant complaint all the time. Queston is how every person has the right to pay for their doctor? sure she shows that the bill is high but she paid the balance (from her pocket) after her "harrowing" experience. How many poor people have the privilege to pay their bills within 30 days. Instead, they starving and "robbing Peter to pay Paul". Complaints throughout the episode are not a modest thing for him. The movie and restaurant scene is terrible. Another privilege he has for poor people.
