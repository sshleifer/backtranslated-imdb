GOLD RAIDERS (1951) <br /> <br /> Unknown Western / Comedy with Three Stooges (including Shemp Howard, I've always been the "Third Stooge"), doing their usual schtick, and Directors are usually trustworthy Edward Bernds, who also did some of their funniest classic shorts - so someone has to wonder what went wrong? The most likely answer is that the one that worked with the 15-minute reelers was too much for a 55-minute feature film. Unlike many classic short themes, GOLD RAIDERS is not worth it yet. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 ****
