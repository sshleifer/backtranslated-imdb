I really want Hollywood to get new ideas and speed. Instead, they go around and create and create a completely good movie again. This movie is a terrible version of DeMille. Through this movie I said to myself, Huh ??? - What ???? - I don't remember that part. The only exciting thing about this movie is still the subtraction of the Red Sea. And in the Heston version it was much better than this version. Did anyone else see the atomic bomb or nuclear bomb cloud disappear and get out when the Red Sea was separated? I think I did. Anyway, I can - maybe - look at the last night. <br /> <br /> I want Hollywood to work on new ideas and themes for new movies. Instead of relocating old movies, they should have left enough. <br /> <br /> UPDATING: <br /> <br /> Well I looked at the last part. Did Moses make another copy of the ten commandments with his hand - or I saw things - please someone - send me an email and let me know. HORRIBLE
