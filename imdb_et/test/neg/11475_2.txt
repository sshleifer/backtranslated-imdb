This movie is not one of those films that are so bad that you get angry and crazy because it seems to be both your own ass and completely funny. It's just that this movie doesn't matter. There are no real jokes that will entertain you, you look 80 minutes, then turn it off. I bought it on a very budget DVD and I'm glad it isn't much worth it. It's not even one of those movies that is so bad that you can watch it with your friends when drunk / high and have a good paw. I didn't hate it like I hate some movies, but it's pretty boring and never needs to be invested. <br /> <br /> Only people who voted 10 in voting for this movie must be connected to it in some way, because I can't imagine that someone really likes this movie after little children
