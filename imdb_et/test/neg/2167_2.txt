"The Stories Of The Crapper" is gory, nasty, tasteless, offensive, low and scatological. But that's OK, I was ready to have my previous Troma experience. What I didn't produce is that it is also meaningless, sleepless and boring. Very few real anarchic views, such as the "Nuke'em High" class, remain intact; Instead, we get ENDLESS fart jokes (to the point where you start thinking about whether Lloyd Kaufman is going to go so far, thinking that adults find loud fun!) and the cynical, shameless exploitation of the viewer who essentially invests time and money to see the "movie" that even Kaufman himself felt it shouldn't have been released first. Oh yes, there is a lot of female nudity on display, but let's face it: the average porn movie probably offers a better story, higher product values, more fun humor, and above all a watch for this viewer than this cruelty. <br /> <br /> P.S: Kelly Powers AKA Suzi Lorraine (blonde lesbian student in "How to make your own movie") is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen.
