Unfortunately, Koontz seems dead to death without his work properly adjusted. Listens very closely to the original book, it seems until the production company has finished making money. All sets on the first half of the movie were carefully restored from the book - something that has been missing in many other Koontz films. In spite of other (numerous) downsides, I continued to observe great landscapes. Wrong. By the time the detectives appear in the explosive head of the book (in the book), the film's foundations are missing and one of the most alternating scenes in the book is destroyed. When the book offered a discovery of grace, a search and a boy's apartment ride, the film offers the back of the boys. <br /> <br /> Let's face it - Koontz writes without a budget because imagination is free. When Koontz's novel ever becomes a decent film, no one is going to watch it because they are so many, many, many times before they are shot. That's why Dean Konnz Frankenstein is just Frankenstien - if you had seen your job, if it was detained repeatedly, you would come out prematurely if it seemed once again!
