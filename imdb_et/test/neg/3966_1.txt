For those of you who have some nice words for this movie, I suspect that you didn't see it when it appeared in "Cast: The Clonus Horror." <br /> <br /> It was a terribly boring movie. It was left unmarked in at least three ways. It was not scary enough; it wasn't funny (though MST3K took care of it); and even in 1979 the plot was original. <br /> <br /> Previous candidates are "Resurrection of Zachary Wheeler" (1971). This is the same idea (clones as spare parts). The film is entertaining and it was fine. The second is "Sleeper" (1975). Yes, Woody Allen's movie. Remember the flat nose? And "Clones" (1973). The last two plots are not like Clonus as the first, but they predict Clonus. <br /> <br /> They are also many decades of fictional books that deal with the idea, although often the word "clone is not used."
