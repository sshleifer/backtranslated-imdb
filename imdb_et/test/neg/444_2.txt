God, it's a miracle. You can't finish a horror movie happily with an eternal family. Yes, yes. I was kind of an ambivalent final act. But my god. He did not have to kill the girl, he did not die, the ghost father appears by treatment (which does not make sense because his spirit would be freed after the killing of all the bad werewolves). What a junk junk. This is the worst horror movie I've seen for a long time, and I've been watching a lot of fear in movies. This is a blow for Landis and all other people in London werewolves in London. Blegh. I hope it destroyed any career where he is Julie Delphy. And CGI: New and chic back in 1997, but today it just seems like a drab compared to London's artistic prosthetics / makeup. Anyway, I'm ready, I hope I'm scared of some people. Take the original or its absence The Howling. Or, if it's not, see American Idol Reeruns. Just don't look at this confusion.
