This film is a clumsy mishmash of various ghost stories and temporary thriller conventions, none of them have fully understood and all were quite irritating. The script was perfect. Functional, ditto. The frightening FX was mostly ridiculous, except for one exquisite seat-jumper moment that frightened me, even though I saw it a mile away. Now explain to me why you need ghosts, AND black magic, and archaic ritual objects, and Count Crapula CG boogeymen, and psychological investigators, and family studies and Irish superstitions, and milk bottles that were left for supernatural beings, and possessed dolly, all in one in the movie? All you expect from a moment of fear, but this movie is flat, flat, flat.
