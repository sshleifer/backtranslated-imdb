What a shame. What a terrible shame. The table was set, the candles lit, the guests had arrived ... and then ... <br /> <br /> ... actually something. Just pretense. It could have been great, maybe not big, but it could have been very good. All the items were there, but at the end of the day when the bottle was empty: NO LIGHT! The way this happened is the mystery at the disposal of the director ... <br /> <br /> The story was quite bold, although it certainly needs significant work with possible multiple finishes to fix and tighten the story. a lot of characters (the only thing that was consistently and constantly and unnecessarily tense was cinematography, but I'm going to do it). But the direction was weak, acting just like that: _a-CTin-G_, having a heavy cheese side and a lot of ham, and then cinematography ... <br /> <br /> It was something to see! But only if you are in the film school "Film Art 101, how ever will you ever use a professional video camera". Of course, the student had slept through the introductory part of the lecture and heard only "... use a professional film camera ...", then blessed back to la la land when the sentence ended. <br /> <br /> What can I say; Amateur and the most terrible! I can only see the movie that was meant for Chick Flick because it should be sad, but then falls flat and just gets "sad" (as an excuse for the movie) ... so even those "chicks" do not fool it stupid! <br /> <br /> PS. I felt Miss Diazile bad. He's much better at his craft than what he promised, even though he was completely FULL. Actually, I know all of this movie except for the director and (you thought) a cinematographer! I say "1. Against the wall for them when the revolution comes!" OK, not really, after "it was just a movie" but maybe a good "tar and feathers and out of town" could be more satisfying or at least much more entertaining !!! <br /> <br /> TTFN :-(
