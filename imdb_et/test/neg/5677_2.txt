This show was an amazing, fresh and innovative idea in the 70s when it was first broadcast. The first 7 or 8 years were great, but after that things went down. By the year 1990, this show was not really funny anymore, and it continued to fall to a waste of modern time. <br /> <br /> It's really shameful how far this show has fallen. Writing is painfully bad, the performances are almost as bad - if not for the guest hosts' easy entertaining relaxation, this exhibition would probably not be in the air. I find it so hard to believe that the same creator who chose the original one also chose the next hacker. How can you recognize this shine and then see the suitability of replacing it with such mediocrity? I felt I had to respect the 2 stars for the original cast of respect, which made it show such great success. As of now, this show is just terrible. I can't believe it's still in the air.
