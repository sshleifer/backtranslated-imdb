The main word that comes to mind when considering this movie is "annoyed." This is a poor quality biography of one-time iconic performers. Definitely worth the better. <br /> <br /> Before I get into the biopsy of my thoughts, I have to say that I have two things I found. First of all, the actual fan materials and interviews were used in certain parts of the film, especially in the scenes depicting the first allegations of child torture. I think it contributed to a certain authenticity that was * serious * throughout the movie. The second was the sequence that depicted the treatment of Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley. I do not comment on whether I believe the marriage was disgraceful, but for many accounts it was communication and affection between the two sides. It really seemed in this movie; Flex Anderson and Krista Rael had enough chemistry to pull it out. These successful points are enough to keep the Mani away from the 1-star status. Very few actors saw people they had to portray, the most extraordinary of those who played Elizabeth Taylor, Janet Jackson and Diana Ross. The lack of Jackson's music was also a big loss. How can you effectively tell your story about your music? I understand that they could not guarantee it because it was low-budget and unauthorized production; however, it seems that if you can't see a man's music on the film, you can pack it and go home because you lose a vital part of your biography. /> <br /> This film character has also bothered me a bit. I do not claim that he was restless and perhaps had a few French fries whose value was a meal, but here he was depicted as being close to the mentally handicapped. I don't think Jackson, who was known to have been a cute businessman, would have been so naive as the adult world was working when he was ready in this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie was nothing shameful. Many lines or dialogues were either extremely bad, like Michael and Janet's "Tinkerbell" exchange, or meaningless, like Michael's 'Love Blanket' comments. Also, scriptwriters do not have the exact know-how. There was a lot of future events telegraph ("What could go wrong?") And it is very obvious that the themes and motifs are hacking in the movie (when I heard the word "believe" again.). This is what ultimately hobbled the movie as something that could be considered awesomely bad. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, if we are a few years or even a decade or three years old, Jackson will be removed from death, someone can bring his story to life more worth in movies. By this time, we may have a better perspective on our lives and someone can present a truly thoughtful study of who Michael Jackson really was and what he intended for the entertainment world. This very annoyed bioopia was not the film.
