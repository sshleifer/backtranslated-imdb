I watched this movie a couple of nights ago and it was terrible! <br /> <br /> Extremely long - though they managed to survive most of their lives! <br /> <br /> Honestly boring - the parts they contained were long and for some reasons the director decided to cut off some of the action and left much of the film inexplicable! <br /> <br /> Awfully inaccurate - the whole "mystical" side of this movie was a joke, and the last time I checked Gheng's Khan wasn't exactly a nice boy! <br /> <br /> Honestly acted - I found several characters that were hard to believe, they were very two-dimensional and incomplete and some depth! <br /> <br /> The film's cinematic film was a sustainable film. That's why I gave this movie a 2-star rating as a minimum! But if you want to look something nice, I would recommend buying a picture instead! All this movie was a terrible waste of my time and money! Please do yourself a favor and give it a mongolian turkey!
