Mr. "Uwe Fail" recaptures, changed the classic game cheaply. Poor performance; Poor targeting; Terrible adaptation; I mean, the Far-Cry game was fantastic, it was a real FPS game, cool guns and a lot of "point and shooting". There was nothing in the movie compared to the game. Well, we had a "point and shoot" thing, but ... I don't know how to explain it, but if you ever watched another "Uwe File" movie understand. If you do not believe me, go to the "Petition on the Internet" website and check one "Stop Uwe Bowl". <br /> <br /> This movie made my eyes bleed, someone must stop it once <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time.
