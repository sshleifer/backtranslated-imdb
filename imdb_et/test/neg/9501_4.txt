Underwoods silly story about a young man (Arquette) who convinces his friends that they should be Frank Sinatra Jr. (Nicholas) rob. The film is ridiculous, the direction is strange, the dialogues are in place and confused, the actors did not do it much fairly, Arquette is a tedious, Ian Nicholas was nonexistent, Macy was decent, but just because he was a pretty good actor and probably just tried not to get his best out of the project with a very embarrassing occurrence, he was at least acceptable. It's a stupid movie in my eyes, boring, not fun, just a movie that I wouldn't want for anyone. IMDb rating: 5.5, my rating: 4/10
