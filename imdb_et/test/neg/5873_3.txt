I bought this movie from a economical store. Six months ago, my friend told me when we were talking about the foolish movies we've seen. When I noticed the cartridge, I knew I had to do it. I looked at that night. I can say that it is very cheesy and inexpensive. . . It led me to that. I put it in and I laughed all the way. I knew Gregory (Ice Cream Man), but I didn't know her name and I didn't remember where I saw her. Later, when looking at Andy Griffith's exhibition, Clint Howard (Ice Cream Man) was extra, because he is a brother of Ron Howard (Opie Taylor). I saw the credit and I would. I turned to my mother, who also looked at the exhibition, and said, "It's an ice cream man!" He also cried. This movie is great, but only laugh and critical. This is a great example of a cheerful horror. If you are laughing and having fun with low budget movies, rent this video.
