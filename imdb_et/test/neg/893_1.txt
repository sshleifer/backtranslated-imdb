I've never seen the first three, but I know they're all better than ... trash. It's about a kid who throws a party. Wow. Sounds amazing (sarcasm). Is it? NOOO! It starts with a child who puts him in bed and wakes up by his mother. So, the boy pretends to be sick so he doesn't have to go to school. He goes to his uncle's house and rounds some people and throws a party. Looking at this trash, I didn't laugh. I can't imagine someone sitting and writing this dialogue to think: "Man, makes me think if they even had a script for this movie. I watched it knowing it would be bad, but usually watching a bad movie that makes I feel good because it makes me joke. It just got angry at me.
