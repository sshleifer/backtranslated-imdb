I think when people say it's beautifully filmed, they talk about the frogs' tasks and cooking. This does not necessarily mean a set that seems to consist of about three rooms that have no frames at all. It's all filmed too close too. <br /> <br /> I got sick of little boys holding Miu or hot wax with ants ... too Vietnamese spend all their time sitting down? Looking at a solid gross, at least, how this film depicts it - one close would have been a lot not ten or more. <br /> <br /> Then the second part will finally come ... chick flick girls from Vietnam who have the perfect beautiful rich man who will spend the whole day playing piano (He is cultured). Pretty maid steals her like banned green mango fruits. Deep. <br /> <br /> Except for some nice close ups, this film is brilliant. It's a kind of soap opera and dialogue. It's busy. How is it beautiful? The set looks absolutely fake. <br /> <br /> Don't make the mistake I made and rent it because someone suggested it. I had been waiting for beautiful shots in the Vietnamese coast or something when I heard it was a visual gem. I like foreign movies even prefer them. But this movie is stupid and boring. It leaves you irritated that something like that won the prizes.
