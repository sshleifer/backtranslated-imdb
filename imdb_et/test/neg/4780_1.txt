The frightening thing about the new leader Carter Smith's new horror movie "The Ruins" is a closing credit that lists comedian Ben Stiller as one of the leading producers. What was Stiller's way of thinking when he needed his indulgences in the cooler that was cursed by the curse of the cursed carnivore, which falls on and throws off his victims. The Oscar screenwriter Scott B. Smith's "Simple Plan", by adapting his best-selling novel, firmly adheres to the usual clich√©s and conventions of all the twenty-year-old frightening saws, where unscrupulous youngsters do everything but do not make any signs of craving for eating them. In this nihilistic way of thinking, there were not enough funny signs that we had another movie where American tourists are at risk simply because they are Americans. In addition, unlike really good horror films that explain why monsters need to eat, "ruins" do not provide explanations for the supernatural shenanigans of their evil vines. <br /> <br /> The structure of the "Shadows" resembles the 2006 horror film "The Tourist", where slippery South Americans trapped the tame American backpackers and cleaned them for their internal organs. Indeed, "Tourist" caused some legitimate excitement and chills. The "ruins" do not cause any excitement or chills. The malevolent mastiff that suddenly strikes our heroes in the camera is as close as the excitement. The rest of The Ruins lends another movie, "The Descent," great, 2006, chilling about one of a number of babes who penetrated into a nightmare experience when they got caves where the caves live. albino mutants with blood from murder. Also a few other films that were deliberately or unintentionally remembered. They are the 1968 Hammer's horror classics "The Lost Continent" on murderous vegetation, threatening innocent bystanders on the deserted ships and Roger Corman's "The Little Shop of Horrors" (1961) on the New York Flower Shop. man eats him in his shop .. <br /> <br /> "Ruins" opens up in a picturesque, sunny Mexico where four frolicking kids from American college, Eric (Shawn Ashmore "X-Men" movies), Stacy (Laura Ramsey, "The Covenant "), Jeff (Jonathan Tucker" Sleepers ") and Amy (Jena Malone" Pride & Prejudice ") offer their tequila-soaked spring break. Stacy loses a high earring in the motel pool, but helpful Teutonic, twenty tourists, Mathias (Joe Anderson, "Copy to Beethoven") recovers it, and the group includes her as her newest best friend. These people live at the party and have already been in contact with their friends with Greek tourists. Mathias talks to them about his despise, accompanied by a lovely archaeologist far from the Mayan pyramid, which is not listed in any guide. He offers them to take and accept. <br /> <br /> The first horror movie rule: if nobody knows where you are going, it would be advisable to avoid it. Since they have only one day left and have not done anything adventurous, our two couples, together with their Spanish-speaking Greek friend Dimtri (newcomer Dimitri Baveas), decide to follow Mathia and control the pyramid. They try to get in the bus to Mexico and look for a taxi to take their next trip. Cabbie looks at her card and warns her away. The second rule of horror movies: if natives warn you to steer clear, then clear. A sharp twenty dollar bill helps him change his mind and lets them out to his destination and then moves to the heartbeat. Soon, our heroes have found a mysterious Mayan pyramid covered with a bedrock that looks suspiciously like the Mississippi kudzu jungle variation as superstitious locals. They know that the pyramid is haunted and they kill Dimtri without fear when he tries to dispel his fears. The rest of the protagonists loot the safety of the pyramid while the paranoid natives surround them to escape them. Finally, the vines slip to heal and eat our heroes. Then the "ruins" become a "mistake", a recent and ridiculous sketchy of Ashley Judd, which deals with insects under the skin. Before that, our heroes carved each other pointlessly to pull the vine out of their skin. One particularly terrible scene shows that Americans are dragging the German man's legs to save his life. In comparison, the torture of the Spanish Inquisition stands out. <br /> <br /> "Ruins" is just another mess of grapes that have nothing to redeem.
