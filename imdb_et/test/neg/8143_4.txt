This film is perfect for inter-haired zombie lovers. this movie that can laugh about acting in horrible zombie action. It is said that I gave this 4 outta 10 for the strenuous cos horror to have a difficult genre to do. The bad points of this movie were as follows. <br /> <br /> #Bad sound #terrible sound and sound effects #realy bad consistency #heesy dialog #one all song played through the movie #stein does not work and I find one of the worst I saw at #rac at the moment and stole Simpsons Label <br /> <br /> Good # # Good Costumes # police officers seemed to be the best # actors with fewer rows or small roles seemed better to try #good <br /> <br /> I don't want a movie bad mouth, its funny to look at these bad points and i think this is what makes this movie OK. if it were better, I don't think it would be any difference, but it wouldn't be interesting to see how the same color that I believe they have improved over the last 7 years has been made.
