How does anyone get this version of the raw film after seeing the wonderful WATERLOO BRIDGE by Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor, to understand that it's not understandable. <br /> <br /> MAE CLARKE Myra is far from the role played by VIVIEN LEIGH remake. He plays a common American girl with a Brooklyn accent, and "Yes" answers are a bit jarring when a less coarse character is expected. DOUGLASS MONTGOMERY (an invoice for final credits if KENT DOUGLASS) is wildly unlikely when a soldier was beaten by him, no matter how many times he fires him. BETTE DAVIS has no role whatsoever. <br /> <br /> The duration of these melodramatic confrontations over the last 20 minutes of the movie is incredible (superfluous exaggerations) - even considering that it is a cruder story when the sound was only a few years old and quiet action was still a rage. <br /> <br /> Just terrible. And it will end suddenly when Clarke loses his life during the bombing of the bridge. End. <br /> <br /> It has no beautiful shades of the 1940 MGM remake, including the Pound Sterling. Instead, it is installed on low budget output values ​​(and I mean shoe string budgets) that don't have any nuances at all. And there's no scene in the code where Myra tells the aristocratic lady why she shouldn't marry her son Roy. He just says, "I chose it on the Waterloo Bridge." Up. There is nothing courage here. <br /> <br /> In summary: A one-time original is not the best version in any way. VIVIEN LEIGH and ROBERT TAYLOR are never surprised by the offer of Myra and Roy, who have worked fine with the 1940 film classics.
