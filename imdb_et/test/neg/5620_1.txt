Who wrote this flick? 15-year-old uninspired <br /> <br /> Maybe one child who wrote Columbine would have written. <br /> <br /> Totally pointless, not all funny, boooooooring ... <br /> <br /> In addition: French do not put their flag everywhere. You don't go to the French bank and don't see the tricolor flag as such. Even on Bastille's day. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against the bathroom. It's just that none of it is plausible or funny. Or an exotic or something like that. <br /> <br /> Ok, those who liked this flick will tell you that I must be fascist, so forget my comment.
