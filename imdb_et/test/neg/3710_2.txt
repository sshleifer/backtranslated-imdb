A terrible B-movie at best if video quality is similar to Dead Alive. I'm challenging someone who is "foreign" (James Cameron 1986). A movie fan to calculate how many times or almost all of the first two Alien movies were ripped to make this classic garbage. <br /> <br /> Cast members, like Lee Lee Ermey and Ray Wise, were the only two players with any talent, and Jack Jack was really terrible. I think they put him on his huge jaw. I was also annoyed that the only black man on John Toles-Bey must watch this movie and just wonder. Look at her sometime when she has made many interesting movies. <br /> <br /> But on this film: The script, as I said earlier, was a burst of aliens that had been transformed and turned into an underwater "thriller". It contained such features as "I have a bad feeling about it" and "Kill me" because one crew member is infected with one mutant and his stomach starts to make "alien hop" just before he jumps out of his stomach. The classic "get some!" Bill Paxton. We also have a bunch of navy primers that run through caves with creepy walls. Even the explosions of mutated creatures are very similar to the opening of aliens when they sail from the Navy in the "Aliens" movie. And the kicker is that some mutants spit the acid (unlike the acid). There are many more examples. So if you want to see this script well, look at the first two classics Alien and Aliens (with Sigourney Weaver). You have a more enjoyable time. <br /> <br /> The plot could have been interesting and better, if not confusing when intervening at the beginning of a movie and generally poor editing. The camera shots were pretty boring and, frankly, it wasn't very difficult to stop watching it and walk in the room to get snacks or watch email. Many interactions between symbols changed little or nothing at all and did not go any further than not. The whole team and Capt. I'm not even sure if the military are masters with complete control over nuclear facilities. In general, this simply shows that the background information is little studied, that the film is at least a bit respectful and there are many other similar examples (such as the depth of diving, etc.). <br /> <br /> Like terrible movies or a big fan of aliens and aliens, and you want to just laugh and shake your head, this movie can be for you. For me it goes back to the shelf ... permanently.
