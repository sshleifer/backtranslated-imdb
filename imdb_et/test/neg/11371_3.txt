Although not as bad as some movies (like the terrible "Atomic Twister"), "Meltdown" still relies on conventional misconceptions and inaccuracies about the nuclear industry to further develop its plot. I am currently studying nuclear technology for a Master's degree and it was easy to point out errors that would be apparent to all those involved in the industry. <br /> <br /> Driving with the wrong fears that a Chernobyl-style collapse might happen in an American factory, the film says that any collapse (even partial, according to one of the guest's commentators) would mean a disaster for the region. In fact, the partial melting of an American state plant does not pose a threat to the surrounding area when destroying the nuclear. Partial collapse occurred on Three Mile Island, and no radioactive material was released into the environment because the natural stability of the fuel and nuclear structure used in that country was associated with significant isolation. <br /> <br /> The security measures shown in the movie may have been part of the most distant movie. In every important strategic location - whether it is a power plant, a chemical company, a military base, something - you never see that employees react to talking to an alarm device when it is an unannounced exercise. This is especially true for a nuclear power plant where, after listening to an alarm, the reactors would be immediately SCRAMed, closing them. The SCRAMing can be done by pressing a button in the control room (you do not need the kernel core "in" mode as shown in the movie), and the nuclear fission chemistry prevents the core from returning power in about 9 hours after SCRAM. So, if this scenario is played in real life, attackers cannot cause a significant collapse. Theoretically, they can still cause some of the residual heat, when they come into contact with the core, but it would be almost impossible, given the numerous back-up systems of the plant - there are many individual backup pumps they are talking about. With regard to spent fuel pools, it may be possible to change the pools dirty Bomb, blowing them up, but it's much harder than just blasting truck parking near pools. The water is less than 18 feet of highly purified water. Water cannot become radioactive (radioactive vapor as they say in the film). Water-soluble particles can, but the water itself does not; thus a very thorough cleaning reason. So the only way to change the fuel park is to get a dirty bomb to get the fuel out of the water. This is not an easy task, because the water is very heavy and the pools are very thick with concrete walls. Explosives should be in the pool under the fuel (which is firmly attached). And there should be a lot of explosives, because the water is * very * difficult to move through the explosion. Even if this were to happen, the spent fuel is not very radioactive, and the explosion would not cause an almost as great death as mentioned in the film, especially given the small amount of radioactive material that would spread. <br /> <br /> From a basic film perspective, I grew a little tired of the style I used. Continuous fading in and out, sharp blacks and whites, and quick tracking and panic saw amateur. The characters were one-dimensional, especially those that were in the US government. I have problems with twisting in the film, but don't discuss it because it would be a big spoiler. <br /> <br /> Overall, 3/10
