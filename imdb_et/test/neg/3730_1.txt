At a time when you see and enjoy thousands of movies, Finning Minnesota is absolutely the worst (** big movie with A-list characters) I've ever seen. There is no bar. This movie fails on every level. It has been poorly photographed and edited. There are uninspired actors, such as actors who see their minds bored. Maybe just a collection of payroll accounts? And, worst of all, it seems that sewage words are written under the influence of some unpleasant substance, which is only found in the sewer. I can't even begin to understand how a writer / director would ever have found someone to fund this project, let alone attract any stars he made. I really wish I could take back the time I wasted on watching this garbage. If possible, I would have given this film a zero number. Better yet, negative number.
