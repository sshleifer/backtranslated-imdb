Unbelievable. "Philosophy". "Depth". Genius. "Masterpiece". People have had to see another "Oldboy" because what I have seen was a poorly written, poorly designed, offensive "Scratch", which, even ignoring the ridiculously violent scenes that make it unsuitable for the child, can barely satisfy the imagination and thirst for seven-year-old plot continuity. <br /> <br /> The "depth" of this unfortunate preparation was exhausted in a small wisdom, "Laugh and the whole world laughs with you, crying and finding yourself alone," a dull type of lucky cook that says a great author, be it Shakespeare or even more IMDb, Kurosawa, it would be garbage can be thrown away without a second thought. If this film had also landed, if we did not live in an age when a cheap shocking and perverse disgust is confused with what was previously called "great art". In short, yuck. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 100. But in no way to save this infantile failure of the value for money.
