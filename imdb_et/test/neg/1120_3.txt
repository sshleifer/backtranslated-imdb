Excuse me, Randy. I love my comedy, but in that case you really put a gilt Turkish egg. <br /> <br /> The piece was thinner than one layer of leather, which is more wood than the giant Redwood and I think the direction was not there. <br /> <br /> Certainly, it seemed pathetic attempts to pick up other films, jaws and European holidays, just two. <br /> <br /> When the memory serves me correctly, Eric Idle played Nat Lamp on a vacation of the same type, but much better. <br /> <br /> I was wondering if Chevy Chase and Beverley D'Angelo turned to this stage. If so, they certainly knew what they were doing when they turned their parts down. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, no one in Chevy and Beverley can do any better in his duties, as Griswolds and Randy Quaid made a great addition to them earlier in the movies. <br /> <br /> Randy Quaid would have had to give up her forthcoming Lampoon.
