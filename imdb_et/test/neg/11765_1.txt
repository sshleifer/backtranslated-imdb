This film is essentially "how" to be a well-connected pedophile. I am surprised that so many people - especially other gay men - have seen this movie and read the book, and no one has brought the fact that if Weber was not an influential photographer, he would be in prison by taking time to harass the child. Poor Peter Johnson. Weber took this poor, naive (albeit incredibly beautiful) teenager he found in a high school driver training camp in the western western part, bringing him home and taking thousands of homoerotic photographs, many of which were full-fledged acts, all through Johnson's teen years. It's not art. This is child abuse. And worse, Weber made a lot of money and poor Johnson has serious "problems" for the rest of his life. Weber's love for the boy is as horrible as his famous (and not so famous) people he knows when he tries to complete Johnson's "education". Creepy, and then just boring. The only redeeming thing you can say about the film is that it is an exciting study of self-deception. But I can't help but know why no one considered this effect "Chop Suey" (Weber's nickname for Johnson) himself.
