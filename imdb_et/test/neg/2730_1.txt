One of these piles was put on Wednesday afternoon when my mother was watching it. I can't get over anyone who basically makes a surprisingly high budget Hollywood flop ("CORE", where there are players like Luke Perry). If one budget is high, it means people think that making a SAME movie 2 years later with NO budget is going somewhere? I smiled for most of the movie because it was very similar (in fact I'm shocked that it's not in legal, but in television incitement) and how it was basically a CORE script that was just bad around, what if you've seen it " core, "you know why it is worse, it's funny because CORE was so bad that it was funny. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy laughing at really bad movies, this is your alley. The only thing I can say is that I want Luke Perry to have a career because he's not a terrible actor. He just lets terrible roles. Crappy, made for television films that only run on daytime television, is pretty much a step closer than 90210 to having a career.
