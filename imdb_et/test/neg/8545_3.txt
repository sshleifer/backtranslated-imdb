A terrifying city of disappointed men after God has been sanctified. Missing is an exciting and unpredictable story, and instead it is dull predictability, accompanied by obvious attempts by the public to manipulate the superficial pretense production and distribution team. This story came with a gentle soap opera as a sharp indie function that should have been. This happens when distributors try to find a wider audience (ridiculous scattered images of the Rio coast, etc.) at the expense of a story and characters. I really don't care what happened to any of the characters in this movie - they were all so two-dimensional. In short, the sad wastage that should have been exceptionally inspired by GOD'S NATURE. Boo!
