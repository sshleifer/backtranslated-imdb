I say one thing to Herman, the US: it's probably always playable to Minnesota audiences. I can't imagine there is another place in the world where a reference to Bemidji's quick life or a line like "I knew Iowa was something wrong" would put the house down. I really enjoyed the first hour. In principle, a few individual statesmen take out a personality advertisement and find their city where they are ready for female women (is it a gender-based word?). It's not progressive, definitely, but it's sorta charming. It is a pity that the filmmakers felt the need to deal with the influential sub-plot of the gold component and its violent spouse. All in all, it's just too amazing for you, but you need to give some props to a film that has the courage to give Kevin Chamberlin's son a naked love scene. I always praise the portrayal of people who do not meet the usual standards of beauty as sexual, caring people, but that is not enough to redeem Herman, USA. In paraphrasing Jello Biafra, it is a nostalgia for an age that has never existed.
