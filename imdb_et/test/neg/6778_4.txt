This movie describes a truly terrible event. But it all falls for the whole cast of bad performances. It is impossible to feel the emotions of almost every character, because all emotional scenes seem like parodies. For example, at the beginning of the movie, the character is hitting and you get a cliché in despair: "Do I do it, Sergeant?", "Yes, it's nothing" ", but it plays like a sketch of the Wayans Brothers movie (I don't know if they've made war movies yet ) or something that plays Leslie Nielsen. <br /> <br /> Sean Penn's sergeant reminds me of Al Bundy married children, while Fox is the biggest self-defeating cliché of good guys that you can imagine ... Thanks to God, She is crawling and smoking at that time. <br /> <br /> Her emotional "NOOOO !!!" is definitely more suitable for comedies like Back to The Future than the so-called serious movies like this one. <br /> <br /> for credit, some of the "main" scenes ... (without giving too much, where they actually do some terrible deeds) ... are well done and make us serious about the subject, but this is despite action, despite it.
