But that's not. The plot is not all that bad, the actors are not all terrible, so it should be decent. Instead, though, despite the good starting point, the plot simply pulls on and suffers a lot, "I can't believe he's so stupid" the moments that are often used in horror movies to keep things. It sometimes deceived me, following some of the leading decisions. It also took too long to get a good part of the movie. Assumption is high, but you can't spend more than half of the movie. Also ashamed because he got proper exposure during the release and hit right before the big Halloween season. Even if I feel it gets at least one step, if not more, maybe they can build something decent based on a strong general plot.
