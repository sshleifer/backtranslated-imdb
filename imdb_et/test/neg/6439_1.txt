I think this program is a load of garbage. All of them argue and shoot each other over the face and call it acting?! These people get a lot of money for this and most of them can't even save their lives. The story is also terrible, and after a few minutes of watching it, I'm bored with it. I like how Harry Hill takes mickey out of his TV show "TV Burp". weak joke "Princess and pea is not exactly Shakespeare?" it was in Sonia and Naomi's stitches. I don't see how it is funny. I think it is wasting everyone's money on their TV license so that it can be shown 4/5 days a week. Is there anything better than this?
