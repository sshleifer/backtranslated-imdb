I'm sorry to say, but I didn't enjoy the movie at all. It was just too boring. So boring that I couldn't watch the rest. It's not as interesting as Lion King or Aladdin. That's why I hate this foolish day because these days aren't exactly what they used to be. The movies that Disney has recently released are really suck! I miss the old days when they made good films like Lion King, Aladdin, Pocahontas, Cinderella, Aristocats and Robin Hood. This movie is really terrible. I really tried to interest my movie, but I just couldn't. I don't think I can recommend this movie to anyone. I would recommend the ones I mentioned above.
