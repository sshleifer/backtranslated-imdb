First of all I love Lucy. His TV show still makes me laugh. He was one of the greatest comedies ever to live with Chaplin and Keaton. But his action in this film is disappointing. He was too old and the lens gauze filters look like a London fog refugee. She couldn't sing, and her voice was so froggy that she was hitting every song. His dance days were long in the past. Just because you are a Lucy fan, do not shine the wrong, sad performance and sing this praise. I like to remind Lucy of my wonderful TV series (I Love Lucy) and pull the charity movie "Mame" on the terrible mess.
