I was one of the many fools who had paid for it in the theater, although I paid 4 bucks for matin√©e (before 18:00). <br /> <br /> The story of Remake was fear, CGI Morlocks were flat, Eloi were rastafarians to mimic today's fads (didn't think the chick was hot at all), killing the hero's modern girlfriend was somewhat cruel, generally just sad , a bad remake. I'll take Rod Taylor, Weena, and a fat-glowing eye-surfer who is attacking this time. In my opinion, many reviewers who like this terrible remake are young children who do not take into account the good taste or the true value of old classics, which are often not acknowledged by today's confused and ever-growing youngsters. <br /> <br /> When the 60s appeared (I saw it for the first time in the 70s for fun), it was quite impressive and still up. You don't have to have too much CGI in the movie to make it better. Too much of this seems fake. I can't say enough how frustrating it is that Morlocks looked and ran and jumped like they were in a child's video game. 3 stars out of 10.
