SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> A clich√©-robbed film that somehow makes the death penalty a statement of human dignity, although it tries to do the opposite. Washington is a paralyzed forensic officer who has suffered and wished to die in the last four years (apparently, he wrote his huge salesbook just a year ago, so it's not all desperation). He will arrange suicide with his doctor who will return in a week. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, it helps with serial numbers. He recruits a dwarf, I don't want to do it, but I'm just so good, police officer Jolie, and they're watching the jumps of impossible hints for very unlikely conclusions about moments. Hey, this old bolt means that a murderer has a millionaire woman in a steam tunnel in an old Woolworth building. Shyeah, right. It's ridiculous. But it is not smart enough to figure out that the doctor who is assisting him is a killer. <br /> <br /> When he can kill Washington (before the schedule), he has a change of heart and fights incredibly for his life. Cut a mandatory bad guy who starts shooting a good boy scene when the BANG gun goes off - but the bad guy didn't come! Well, the woman stepped out of the corner, she just hit her.
