This movie is bad. I saw a rated and unrated version. They are terrible! Now, I know it's a small budget, spiderman looting, but Spiderbabe isn't just a good bad. That's not funny! Not funny at all !! I wanted to laugh. I tried to laugh. But this movie lets me down. At least the unrated version has a lot of nudity to wait for. And it is me, because Mundae is not a beautiful woman. He is okay below the waist, but the way up leaves much to be desired. She looks good in her schoolgirl clothes. Please, if you need to look at this spiderbabe, rent it first. Rated or not, there is really no difference, they are so bad for me !!
