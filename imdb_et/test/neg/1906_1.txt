Did you really look at a bad movie and angry it? Even a movie that didn't have great expectations? Well I just rented the movie "Dead Line". This is the title of the "Interferencia" US video. Now I've seen a lot of bad movies and watched a lot of "B" titles, but it's in another league. It was put on the "Shelter" label, and anyone who rents many direct video films knows this label. If you rent one from there, you know what you get. A lot of marginal low budget horror, but usually still quite good. Not that. The action of the three leaders was bad. Even fast forwarding didn't help. The label line on the front of the box says, "In DePalma's physical culture tradition. It's worth comparing it with classic film. The only real comment is" The shouts you hear are real ".
