The holy crap, the start rose when the first fell off (good start). Then it goes downhill. You looked like you were watching TV and you are changing this teenage soap opera, Predator movie and some dirty detective shows. The first ten minutes of use of the signs are not related to each other until the last 45 minutes (the real characters of teenage soap operas and the actual story of the alien). <br /> <br /> Finally, the producers ended the money quickly and decided to end the film, so they decided to drop the doll into the city. <br /> <br /> PS-What do you do with crap cameras? magnified, can't say what's going on? Seriously, filmmakers make a good fight with scenes and do it where to fight.
