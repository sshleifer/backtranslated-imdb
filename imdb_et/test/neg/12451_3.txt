This is an adaptation of Edith Wharton's work, which is amazing to write. Unfortunately, this film never shakes the feel that these people of the 20th century film do not understand the repression and despair of the 19th century represented by Wharton's work. Ward and Dalton are not so bad, but Alicia Witt's wooden staging made me feel fast. He had to play the story with a restless element, but he stood like the whole movie and I never believed him out of my mouth. When he asks "Why can't I move you?" at the end of the movie I couldn't answer, but I said, "What I was thinking for the last hour and a half!"
