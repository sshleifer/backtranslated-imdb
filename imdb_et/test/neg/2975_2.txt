Okay, so I'm in Singapore and I would like to say it's time to end Singapore's stereotypes and make such films. Some actors / actors are actually talented, but unfortunately it wasn't shown much in the movie. I looked up when I looked at it, being pretty young at that time, my parents pulled me to see it. Frankly, I can say that I'm going to sleep. And there was this lofty western boy just on my nerves. In general, it is a boring film and a general waste of participants' talent. I've seen better Singapore movies than this. Chicken Rice War was good. However, I can't believe it is considered a better Singapore movie. Sorry, I don't recommend it.
