Some things just don't get dead. They just have to come more, whether we like it or not. I think some people want to win a dead horse. The first "Ghoulies" was a surprise and it was the first ever better film. The third film dealt with a more comical approach, and at that moment the small buggers began to overcome their greetings. I think someone there in Hollywood thought it was a brilliant idea to revive the franchise, but the result is probably fans of the previous records. </p> this. A stupid but fun score. Moves correctly. Some cheeses for those who love it. Some pretty good-packed sequences. He has a little more plot than others and, unlike II & III, they try to associate themselves with at least the original. <br /> <br /> Cons: Not nearly as fun as its predecessors. Although he has more plots than before, it's pretty ridiculous. Poor impact. The original Ghoulies appear only in rebounds and here they are replaced by two trolls that are not for any other purpose than comic relief. Speaking of comedy, all humor tests are flat. Is a direct sequel to the first film, but there are so many open ends. For example, I thought Jonathan was made with black magic after what was in the original? Not that it was impressive, but the direction of this film is particularly sharp. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: The first three "Ghoulies" movies are a bad film students dream. This fourth and so far final order (We hope) is a bit devastating. Of course, it's nice to be, but it's not just the same. Others are also low-budget, but the people involved put much more on them. See if you are perfect or want to see beautiful women in hidden gear. Otherwise, stay with the other three. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 2/5
