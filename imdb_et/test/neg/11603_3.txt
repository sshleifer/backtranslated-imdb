Perhaps Alfred Hitchcock's quasi-manager, who has been outright seen by the director, is linking Carole Lombard with Robert Montgomery as a couple who discovered the mistake, has canceled his marriage. Where do they really stand with each other? <br /> <br /> Contrary to what others say, there is another tense element here: the idea that these two unfortunate people can escape from each other, freely create some of them This is funny reading comments here, how unhappy Lombard Ann Smith in this movie plays because Montgomery's role is just as much a heel. He mannandles Anni, clicks at witnesses, briefly shocking clients - just a lawyer who gives a bad name to his profession. Of course, Ann is also the type of woman who keeps her husband out of the beating of a hostage within six days, highlighting things he did in Paris when he was 20 years old and had not yet met him. "I gave you that!" He says it would be great for him. <br /> <br /> David's canceled marriage is a chance to have some unlawful joy against his "mistress" before the knot is tied to good. For Ann, this is an attempt for premature sex that has to be discarded with a bottle of champagne, followed by expulsion from her apartment and life. <br /> <br /> Fever does not seem far from a tree, as Anne's mother is scandalized as an apopox when she learns what David was trying to pull, "Oh, poor child! Thanks to heaven, your father is dead!" <br /> <br /> This is a rare good line in this ridiculous, unlikely comedy. <br /> <br /> This can be called, for example, "marriage comedy", in which marriage bonds are challenged to be re-affirmed. It can also be called, for example, what Roger Ebert calls the "idiot plan" where the storyline depends on the main characters acting as idiots. Hitchcock seems to have a ridiculous American morale, but it can't really do anything more than a funny scene where the older couple is scandalous due to loud piping sound. <br /> <br /> Lombard died this year of release; it was his last film he saw. What a shame could not be better! He was also "My Man Godfreys" but so nice that you just didn't have to go with him. Here he plays with a smile that is not there, while the sadistic pieces of David are broken over and over again. Montgomery casts a lot of eyes like Groucho, a study that is insidious. <br /> <br /> The only true human dignity in this movie, which lasts for more than a few seconds, is Gene Raymond, David's legal partner, Jeff Custer, who plays for Ann and acts with honor and dignity. Raymond lowers his many reactions and even drunk the scene, all of which are well influenced. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER *** So a decent man is Jeff that Ann will stop him not fighting with David after he goes to confront, calling Custer a "piece of gel". Jeff leaves the scene leaving Ann and David with his future murder suicide. Here's one Custer who was able to kill the massacre! *** SPOILER END ***
