The film begins with a promising start, the use of images and simple short clips gives a bigger story, which usually requires a much larger budget than here. But he began to worry about me, as it continued, with another over-husky Max Payne-type voice over the film. I was hoping it was just an introduction to the story. <br /> <br /> The story is what really struck me and brought it to the movie. The idea that a scientist has created a virus that actually protects other cells that infect infections was an interesting scientific idea. Then the people who were the most bizarre were looking for a scientist and offered their human experiments, which made me think that it could be one very good little film. However, the introduction did not go well. <br /> <br /> It seemed that the film turned into recorded interviews by the four main characters of the film, the subjects. Although the performance was not great, it seemed that throughout the film there were many ways to develop character, and the recordings were quite good, with a diverse combination of characters. But they disappear through the film. They will not be used again after some short clips and I thought there was a missed opportunity to offer some great character development, reflecting them back, but it shouldn't have been. <br /> <br /> Images are increasingly becoming an integral part of the story, often repeating what is still happening. This disconnection and repetition is reflected in the annoying and annoying commentary. He began to read the words one after another. Short, meaningless phrases and not too important or interesting scientific rays. If there were anything to describe, four or five words would be used, it was too long, repetitive, round, loop, ... you get the idea. <br /> <br /> Now it would have been possible to reflect the confusion and character, slowly turning into his own thoughts, igniting food and lack of water. What he actually did was put me completely out and the film closing stages found that I didn't listen to some ramblings. <br /> <br /> Many times, the event finds that the camera shows all its symbols one after the other, which seems to be somewhere between confusion and thinking. From the same scene, the same scene has repetitive shots, for example, the sleepy character fades into black, then the sleeping character again disappears. Look, we know the character is sleeping, we know the time is over, please move on. In general, there are too many atmospheric cuts and long, hanging frames to fill the time. <br /> <br /> Operation was not bad and the characters were okay, but they weren't used and developed. When they were communicating, there were some real moments. For example, if one of them asks if they are hungry, looks at the camera and returns to the group, stops, looks at each other, turns back to the camera and says "No" slowly. It hit or two. Their dialogue was slow, shiny, or missing at all, or totally unnecessary, and it seemed that dialogue did not hit the spot in the middle. <br /> <br /> However, there were some good scenes, but they were really hard to find if you didn't look at them in isolation, and that's what this movie looks like. The film has been viewed as scenes and not a complete story. <br /> <br /> Nowhere is more than the main line. The characters are infected with a virus that has killed the animals that were created for them. We were told that it is developing in stages with something dramatic and so we are waiting for it. What we get is the characters who eat loads together, everyone throws together, the water that flows from their mouths in the unsteady streams, then everything goes to sleep, all the steps that really happen at the beginning of the movie. Then they all say "Good" together when asked how they are, and that's it. It's a virus, nothing else happens. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been so much more done, so much virus developed and it protected them from any kind of damage. It could have explored the serious change of these characters when it became infected and taken over, he could have developed these symbols, show them the decisions, and do things that bring back the character of the interviews. The end is not even confusing, intriguing or thought-provoking. It just shows something that happens, and it is, albeit with a long, drawn style of irritating voice over it. I really struggled with this movie and watched several press members who walked out (including one famous TV critic who left the first twenty minutes), I missed, but lost my time.
