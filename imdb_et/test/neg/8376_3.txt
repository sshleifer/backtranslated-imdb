Let me start by saying that I can't remember laughing during this comedy. From the opening scene, our protagonist Solo (Giovanni Ribisi) shows himself to be absorbed, weak and neurotic loser, unable to cope fully with the smallest responsibilities, such as balancing the checkbook, maintaining the word, or creating a single thought. I think we should lead her fragile vulnerability and rejoice her through a deep depression. I think we should sympathize if he stumbles through a lot of unpleasant things that seem to be fired by buying his dog, but in fact it brought his despicable nature. I didn't get the slightest hint at any point when Solo had ever had a redeeming character that became worrying when he could not feed his dog for a few days. No mankind's spark or conscience gave me the hope that he would ever realize that his life was so completely unhappy because he was self-absorbing, self-defeating low life. I didn't develop any connection with that character. He didn't seem to care, and so I didn't. I really wanted her knee protectors to stop at one point. <br /> <br /> The dog was not characteristic of the film. Just had to use, ignore, intimidate, abuse, crave and destroy the whim. So be warned. Although the "dog" is in the title, this movie is not a romantic comedy for dog lovers. <br /> <br /> Scott Can's role is fun and unbelievable as a superfluous friend. Don Cheadle is sincere and magnetic - I want to see him more on the screen. Mena Suvari was pleasantly repulsive. Lynn Collins played the "heart stripper" role well, but the character was simultaneously absurd and clich√©, not to mention the chemistry between him and Ribisi. <br /> <br /> Romantic? Hardly. Comedy? If you say so.
