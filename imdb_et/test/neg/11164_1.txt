I do not know what was worse, the viewers made the print or the stars of the film that look like cords. Do I believe this woman has raised this child for seven years and has never noticed that the child was a little blind? Do I believe that her mother, her father and her husband have never said that this child looks a little dark? Do I believe when the courts ordered the mother to see the adopted parents that Lisa Hartman had that face on her face when she told her that Christopher was half black! What! Was it real, do you think that. So not only grandmother and grandfather never saw it as stupid and stupid, but I think we should look surprised and say ... hmmmmm omg she's half black! Totally stupid movie, almost embarrassing even to watch it!
