Evil, which men did (1984), was one of the few regrettable films Charlie Bronson made in the 80s. Unlike most Cannon movies Charlie celebrated, it wasn't fun or fun. Charlie tortures and tortures people for more than one and a half hours. If you thought he was before Emotion, wait until you see it! <br /> <br /> In this one, Charlie goes to an unnamed Central American country and tells the public that anyone who intervenes with Chuck or his people must pay for the piper. It's not fun. It's not cheesy or campy, just brutal, sadistic and not good. <br /> <br /> I didn't like it. I don't love this movie. No suggestions because it is not worth it. Maybe if they didn't cut that damn. Be careful. <br /> <br /> Don't worry.
