I'm not a fan of the original book, but I was expecting a better adaptation than Natalie Portman's film, which I found terribly. This version is even worse. <br /> <br /> First of all, this script has very little pr. Gregory book. The entire George Boleyn sub-unit of sexuality has been completely eliminated, and in this version, George is just a bumpy change between his commitment and the Boleyn family and his commitment to the king. I thought the title of the book refers to Mary as the lesser known Boleyn sisters, but here it is used for Anne. <br /> <br /> Second, the script regularly targets the audience as a confession. Obviously, it is meant to give a bit of a modest story and explain their motives, but it is amateurish when it comes to implementation. <br /> <br /> On a bad script, the direction is amazingly bad. There are too many shots taken with a circular camera that is at best not too stable and worst worst. Several speeches are preliminary, as in the first sample. Henry's soft spot production values ​​are minimal. Costumes vary: some are copies of historical portraits and others come from some fancy imagination of the costume designer. And the king, the source of all power and favor, is often shown in ALONE. No delicate suitcases, no servant in the background - where are all the people? I am used to making Hollywood a fantasy of history, but I was looking forward to BBC production. Even if it's based on the wrong book, it's BAD.
