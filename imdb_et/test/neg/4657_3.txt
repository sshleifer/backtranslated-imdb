I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad. I'm surprised that someone took it seriously. The characters are one-dimensional, even good guys and especially bad guys. The only value is that it is as flat as it is funny. In fact, for me, it is an added benefit to have it delivered in the national park where I live, so seeing some local attractions on the big screen is a hoot. <br /> <br /> The main character is an off-duty cop, and makes a great point lecture for a good man that vigilante justice is not just a bad idea, it is against the law. Imagine how long it will last ... <br /> <br /> Most of the North California symbols are blown dried Hollywood cheese balls, as they have never been in the fight. The story is completely predictable. This movie is mature for MST-3K. CAMP only. I'm pretty forgiving the movie in general, but seeing the old positive reviews had to speak. It's a dog. I'll give him 3 out of 10 and then just laugh.
