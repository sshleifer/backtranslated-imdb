This series, made for Televisión Española (TVE), is basically a series of chapters in 1968, mostly in the eyes of the youngest son. <br /> <br /> Based on background historical events such as the May 1968 student uprising in France, the disintegrating Franco regime, the war in Vietnam, the rise of imperialism, and others that are specifically related to Spanish life at that moment, this series can be considered as easy to characterize foiblesides. compilation that is so obvious in such entertainment. <br /> <br /> In general, light veins, though not at certain points in time, which can be called dramatic, seem to be aimed at people about fifty people who can keep them, as they say, choose to ignore such events, or is busy with other things. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this series is Ana Duato's rat as her mother's mother, three children: she really plays the part of a housewife of all time, showing that the peculiar tendency of Spain, especially among women, promises all your thinking and deeds will advance your heart rate without using it for brain use. As we say in Spain, common sense is one of the least common senses. Imanol Arias offers very little, besides being a normal stereotypical policeman as in other TV series. In fact, he should not be trusted as an actor who is not in the television series. Its resources are too limited; however, his role as a working class household father is not at all bad. <br /> <br /> Not really recommended for other audiences, even Latin-American Spanish-speaking people: topics are too much related to a specific place in today's Spanish history, so if the viewer doesn't live here at this time, he will miss most of the references disappear. It is even likely that some situations that cause some Spanish smiles do not mean anything to other viewers.
