I hadn't seen it for many years. The act was as good as I started this time, I thought, "Great! Another movie I was wrong with as a foolish young man." But then the topic started to be clear and I felt the same way. <br /> <br /> It was Hollywood, the location of glamor; so the concept should not be a surprise. But this is such an abandoning concept that I feel like I should look in the shower after that. In short, he says that even physically ugly people can be beautiful to each other and even feel attractive. <br /> <br /> Dorothy McGuire is a home heroine. He seems to have been filmed with a minimal make-up. Robert Young is injured in war and fears. Her parents can't see her either. He seems to have all his faculties and partly the concepts of disability have expired. <br /> <br /> Herbert Marshall is a blind pianist. His character talks about abandoned tones and is all-knowing. <br /> <br /> The best result is given by Mildred Natwick as the title residence owner. He's bitter and bitter, but not ice. His story is much more interesting and plausible than McGuire and Young.
