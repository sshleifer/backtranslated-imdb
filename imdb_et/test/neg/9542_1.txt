Wow - this movie was very bad! Are you talking about a formulaic, typical film image? Watching this movie was like hitting my head repeatedly against a brick. Transitions tried to be cool but failed. Plot twisting ends where we find out who was a bad boy unexpected, but didn't know his monologue. Even then ... The size of this movie doesn't help. Are all these pictures necessary? My last complaint concerns the credibility of the film's pieces. Will PD really send an unmanned warehouse to a single officer, to the subway tunnel, or wherever the body can be found, if the location of the perplexes is unknown? And why romance ultimately seems to happen suddenly? It's like a writer tried to fit into any Hollywood clich√© he could have. Don't waste your time looking at it ... anything.
