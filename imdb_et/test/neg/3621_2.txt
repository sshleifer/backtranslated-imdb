Zoey 101 is basically about a girl named Zoey who goes to all boys boarding schools in the first year, where they integrate girls. This raw plot line, I admit, is a pretty good idea. Although this exhibition was meant for children, a five-year-old mistake may appear to be fatal. First of all, Zoey is a clich√© character, he is very popular, super attractive, super smart and there is nothing wrong with it; no girl is like that. The exhibition seems to have attracted attention to Jamie Lynn Spears and increased her fame. Dana, who appeared at the beginning of the first season, is just plain. I think he was probably the most realistic character of all of them, which is sad when Dana is never nice. Nicole is too peppy and works like a full head, but gets mysteriously straightened. Lola seems to be capable of her Emmy deserving of acting skill. Quinn should be super smart, and although he can create the most unrealistic things, he is also ready to be strange and he will never get anyone, even though he is as beautiful as smart, while Zoey, Lola and Nicole get the guys and they are all beautiful and beautiful. personality. Chase and Michael are very similar and sometimes even confused. Logan is unreally rich and gives out millions as they are dollars. No one's so rich. I have also noticed that every character in the exhibition means that Stacy girl who does nothing but acts nice to them. It's not funny! That means, and it just influences young girls to act perfectly for people. Finally, the school adds an unrealistic freezing of the cake, offering the students 5-star facilities such as a picturesque location, a sushi bar, a hot lounge with a free lounge, a pool and a jacuzzi, cinema and boys and girls. free to go to another sex dormitory. In most internatols, if the boy goes to the girls or vice versa, they would be expelled. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, Zoey 101 was poorly written and would have had to write a few more years.
