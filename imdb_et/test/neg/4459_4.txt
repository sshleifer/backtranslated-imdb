Although I had enjoyed Dracula's SATANILISED RITES (1974), I knew I wouldn't have to wait too much for my more frustrating predecessor! Certainly, Hammer Dracula (Marcus Hearn, who has heard CREEPING FLESH in 1973) is the least likely to call it the lowest in the studio!) The film really threatens to update my sales due to its full unity - and now the embarrassing date - the device was better suited to SATANIC RITES rather than that ... ... even if the truth has been said, it is still very preferable to Dracula 2000 (2000) or VAN HELSING (2004)! In spite of Christopher Lee's cinematic art, he still undoubtedly cuts a striking figure as a Undead vampire (even if he seems very little and inexplicably limited to one setting); Peter Cushing also gives his usual performance. The only other remarkable act in the film is what Christopher Neame (son of director Ronaldi) Johnny Alucard (!) - even if it's just because of the incredible hammy! Unfortunately, the two most well-known women (both horrible women) - Stephanie Beacham and Caroline Munro - do not get beyond their physical qualities. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is Dick's Bush (who had taken the blood from SATANI TOWER 1971) and the Hammer, as the DINOSAURS RULERER COUNTRY [1970] and TWINS OF EVIL [1971], but is probably the best known for his long-term cooperation for Ken Russell). a nice atmosphere throughout, especially during the three important sequences: transport-driving strikes (correctly Gothic) at first; a hysterical black mass sequence followed by a revival of Drakula; and the final confrontation between Lee and Cushing Van Helsinki.
