I thought "Scarecrow Gone Wild" is a boring slasher. Yes, it has some good points, but it is another flick rehash. The operations are both terrible and plots. <br /> <br /> The story comes from a legend about a live peacock on the ground. When initiation becomes crap and causes life in danger for the son, the scarecrow comes alive and starts killing. Sound familiar, right? It's derived from Scream, Friday the13th, Jeepeer Creepers, Corn of Children, what you call it! <br /> <br /> 'The wild wildfire' is as low as the average movie. Hardly a scary moment. Even the last scene is ridiculous! Unfortunately, we could still enjoy it as our journalist. But I prefer you look at something else. If you are not a big fan of bad and cheesy movies, off course. <br /> <br /> 4/10
