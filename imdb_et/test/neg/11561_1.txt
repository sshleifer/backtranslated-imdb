The robot holocaust is about flattened, the most pathetic attempt to make the post-apocalyptic movie I've seen. And I thought the Italians were the masters of the evil Mad Max wannabes. Some of these films, such as Escape 2000, are very brilliant compared to this poo piece. The plot is pointless? even if the narrator creates each scene. And the boy is dragging it. Scene after a scene with no interest. Special effects (and I use the word "special" loosely) consist of a sock puppet. Yes, that's right ?? Sock Dolls! Effective effect is debilitating. Angelika Jager is working on what I have ever seen. Sure, he's French or German or whatever ??? but the man is bad. I don't think about a positive thing about the film. So I'll stop there because ten sentences about this spam are about ten too many. <br /> <br /> But luckily I saw Robot in the MST3K version of the Holocaust. Some of the things that made the film so bad helped it to win the MST3K episode. During one season, the reefs come quickly and fiercely and hit their mark almost every time. In my MST3K rating scale, will I give this episode 4/5? look for it.
