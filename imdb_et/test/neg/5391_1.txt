I, like many others here, bought this movie on my local WM "Two for $ 11.00" cheaply-o bin. I love cheesy B horror and sci-fi movies, and it definitely fits into this category. Pretty much what everyone else said here is dead. Yes, it was bad, but it was expected. The "main" problem I had with this movie is that it was basically BORING. I mean a serious awakening-rama. Action was bad, costumes (K Mart Skeletor's clothing in 1982) were worse and editing was terrible. There is no consistency. Mr Skeletor will eventually die of any explosion, although he found several explosions throughout this time. I think the last one to pay for him. Apparently, the previous meetings with this "military" group (cough) paid for their horse. Even for a B movie, do yourself a favor and skip it. Only good will it serve me now to add it to my DVD collection. Hopefully, nobody knows when they watch my movie collection. Slightly down, big time.
