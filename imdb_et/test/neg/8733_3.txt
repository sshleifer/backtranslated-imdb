After his career as a romantic leader, ended in the late 1960s, Rock Hudson played in many different projects, including TV shows and fewer films. However, I believe that the "embryo" is his only referral to a mad scientist, and that is probably a good thing. I think he needed a job. <br /> <br /> Drive one blind and storm night, brilliant dr. Paul Holliston (Hudson) hits and injures Doberman, which he brings back to his lab. dwest Midwestern Basement). Then he succeeds in raising the dog's unborn puppy outside the womb, so of course he decides to do the same thing with the person. She raises Victoria (beautiful Barbara Carrera) to the fetus in the same way. Victoria is growing at an amazing pace and will soon flourish with a gorgeous young woman. <br /> <br /> Things are expected to go wrong. After the halcyon begins, Holliston's sister Martha (Diane Ladd) starts thinking about where the young woman came from and Victoria himself is showing signs of instability and violence. The final queue is one long drive straight from "Smokey and Bandit", followed by Victoria, who has been shockingly outdated for a few minutes, attacking the frantic Holliston, who is trying to destroy his malformation with an unborn child in vain. All this comes with striking tires, roaring engines, car fire and many sirens. The clamor that ends up with a lot of parameters that worked frantically with Victoria, while Holliston's mischief is unfortunate, is more work than creepy. <br /> <br /> Although this movie was made in 1976, this movie is dated. The only difference between this and many 1940s crazy scientists' films is that Hudson plays a leading role rather than Boris Karloff. Sets are pretty cheap and very obsolete for today's audiences as Hudson's reel-to-reel tape recorder is about the size of the fridge. Much of the activity takes place in a poorly lit laboratory. Hudson's dreams have a role to play, giving the impression that he is a truly washed film star, while Ladd and Carrera are much more plausible. Surprisingly, Roddy McDowall briefly appears as a chess player. <br /> <br /> Passport video transmission is very inferior. If you're nostalgic in 1976, look at it once to say you did. Otherwise, watch football or soap opera instead.
