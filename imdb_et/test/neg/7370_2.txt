It's really a shame to see so many talented people that have happened to be a waste of talent. The plot is a cliche. Leadership is too self-conscious and the characters are almost cartoons. One of the disappointing aspects of this film is the performance of Gerard Depardieu in English (this film was filmed at the same time in French and English). Although he is one of the best actors in the film, he gives the worst result. I have to say that Bianca Gervais comes very close ... <br /> <br /> In a more positive note, I have to say that the newcomer Juliette Gosselin is a great result in both versions. Unfortunately, the only good thing I can remember about this movie ... <br /> <br /> By the way, I have to apologize for not being a good English ...
