I had just finished reading the book and waited for the television adaptation that was sent on the Hallmark channel on Monday evening (5/30/05). The key to the whole book was a manifest that a man stole with steel teeth, but I looked for an hour (3/2) and I saw a man with steel teeth, but I never saw him steal a manifesto. I saw someone stealing some virus, but what did it do with the book? It is too bad because this film had great product values ​​and good light, but it is not an idea to convert a book into a movie (TV or film) so that the people reading the book would belong to the audience. They kept me for only an hour. I thought the book's assumption was great and what they did but was thrown out of the assumption. This book had a great McGuff (for paraphrasing Hitchcock), but they ignored it. And the titles said Forsyth was involved in production. They must definitely pay him a lot of money.
