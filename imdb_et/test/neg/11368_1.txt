It was the worst TV movie I've ever seen. The visuals were so dirty that it was dizzy. I hated continuous zooming and reduction, and frequent black and white to color switches. I also thought that the story was not understandable in any way, and it was another clich√© film whose hero was a bad man and some hostages. I could do a better movie than my own camera, why? I can keep it stable that the director couldn't. Over all the really worst I've ever seen, you thought Disney was bad? I didn't even bother to look at the whole thing because I'm sure I can guess this result and the visuals were the worst I've ever seen.
