Connery climbs on the Moore bonus train on the stink of this movie. First of all, the success of Bond was unsuccessful, this film further worsens the character of Bond, which puts him in the category of Inspectors widget. Get Smart It's Not. There are no styles here, but secondary actors who fill in cheap kits. It's a disgrace that Connery couldn't give in to this class, but it hasn't met. Everything here is mediocre, including Connery's bad toupee. Maybe if I had become snowy and would have chosen "Never Say Never Again" and "Howard The Duck", I would choose the former one. If you want a real James Bond, take the novel by Ian Flemming.
