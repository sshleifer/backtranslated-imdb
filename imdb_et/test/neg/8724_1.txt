This is the mini-series "Battlefield Earth". There are some exceptions to this, with the exception of all the catastrophic ingredients that condemn this film and follow the grave of the Turkish cemetery. These are both book adaptations with an endless number of pages written by the publisher and director (in which case they are the same person) who clearly do not know what they are doing. have both messian wannabe who are not really a hero (in this case played by a man who looks like Mark Hamill, but unfortunately this is not his power.) and a number of foolish bad guys who want to betray and confuse each other's life, they both contain stolen scenes from better productions and they are both cheap productions that try to watch some (often badly done) computer animation. Exceptions that make the whole thing worse is the terrible work done by a lighting man who does not even have the ability to turn on the light in his living room, the camera works for some reason, sometimes the "Battlefield Earth" mode is not inclined, but most of the time it is pancake a flat, extremely inexpensive and small ear kit that contains only sand painted at the ear that becomes very old very quickly. Because it occurs in almost every scene and the bad idea of ​​a costume designer is to try to emulate the "fifth element" of fashion madness by adding ever made silliest hats. Memorable moments to remember: 1. Every scene with guilds who look like MST3K observers, but foolish hats. 2. Irulan appears in a butterfly-dressed party (Why a butterfly?), Where were the parrots parked cleaner? 3. Paul is a stand-up comedian. 4. Baron Harkonnen, who is acting over the head, shouting "I, alive". 5. Every scene with the background, because it is more suitable for the foreground 6. Every scene where Fremen's counterfeit religious kermons are specially "life-style". 7. Battle scenes where the same guys are killed a few times and the same things explode over and over again. It's much more, but it's a 1000 word limit, so I'd better stop before I take it.
