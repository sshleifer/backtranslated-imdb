When Daphne Du Maurier had set up REBECCA in San Francisco in the 1950s, it could very well resemble Robert Wise's extremely unusual dagger. Valentina Cortese plays a concentration camp survivor who steals the identity of a dead woman and puts himself in the life of Richard Basehart (who also acts as the guardian of the dead woman's son) ... it is absurd and overwhelmed, but also topflight entertainment. Cortese is terrible, slowly decaying when she understands the mistake she made. Basehart is good as a bit more blissful ... even though the lighting half way makes him very dangerous. Fay Baker is a very good caregiver for Mrs Danvers. Wise is a good director and he keeps things in a pretty agile clip. He also undergoes classical control in a Cortese (or at least Cortese stunt) car.
