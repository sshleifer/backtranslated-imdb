This is one of those uncomfortable and lightly entertaining small movies that will try to please you more. However, like many others, this material is not strong enough to be successful for a few hours. <br /> <br /> The track is promising: three drawn queens go by bus through Outback in Sydney to Alice Springs. They get a lot of trouble - with homophobic locals, with the engine, with their past. <br /> <br /> The real problem is in dialogue. The wires are good (although Pearce's constant camping becomes tiring), but lumps and epitheliums feel forced where they are accidentally thrown away. The characters should not laugh at their gags. <br /> <br /> Elliott, the writer / director, also feels the need to bury joyfully disgusting costumes that are very high, such as so many cheap make-up. With self-confidence and the film itself, it seems to be very uncertain in itself.
