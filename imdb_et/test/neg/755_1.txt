In my opinion, this film was ridiculous - a bad dialogue. Who wrote the script - Keep your day's work. This is certainly not a godfather or Goodfellad. It's good if you want to be on the other side of the table - a bad choice of words. Some of the characters were clowns. But what do you expect from a low budget movie that doesn't have a name link.
