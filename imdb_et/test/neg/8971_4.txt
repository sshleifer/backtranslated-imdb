It looks very smooth and patronizing to a great extent. The whole plot is extremely forced - especially the "galanic" endeavor to destroy the college, and the moral confession (especially by the leading lady) starts a little bit. <br /> <br /> But there are one or two comic moments that help to ease boredom and dancing is quite fun (especially for alleged amateurs - ha, ha!) <br /> <br /> Shopkeeper and young man makes a great tap dance, were especially important. And I liked Peter Hayes' impressions of Charles Laughton and Ronald Coleman.
