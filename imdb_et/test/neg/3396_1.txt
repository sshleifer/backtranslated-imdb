This is my opinion of the film that is expressed in its dialogues. <br /> <br /> To be more serious, I can't say that this movie is a bad moment, but I didn't enjoy it either. First, I was just indifferent and could not recognize my minds in the monkey world. Although make-up is very realistic, constant shouting was irritating. Has the film become a monkey for cats and this is a cult film for me that is related to my affection. <br /> <br /> The second part is more interesting when talent and freshness are newcomers (Macdowell & Lambert), but I felt alienated: the whole story is in a large British mansion: no matter how luxurious it is, it was a prison for me. <br /> <br /> Ultimately it may be good to customize Burroughs' Tarzan story? I don't know, ever reading a book (or seeing Disney) :. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have no good time to remember so one view would be enough for me. <br /> <br /> I should have guessed my boredom after an endless freeze called "Overture" at the beginning ... What is it? Only the director knows this.
