OK if you are looking for a fun lesbian rum. This is not a movie If you are looking for a fun movie with a hot sociopathic character ("cruel intentions" or "wild things") This is not a movie if you are looking for a classic vampire lesbian seductrise movie. It's not a movie. <br /> <br /> However, if you are looking for an hour of your life, it is your movie. It is poorly written, poorly targeted, poorly rated, poorly filmed. It had bad special effects ... I mean very bad special effects. I think you can actually create the same special effects imovie lolis. <br /> <br /> It's really PRETTY BAD MOVIE. <br /> <br /> The actors were classic star-shaped beauties, but watch more porn stars. it strikes like a soft core of porn, but you never get money off and the actors all see your brain bored. "girl girl" scenes that suck btw were so lame that there was hardly worth mentioning. see youtube cos 'almost sex scenes', which is the only reason you would like to watch this movie and not even worth it. <br /> <br /> FUNDED MONEY AND TIME !!! Don't even take it up, look instead for "cruel intentions 2" - the same movie with no bad special effects, bad style, bad writing, bad dialogue and bad acting. in fact i could go look at it just now in my mind to clean up
