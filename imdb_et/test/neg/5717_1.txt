Corny and some really bad actions, but Golan-Globuse movie on the right par. I saw this movie in 1985 mainly because I liked the sword and witchcraft (what did I mean?). Arnold plays a high lord who tries to make sure that the old talisman is destroyed before it blows into the world.Brigitte Nielsen is the title holder who was then a Sly girl and a pretty bad actor. Women who can't act in low budget B movies. Brigitte cheeses, like Sonya and Arnold, act like Lord Kalidor. There's also Sandahl Bergman (who was in the original Conan movie Valeriana), where he plays the evil queen Gedren, the obvious camp for her Conan role. And then one of the most irritating child actors (ernie reyes), like Prince Tarn, who should have been hard hit and sent to bed. Some sword competitions are too bad, but music really sucks. Special effects are cheap and look like the 70s, like the explosion of an evil queen castle at the pinnacle of the movie. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a very low par film, but fans of b movie films might like it for their campines.
