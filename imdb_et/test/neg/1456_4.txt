Have you ever tried the kind of food your friend made and then said to himself, "Oh, it wasn't a good mix"? Well, so I felt like watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Many viewers remain very uncomfortable with this strange crime and very nervous comedy. Its almost like watching Mr Rogers playing a ruthless gangster, very weird. Some things just don't mix, and this movie clearly demonstrates it. <br /> <br /> There are some very good performances here, because Dean Stockwell, Mercedes Ruhle and Alec Baldwin are all great, but it doesn't do the balance and symmetry of the film. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Demme has done great work in films such as silence of Lambate and Philadelphia, but it does not seem to have this element.
