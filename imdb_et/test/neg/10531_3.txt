Steven Segal has made terrible movies, but it is probably one of the best because his career took diving about ten years ago. The cast is better than usual, and while the story and plot are totally funny, at least most of the action scenes are pretty good. <br /> <br /> The plot is probably one of the worst film history. Someone is killed because he stole money? Some types of mercenaries robbing the justice of the Supreme Court? Their goal is to change the judge to a prisoner so they can know where he has the money? Meanwhile, the filling chamber is full of trapped doors and false floors, and looks like Cirque Du Soleil's circus shows. <br /> <br /> Then there's a prison question. Here's Warden's gay, played by Tony Plana. All prisoners have their gang colors and characters, and the guards are clean for food and prison. Something like prisoners who fight and beat some guards when the guard keeps track. What happens? The Warden gives them a stern talk. He can punish them the next time. <br /> <br /> There are many moments in this movie that are suitable for a laugh. But Nia Peeples looks pretty good and Ja Rule tries to be a silver hero. Lots of fun watching prisoners all "do the right thing" and get armed so they can release the Supreme Judge from their captors. Regardless of how bad Half Past Dead may be, if you look at it, remember that this is just the best movie Steven Segal has been playing since Under Siege since 1992.
