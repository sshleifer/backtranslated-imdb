BAD study. Bad direction, poor performance, poor writing and f / x that teach you that you want to upgrade your computer before filming. This is the kind of clinging that you drunk in your basement when your father's camera was young when you were young. But definitely not showing it publicly if you're happy again? You wouldn't even see it. Avoid at all costs.
