Ah sci-fi channel. How often do you cheat me? Quite often, do you think you've ever shown good movies? OK, you have given me a great "heroes" and a pretty good "lost space", but these are a series and there is really something positive about the movie. Bad behavior, bad leadership, terrible characters and a low story, and that's just for beginners. I checked the director Allan A Goldstien and was not surprised to find something interesting about his curriculum vitae (in fact, I mean, it's a pseudo name). The four motorcycle spaces in the national park, if one of them is an accident that needs a parkman to save them only to get wild fire, is weak and predictable that you know every win before it happens. The leading man at Bryan Genesse is a park ranger so bad that it is terrible. Create as a hero in the footsteps of so many other martial arts men, this man makes Seagal and Van Damme look like De Nero. Supporting casting is a bit better, and before the end, one hope was that they would all put the fire on top of the film team. Avoid at all costs
