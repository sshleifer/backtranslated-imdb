The traveling couple (Horton and Hamilton) stumble upon the city of Gatlin, where children have killed adults and are always eager to kill as they are separated, and of course Peter Horton must save his wife from these tiring terrible stories of any king's best short stories. In the original story, the king was able to create tension and pull the personality of his characters, but all that has been produced, and all that is left, is a repetitive cage that is too predictable to be all that stopping. Likewise, the effective end that uses the story is a dumped end to end, which alters the overall impact. Some atmospheric and stylish management, but no plot to bring it back. Children are also convincingly convincing. <br /> <br /> 1/5 Matt Bronson
