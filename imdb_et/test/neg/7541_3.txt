Herman has made the North drama with his small voice and twisted off, but the formula falters in the two teenage criminals trying to get season tickets to Newcastle are swelling. <br /> <br /> Truancy, Juvenile Smoking and Drinking, Minor Sex, Teenage Abortion, School Bullying, Drug Abuse, Drug Abuse, Depression, Child Violence, Child Sexual Abuse, Shop Lunch, Household, Car Theft, Violent Attack and Armed Robbery . None of these issues has been studied, but it is a story of one unlikely situation for another. The film is not as sharp as Trainspotting, as it is the perfect Monty, or as a reflective time as a wonderland (from which it shamelessly steals music in a too manipulative manner). I suspect that no filmmaker is from Newcastle and has never experienced any movie references. I'm all for entertainment, and Herman's results show he is aware of the need to balance the social message with laughter and tears. He just says here in a very incredibly short time. <br /> <br /> The movie has a nice ending, but there are too many flat, banal moments to get there. Well-hit, not very well-behaved, and finally not reaching three important points: script, script, script.
