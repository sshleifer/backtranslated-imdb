I am very interested in animal children and I have read a lot of Edger Rice Burroughs' novels - but this terrible film was not interesting to me and I couldn't hesitate about all absurd, unrealistic scenes. I only managed to sit through the African part and John's first days in Scotland. Let's talk about "unreal" and "outrageous"! Actresses in ape suits seemed like extra big chisels than big monkeys (there is a difference). They did not move with the mercy that the wild animal would have. (For comparison, look at some of the best Apeside movies where they trained their participants in a simian way). Monkeys eat a lot of meat - not the common monkey practice familiar to me. I am an animal stranger, but the script did not change me against the monkeys. John Clayton found an expedition for large white hunters to be fully charicaturish. Clayton's parents were shipwrecked on the seashore, but somehow this is a very long trip along the river to reach the coast - give me a break! Let's talk about slow. Even people who think this is a great movie admit it is not a feature film. Far from it. He is trying to be a character lesson - unfortunately, a rather silly part dominates! I didn't read Burroughs' Tarzan books, but many of his other series - they were full of meaningful action and heroic purpose! This movie doesn't just exist.
