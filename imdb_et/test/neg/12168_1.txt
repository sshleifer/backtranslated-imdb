Please, if you have not tried to sit this garbage and consider viewing this flick / mini series - do yourself a favor and find something else. Teeth your teeth, start playing the cello, beat your dog - all you choose is the time to spend as you watch this spam. It's not a bad movie that you can get some couples out - it just sucks in every possible way. Just bored from start to finish. <br /> <br /> And for those animal lovers who feel that my comment is extremely sensitive - if your dog could speak, he would beg instead of beating if he suffered from viewing. it's a mess.
