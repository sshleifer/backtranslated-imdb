I had known Brad Linaweaver in the state of U in the early 1970s when he was an inspiring, inventive writer who I thought was heading for greater glory. <br /> <br /> That's why I rented this video. Well, well, Mr Linaweaver has not had time. I think that the pressure on maintenance makes higher aspirations costly. Another flower that has been blooming and has been wonderful in the summer. Amen. Nothing to say. And add something. A sad epitaph that is once a flourishing career, as stated above. But this is the price paid by the search for shadow without a solid foundation or goals in life. Because this film has no purpose, no purpose, and I told myself what happened to Brad's creativity, once with a brilliant genius? Past, neglect of past years has worsened his repeated bright mind.
