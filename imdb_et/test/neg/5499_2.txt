I've loved Tim Burton before. I loved the attacks of Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, and even Mars. But I hate this movie. In the beginning, the costume scenes were the ones that were badly done, the cunning things that previously interrupted the historical drama 25 years ago. Then there were all the scenes in the head that just left me cold, and that is something that should think about something. Yes, there were some nice trees and foggy nights, and the horse rider who jumped out of the tree was a nice special effect, but the whole movie was boring and pointless.
