Debra Winger's "Black Widow" in 1987 is much better. <br /> <br /> It's like a flat version, and Jane Seymour usually does it better. <br /> <br /> Chad Allen is also pretty poor in this. Just playing your usual role like a boring rebel child. <br /> <br /> Maybe both people from Dr Quinn would have been thrilled. <br /> <br /> When it is turned on, grab a copy of "Black Widow".
