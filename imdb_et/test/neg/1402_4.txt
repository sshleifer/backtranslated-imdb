I just finished this terribly depressing drama and realized that in the light of recent dramas like these, the only ones that can be considered abnormal are those who are least aware that life is nothing but tragic. I would suggest that this conclusion is unlikely to be defeatist and counterproductive, even if relationships and prospects such as those presented in this film are in fact somewhat justified. But instead, I realized that these films have made a tremendous gap in tragedy, when the same boring situations, the same stifling dysfunctional families and friendships still play in some way over and over again. Try to eliminate the earlier distortions of family life (much of it exists in the 1950s and earlier, so the aberrations of personality and character have been made so fine), replacing it rather than actually. In fact, what we are looking at is no longer dysfunctional, but in fact is a normal existence and a set of circumstances that have always existed at all times, but which we may be aware of before and thus we have ignored or at least denied. <br /> <br /> The only problem is that too many movies have tried to do it. And doing this in almost identical form. When I read the movie summary, I immediately thought of the "ice form". Watching the depressing lifelessness of the Travis family, which seemed to endure repetitive emotional wilting, I immediately recalled "American beauty". And in some cases, the relationship between parents and the middle child, Tim, pointed to similarities with 'Igby Goes Down'. "Imaginary Heroes" may be a novel experience, perhaps refreshing, which is considered to represent such a honest character, as has been said before, that there are no family films (which are thought to be idiotic since we were always idiotic). we've already seen relationships in movies like "ordinary people" back in the 1980s and go even further. But for the experienced viewer, these movies can offer something new. In fact, they have become a rather tired testimony of too many filmmakers who may try to do it with trauma and apathy that they can pack into one family (and here it extends to neighbors and friends). In fact, "Imaginary Heroes", which is the last in this genre (I think there have been enough films to accurately declare it "genre"), captures so many catastrophes and surprises in one family so that they can receive prizes for the daily chat show host. This is the story of a family who is being tested for the suicide of the oldest son, a gifted and adorned swimmer who hates the passion for sport. The youngest son knew this, his father was blinded and blinded by the quest for the competitiveness of the sons of all stars. And it is not clear that mother and sister had a lot of relationship with a young man. <br /> <br /> It is perceived to be no less entertaining (to some extent for those who find this material exhaustive in time) and performances are quite good, especially Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels. But I hope that in the future, filmmakers who want to add comments on distressing family relationships (which, incidentally or not always appear to be upper middle class white suburban families), offer something new in material and understandable terms. I see no difference (and therefore no purpose) otherwise.
