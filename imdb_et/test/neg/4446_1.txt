Wow. I thought Eskimo Limon was the most terrible and embarrassing primary film ever. But I forgot that Germany is always trying to compete. In this case, the well-known German film producer Bernd Eichinger was even worse. Harte Jungs is stupid, not credible and predictable, and above all: not funny. It is almost a tragedy that so many children went to see it in Germany (and I also fear Austria). <br /> <br /> Tobias Schenke, 19, looks too nice not to be a girlfriend and too mature to be 15, and her character is too stupid to be true. Schenke is trying to seriously believe that he does not know anything, but it does not help. Someone who looked at Al Bundy and took her too seriously seems to have made Harte Jungs. <br /> <br /> The best actors in the movie are Sissi Perlinger and Stefan Jürgens, who play Schenk's side of liberal parents. Perlinger and Jürgens are stand-up comics who aren't particularly talented in making a movie. Nevertheless, their performances are the best and most fun. <br /> <br /> Complete failure.
