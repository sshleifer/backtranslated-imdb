- Includes one spoiler, a market: ***** - <br /> <br /> Don't show yourself another remake of "Interview". Unfortunately, it does not even add to the difficulties of physical torture, as it does not add anything to the achievement of its predecessor in terms of arbitration, plot or performance. In fact, five fingers never reach near this level. <br /> <br /> What I was particularly painful to watch was not torture myself, but the way Martijn (Ryan Philippe) made his challenge. It seemed to me that Philippe had tried too hard to make his accent correct and made his impression of an amateur, which in turn dragged an otherwise excellent Colm Meaney performance. Phillipe's accent btw, far from anything near the Netherlands, sounded more like Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> In addition to Philippi's behavior (which, to my surprise, to the point of really ending), the Dutch landscape has been set back. (If these scenes were placed in Switzerland, they would have eaten cheese in mountainous areas with endless pasture pastures that wear expensive watches). Scenery set aside how these setbacks pushed the plot to not work for me at all. It made it serve as French french fries while driving and caused a fixed plane. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the movie became more enjoyable when Phillipe's behavior improved, but I couldn't be threatened every time and then scenes that were just unlikely. For example: <br /> <br /> ************ Start with a spoiler <br /> <br /> At some point (after days), a female terrorist is almost washed by Philippe. This is followed only by the brutal interruption of the second finger. Why give the boy a wash when he is tortured? And the breaking of this last finger seemed to be just the title of this valve anyway, I thought he was practically begging to peel it off. Didn't it make sense? <br /> <br /> ************ Final Spoiler <br /> <br /> What I finally looked at was Fishburn's performance, which once again proved that it is a brilliant actor but also had the best part of the script. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's just better to see another interview with other Matrix icons: Hugo Knitting. And if you do, I'm sure you won't find this review that is unpleasant. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> "Interview", 1998 www.imdb.com/ title / tt0120714 /
