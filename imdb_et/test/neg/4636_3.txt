Here is an example of the number 87 358 of Hollywood's anti-biblical prejudice that is so typical of them. <br /> <br /> Previously, Ray Liotta's husband has been married and women are being questioned about the household. The first interviewee is an old-fashioned look (dress, manners, speech), who immediately sets strict rules here, saying that "the day is two hours of the Bible." <br /> <br /> This is said, of course, to make it sound like reading the Bible is a worse punishment that you could inflict on someone, especially a child. Again, the Bible is equated with tired, average-minded people. This woman is, of course, immediately released. <br /> <br /> Of course, the liberal black woman (Whoopi Goldberg - who else?) is who hired and, voil√†, saves the day! <br /> <br /> Yawn.
