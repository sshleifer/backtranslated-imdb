Apparently I'm swimming against the glowing comments of this movie. I haven't seen it because I was 4 or 5 years old, but there is one thing I can clearly remember ... <br /> <br /> Bunyip was TERRIFIING !!! A fearful nightmare. With creepy music and little girl and kangaroo running / hopping your life ... <br /> <br /> Like a kid, I also remember animated Hobbit ... don't worry. Watercraft down? No blinking eyes. Dot and Kangaroo? It still haunts my dreams. And I have several friends of the same age who think it was tremendously horrible. Maybe we get a group rate of therapy. <br /> <br /> In short, one nice movie by then.
