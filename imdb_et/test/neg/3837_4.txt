Hopper has never been worse than he felt that this film deserves only a B-stage performance and he's pretty good. Outside Madsen and Hopper, this is terrible; you have seen better in the local high school. Sound and sometimes editing and camera pictures are the shallow ends of B-films. The style in which the peeping tom is is the films that are the greatest naked scenes I've ever seen. The script was probably an excellent 10-page view, but when it comes to a full-length movie, there's more holes in it, then Madsen's dead bodies. I have to say that Hopper, who has been wearing costume with Lobster costume, had a laugh at me, but I don't think it was an intention. Yes, there is a little style, and Hopper can always attract interest. But the interesting plot concept will never pay off, and you don't know why you're wasting that time.
