But at least this movie got what he was doing - sent to the Love Satellite, to be smiled by Mike, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot at Pearl Forrester's "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" "Soultaker" is one of those lost, forgotten films that are so bad that you are guaranteed to have later nightmares or depression. Although the film is not so old, it is still a very forgotten type of film. If the intelligent minds of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" had never been, the film does not just look like it has never been done, but the film would not be very enjoyable for our filmmakers. <br /> <br /> In real life: this movie is really bad. The Satellite of Love: This movie is great!
