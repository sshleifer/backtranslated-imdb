I was expecting "Born to Kill" to be an exciting and intense movie. Instead, Robert de Grasse has two good activities (one at the start and one at the end) and some wonderful atmospheric artists (usually the "glamor" operator and the surprising credit for the young man), but the rest of the film is quite boring. Lawrence Tierney undergoes a psychological blow, but it is a strictly numerical performance that poisoned mechanically what the spectator is waiting for him after "Dillinger" (overvalued film, but at least better). The character of Claire Trevor is too stupid and unmotivated to have an audience complaint, and this action (as it is) remains so purposeful in a cursed home in San Francisco where the film becomes claustrophobic, not really exciting. This is one of the films supported by the players - especially Elisha Cook, Jr. (whose character is homoerotic itching for Tierney is one of the few nuances of otherwise quite obvious script) and Isabel Jewell - steer away. It also doesn't help that almost half a century after Alfred Hitchcock's and Anthony Perkins's revolutionary psycho-killer image on Psycho's screen, Tierney is so big and obvious that he may also have "PSYCHO" tattooed on his forehead. There is also no indication in the film as to why "Deadlier as Male" was called the source collection, but maybe James Gunn made the female characters stronger and more interesting than in the movie. "Born to Kill" is a real disappointment for Robert Wise, who already had some high quality films under his belts and who are continuing his career as a star.
