This film was disappointing for at least one of two reasons. The break that was created disappeared from terrible action or lack of a driver. I don't know ... it was like a delicious mule that seemed tasty, but you continue to chew it, because once you tasted it very well. Like most thrillers, Hitchhiker still had a promise if he could not, if he had light eyes and ready to reduce the volume (I watched the movie alone ... in the dark) That's what. changing something else. It just ran out of gas and went on watching a movie-like style movie with one exception. It was probably -R.
