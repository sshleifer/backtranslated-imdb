When people say kids are annoying, I think my little cousins ​​may be annoying and I told LITTLE. These children turn to ten and are undoubtedly the most annoying children you will ever meet (in the movie). Let's start with blonde - Debbie - She's a girl's bitch, I think she's wearing mini skirts, she's got foolish hairs blonde and freckley red bunny like a face. He's acting so innocent. Next we have another child - Geek - who thinks he is so cool when he has his long-distance shot and used a muffler (mantle over the gun) and above all his evil gentle smile. The next child is quiet, which you don't care about. This movie frustrated me with the intelligence of children and the only pleasure I got was my cousin who was struck by them.
