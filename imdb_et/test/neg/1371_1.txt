Sorry, but this guy is not funny. I swear I've heard that 4-year-olds have come out with a better joke, some of them. For example, "Dee dee dee" is probably the worst fishing statement I've ever heard. It has no creativity at all and the fun of people with mental challenges, when you have reached the level of your exhibition, is incredibly dimmed by the part of Mencia. <br /> <br /> Although everyone compares this fool to Chappelle, there is no competition for them. First of all, they were very different. I think all Menica's exhibitions had, on average, only two short 5-minute skits between his 10-minute-long beads known to God. The Chappelles show was more like a skateboard comedy, with 2-4 skits that took the whole show. All chappelle made a brief summary of each sketch before and after. Here, Mencia fails even more. Would it make sense for Mencia to think she has a model that consists of the same standup comedy she talks about her standup specials? Does anyone really want to listen to a little George Lopez, who had begun Mencia for years before, but just pulled his faith beyond where he died? Snowflake in Hell. <br /> <br /> My idea, even if most people hate this guy for their race, I just can't stand for his race. Comedy Central was looking for a minority whom they could name as "controversial" brands and then leave it to follow the Chappelles Road. The problem is, this man made it very clear that he didn't want to be Chappelle. That's why he takes his dirty show down like a burning train to the ground. Does anyone want to see the same things every week for every week, I know for sure that I don't do hell. <br /> <br /> I can't tell Comedy Central. This idiot show has been made. Personally, after looking at my views, I don't know how he got his own exhibition. Jim Gafigan, Zach Galifinakis and so on are so much worth comics. In fact, everyone is better than this stupid.
