I'm not sure what the appeal of this movie is, but I couldn't find it. It's a really long, barely believable, hardly passionate conversation between three boys in one set. <br /> <br /> It doesn't move anywhere, the characters are just strange, the underlying plot is the same. This is a movie that has disappeared from me, definitely going out. <br /> <br /> One thing that keeps you out of the race is never an unrealized opportunity that it may have some point or meaningful peak, and the fact that all the excitement is in the deviant personalities, they acted quite reasonably. But you have to endure an endless dialogue, in many cases wishing the teacher just to close% * & * for a moment.
