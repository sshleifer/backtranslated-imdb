I am going to introduce myself as a big fan of JJL and not a Patrick fan. That's why I watched it to see her action and of course it was great. I don't think the director was enough for the film because there were many very bad choices: shooting corners, blocking, etc. When the director tried to make him "realistic", they failed and lost some good results. It almost always seemed that the camera was too static, too far from intense facial reactions - and as many times as it was dependent on the intimacy of the wires, the dialogue was slow and tired. It could have been easily resolved by changes in frames or camera angle. But I had the impression that the budget was too small and only one camera was used! I also had the impression that the scenes were shot several times and the energy from the actors was exhausted.
