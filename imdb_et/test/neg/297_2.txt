I looked for the first 15 minutes and I can say that no military staff were consulted. Judith Light's career (officer) has her hair behind her shoulders! One of the first officers to greet him when he walks to his medical facility is so overweight that his laptop pockets have a gap! No - this movie had no military advice. Even a former soldier could help here.
