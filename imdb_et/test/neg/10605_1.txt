OK, number one - this "movie" is a version of the '90s of the 1970s that nobody can remember! The number two-as soon as the movie started, I was confused, it was like I was walking the movie halfway! There were no plots! it was very annoying! A terrible wardrobe! Call me crazy, but I'm not just believing that a little skinny Omar Epps can push a big man without a gun and scare him! This is a ridiculous "plot". Sorry, but for me these days kids can't even put their pants on one leg at the same time, not to mention that they are trying some "evil, underground, killers". I went out of the theater and demanded and got my money back! I don't recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 12!
