"No one really knows how power came in. Not even the Lord's Book did record its beginning, but those who took it have always been hunting? The Ipswich families formed the Spirit Pact? Bla bla bla" intro, we see suddenly Take That. Or was it N'Synch? Maybe Backstreet Boys? Well, I don't know which one belongs to them, but one thing is certain: the descendants of Salem are a boy band. Can you separate them? I couldn't. If you can tell me what it is, I appreciate it very much. These boys and boys guys can see both the fucking and the damn? Seriously now. Is it a horror movie or a movie of teenie-boppers? It is sad that teenagers have been abducted (anyway weak) by the horror genre. And this is one of the teenagers I've seen so far. The film is visually sound, but the cast is so gentle, functional so terrible that it was a movie that ended the movie. As much as it was painful (boy and fashion models are rarely good actors), the absolute “stand-out” in this respect was the man who played Sebastian Stan. This guy is superfluous, where the film's history is the worst. I have rarely seen anyone making such annoying and stupid things in such a short time. What's even worse is that she has the most baby's face on the baby's face. I mean, it's a joke.
