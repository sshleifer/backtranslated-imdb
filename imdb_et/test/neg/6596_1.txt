Okay, first, I missed the first 15 minutes of the movie, so I missed the credit and stuff. When I finally got it, I was like "Who the fuck is this guy?". I learned that it was Flex like hours after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Flex didn't look like Michael Jackson. Not a bit. He couldn't dance to him or move as he did, the only thing he almost had was a voice. People commented on Elizabeth Taylor, but I can't really comment on it because I don't know much about her. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was just plain. Dialogue sucked. Cinematography - if it can be soaked. Heliriba sucked. Functional sucked. Yeah, even Flex ... I'm so upset. I didn't want to suck it. I'm so sad that Flex said he could go with it. But the whole thing looked like a dress. You know? It's like someone seemed to have been excluded from Joseph Jackson. <br /> <br /> Concert series are just miracles. Sorry, Flex can't dance like Michael. I mean, what the hell did VH1 mean? Makeup didn't fit even when Michael went through. For example, in the movie he was still in the dark when Neverland attacked for the first time. In real life, MJ was white in hell. There was some stupid delay in the color change of your skin. <br /> <br /> The film was not boring, it wasn't for me. It wasn't really anything. I was just so upset about everything that was wrong with it. I wanted to see how it came out and whether Flex could redeem itself. He doesn't really. The only part I found as a little interesting was all Lisa Marie's thing. When they fell in love. It was great. But I have to turn my face to kiss. Heh. And only two parts made me laugh. The first time they were cut from Michael with short hair, you know the Triller era, Michael, who has long currents from the hair of the Dangerous Era and who was still black! It was funny. The second time I smiled when they showed all of Michael's posters and memorabilia, but they had a Flex face instead! It was so funny. In general, this movie was a cheap trash. It was just a two-hour dress and could have been so much better. But no, VH1 is cheap. See if you like. But this movie is not funny given its ridiculousness. I came to feel angry about it. And when I found out it was Flex, I just started to be so bad. So ... see if you want.
