Oh, my God, I had waited so much for entertainment when I downloaded this movie because 1903 was one of my older film years, but it was amazing! The "plot", although I hesitate to call it, is about some elephant. It slowly leads to the platform and pushes to death. Lame. Even for a short film, the plot was too attentive to keep my attention. Edison is like the worst director. In addition, the elephant has no screen presence. And the end? Wow, it wasn't predictable at all. * sarcasm * <br /> <br /> Image quality is also terrible. You can hardly say what happens most of the time. The only positive thing about this film is that, unlike most other scary horror, it did not cause one another. Other than that, it's a complete waste of money and 1 minute of your life that you never get back.
