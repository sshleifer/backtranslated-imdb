It must be one of the weakest plots in the movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> But this is not all about this film. This film has the worst performance, writing, directing, special effects, it's the name - it's the worst. <br /> <br /> I suggest you spend your time with valuable movies and not waste your time on garbage. <br /> <br /> I agree with an earlier post that "women" were definitely men who were dressed, and it gave me a smile, I continued to try to figure out if they were obvious or when they were actually trying to be sexy women. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie doesn't have much to look at! <br /> <br /> In summary: terrible action, horrible script, terrible idea of ​​the movie. An hour and a half of my life I want back to the right!
