This movie could have been great. That is not my opinion. The story is fragmented, the editor does not seem to be able to choose the style and simplicity of Guy Ritchie's narration. Great emphasis is placed on excessive violence, including torture. Too much when you ask me. The characters are very low and stereotypical, I would have liked to see a deeper depth there. It is difficult to identify the main character. As a result, the film as a whole remains low. <br /> <br /> The film says that it gives the spectator a British criminal subclass, especially the Essex subclass. Football hooligans, steroids, cocaine, heroine and violence, lots and lots of violence. Violence from Paranoia and General Fear. In this movie, no one seems to be using his (or her) brain to look at clothes. As I said, there is not much plot and storytelling leaves much to be desired. <br /> <br /> If you're a 30-year-old man like gore and hardcore violence and think it's fun, it's a movie for you. If you are looking for a movie that is a real person with a well-developed story, relationship and depth, you can skip it.
