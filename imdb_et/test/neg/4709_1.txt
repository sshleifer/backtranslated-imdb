There should be some prosecution to punish the financing of producer scenarios. I think criminalizing some of the bad films can prevent more such idiotic movies. Of course, it has an interesting set of characters, but I don't think I've ever seen more cardboard performance in all its cast form, like this uniquely embarrassing piece. This director should be punished somehow for not bringing any of these people at least. So leaving is a topic, (not, they beat you with that head), that doesn't mean every character has to say their rows like NPR. Did I mention that this movie was dirty? Finally, I am not sure what the relation of your memories to the terminal bone cancer is, but I am reasonably sure if you were completely dead in the brain. This film is offensive to cancer patients, medical professionals and non-slowed people. And, finally, bumblebees fly because they produce enough lift for their mass, beating their wings like every other flying insect. I despise people who give absolutely wrong knowledge. Next time, do a little research before using the miraculous misconception as a prerequisite for the whole amazing film. TAKE YOUR JUSTES IN JESUS!
