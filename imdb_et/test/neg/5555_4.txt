Some may remember whether seeing Juno is a scene where Ellen Page is Dario Argento's favorite horror film. The character of Jason Bateman then asks if he has ever seen Herschel Gordon Lewis and has a copy of the film (forget what he is now) and shows it to him. At that time, I saw Juno that I had seen Suspiria and some Argento films, but not Lewis. Now I see that this is not just one of the Diablo Cody pop culture "in" references, but something that is actually character character and perhaps more subjectively based on how to judge them according to their taste. In other words, the reputation of Herschel Gordon Lewis will be preserved a few years after he stopped making his gore film - and that is no longer Schlock-Master. In fact, there is less. <br /> <br /> It is then interesting to take Argento as a benchmark because both filmmakers are approaching, at least for Gore Gore girls, and any Argento picture, for similar material. When Argento is exceptionally aware of its craft, getting a small story from the audience, it's under the power of the camera and the movement of music and style, Lewis takes a simple path to the audience that is immature in the script and (slightly) inconvenient. Gore Gore Girls shows a filmmaker who is not interested in their audience's entertainment in reality, such as a horror film, but a side show or a brothel. She can't handle the devil's trouble, she lights up like a movie, and there are ten of every possible smart or funny one-liner that's either stinky or too smart half or not smart enough. > <br /> That said, maybe this is the best thing to say about Gore Gore Girls, a mystery film detective (2nd class Sherlock Holmes man played by somewhat amusing Frank Kress) and newspaper reporter (dummie Amy Farrell )), investigating a series of murderous murderers, it works as a model for countless Troma-style images. Maybe it's a weak praise, and really the best thing to say is that Henny Youngman - "Get my wife, please!" There are a couple of scenes and each one steals them without having to try a lot. It is sad because it could be an image that could entertain badly at a bad level. But even with this score, you can smile more from embarrassing production, some of the actors (the man who plays the cop, my God) than enjoying some innocent joy. <br /> <br /> Even Gore itself is somewhat behind. First of all, it is believed that Lewis is at least achieving this goal by showing that women are murdered in crazy and malicious and exaggerated ways. But killing it will last longer than necessary; I don't want this shock in value because it's good. But to really "stay", there must be something else that shows that splitting the faces of women and losing eyes is good when you are 12 and see it as one of your first horror films. It changes, I dare say, bored. Such a "bold" movie is dangerously dull. <br /> <br /> It was Lewis' last film until 30 years later, apparently, a worthy swan song, followed by a movie he'd made earlier, retirement from a movie and a job at writing books on how to do business. But no experience he had come to this shows. It's not a failure, but it could have been, and it's just ... schlock. Take it or leave it.
