This movie is amazing. MGM took some of his best characters and played them in a movie that was usually charming Margaret O'Brien. Lionel Barrymore, Edward Arnold, and Lewis Stone star as three greedy old bachelors who live in the same home. Though they have accumulated wealth over the years, they have been selfish jerks. One of them has the idea of ​​donating some property to buy a good name (like Carnegie), but it turns out that the property they want to give is actually O'Brien. And because he is an orphan, he is volunteered to be his guardian so that they can give away their assets and look like big philanthropists. <br /> <br /> There is also a cozy sub-block that includes administrators - controlled by the wonderful character actor Henry Davenport. And since O'Brien is an Irishman (as evidenced by his outrageous accent), he and small people make up a large part of the plot. Frankly, I absolutely hated this part of the movie and wished it just fell off completely. Instead, the story of STILL might be about the sweet Margaret, which melts the middle hearts of old men - it would have worked. But ... "small people"?!? Sheesh! In general, the actors try very, but hard, but the plot's foolishness and the deadly serious way they tried, made me brighter. I noticed that many people liked this movie - I think I'm just an old hat! I found it hard to watch the movie.
