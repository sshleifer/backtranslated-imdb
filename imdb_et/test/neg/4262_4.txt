Amitabh and Jiah Khan had a great expectation at their press conferences, though critics and fans were fairly simple that ultimately it would drop a lot of hyped, Ram Gopal Verma plant product on their face. , in all probabilities! Why, because Jiah was so immature and childish, and Bacchan, guilty and insecure. they themselves did not know what the hell they were talking to the press, adhering to the label that some love stories could not be understood or some sort of garbage! Why is the name Nishabd? Ramu must refresh his knowledge of Sanskrit because Vidhu Vinod has to learn Mahabharata by marking a line, another brilliant flop of Eklavy! Compared to sweet hearts and Lolit, it is inevitable, because the plot of the plot should inspire them. but unfortunately, Ramu has hardly made any serious efforts to deepen his mind into the psychology and youth of aging. is the lolly pop sucking final figure of innocence? and, contrary to this childhood, the leg at the dining table with Vijay, which is Bacchan in this role, breaking the shameful laughter that is constantly following the palace? this girl is actually her seductive game, attracting the poor Vijay to think, she is in love with her. the legs are thin enough, and the fact that the water hose is placed through the legs is right. is it beyond any understanding of how a girl who arrives in a body house as a guest can be so harsh, dirty and overwhelming? and why is this stupid woman of hell played by Revath very well, though she wrote badly and characterized unrealistly, encourages her husband to dance sexually with a young girl? this part of Vijay, trying to somewhat refresh his humble life, is an absolute mess. because he seems to be happy when he is, a well-lived life and a hobby to restore. It reminds Blame of Rio, the older father and his young love, which Michael Caine played perfectly. Bacchan sees terribly near and everywhere Kevin spacey and Jeremy Irons looked embarrassing and beautiful, making young chicks somewhat attracted to older men, their charming person, compared to the young boys' vulnerability. their age. The only good thing about this movie is the green, sprawling areas, links and pleasant cinematography. this low film has no substance or even a wonderful example of emotions, drama, or even intriguing, turbulent sex, as it is in Lolitas, it's no wonder it has fallen on the face and had to stop under the screen in the first few weeks! next time, before copying such a theme from Hollywood, Ramu should work at home and Bacchan should think twice! you can't fool people all the time, Mr. Bacchan!
