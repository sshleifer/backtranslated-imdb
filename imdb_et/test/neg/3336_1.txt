French cinema sucks! With all these psychotropic visions, together with your god-am-cult cultured distinct attitude! Pestilence for understandable symbolic film language and waterproof chiffers! I don't want to understand that anymore! Léos Carax, have you ever thought that dialogue in film can be natural and lively? Maybe I'm too ordinary to understand you? Or would it have been your task to confirm all the French emperors in the world? Guillaume to be spit comes from your home palace. Deneuve, not in the picture, plays the flute: "Here I am, dear!" At this point I knew he was in the bath and we could see him soon. Don't get me wrong, I'm not proud and the incestous sex scene was the movie's tip. But it is in Berlin, saying "epithets", which means something "être-peut-être", snobistic, self-satisfied and worst, often in French films, which I can say! Another example: she's beautiful and deliberate looking at her in the mirror, combing her hair and her wild beard, dirty young guru penetrating into space, breathing shouting, "No escape, no escape!" Forty years after existential Sartres and the consortium - what's new, exciting? My God, there is a woman and she loves you and admires you, what would be more natural to be happy with your life? And if you don't, please explain much better why! Born in French means you have to live in extravagant life, don't get it, is it a point?
