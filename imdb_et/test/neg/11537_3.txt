Princess Warrior is a fictional film that has a pretty thin plot - mainly two queens of the Queen's mother, one evil and one good death, fighting for throne control. A good sister is beaten so she flees to the Earth, where she looks naked naked in the middle of a t-shirt. The rest of the movie is basically one long chase, because the evil sister tries to find and kill the younger sister. But the younger sister, Bob, with a good heart DJ, is all complicated by the involvement of the police and the ignorance of a good sister in the practices and culture of the Earth. The older sister catches her younger sister several times, but she succeeds to escape and run again. Throughout this activity, there is a cult of women on the planet with some sort of space time to bring back a good sister. Unfortunately, a good part of this movie seems to be a rather boring car chase when they drive around in Los Angeles (and what was the sound effect when the police car crashed?) The film culminates in another physical struggle between nurses with predictable ending. <br /> <br /> You seem to borrow elements from Star Wars (light sails and the look of a girl's home planet on opening and following scenes), Dr. Who (a telephone cab as a means of transport)) and some costumes (a home-grown cult) could have been taken from the Star Trek episodes. <br /> <br /> ms. Dana Fredst (the evil sister of the movie) mentioned "endless (and boring) wet t-shirt competition in second user commentary. This is the longest wet T-shirt competition in cinema history. and I could not make it better. The only thing I would like to add is that music in this scene is just annoying. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors are quite up, but it fits the whole style of the movie. Vinnie and Vito players were too much for me - I just found them annoying. Ms Fredst (Curette) seemed to enjoy herself and did not take the whole thing too seriously, contrary to Sharon Lee Jones, who was acting well, but seemed to take it seriously. The whole police was portrayed as an agonizing idiot, probably adding a comic relief that is a bit unnecessary as the whole movie was quite comical. <br /> <br /> From a rating point of view, this film had a lot of wrong language; some topless women and others with little dressed straps but not enough skin to satisfy those who are looking for nudity; one sex scene depicted in a non-graphic artistic dream way; little violence - although there was a risk of violence, both the sword struggle and the shooting scenes were exaggerated and too campy "offensive", although it seemed that the actors were so much fun with it. <br /> <br /> Do I have to think about the names of the characters? Ovule (small egg), Curette (surgical instrument for encapsulation and cleaning), Exema (suspiciously similar to skin and pruritus), Bulemia (eating disorder with burning and cleaning) and Rickettsia (another disease)? In general, it is a bad, low budget, campy, sci-fi action movie, but it kept me entertained, though I need some drinks before that again.
