I rented this movie knowing it would be bad (I've only seen one good Disney sequel and it was game story 2), but it went a lot less than my expectations. I'm a die hard disney fan and I just don't believe in disney movies. For someone who did not grow up with the classics (whether looking at them when they came out or after they were born), this is a lovely story. I just feel the plot was pulled a little too much and was predictable. One of the things that most annoyed me the most was the voice of the ladies and the tramp. They were too high. While most of the comments say it is not so bad, I think that if you are a true Disney fan, you should not waste that time. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, Disney will do nothing more to any other class at any time.
