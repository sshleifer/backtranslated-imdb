Zoey 101 is such a stupid show. I don't know if it's because Jamie Lynn Spears is a sparkling star, but I just know the show sucks. It's about a girl and her brother who go to school. The jokes in this show are extremely dull and awkward, and I hate every character except Chase and Lola. Heck, jokes at this show are so strange that they make Jack Black look like Monty Python. This exhibition is undoubtedly one of Nickelodeon's worst examples, which is exactly where Avatar and Danny Phantom are ashamed of the two, and if this exhibition was a man of honor, it would be a shame. <br /> <br /> 1/10
