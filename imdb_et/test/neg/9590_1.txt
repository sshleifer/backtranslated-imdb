Jessica Lange was not a big actor (she became one), but she was so hot! I went to see "Sweet Dreams" when it came out because by that time Lange had become a big actor. It seemed like a wonderful story. And it's always exciting to see. <br /> <br /> I never went out of the movie faster. My wife admitted. <br /> <br /> When we got into the car, I turned to him and said, "If you had told me I'd get bored that Jessica Lange would take her clothes off, I would have told her I just missed Jessice Lange watching her clothes off! "How bad is it?
