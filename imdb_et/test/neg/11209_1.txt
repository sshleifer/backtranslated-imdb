Ask a thousand people what the greatest unintentional comedy of all time is, and they almost always tell you the ground of the battlefield or plan 9 from space. They're wrong. The American Ninja has beaten these two turkeys for a number of reasons, the least of which is a script that was not clearly understood. While I fully support the B-image industry in keeping slobs like Michael Dudikoff at work, it would have been a bit of a job for this product. <br /> <br /> For those who give the back of the rat, the following paragraphs will give you a significant portion of the plot. <br /> <br /> First of all, when we are given background information about the title hero, we are told its date of birth, next to relatives, parents, etc. , are all unknown. I don't know about you, but I hope that the US Army will take some more serious facts about finding its employees. They also manage to stick to the consistency of dates quite effectively, even though I don't remember which dates were twisted and when. This is actually one of the less obvious mistakes of the American Ninja. <br /> <br /> It has been mentioned earlier, but the general failure of many martial arts films is that when our heroes are facing a large number of antagonists, attack one by one. The latest films, like The Matrix Reloaded, violate this convention, but almost every 1980's film is screaming, "hey, why don't you attack at once?" Martial arts films tend to be much more impressive when fighting is more than one-on-one. <br /> <br /> The central assumption was originally a joke, but in the light of recent events where the US Army cannot crush the rebellious cell phone simply because they do not delegate specialists, it seems strange ironic. The Phillipino renegades steal weapons from the local division of the US Armed Forces to sell them to wealthy customers. Do not forget that this theft forces the military to give responsible or even responsible air rectal exams to local businessmen, an exciting film of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> Part of the movie, however, is climate fighting. When Joe and Jackson combine posing and fighting with art form, evil ninjas begin to explode for no apparent reason. I agree with one of the previous commentators that this movie should have been called the Ninja Holocaust because I am ready to contribute to at least three hundred ninja ninja biting this movie during the working hours. In addition, Black Star Ninja is starting to fight with rocket carriers, laser beams and all kinds of ridiculous tools that are not only badly thought out. You never see a laser beam effect that seems cheaper. <br /> <br /> What's best about this is that the film takes itself so seriously. When Joe meets his old mentor again, I dare not to laugh at the audience in a terrible dialogue. Not that I know any Ninjitsu modern practitioner, but on the logical side of my imagination it is hard to believe that they have spoken at any time in their history. During this mentoring I assume that the old man will tell Joe that he must prove his masculinity by cutting his head off with a blunt plastic glove. <br /> <br /> In general, I gave the American ninja a 1. This is a special result in my system because it is reserved for the worst, most horrible, offensive films I've ever seen, or movies that make me laugh, even if not trying to try. The American Ninja is definitely the last example.
