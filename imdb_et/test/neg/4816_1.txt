This film is the worst person. You think manos is the worst movie? It's not even close to this garbage. I don't even know where to start. The "Russian" commander and rebellious chic are the most important "actors" of the film. They make Sister Troll 2 out like Meryl Streep. Goofy faces elegant factors when he believes in kung fu training. Then there is strange music during the jail break, a totally inappropriate scene of love, a stupid song that plays during a scene of love on the spot, a fake magic, the fact that everyone has a headband and / or bandanna part of a body that has ever been filmed and the worst thing ever to film was placed. This film deserves to be more well-known among the worst film fans. Definitely the worst film ever made.
