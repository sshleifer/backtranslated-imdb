I wish all mockumentary and horror spoofs would go away. If you are going to explore locality .. is it real. Enough of the bull ****. Same as horror and sci-fi ... if you are going to make a movie and it should be scary. I hate watching a horror film, and the character struggles for his life (or runs or whatever .. their lives are at stake) and they are breaking fun. It never happens. Where are all the good leaders missing? I think the horror and sci-fi has actually fallen since the 1970s. I have been for a long time when the scary was scary ... this "scary movie" is for birds. This film is also for birds. If you really want to see good research or talk seriously here, don't wait for this video.
