When I was younger (oh about 2), I first looked at Barney and liked it. But then I had no brain. And now I look back and see what the terrible exhibition "Barney" really is: First of all, this exhibition is horrible. The main character, Barney, is a terrible 9-foot spoken, purple dinosaur that teaches 13-year-olds "imagination ...." (* shudders *) BJ (I know what your thought is about your name.) Is smaller, but creepy yellow dinosaur that is "supposudly" cooled. But in fact it is exactly the opposite. After watching some episodes where B.J. buggy drumming his slightly turned back cover and making a few funny jokes, I wanted to scream. Baby Bop-oh-oh-god! (* Vomiting *) oh-oh-oh-anyway Baby Bop is the worst idea for EVER. He is a green triceratops (a dinosaur) with a yellow blanket. His comments on "hee-hee-hee" and Barney's praise for the "super-deeee-doop" make it difficult to sit every episode because a seven-grade student gets to know the shapes and ways. <br /> <br /> And this, my friend, makes this exhibition really terrible.
