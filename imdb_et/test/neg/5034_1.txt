Well, this decade after the release of this movie and the sands of time have not improved a bit, then, like other comments, Aussie filmmakers should have more drama than middle class jockeys who travel around the beautiful places of bicycles in the dialogue was not much. middle class is not funny or rich. There is also a mish mash of cast. Why does a young woman get married to a man who is old enough to be his father, it escapes me. It's such a shame about this movie, it looks like a great place to celebrate. Anyway, in my hour and thirty minutes of my life, I can never come back. to watch this movie briefly.
