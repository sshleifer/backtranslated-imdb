This movie is terrible. It creates characters that are not in the book and some of them are ethnic or racial stereotypes. Including an unpleasant little Jewish boy and a politically correct little black girl. Not to mention Yiddish speaking elves. The book was a simple story of convictions, and this film is a dark, ugly and unnecessarily scary film that is nothing. <br /> <br /> Animation is great, but the Hollywood story is broken. <Br /> <br /> It is good that this film takes the bath box and maybe the manufacturers learn that they keep an unchanged story that doesn't need to be repaired. Hanks was superfluous and I do not see why the votes of other participants could not be used.
