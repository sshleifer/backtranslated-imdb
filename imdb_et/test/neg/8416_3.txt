It's a stupid mess of private eye thrillers, as the novelist (Michael Cain) has been invited to "refresh" the autobiography of the colorful, shrinking Hollywood star (Mickey Rooney). Sometimes the disorientation sometimes changes. It's not his best Cain. Rooney is on top. Significant support from Lizabeth Scott, Lionel Stander and comely Nadia Cassin. Not easy to see.
