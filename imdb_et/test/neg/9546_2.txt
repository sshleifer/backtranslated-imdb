Bone Collector is based in New York and starts as one of the most important criminologists and crime scene experts in the world, Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) is involved in an accident that leaves him in bed. Jump four years further and Alan (Gary Swanson) and his wife Lindsay Rubin (Olivia Birkelund) are kidnapped, right after New York police officer Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) is called to the crime scene and finds Alan buried and corrupted. Amelia notices some unusual evidence of crime sites and notices that impresses Rhyme when asked to work on the case. He realizes that the evidence is actually mysterious hints about Lindsay's location. Cracked in the race, it was too late for the police to save him, but this is just the beginning, because the sadistic serum killer continues to kill and leaves forensic science to Rhyme and the police ... <br /> <br /> Director Phillip Noyce Ma Watched Bone Collector last night and I have to say that this is one of the worst big budget posts: "Silence of Sheep's Lambs" (1991) & Se7en (1995), what I saw, actually doing it on Friday 13th (1980)) looks sophisticated and realistic! The Jeremy Iacone script was based on the Jeffery Deaver book and so poor on so many levels that I hardly know where to start. In the beginning, he takes himself seriously and makes all the other disadvantages twice worse. The characters are really terrible and I didn't think anyone would be a real person. First of all, we have Lincoln Rhyme, who is paralyzed by the neck and there is not just a lot of script that he can do with him, he really can't do anything literally, but in the whole movie bed. He has apparently impressed Amelia because he stopped the train and thought that there might be a new footprint near the murdered person because I am not funny here, but does a policeman not understand the footprint close to the murder victim, which would be somewhat appropriate? Why does she impress her? Then there is Capatin Cheney, who for obvious reasons is not only unlikely and cries to everyone, but is so incompetent that he was unable to combine several short-lived killings when every victim had a surgical removal of meat and skin from their body Captain? Then the killer, whose motives are less believable, are you trying to tell me that they have developed a complicated plan to kill at least seven people because they spent six years in jail for something they actually did? If they wanted Rhyme's revenge, why they killed all the other people who had no connection, maybe I just might buy someone who wants to resist revenge, who put them away, but not kill several other people who aren't related , target Rhyme something else. Even after planning a complicated plan to kill and get rid of these people, they suddenly become the most foolish person in history, despite keeping a big knife and being able to walk and use their weapons. who has no movement in his body under his neck! How did it happen? I should also mention Amelia, who is a terrible figure, she buys her camera to take criminals' photos and shoots of rats for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> In addition to some of the worst written characters, this story and plot are not much better. We will never know why the killer uses Bone Collector's book as inspiration. We will never know why the killer is killing a muscle strip from its victims. It has never been explained why a novice cop, such as Amelia, can enter criminal situations even before a forensic team. There is no reason why the killer chooses his victims. The murderer's hints are also a bit unclear, aren't they? I mean the blood of a bloody animal and shaved rats? Of course, how does someone go to the exact location of the next victim of bone and rat hair and is there a choice in New York? There are some nonsense about the birds sitting by the Rhymes window, which is just completely random and after almost two hours the Bone Collector is really slow. There is so much wrong in Bone Collector and it all comes down to one of the worst scripts, it is scary at all levels and reliability is zero. Apparently, Angelina Jolie has said she shot nude scenes for this movie, but they were cut because they felt too distracting. <br /> <br /> The estimated budget is about $ 48,000,000. values ​​and Hollywood shiny. I have to add now that I think Angelina Jolie is one of the worst performances I've ever seen, I think she's very terrible. Denzel Washington is exactly what it really is, Queen Latifah is terrible and even Michael Rooker can't do much because he's caught up in one dimensional character. <br /> <br /> The Bone Collector must be one of the worst Hollywood movies I've seen for a while, I saw telly free last night and still feel cheated and ripped. There are just so many things that it is stupid, embarrassingly awful or should it be terribly embarrassing? Works honestly ...
