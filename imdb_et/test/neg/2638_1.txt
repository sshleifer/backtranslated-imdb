This film was so weak that he couldn't even get out with good clich√©s. I love horror films and I see practically everything, but if I had done it again, I would have missed it. You might think I'm overwhelming, but I invite someone to find something even far-reaching or interesting about this garbage. Not scary, not funny, not curious, not worth it.
