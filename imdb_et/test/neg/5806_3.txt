What could be expected of any comedy produced by Adam Sandler, the grandmother's boy is predictable and so stupid that it is sick. Allen Covert celebrates Alex, a 35-year-old pothead who works as a video game tester and had to lose his apartment with his grandmother and his two roommates. Some common plots are changing: he has difficulty adjusting to his new way of life, which in turn makes it difficult for him to work, which is particularly bad because he is trying to nail one of the new consultants in one office. Throw a strange boss, a star of an almost alien company, really the best friend of a joke, a couple of scene-burning shops over a dealer, a really big party party and an original video game Alex trying to mix yourself with your grandmother Boy as a whole. Allen Covert takes a very good lead, Linda Cardellini is lovely enough to get her role as a one-no-no-pink office consultant in Samantha, and some scenes can splash out two or two, but none of them do grandmother's boyfriend time. Most of the allegedly funny jokes or gags or whatever you want to name them is nothing more than "humor" that would make someone look embarrassed to National Lampoons, Joel Moore is incredibly unsuccessful in his video game JP, and the whole movie will be boring, not funny or important. Well, at least grandmother's boyfriend did something: Adam Sandler was able to get some salary certificates for his out-of-work friends David Spade, Kevin Nealon and Rob Schneider.
