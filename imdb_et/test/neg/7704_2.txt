This movie plays like a VH1 "Where Are They" or "Behind Music" demented episode. In the first half of the film (which depicts his "glory days"), Abbie Hoffman is depicted involuntarily as a sort of misleading rock star. You know it; Poseur singer, a beautiful boy who didn't write any music, has no clue but gets all the prizes for anything and chicks for free. As a result, he takes for granted, abuses and ultimately destroys it with him. Indeed, Hoffman's awards ended abruptly when he had missed and hid bail for dealing with cocaine. <br /> <br /> The second part of the movie is about to hide this time. In this we see that Hoffman is a pathetic crybaby who blames infinitely everyone, someone but himself for his fall. Finally, the times pass completely; and he can never cope with it. When sad. END. Stop Credit and OH NO! We learn that Abbie Hoffman finally committed suicide in 1989. <br /> <br /> I am sure that this is not the picture the filmmakers have anticipated when making a movie. Given that Tom Hayden and Gerald Lefcourt took part, I am sure they intend this film to be a tribute to some people who were, after all, the icon of the 60's and left-wing anti-war movements. There they failed. The film presents Abbie Hoffman as a meaningless caricature. We never talk about what drives him. How did he reach his point of view? How did he manage to capture the whole generation's imagination? How did he organize such a big movement? Why was his fame associated with making cocaine? Why? Who knows, and since filmmakers don't seem to end up caring?
