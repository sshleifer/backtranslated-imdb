I've started thinking about how I read some of the opinions here when I watched the same movie as the other reviewers, but after checking my facts I am sad to conclude that I have. <br /> <br /> The wannabee screwball comedy must be one of the longest 94 minutes I've spent and one of the most weird things I've seen. Now don't get me wrong, I love screwing comedies, but this boring, set bundling goes so far away from the dizziness of Preston Sturges and Howards Hawks that it doesn't deserve (blending my metaphors) to think in the same breath as the ones it is. The writer / director Charles Martin's dialogue is not funny, subtle or interesting - and there is so much. He does not know how to end the scene, with some ruthless cutting, especially from people who leave the room and say goodbye to each other, the pace of the film would be canceled and then the fact that a limited number of characters make stupid and unmotivated things for some other reason than it should be comedy would have been a bit less obvious. The characters in this film get in love with and out of each other and move into and out of the apartments, just to move on to that little plot. At one point, people desperately miss one person, the next they marry someone else - being silenced and lost on the screen, so we don't know about it until one of these characters tells us, "Oh, they get married!" (Usually after someone has made faux-pas or jumped to the wrong conclusion). If we knew that the two characters were in love or should be at hand before hand, we would have, the audience, experienced the experience of seeing someone who fools himself. Like characters, just like selfish, petulous idiots, and we do not recognize any sympathy for them. <br /> <br /> The sets are limited and the action is limited to them in a way that makes the whole thing look like a poorly filmed stage game. The only moments of release from tedium are Keenan Wynn, who looks at how he has traveled from a different film and decided to hang and be a little more fun than all the inconvenient things around him. <br /> <br /> Very avoidable.
