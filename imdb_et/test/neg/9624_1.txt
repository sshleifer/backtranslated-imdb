This movie is really very bad, it is not very well done and is missing the luster test of anything but I'm not sure what. I looked at it and was very disappointed. It promised a lot but didn't give anything. The characters are low and wood, and the music, if you call it, is terrible. Of course, there are all beings and animated beings, but they are so badly made that it does not touch anything other than the third prized movie. It is a real shame that no special attention can be paid to special effects, not to the whole and to finish all the film I agree with, but in the film around them it is a very important factor. For me, this is a very sad test and should be avoided.
