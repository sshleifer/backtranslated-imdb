It is still the worst garbage I've ever seen. I'm so upset that I even complained to Blockbuster about its storage. I and some friends drove to see the back cover thinking that we had a good horror movie. The line of the picture seems to change during the film and there were many unimportant cushions. The film came to an abrupt end, I think they came out of the movie. The quality of the sound was terrible, and the first female character had a very thick Spanish accent, though she spoke in vain. The man gave a short bit of eye candy until his bizarre attempts to kill him. After all the time wasting to thoroughly discuss the workshop and its many electric tools, he decides to put a plastic bag on his head. All in all, I think you have to watch this movie to actually think it's there.
