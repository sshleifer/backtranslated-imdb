I couldn't wait. It's the worst movie I've ever seen. If you thought that almost everyone could make a watchable movie, these people prove that a minimum set of skills is needed. This is a film that has no redemptive qualities. In each department it is zero. This is more than just an "amateur" because no attention or attention is paid to the audience. There is no serious effort to act or entertain. The story is goal, pointless, and pointless. The cast is very uncomfortable and completely incomplete. The technical aspects of the film are bad. <br /> <br /> The DVD has good drinking boxes.
