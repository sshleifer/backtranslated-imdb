This film would probably have been good if they didn't use CGI (computer generated images) for werewolf scenes. It made creatures look and werewolves looked at the cartoon. But if we see a movie where the creature has to look completely real, there is no CGI way to go. Create an American werewolf in London. No CGI. Just makeup and a mechanical creature and what you came up with was more realistic than what was shown. This movie offered some gags that were fun to watch and the humor of this movie seemed to me, but that's nothing more than a movie that I thought was OK and not good enough. In my opinion, the American werewolf in Paris does not have to hold the original.
