Yeah, that's me again! Mr. "I'm sitting through the mess, so you don't have to". <br /> <br /> What do you think it is? Could it be about a woman calling a sex line and organizing an individual with a master's degree? Then his boyfriend's boyfriend reaches out and blows his throat with the razor before they put down their cash? Oh, what do you think! And when I tell you that a police officer is forced to join a team with a sexy helper to tell these mammals what kind of conclusion do you get? Do you think that a sexy DA is going under a crazy red dress to try to hit the queen, but eventually robbed and we need to rescue maverick officer? (who has already given his weapon and mark) ZING! You get 10 points! <br /> <br /> Frankly, this film missed tears. Why do people require this type of garbage? It's a waste of our time, their time, and still, no matter how we film a movie that nobody is giving. If it has redemption features, it is the fact that it has some of the finest women I saw on the film for a while. I hope they spent a little on the wages they earned from botox and colon irrigation. They would look great on the Vogue cover or sat on the top of the car on the bikini. They should simply act as specialists (like Shannon Tweed). <br /> <br /> For the future career, I'll talk to the director the second day. He's sure it will spray a delicious chicken burger meal. I also have to say that the uniform is actually suitable for her. I asked him "Party Line" and his eyes went to the floor before he poisoned any extra French fries. Well, I think it didn't work quite well. Don't forget that they will let him take over tomorrow! Hurray !! 1/10
