Jon Stewart (aka John Liebowitz) is constantly hanging on conservatism and something from the Republic. This liberal comic is something other than pouring his "humor" of cutting into the throats of impressive young people. I saw an example in the waiting area when my car was repaired and this guy is betrayed. He takes Al Queda toward Bush every day. She is shameless and everything she says is hitting a fictitious laughrack. I remember four years ago when he interviewed John Kerry. These two saw each other, which seemed to exclude makeout. It was like "Get a room, you guys". I just don't like smirky little traitors who are driving their propaganda. Call me low. The Daily Show has been a long-standing one and there are many similar liberals who hate Republicans and conservatism. I'm not surprised at this success, but are many people actually watching comedy? This Mancia man puts me in a barrel.
