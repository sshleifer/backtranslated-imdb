I liked this movie. Number 5, the star star of the movie is hit by lightning and some things happened to his chains. He acts and thinks more than a person. The robot repeats the ads he learns after watching TV. He then applies these testimonies to his circumstances. Number 5 is fast and funny. The character imitates the voices of the stars, trying to dance like John Travolta in life and in many other things. He has said that most of his circumstances have been remembered. Robot action is really good. Number 5 wants to drive to Stefany, bake and ask the person for all the qualities. The way robots move and line up is really hysterical. I'm disappointed that the writers couldn't keep it clean for all viewers. This film has a surprise that ends with something you don't expect. I hate movies that swear in them, although I like to give them a lower rating. This movie was passionate. Jesus Christ was used as a swear word that offends me, it is used at least 3 times. G's D-m, Bull sh_t, etc. It could have been a great movie with all this offensive language. In this film there is no sex, violence like robots that incite cars and machines.
