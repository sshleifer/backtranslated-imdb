I thought it was difficult, if not impossible, to look at, and not because of their horrible horrors, but because of their ways of portraying them. Imagine what Costa Gavras could have done with this real horror story. What I dispute is the idea that it is enough to denounce what I order. But showing it to us with powerful cinema power. I feel that the filmmaker, maybe even the righteous anger, did not allow him to see it clearly from a cinematic point of view. Or if it was a kinematic point of view, I mean, choice, I didn't like it at all. I was more concerned about how the film was filmed as a movie itself. I'm sure I'm sure, but unfortunately it's not nearly enough.
