I have to say that I am a big fan of these "left-wing" attacks, even those most people hate, are often held relatively high; but one of the movies I didn't like was Aldo Lado's 'Night Train Murders', and unfortunately the trains and the last left house are not confused because Terror Express is another messy out. Something that such a movie really needs is an amazingly nasty driver. and while Terror Express offers up to three potential candidates, none of them will stand up and become a scapegoat, leaving a shortcoming in the most important area. In fact, it will be a good start when three young men on the train line will easily irritate the guests on board. This forces the audience to believe that there are more stores, but unfortunately it never reaches the scene setting. From there, the trio gets over the train and uses its new found power to terrorize guests and rape women. <br /> <br /> It's a fair amount to say. a movie that is pleasing to many viewers; but there is no blood. Director Ferdinando Baldi seemed to think he could go away with blood substitutions with sexual scenes and he could also get it off; if he could shoot a brutal sex scene. The idea that these men take a train by force goes out of the window after it goes to sex because the people you think are powerful and powerful seem too eager to show their women a good time and despite this very sandwich sequence , no gender is particularly interesting. Since many sexual scenes take part in the film, it becomes a huge problem. Such films are often lacking in style, difference and credibility; but you know you look bad if it's boring. As you think, there is nothing about action; and the central three eyes stand out from the garbage. The direction is lacking in style and there is very little tension or tension; complicating what happens. All in all, this is a pretty dirty example of exploiting a movie and I can't recommend it.
