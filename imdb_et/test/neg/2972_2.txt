Hollywood has made many wonderful films over the years, but none of them are strangers. WHY this film got what I never know or how Paramount might have thought it was selling tickets in 1947. This is a strange combination of genres I've seen for a long time, a movie that really doesn't know if it is trying to be a serious war drama or a Viennese operetta comedy. <br /> <br /> It speaks of British Spy, who is trying to change Germany's poison gas formula before the start of World War II. Exquisite actor Ray Milland has played Monty's Python extract, a very exaggerated English pre-school dialogue. In Germany he meets a Gypsy, Marlene Dietrich, who helps her to travel under the lid, as of course the other Gypsies. He plays his role as a typical Gypsy gypsy caricature, as well as other "gypsies" in the movie. But there are also Nazis who are not funny at all. And then Milland thinks he's gonna think like a gypsy and it's not a joke. Sometimes music is a light comedy, sometimes for drama. Every time the Nazis appear, the film plays Wagner, which is funny. <br /> <br /> This film could have been a comedy, or it could have taken seriously the difficulties of the gypsies and a serious task of showing how the Nazis treated them. Both refer to this film but they are not continued. What we have left is a truly strange genre that must confuse everyone except the director. <br /> <br /> Reliable.
