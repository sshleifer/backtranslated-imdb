Sorry, but I can't agree it was a good movie. Yes, it looked good, but it is a story that drives the film and I have to say that the story is breastfed. How in the world they were able to slip some of these plot holes by critics. Better story and I would have given him a bigger voice, but I was unable to do it and still live. I've always been a fan of frightening films and I was cheating on the previews. All scary scenes were previewed. And why could the family kill to take home home? Why did the father come back? Why did he decide to kill first? Why were the children the only ones who saw the spirits first? Many questions do not have enough answers. If I had given it to zero, I would have done it.
