If you plan to look at "Partner" and read IMDb's comments on it, you have wasted too much time on this foolish, idiotic and terrible movie. <br /> <br /> This is a horrible, horrible and terrible copy of the movie "Hitch." I decide to ignore all the other warnings and bad comments I had heard about this movie and wasted it for 20 minutes - I thought that after David Dhawan did it and he had Govinda - how bad would it be? But after you saw it for 20 minutes, I couldn't take it away and shut down the computer. <br /> <br /> Dealing with all the film, foolish dialogues, all the waste of time - I gave it a 1-star rating because it is the lowest you can do. If I could go down, I would have given him an estimate of -100.
