When I was 13 or so, I was happy to find this movie. It was part of an endless Danish joyful feed. It was, however, the most exciting, but I think I sold it too bad. Well, what to write ... Better than "Manos: Hands of Fate" and worse than "Critters 4". But it is definitely worth one and a half hours, because it was done by people who wanted to do it. Action is not so terrible compared to several other eighties garbage - in fact, I like the old man, although he saw it look like India. But I think you can't get everything ... Do yourself a favor and look at it ...
