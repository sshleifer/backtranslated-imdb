This conglomerate fails at each level so painfully that it is difficult to decide what to say. It doesn't deserve a single line, much less ten, but compliance with IMDb rules, here goes, and I probably won't succeed for the first time, and I still have a few more to accept. LOL <br /> <br /> If I had seen it during my seventies when I was through my mushroom stage, I would have considered it unimaginable and low. For me, the most exciting picture was when the elevator door was opened and closed. I was on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> One person here wrote that he had met the creator of this confusion, as if it were a red anniversary in his life. You can only pray that there will be much more exciting things in this poster life.
