The last installment of the "Airport" franchise was so incredibly horrible that it took some time to realize that it wasn't really a tiny comedy like "The Airplane". George Kennedy shot a burnt gun out of an open window to direct the heat-seeking missiles into a comic. What would happen to your hand if you keep this speed out of the window? You would lose your gun grip and get a broken arm. The passengers were unintentionally fun, as was the interior of the plane. An experienced French woman who came to slobby George Kennedy was like Jackie Kennedy, who came to Ernest Borgnine. It won't happen. The talented and countless actor, Susan Blakely, did not get any points on it. Also Robert Wagner. This movie was so bad that it seemed surreal.
