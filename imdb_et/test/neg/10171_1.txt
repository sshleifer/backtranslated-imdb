Like many of the above remarks, I am also saying that it was an average scifi movie, but unfortunately it wasn't. I found it quite patronizing and really preaching. <br /> <br /> But this is not the only comment. Scenes are very "artificial" (not like a sci-fi, as I explain in a few minutes). (The next sentence is a small spoiler.) The film more or less represents the discussion between the two groups. The physical setting of the discussion usually involves two or three men standing next to each other. In the worst case, one person represents the other party. <br /> <br /> Interviews with reporters are also very artificial, sometimes even unprofessional. For example, sometimes there is a discussion between reporters (I mean "akward" from the interviewed point). In addition, the interview people always remain calm, they say everything without normal emotions. E.e. You cannot say whether they lie or not, are angry or not. They show almost nothing. <br /> <br /> It is also very unprofessional, Christian journalists always believe in what they say by the people interviewed. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: <br /> <br /> All conversations include: <br /> <br /> - facts <br /> <br /> - arguments <br /> <br /> > There are no lies. Nobody is hiding. (The next sentence is a spoiler, ignore if you plan to see the movie yet.) The only wrong thing is to show how "bad" is unfaithful. <br /> <br /> This leads me to the conclusion that film is a B movie. It is very similar to the plan of the external environment 9 (from the 50s), but this film also has a tedious, wrong talk about aliens and Christian faith. <br /> <br /> NOTE. Christians, people who believe in foreigners or who else. This is the idea I have about a film, not about people. <br /> <br /> In addition, I would like to point out that I do not know if the actors are bad or were simply given terrible scripts.
