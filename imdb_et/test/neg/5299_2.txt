"Get Shorty", "Out of Sight", "Jackie Brown" (and even "52 Pick-Up") - people finally got Elmore Leonard, making good films for their work. So, despite my pupils' warnings about this movie's mischief, I couldn't rent it. I thought it was bad? Oy, which is a mistake, especially at the book reading, which was a flat (and too circular, self-referencing) versus the rest of Elmore Leonard's books. However, the book was better than film. Leonard is fighting again the weak and unqualified screen writers who are trying to take over their books. The dialogue written for Steven Tyler was painful to look at. And the lyrics that mark Linda Moon's first song? My high school students write deeper. Sad, sad, sad. Why even give it a star? Since Harvey Keitel and Uma Thurman are still fun for the screen, and Andre 3000 didn't make himself completely stupid.
