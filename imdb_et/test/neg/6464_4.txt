Not too long ago I bought a cheap VHS tape called "Just Rambling Along", which allegedly had Laurel and Hardy. Being somewhat familiar with my production and recognizing this name, I made an embarrassing decision to buy and buy the whole dollar. When I submitted it, I found the movie HOP TO IT. Of course, Mr Laurel was nowhere over, making the packaging of this product criminally deceptive. Worse still, quality is terrible. It looks like it was a 8 mm film source. It had a somewhat suitable musical result. In fact, the tape is really worth it if you just want to understand what the film is. In my opinion, this is a decent but unusual short. IMDb should add an alternative title to this movie, JUST RAMBLING ALONG, which was the name of the 1918 Stan Laurel movie!
