I liked most of this movie. As other reviews mentioned, it is a good lie, the plot is interesting enough. All in all, it's fun to watch. <br /> <br /> But the end, I feel, is completely botched, left me confused. Yes, do you think that in such a film people cross and cross each other, but a fourfold intersection? Well, if this is justified by the plot, why not? <br /> <br /> But it's a bad part, it's not necessary. For a certain point, it is all meaningless. (here comes SPOILER). After the airport scene, Enrico and his companions are already making money. I didn't understand the need for the rest of the fraud. Do you just need to rub Federico's nose to be deceived? I don't buy it. <br /> <br /> So from 6 out of 10 3/4 movies and 2 out of 10.
