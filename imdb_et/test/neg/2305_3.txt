Jacqueline Susann wrote several novels all related to sex and melodrama, and some of them were actually made for such efforts, and all of them have the difference that they are some of the worst films. The story here is about Robin Stone (John Phillip Law) and his rise to the top of television, being merciless and compassionate for everyone around him. He's the worst sort of playboy and then throws all the women he's in bed, including the IBC network president's wife. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** Greg Austin (Robert Ryan) is responsible for the TV network IBC, and when his younger wife, Judith, looks at Robin, he doesn't waste time with him in bed. Greg gets sick and has to take time, and Robin comes in and starts up the net, but throughout this time, Amanda (Jodi Wexler) kills her in love with her. When Greg returns to his job, he tries to get rid of Robin, using his moral clauses in his contract, when rumors begin his relationship with Jerry Nelson (David Hemmings), a gay fashion designer. <br /> <br /> Jack Haley Jr, who went on to be a very successful producer on television and movies, but it was only his second film as a director and the material he was forced to deal with seems to be over head! The script comes from Susan's novel, and this would probably be the reason why it is similar to the cross between "Alfie" and "The Valley of Dolls", and I think the reason why his books never translate to a film is that the filmmakers made a terrible mistake in his stories seriously instead of tongue. With this, laughs are unintentional, especially during a totally ridiculous fight at the end of the movie, which begins when Cannon refuses to return the slave bracelet to gay characters! Hemmings was a very good actor, but his role here is absolutely up and he has one of the worst beards in history, and every second sentence uses the word "chic". The law was not the leading initial choice, but the other participant had a serious accident and the law came in and offers a wooden show on Miles O'Keeffe on this side. The movie script suffers in two different areas, so it is so stupid and terribly dull, and tests the patience of the viewers when they decide to watch it. One should ask what the result would be if the director decided to film one of Susan's novels and not take it seriously, because the test here is pointless and ridiculous.
