The cast played Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare lost. <br /> <br /> I appreciate that it is trying to bring Shakespeare to the masses, but why destroy it so good. <br /> <br Is it because the "Scottish game" is my favorite Shakespeare? I do not know. I know that a certain Rev Bowdler (so bowdlerization) tried to do something similar during Victorian. <br /> <br /> In other words, you cannot perfect perfection. <br /> <br /> I no longer have to write, but since I have to write at least ten lines of text (and the English composition has never been my forte, I just have to continue and say that this movie, as they say, just don't cut it.
