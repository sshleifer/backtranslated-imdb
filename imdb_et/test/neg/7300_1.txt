The post-apocalyptic warrior goes out to save some Nun and the journey meets some cyber-red skates who want to hit their ass. This is one of the hardest movies ever to see. By default, scenes that appear the last hour before someone leaves with the next poorly written, poorly acting line. There are sequences of activities that continue to repeat - and we're not talking about a quick 1-2-3 action that is repeated with a particularly good blow that Eastern directors made popular, talking about many, many, repeated, long, bad sequences. This is confusing first, but then it quickly becomes annoying when you look at the 30 second sequence of the second, third and fourth order. Any plot or vision disappears in confused continuity, the only thing that keeps this movie in the video player (after betting a friend that I couldn't look at it all the time without begging to turn it off safely removed so that it doesn't harm anyone else) is the fact that although this film is painful, it is unintentionally fun, I am not a fan of the "so bad that it's funny", but in some i was tearing. Others are the quality of the sound and the picture, but it is forgiving because obvious money is a big problem in making this movie. The ultimate decision - the "so funny funny" king of the genre, someone with the kind of genre video night should get a copy of themselves. Also, remember that this is actually the worst film I've ever seen.
