Well, I have to agree with those critics who all said, "Leave it alone." Why they had to do the transformation of the 1960s Psycho that I don't know. I think they wanted to reach a new audience and the color and today's actors were the answer because they were the main changes. The dialogue was the same and the same story. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I commend them because they didn't do it through a lot of embarrassment and nudity and made it a stupid movie. But if they kept everything the same, why barely if you were not going to improve Tony Perkins, Janet Leigh and the initial pain, did they think Vince Vaughn was going to be as good or better than Perkins? Are you kidding? Ann Heche, with her short mannequin hairstyle, is better than Leigh? I don't think so! <br /> <br /> Yes, the colors were beautiful here, but it's black and white photography that helped the 1960s start. It's the perfect story, not a bunch of green and pink! Again, I think filmmakers banked an audience who never saw the original. <br /> <br /> It was just a stupid project that you would never have had to get out of the ground.
