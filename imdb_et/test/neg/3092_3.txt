This film should have been much better than it was. Christopher Eccleston is a great actor, but even he couldn't save the story of a young woman who was looking for the truth about her sister's death. Spoiler Warning: In fact, it is true that the older sister (played by Diaz) is just a spoiled, selfish and low-profile girl who took too many medications. Not much twist and not so interesting. The film is also superfluous with too many setbacks and voice transmissions, and there is no dramatic pace. All in all, it is definitely worth the absence - not recommended.
