This is a known fact, Mr Seagal can't smile, he can act, he can kick off, there are weak smiles, there is no real smile that doesn't laugh out loud and is not a real point in watching this crazy movie. We see that Mr Seagal is dr. Wesley Maclaren, who desperately needs a hairstyle, and her real daughter Ayako appeared as an assistant to her office. Story: Okay, so Wesley lives with another sweet daughter, Holly. They sit and enjoy their red flower paths and omelets, and at the other end of the city, some overweight army chief decides to make the whole city sick, spreading the airborne virus and killing within 2 days, thinking he can survive. he had an antidote. The problem, there is no antidote and what exists, keeps the virus some time ago. CIA is contacted and even they can't help, and only one person is not sick, Wesley's daughter Holly. So he starts hunting to think that the treatment is in his blood. Wesley manages to grab her daughter and bring her to her grandfather who is Indian. With their sister Ann, they go to the base where there is a hidden lab to find a cure, but even the soldiers there dying slowly and so on, if they do not find timely treatment. And in order to shorten the moment, neither Ann nor Wesley was infected with the virus ... hmm. One weak fight. The terrible movie and all the men in it desperately need stairs.
