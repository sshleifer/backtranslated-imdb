I watched this movie without knowing what it used to be. I was intrigued for the first whole hour. It turned into a big thriller. Very talented cast and good dialogue. It all broke down for me in the first vampire eyes. I couldn't believe my eyes. A big thriller was rinsed off the toilet. The rest of the movie from this point was absolutely terrible. I think it's a bit generous, but I had some time for entertainment. I'm not a fan of vampires or zombie movies at all. If you are, you may disagree with my opinion.
