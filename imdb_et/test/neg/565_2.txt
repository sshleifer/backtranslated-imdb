Dedicated Penalty and Generation Peter Watkins goes over the pond to take over the 1971 American legal system, a priceless piece of familiar paranoia that is still falling left to the left. Watkins is pure tourism when it brings together our gang tragedy against clich√©s from freaks, hippies and black revolutionaries who have unleashed happy policemen and military personnel, and a canopy court composed of bad adults who are bad fashion statements. Talk about the revolution. <br /> <br /> In the Penalty Park, we have a radical youth and a corrupt system because criminals are sentenced to imprisonment or a three-day trek to Punishment Park (Death Valley) and freedom. Of course, law enforcement officers who follow their journey are not going to play fairly, and with the suffocating heat, the fate of our protagonists will be closed. <br /> <br /> There are both Kafka elements and theme in the Park of Penalties. Studies take place under a large canvas text, where imprisoned prisoners talk about harsh love or leave the group's researchers (like members of a peaceful American silent majority) who are retreating. Each group does not spend much time listening to the other, and the procedure sometimes takes teenage parenting to drive keys. For the most part, it's just one side that says what's wrong in America, the other says what's right if no one offers solutions. Meanwhile, the martyrs of the punishment park are infinitely about dessert, while the police officers with the gun act like twelve years. It has the look and feel of its 70's college film classes when we were younger and more aware of it now. <br /> <br /> Peter Watkins has always been on the underside of the world and a common man against what he perceives as corrupt little. Culledon was a strong accusation of military cruelty in the 18th century Scotland, which still resonates. The war game is a raw-minded look at the follow-up of nuclear energy, which should be looked at for everyone. The punishment park also has its value but not for any other reason. The Watkins vision is an example of a textbook from the left-wing, full-length, 70-year-old paranoia of the culture of the pilot, and the time (Vietnam, Kent, Chicago 7) did not seem such a dirty hysteria far from the truth. But 35 years later, the fever has been reduced and the punishment park with an unlimited narrow perspective is pretty foolish.
