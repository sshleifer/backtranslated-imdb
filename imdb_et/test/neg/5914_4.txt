Dane Youssef. <br /> <br /> I was the one who was waiting for it. I like Eddie Murphy and I love it when a star makes a vehicle for itself or someone who writes decides to celebrate their driver's debut. But if the head of the star becomes too big for the rest of the body, there is always a danger that Hollywood's big production will be a big budget. <br /> <br /> Does a filmmaker consider this to be real? or is she just wasting money (studio, us) and time (studio, us and her own) who are hitting one and a half hours? Unfortunately, this is the last one here. <br /> <br /> Another thing I really like is when someone breathes new and fresh life into an exhausted and dried genre. None of this here. War Nightclub movies have become so worn that even its parodies are bad and dead. <br /> <br /> Murphy doesn't do that. He makes the most cliché: he puts a picture of the usual ordinary gangster and plays it as seriously as it would be a "godfather". It's like a script where the next pattern puts fun and new ideas. But it seems that someone with authority has looked at it and went, "No, that's good." <br /> <br /> Probably Murphy. He's been credited with all of that. At the opening of beautiful white satin leaves, her titles over credit are about five times. <br /> <br /> PLOT: A young orphan saves Pryor's life and Pryor takes a small ragamaffin. <br /> <br /> 20 years later, Pryor dumps have been first-class. They pull down big money and the gangster wants his action. She even has a dirty cop at work. But Pryor comes up with a scheme called "THE STING". <br /> <br /> The Murphy scenario plays like the unfinished first draft that no one could call. The actors can't really stand out at all, if at all. Even the omnipotent Murphy seems to be an automatic pilot. <br /> <br /> Pryor shows class and gentlemen's behavior like Sugar Ray (maybe it would have been better to mention his character BROWN Sugar Ray? <br /> <br /> The Oscar nomination received by the film is richly earned (Joe I. Tompkins' best costume design), but the output values ​​are the only part that makes the 30s feel authentic. <br /> <br /> Some kits look somewhat fake, but it should be a sort of comedy. It's rare: one film will become a candidate for both Razzie and the Oscar (if not one of Lucas' new "Star Wars" chapters). <br /> <br /> It's 1938 and everyone is talking like it's 1988, especially comedians. This is a prehistoric white man's formula. And all these black comedians and satirists are waiting for them to twist the genre or at least give it a new life. No. Murphy is almost just off the coast here. <br /> <br /> The big Roger Ebert summarized it when he noted in his review: "Murphy is approaching a more costume party where everyone can look out for a plot that hasn't been fresh since at least 1938. "<br /> <br /> Jasmine Guy is completely cast and seems to be taking on his role and Michael Lerner has all the looks, evils and ways of the prototype mob. And there are moments where Pryor gives you an idea of ​​what an interesting leader and the number of authors look like. He gives a sense of dignity to each scene. <br /> <br /> Would it have been too much to ask Della Resse to sing? Or at least torture yourself with all your "Kiss My Ass"? <br /> <br /> And late Redd Foxx can't leave much of this song song. He's with Resse, which could have been great. No. Murphy wastes another opportunity here. <br /> <br /> Murphy's Quick is charismatic and pleasant. But these moments are little and far from certain. Murphy has never seen a better one and has never been numb. His character made me laugh twice during the film. <br /> <br /> Stan Shawi's terrible speech-impaired boxer is not just painful and embarrassing, it is annoying. There is more comedy than just something unpleasant. You have to add some light touch and a funny situation. Looking at him with the strain, even some of the simplest words, makes us desperate and Murphy annoying. <br /> <br /> Is Murphy writing a manuscript? Well? there was "raw" but it was really a stand-up material. He certainly wrote the "Boomerang" and "Coming to America" ​​vision. But he didn't have the last word. Perhaps a team of script-like scripting ER could have revived it. <br /> <br /> Murphy's direction is so slow and quiet when you swear he's asleep with the bike. He has too many static shots and it doesn't seem to know how to build and release tension. On some levels, I think Quick is a real Eddie Murphy. Angry, young, hot and ambitious. But from time to time charming. Now, he was sometimes funny. <br /> <br /> There is a scene where Murphy is in the bed of the femme who is going to love her and kill her. You may think how it will come out. Like everything in the movie, it would have been better, but ??? <br /> <br /> "Surprisingly," Murphy hasn't directed another movie (he got Razzie nomination). And she no longer writes a ready-made draft for her films (she won Razzie for writing it!) <br /> <br /> It's nice to watch and the music is beautiful and there are some really nice scenes. But it just belongs to the category of "gems all junk." Not enough of them. <br /> <br /> May be. Should it be. Was not. Oh, well. <br /> <br /> Dane Youssef
