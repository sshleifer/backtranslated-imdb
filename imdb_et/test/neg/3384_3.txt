Now don't get me wrong I love bad movies ... I don't adore bad movies, Troll 2 .... ouch painful, Manos Hands of fate ... just look at Torgo, Guru Mad Monk .. is this traffic noise in the Middle Ages? OK, so it's clear, but it's one of those films that obviously tried to be better, but didn't. Why not? Well, to make the plot easy to blame, but hey, what we've seen worse, there were not too many holes and heh I know there is not much originality, but then this movie doesn't have to kill. Impacts are not bad (if you completely ignore the last scene), the monster is OK, the truck is quite threatening that where it went wrong? Well, I would like to blame it on "Chris Moyles" like Harley ... so I'm doing! Comedy and horror are difficult to mix, bad comedy and horror even worse and there's a problem. I threw this man from the moment he closed his head (literally), the constant harassment of Adam becomes annoying, so annoying that you lose the belief that the most gentle people would not react when he moves out of the car door. .. and I thought it was a monster bit that the director needed to convince us. Why are bad movies fun? Well you have a lot of fun poking holes in them, laughing at the script, all the howlers, etc. This movie doesn't make the coveted category "worst movies" because its just bad because of being annoying nuff said. Don't worry, go see something else and you're a better person ... I promise! (Torgo Torgo Torgo's Singing Songs)
