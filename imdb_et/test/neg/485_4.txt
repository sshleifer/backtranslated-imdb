This is better than the previous Cronenberg horrors, but something other than your real-life story. The theme of the video game has also been mentioned earlier. There is nothing left of the original, except for the weird Cronenberg atmosphere (which is not so strong here) where there is amusing sexual reference and the darkness of Shore. The story doesn't grab your full attention. It flows bitterly after the event. Rating 4/10.
