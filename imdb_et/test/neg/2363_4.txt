Now every fan of Blaxploiation knows the ingredients: big Afros, topless babes, surrealy bad fashion and some jive tales. In such a case, add a manager who is unable to act to a plot that makes little sense, edited by someone who has no hands who are stuck and the most adorable-terrible fighting scenes and you have "TNT Jackson". It's not bad enough to be good, but not good enough to be bad, it's a great mess from start to finish. I especially loved the infinite continuity bugs and the lead with a white stunt. <br /> <br /> It's so "70's bad" Far Eastern martial arts match the black power that it hurts, but the boy is so good! I am ashamed to admit that I almost enjoyed it.
