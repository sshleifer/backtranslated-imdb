According to Hollywood standards, this film was filmed and edited in the form of Hollywood films, and so it seemed like a movie that you will get out of a big-time studio in Hollywood. That's where Hollywood remote control ends. It was MOVIE, WHAT I ME ME MY MY! I'm not kidding. The story was so incredibly stupid and unrealistic that I could not smile in the movie while watching the movie. I know what you're talking about, "his horror film, which shouldn't have a good story that should frighten you." Well let me tell you something, the movie isn't even a little bit scary. Too full of stupid bits, which cancels a small intercourse. The actor was also terrible, as well as the lack of a murderer that you constantly saw through the backside of the cage pulled out. Throughout the film, I got the idea that I was looking at something I thought, wrote, brought and directed by a college that looks too much pornography. Please don't see this movie, spend your $ 8.50 on other things like a snow cone, which would be well worth your time.
