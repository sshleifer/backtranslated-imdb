Another First: This French film is my introduction to the world of Eric Rohmer. Maybe I'm in a hurry when I say it's probably my last Rohmer movie, but I was immediately turned off when Rohmer relies on monotonous philosophical conversations that never come. In the film, there is a scene where the characters discuss the love that I thought would never end. Honestly, no matter how much I tried, I couldn't understand why Rohmer was so highly appreciated among cinephiles. He struck me as one of those outrageous harsh people full of hot air. If this is an example of what his films are, I don't care. I don't care about French cinema (usually reflective and speculative), so maybe I'm biased.
