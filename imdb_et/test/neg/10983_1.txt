This woman is a terrible comedian. She can't break the fun. He has no real character. This is another example of a typical American rubbish that people laugh at because they have no idea how to react, so they say to themselves, "Well, it's a comedy show," so I'm laughing, I guess. > <br /> I can't bar this unfortunate woman and her $ $$ for comedy. He deserves nothing but a boost. <br /> <br /> Why can't America get such a sweat joy and go for something that actually contains humor. <br /> <br /> She's not funny. Not at all. Why oh, even one person is such an idiot?
