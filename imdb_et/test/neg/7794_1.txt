Do writers of this type of "comedies" have such empty lives that they have to show them as tragic as it is? "Why a talented and proud busy Phillips is in the trash, I can't stand a Spanish girl whose accent sounds very fake and is so awkward and annoying as another African-American girl with a gentle voice. <br /> < jokes are often stupid, the Jewish boy screams a lot and the show never goes anywhere, one particular episode with a solider who is looking for love was just terrible. <br /> <br /> I don't think many work with a loving office and only one man? Of course, all women are tightly fitted tops and make up tons to make up for their lack of talent. <br /> <br /> I found Holly in my older plays funny and I've always admired the busy, but this show is stupid empty and he had nothing to do with it.
