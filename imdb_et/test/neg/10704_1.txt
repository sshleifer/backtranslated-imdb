I don't think it can legally be qualified as a "movie". The plot was so weak, the dialogue so low, and the lines so terrible that I couldn't believe someone actually wrote the lines, said "Holy sh * t! This is a masterpiece" and then really that manufacturer. On the one hand, I am still buggy and I remember this movie forever as a sign of degeneration of intelligence in America - this and, of course, a crossroads.
