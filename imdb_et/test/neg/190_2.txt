Don't be stupid, right? We all know that this film is made for the success of "Grumpy Old Men" films. Unlike these, it has zero humor and a very small heart. <br /> <br /> Gloria DeHaven is the only bright light. It breaks my heart that he was finally given the opportunity to show his skills to the new generation members to reach only that piece, like this one. There was a touching scene that showed someone loved her. His exquisite performance was the only quality that took place in "Out To Sea." All others are just in motion. 2/10
