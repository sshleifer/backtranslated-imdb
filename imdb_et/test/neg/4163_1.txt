I just stopped watching this movie and I think it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was so boring that I found myself zooming at X2 speed and finished it in less than 30 minutes. I was not just disappointed, but angry that I had wasted this money. It's the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen thousands of movies! The plot was very confusing. If I hadn't rented the cover for the DVD before that, I would have disappeared completely during this movie. I wouldn't have thought that Tim Robbins would have been in the movie after such good films as "Shawshank Redemption".
