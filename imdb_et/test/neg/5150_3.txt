This film started with a force majeure - but it was designed with the arrogant mother, the rival witch and the hesitant queen of beauty, who was in second place. There were some glowing overflows and some unlikely plot points (he comes first with ALL ONE contest? ALL of them?) Unfortunately, the movie is terribly suffering that it should be a TV movie. Instead of ending at the end of the movie, the amusing twist in which the killer is (half-believable) appears for a further twenty minutes to make sure justice is done. Of course, now that the killer appears, he suddenly undergoes a complete personality shift - his character is completely rewritten because the writers no longer have to keep their identity secret. The cheese was completely drowned, otherwise it could have been a passive fun movie.
