"Nero", as the movie's title in Germany, is another attempt to show one of the most interesting Roman emperors, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, better known as Nero. Although this attempt at least tried to show a more historical more accurate Nero than a fun, but completely fictional Nero Peter Ustinov, who played "Quo Vadis!" it is still a big failure. And for those IMDb commentators who still believe that Sueton and Tacitus propaganda is true, read the book about Nero, which was published less than 20 years ago. Nero didn't burn Rome, it's proven! He didn't murder Britannicus. He was not tortured, killed or tasted for joy, he was the first emperor to fight the BANNED gladiator. The film still has a lot of mistakes, mistakes and it has been made in a very cheap style, especially the kits were cheap and convincing, the palace, which looks like some villas, the city itself looked like. The action took place between the good and the sub-parameter, the music was almost insignificant, and the film soon deteriorated after Nero became embarrassed and embarrassed without a clear narrative structure. So there is still a potential epic biography of Nero, which shows the true Nero, one of Rome's best emperors, despite Sueton et al.
