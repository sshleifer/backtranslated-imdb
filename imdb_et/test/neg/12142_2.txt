"Final comedown" wants to "say something" about racism and urban violence; Unfortunately, this message is a pointless pointless script, an amateur production and a hard handle. How hard, you ask? One example, a black doctor comes out of his hiding place, unarmed, hands in the air, ready to hand over to the police: one (all white) cops say, "Don't shoot him, he's a doctor," which the other cop replies: "What? another **** r ", and he shoots him with cold blood. An unknown, racist killer is depicted in the police, although there are as many dead people among the black people who have been attacking the attack. And this whole event meant that the white people were "sensitive" to the humiliating treatment of the black people, when in fact something like that just got more hatred and violence on both sides. Pamela Jones, like a Williams girlfriend, briefly burns the screen with her smile and body, especially in a delicate sex composition, and raises the rating from 1 to 10 out of 10.
