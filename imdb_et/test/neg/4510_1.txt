I have rarely seen the work of literature that has been so badly translated on the screen. The hysterical light of the B-film and the sitcom add-ons simply transforms the characters into bad Jewish stereotypes. The worst is Melissa Gilbert, whom you hate from the scene and never condemn. Such performances should be recorded and used against participants wishing to work again. All in all, TV movies have a bad name with a small budget TV movie.
