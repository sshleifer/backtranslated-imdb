The only time I get trawled through IMDb comments is when I see a couple of movies. I think I want to confirm that it's not just me. For me, Lonesome Jim was a film packed with impressive movies packed in amazing situations, sliding flat and forever into a hackneyed conclusion. So I look at what other people say and feel like Jim, outside the limb, alienated when the page after several star rating pages leaves me in doubt in their critical faculties. Maybe I should check the comment presentation settings because after a while I will die and I am released to see the values ​​that my own reflect. I feel right. This is a garbage film, it doesn't hang and it is a wasted night that sits through it. Praise the spirits of the families.
