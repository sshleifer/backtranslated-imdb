Good mourning .. I think I've seen it all. Danny Thomas looks so good. She looks really uncomfortable. He can't be worth the song, and if he's paired with Peggy Lee (PEGGY LEE ???), he just eases him! Perhaps the director saw it and made him a reality that was really a bad comedy he sometimes did in the film. Peggy Lee is okay, but the whole thing is disgraceful. Maybe laugh good.
