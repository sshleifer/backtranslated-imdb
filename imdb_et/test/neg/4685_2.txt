The word "boring" is thrown too often, referring precisely to how bad a low budget horror movie is. I've seen a lot of B movie. Many terrible, terribly wrong B-movies. Some outputs worth a few hundred bucks. Does failure, bad action, worse continuity and embarrassing budgets make the movie really invisible? Some would no doubt be yes. Most of them are probably the big fans of The Matrix. Well, I hate high budget movies, so I say no. Bad can sometimes be funny (Blood Freak), sometimes even delightful (Troll 2), but boring is always unobtrusive ... Hey, like a bloodthirsty butcher that reminds me that I write a review of garbage ... Yes, yes anyway . This is one of the many alternatives to the late British director Andy Milligan's dreams. It's based on Sweeney Todd ... Big. Milligan takes a boring story and succeeds. Hey, it's pretty funny, I said bu ... sorry, I'm still confused. It's not quite easy. For a second thought, I make it easy. There are no fears, fears, entertainment, just unlikely, annoying people with conversations. it's a bloodthirsty butcher. Oh yes, and something like a hairdresser killing a hairdresser and something or other meat on pies. I don't know, it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> For Andy Milligan, something more satisfying is always the only one I've ever seen, Rats come, werewolves are here. Yeah, you heard me. But if we forget this Milligan man, we all forget and suck something sweet like Sick Girl or Teenape Goes Camp. No matter what you decide, you just know that bovine butchers are sucking, maybe even more than any other version of the already empty story. And fans of the B-movie really say something. 2/10
