I'm a big fear film, especially in the 1980s. Name One? I've probably seen it. Last year, the theater began to hit a new, small horror film, which seemed like a mainstream radar "Saw". I was moderately excited. Having heard of this, I thought it was quite promising in terms of previews and posters (well, except for the back and white hands and feet ... those who just saw terribly)! . It was one of the worst experiences in my life. This film was literally spiritual and spiritual. Because it was scary? ... NO! Because it was one of the most terrible movies I've ever seen! First of all, the scenario and editing structure was completely frightening, even according to horror movie standards. Starting with the queue in the interrogation room with the victim (Shawnee Smith), who recently survived the serial number attack, then showing a setback on what he was living? NOT SCARY! It was impossible to feel any tension, WHAT is aware that the abovementioned victim was in perfect order. Of course, this upside-down thing was horrible ... but WHY should I be a little bit frightened than CLEARLY, you just showed that he was living in an ordeal? Unfortunately, the whole movie was built so. It starts with two men in the basement. Then they show the setbacks on how they were abducted ... NOT SCARY! Why? Because we already know what happens to them, seeing how we Come on the result of the attack. THESE EFFECTIVE! Move the story! What's more, unfortunately, the real story was, at best, scarce. I couldn't disturb the "characters" of these annoying, pathetic excuses and the actor didn't help. Cary Elwes was mostly strong and then at the end of the day she started to cry like a lost child, while struggling to keep her American accent in tact (it didn't work with the audience I saw it was in seam). It led him to a rash and an idiotic decision, even though the easiest way of thinking was not. He had other options. Better. LARGE ONES. Even because of its intense emotional state (terribly communicating), it was still irrational. I didn't buy it. BAD WRITING ALERT! Moreover, even if certain sequences were played straight and freely, they were painfully predictable. I constantly found, by tapping my mouth, unexpectedly that an unexpected queue ended. It happened for the whole movie. I saw every "twist" coming. Twenty minutes to the film I called the killer's identity, not to mention his relationship with his "accomplice" as SOON as they appeared on the screen. Better action could have overshadowed the terrible script. Instead, the actors could have tattooed "RED-HERRING" or "ACCOMPLICE" over their forehead. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, I was completely outraged that I was even wasting my fragment on this film and the whole theater was hysterically frightening. You really think they're watching Monty Python's movie. I would also laugh if I was not so tempted by the complete and complete failure of the movie to do something that he intended. When we left, there was a (no joke) line to talk to the theater manager to get their money back (did not happen). I was absolutely positive that the movie was a box. Next week you could not imagine that my "Saw" shock found it to be the first hit and EVERYONE talks about it (mostly individuals who found "Napoleon Dynamite" a thoughtful epic story and thought "satire" was some type of rubber). I'm so sick to hear people praise this movie, which I often feel like I'm going to vomit. It is entertainment for the weakest and easiest mind of mankind. Those who find some strange Jigsaw clown dolls who are driving in a tricycle (it's a doll? Tap it over and leave it so scary?). <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong, I own every "Friday 13th", love my splatter movies, thought "Napoleon Dynamite" was fun, couldn't get Freddy, Michael, Pinhead or Leatherface, is a font of recognition unknown horror gems and rank "Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Bearings" among my 10 best favorite toys. But do I understand that these movies are not the most complex American cinema to offer? I appreciate them for what they are? fast, easy fun. "Saev" is a movie. The film strives to be a smart and semi-complex, unpleasant little excitement and bastard against irritating, tedious time, money, energy and cellulose waste. All accounts are scary. Each copy must be burned with weak-minded fans. Shame on you all. <br /> <br /> Can I see "Saw II"? Maybe after I took Liquid Drano's double picture before I cast out my eyes and white hot-cabob brochet in my ears and colon. My Rating: 0/10. Avoid at all costs.
