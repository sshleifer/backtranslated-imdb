In essence, the inactive film has two good guys (Fong and Roundtree), adopted against two bad guys (Mitchell and Pierce). Fong is perhaps the most unpleasant leadership of the 80s, the small part of Roundtree is far from his "Shaft" days and Cameron Mitchell adds another shameful role to his career. Murder "(this man was once an actor detained, now he has come to wear his own flowers for flowers and complains about bleeding his carpets.) Only Stack Pierce acts with some dignity, not worrying about violence: most of it is too bad for anyone offend (* 1/2)
