o Dear God, I had to watch this movie four times in my nursing house, and whether it was a terrible story about sex and weapons, and a very inexplicable act if you are not at the gun point to avoid it. Ving Rhames also gave some of the most terrible acts in his films, because one part of this film didn't laugh or made me jump or feel emotions that I would be surprised that people actually enjoyed it, but that would be in my five worst movies, where music wasn't good at it and the story I thought was made by a couple of guys who ordered pizza and just sat down, wrote ten points and then made the film absolutely terrible
