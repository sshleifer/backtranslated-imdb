so when the boy meets and he says, "I want you to see my erection!" don't worry, maybe he wants you to watch the movie he did, how his house was built. yes! this is the only thing that happens in this movie! it's like the worst Warholian BEEP I've ever seen! it is like filming the interior of the toilet before it is rinsed, it is actually less interesting to look at than that. <br /> <br /> But if you look at Lennon's erection, you should be warned that he put a lot of background on the noise in it. I mean, really, it's like building attacking hell or something else! in the meantime, the building in progress is growing, and the erection can be done (in almost 20 minutes, which achievement). <br /> <br /> So if someone asks you to check your erection, make sure he wants to save it all.
