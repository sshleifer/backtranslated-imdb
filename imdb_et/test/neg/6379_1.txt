I've tried to look at this example on several occasions, and every time I found it to be a lovely humor. <br /> <br /> One thing to mention is that it is only based on the ridicule that has been done in the republics. In short, it is basically a political opinion of a democratic party, which is said to be humor. <br /> <br /> All Mr. Stewart is a wisecrack of what Republicans have done. I do not think that the left on the left has such a real content that they themselves have to determine how much they hate Republicans. <br /> <br /> -LD <br /> <br /> _____________________________ <br /> <br /> my belief: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
