Wow, what is a racist, filthy piece of pulp rubbish and an insult to the great genre of Western countries. <br /> <br /> Use it? Gender scenes are abundant, scary is abundant, violence and gore are a lot ..... all that makes contemporary films so good, especially those who prefer classical movies. It's a slip that gives old people ammunition to today's movies. <br /> <br /> In some way, I just can't get a picture of naked male scenes in Randolph Scott or Gene Autrey. Also, I can't listen to "mother!" shouted here and there. I doubt this word was about 100 years ago. But here the f-word is so common that you think you're looking at a story that focuses on today's urban areas, not on the west of the 1800s. <br /> <br /> Prediction? What if all the white characters were good guys and every black person was disgusting, brutal villain? Do you think someone can complain about a racist film? Home come when we don't hear the attack when the opposite - as shown in this movie - is shown in hundreds of theaters all over the country? Remember this name. Apparently, he's the contemporary filmmaker "Ed Wood". Even Spike Lee wouldn't be racist. You can't make this movie much worse.
