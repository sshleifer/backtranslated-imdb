Comebacks is a scam for inspiring sports movies and let me just say it is not good. Tom Brady (director) probably found it fun to have sports movies (Gridiron Gang, Invincible, and even Miracle! Until the longest yard and Dodgeball-yes Dodgeball!) Moving and a couple of sex jokes would be a more fun thing because the plane! Well, he was wrong. They made such a blow, you thought it was written in a week. I found that if the director loves the genre, the film is good. Of course, Brady does not love the genre he is spamming. This movie is a messy garbage that doesn't need to be viewed, so don't see it!
