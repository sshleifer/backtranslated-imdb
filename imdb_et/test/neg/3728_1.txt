It was undoubtedly the worst film I ever sat. And it says a lot because I've seen the share of my terrible movies. Seriously, the script did not have any respectable character. How fit that the plot was flat, there was no intelligence. And although I haven't seen all of my other movies, I've always enjoyed my performances. It's not that it was bad, but the whole story was moral.
