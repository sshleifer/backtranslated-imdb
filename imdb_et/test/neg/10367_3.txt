This one and one before Toulon's revenge and the next seem to be completely different from the first two movies, where the dolls were not that nice. This is basically the choice of your series, the first two to go together and paint the dolls as killers, while the next three are the good guys. It plays a lot, like a series of episodes with a cheese that is as good as the third part, and I never wanted to try and watch the fifth part of the series. Basically, a baby gets dolls, while some strange dark lord or something sends his evil dolls to kill, this dark lord looks like some enemy from one of those living Japanese shows like Ultraman. The movie is over before you know it, but it has to get a credit for not seeing the film very painfully. Just for many plot holes and things to be considered the right movie. You see the man who played Toulon in the last movie, though then you have a very anti-climate fight and this movie is over before it actually starts.
