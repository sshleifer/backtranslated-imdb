Being a gay man who lived through this tedious documentary period, I was eager to see how the matter was dealt with. Unfortunately, filmmakers wasted what could have been an energetic and understandable way to enlighten their collective gay history. This film only concerns the New York period, ignoring the rest of the country. While I spent quite a lot of time at NYC this time, I can assure you that there was a homosexual life outside of Manhattan! The men interviewed here are the same "A" queens who thought they were better than anyone else in the 70s, and here they are rejoicing in the nostalgic and still throwing attitude. The film should at least have attempted to cover major issues such as race, age, growing homosexual "caste system" based on prosperity, body image and "clones" rise, discrimination of subgroups in the community, and the ability to grow a decent mustache (which was very important in the 70s!). Unfortunately, we have no such presentations and the interviewed memories do not differ from my memories. If you were there for a decade, you will enjoy archive photos and high-profile home movies that have been worshiped by bars and discos. If you weren't there, this movie seems to be boring. It should have been so much more, but unfortunately this is not the case. Two letters to run the memory ... I'm still not going to Anvil!
