I really don't know where to start here. just imagine a movie that is so bad in every sense, from action to requisites to anger the story. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen and that says a lot because I've seen some bad things. When I saw this movie, I knew it was a blade knock, but I thought it was kung fu and vampires. This is as long as I put it in my DVD player. How Ron managed to get something cool as vampires and martial arts over me. First, it works. I didn't expect much here to get started because his action film and B one, but the acting here is so bad that I couldn't disturb it. expressions and vocal tones were out of place, almost the whole film had no emotion and if it was so ridiculous, I thought I was watching Mad TV. For example, a girly man screams out of Derek when he has to kill a captain who wouldn't have been born. All in all, I've seen better action when playing primary school. but there is an action. is not even right compared to what has been done late in the action cinema. but still this act was not suppressed at all, as Ron's hall seems to have some martial arts skills. but even the skills he has are hidden by the stupid things he does, such as the part of the movie where he starts spinning and then the camera changes. I almost knocked on the pillow. And the battle scene where his prison friend fights for vampires, turning his hands on them. WOW.OR is a part of a prison where Derek suddenly knows the magic and can pre-form songs that make tap water with holy water. and as far as the props go. Weapons look like walmart toys, teeth are stolen from Halloween costumes and words don't describe how bad CG graphics are. I can feel the way about all the wrong things in this movie and trust me that it's just the tip of the iceberg. it only got 2 because it made me laugh. although I laughed at how bad the film was, laughs laughing. I would say to avoid vampire assassin if you don't want to laugh at a horrible movie or plan to torture for a long time and want to practice
