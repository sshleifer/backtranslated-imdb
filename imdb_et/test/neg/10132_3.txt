Natalie Wood represents Courtney Patterson, a polio disability singer who tries to avoid becoming a victim of her first love affair with her partner Marcus Simon, who was played by Wood's real wife Robert Wagner. The film is severely cut, but most of the other scenes show a very weak hand from the director, who allows Wagner to consistently somnambulate, put waste on clean and nuanced performance, which is also a fine soprano. The script is somewhat narrow, but the persistent nature of Wagner's dramatic shortage is unfortunately in place, as he is given free hands to put his desultory stare Wood, which must prevent the actor from being taken away. The progress of these relationships is insecure and this, together with the embarrassing editing, leads the viewer to be less confident about what is changing, motivation is almost completely ignored in writing. Although cinematography stands out in one short scene when the wood is placed on the terrace, the closed door stays in the middle of the sound, while the camera constantly pulls the eye out, showing his helplessness and weakness. A more controlled direction would have allowed performers, even the hip Wagner, to scale up their relationship by binding; since it was released, there is usually a lack of enormous commitment.
