There's something rotten about this movie, and basically it's the way he turns the evil and twisted character into a hero, taking advantage of our compassion for his apparently horrible situation. Sampedro, like many who have lost hope, choose suicide. The fact that he has been considering it for over 26 years makes his condition worse, but the belief that we should do whatever one asks, even if it means ending life, is, in my opinion, deeply wrong. What is the contrast with the resurrective example of the scientist Stephen Hawkings, who has suffered much longer for much worse! But with the moral upside down, the film appears in the worship of the hero, and people who disagree are painted with simple idiotic conditions. A little room is especially delicately at the meeting with the priest (deliberately manipulating a real life encounter with a much younger priest). In this way, I think the film is similar to the will of the Riefenstahls Triumph. The crazy idea is that everyone should have the right to take their own life if they feel that they cannot live it anymore. No matter whether you are physically or psychologically damaged, there are people who think you are right to choose. The same people are likely to be abortion. Its all part of the current tendency to get suffering or the eyes of sufferers, brushing it under the carpet, mammy says it. OK, and we all feel very happy. So we go on a slippery road, believing that some lives, just not worth living, and then we decide that if some people can't decide for themselves, then we bring the country to their decision. Enter Adolf Hitler directly from this other Oscar competitor "der Untergang". Of course, Hitler believes that he is doing exactly what nature is doing to destroy the weak. Under his regime were forced abortions among "weaker" strains, people with mental disabilities were silently put down and the Jews "gased" with gas, he would have approved this film and why not because it was not in line with his philosophy ... "some lives are not just alive". I'm different from Ramon Sampedro, Hitler and all the people involved in making this movie. Human life is sacred, it is not right, it is a gift and Nobody wants to be born, who can choose death, not religion, its weak and helpless protection, something that this film does a lot to undermine!
