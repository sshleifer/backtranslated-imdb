I feel that many people liked this film (not all people, but many of them) because they don't want to admit they don't understand it. People who want you to be so avant garde and trendy who think Lynch is a genius. They are both big but neither is a messiah because so many fanboys want to believe. No director can change the world, so cool. And both sometimes make successful pulls, it just happens. Everyone has a bad day. And it is clear that because this film was actually the first pilot and then the hacking feature film, it was not done with all the passion and imagination that should make the film. Faced with it, much of the film is an incomprehensible misunderstanding that cannot be understood. We all can make sense, Lynch may have an opinion, but none of it. It was uneven on the screen. True, the first part was similar to a deliberately twisted throughout interesting story, but then this falters. I can almost scream a picture of David Lynch, forcing the team to gather around him and explain to all of them: "Look how crazy and we are! Isn't that big? Weird and crazy work when it is a by-product of your style. And tired when you go out of your way to do something, it's like all those half-assed Pulp Fiction throwing backs that came out after Pulp Fiction.
