Isn't it frustrating how the Cartoon Network's most violent comic is targeted at girls? While I would not watch the soldiers shoot down and burn in a private Ryan or Brother band, it would be nice if there were comics on television or at least something I could watch to satisfy my violent demands. And something I wouldn't look at. I saw some episodes (I should actually hit it) and I had to sit through the movie (now where do I find the weapon?) And it is quite clear that it lost its spark after the first few episodes. If you like to see 500-foot monsters that can destroy huge cities in a matter of seconds to kill toddlers at a height of about one foot, this is a must-see. But after a few minutes it will be very boring, and even in such an exhibition, even the original ideas will become dull. The film seemed like a long-lasting episode (I don't remember it) and the villain should have been more scary than the green monkey. This exhibition is laughing. After the episode passes, it pulls out the same basic episode, and while it may sometimes try some secret and intrigue, the end is always the same - "Powerpuff Girls Saves the Day!" Everything is good and nice, but everything is very, very repetitive ... I give it to 3 out of 10 to be the only CN comic to turn around violence, even though it's aimed at girls so I don't tune ever for that. I have created myself as a fan of war and violence films and I will not destroy this reputation ...
