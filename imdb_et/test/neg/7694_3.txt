what shame our first film is so bad ........................... hi hi sham what did you do in this movie: (.. it is terrible! and the director :( .. there is no story in this movie. I was asleep when I watched this movie. It is disappointing and most of the team is not Saudi Arabia. It should be a comedy film, but it doesn't have the essential elements of comedy, < br /> <br /> I know this for the first time in a cinema in Saudi Arabia, but I look forward to Kaif Al Halist's movie is the presence of some talented actors who did not give many texts to explode their talents Finally, I would like to hear your comment on this movie ... is it bad or what?
