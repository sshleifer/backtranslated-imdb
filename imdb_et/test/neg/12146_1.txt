It's a joke, right? Can't be a real movie? Not even a real video? Give some Harvey Milk High School child a video camera and they can make a better movie about it. The filmmaker can't be serious ... right? Is it satire? Comedy? Drama went terribly wrong? The script is as conceivable and boring as is conceivable. With a better scenario, ten locked monkeys in a laptop computer could come. Dialogue is not a cliché. The Clichéd dialogue can raise the crap of vacation that is similar to the camp's fun, but it is not and it is not. The worst worst - a homeowner wanders into a dramatic scene in a private apartment with a bathrobe that carries a panic like "Honeymooners" episode. Whaaa ??? I've seen better action from high school drama clubs. One of the drivers is an attractive lunk, the other is not. They can't even manage convincing kisses. So much romance. Supporting players are jaw-up-over-the-top. <br /> <br /> Everybody has stressed the nauseating soundtrack and the sound seems to be stored in the back room toilet. Most of the dialogue is (grace) incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> This obsolete cinematic fruit cake is not even worth being the next ROCKY HORROR or MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3,000 gay holiday. It's just bad. Any way. VISITIONS OF SUGARPLUMS can't dance with their heads - they drag your expectations. Keep your egg and stare at the neighbors' holiday light - it's a better time to spend.
