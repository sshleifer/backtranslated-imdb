This little cheap is only significant because it is the worst film Abbott and Costello. It is all strange: exquisite music, terrible choreography (check unpleasant conductors' dancers), cheesy special effects and kits, wooden actors (they are barely at the high school level in their profession and were not heard later). and script without one laugh. The better times were the comedy duo. Abbott and Costello meet Captain Kidd, as do the TV series that were sometimes inspired. But skip it.
