Don't take it because the premise of this movie is good. This is, but it's not a good movie, it does. Comedies need a well-occupied script and a masterful direction. Unfortunately, this is not badly filled on film. Leconte, a good director of other genres, does not offer his comic (Les Bronzes series is another example). <br /> <br /> Comic timing is terrible. Some jokes are telegraphed. Some have been filmed again from other films. Others just sit there when they give you time to laugh. The plot has dirty sublots (allergic daughter, lesbian co-owner) and simply does not develop or surround the viewer. It's not funny and it's not plausible for another. <br /> <br /> Compare it to any Billy Wilder comedy (some like this hot, foreign affair, etc.) or Leconte compatriot, Francis Veber, a true GENIUS French comedy (Le Diner de Cons, Le Placard, Les Comperes, La Chevre , La Grande Blonde, etc.) and see the difference in their narrow scripts, big comedy actions and timing. jokes that lead to the next. <br /> <br /> Mon Meilleur Am's double viewing would be a cruel and unusual punishment, not a good comedy sign.
