The Loki, the Norwegian god of trouble, creates a mask that gives the bearer a cup-like power. His father, Odin, is spending the rest of the film looking for a mask that does not cause mankind any more grief. In the meantime, the mask is the keeper of the children who suppress the mask's abilities. Etc, etc. If it sounds like a pretty thin line, that's it. Add to this the fact that the film is treated incorrectly from start to finish and the result is very bad. You can find worse movies, but you need to actively search for them. <br /> <br /> Most often, a woman's son has been presented at the intellectual level of preschool children, but considering scenes such as masculine baby urination, which is urinated in six different directions, including his father, it seems unlikely. I asked my son, who thought he'd been the target audience for the film, and he replied to "Convicted Rogues", forgetting that the Constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. <br /> <br /> Bad film is not sin, or hell is full. What makes this sin is that $ 72 million was spent on this garbage. To see things, the day after we looked at the woman's son, my son and I looked at "good night and happiness", a film that gathered six academic award candidates (including the best picture), and it was brought for $ 7 million. This is correct. Just one tenth of the mask spent on the amount spent. It is then a sin - a good flow of cash flow through the sewerage system, if it could have been better used for watching movies or feeding starving children, or for almost any other purpose. Manufacturers should really be ashamed.
