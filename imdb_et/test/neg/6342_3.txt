But a little more precise, I don't think it would be as bad as it could be. Though the actors (who are famous famous) did not do a very good job. Directors' fault? Could I say so much to the script? Anyway, if you are after lots of cool guns and action it's not a movie for you, but they won't run a lot of ww2 vintage weapons. Fun fun :) Well I think I can say more, but it just doesn't feel like it's worth it. If you're desperate enough or the Hackman freak sees it otherwise! <br /> <br /> Life is good and booming
