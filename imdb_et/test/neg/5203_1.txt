As a big fan of the original Delta Force operation, I thought I was picking this movie. I thought it couldn't be too bad. But here's a list of things I learned from the Delta Force 4 operation: Deep Fault. - The Delta Force, despite being an elite of the American Armed Forces, are mostly overweight men in their late 30s and early 40s. - The Delta Force, despite being an elite of the American Armed Forces, is carrying standard pistols or AK-47 on its most important missions. <br /> <br /> - The Delta Force, despite being an elite of American Armed Forces, has not learned that, during hidden missions, wearing bright red skiers and moving around in open spaces is not yours. <br /> - If you drop a Molotov cocktail into a tank, it will explode externally like a garnet. <br /> <br /> - If you get into a tank fire, you can escape, although the breathing can cause minor breathing difficulties. <br /> <br /> - You can die with one standard gun, but you can live even though the sniper gun has hit several times and with AK-47 a few times. <br /> <br /> - Fighting hand in hand, members of the Delta Force, despite being an elite of the American Armed Forces, regularly run on railroads. > <br /> - When the bad guys approach you on a slow-moving train, there's nothing to worry about - they can't figure out how to get an automatic weapon fire, let alone hit someone from 5 meters (50 feet) between at least 50 attempts. <br /> <br /> - If you are short acting actors, recycle them - Operation Delta Force 1's bad boy plays a good man named Mac in Delta Force 4, and the guy who played Mac in Delta Force 3 is now playing Skip Lang , another good man. <br /> <br /> Delta Force is not the right armed terrorist, even when he is trying to load his weapon. <br /> <br /> - Grenades thrown into the Delta Force members will explode in a clash with the ground. The explosions thrown by non-Delta Force personnel are exploding in exactly where Delta Force members are grenades back to bad guys. <br /> <br /> - Tanks can drive faster than conventional trucks. > <br /> - Military and personal armies are using exactly the same chopper used by the UN operation Delta Force 1. <br /> <br /> - When the chopper arrives, this chopper doesn't see a bad guy when you lie down. <br /> <br /> - Repeated chest imaging results in minor injury. This person kills knees in 5 seconds. <br /> <br /> - Delta's troops steal cars from old people when they travel abroad, because the US military doesn't give them any means of transport. It can also explain why they got public transport. <br /> <br /> As you can see, this is not the best time for making movies, but it's a good laugh.
