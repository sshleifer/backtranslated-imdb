If you can ripen your stomach, this film should laugh several times. It was at least for me. I only mention one of my favorite elements: "fish" "swimming" "underwater shots". The sound that comes with these frames is also great. <br /> <br /> One last comment: William Katt is actually a pretty decent actress. I hope he will get one more day a day; looking at her as the "greatest hero of America," a few decades ago I had a fun part of my childhood and has not been very visible ever since. He felt depressed in such a movie. Someone gives him a fun job with a good show or something.
