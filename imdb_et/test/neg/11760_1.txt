You can't really blame Che's respect for the filmmaker because the industry is on the money. Most of the stories heard by this "freedom fighter" are an absolute trick made by the Communist Cuban Government after Che's death. Che was killing from day one. Here is a list of the great things Che made to Cuba 1) Tens thousands of innocent Cuban men, women and children to satisfy their power. <br /> <br /> 2) Destroy Cuban economy and good condition with the rest of the world. The Cuban Peso was equal to the American dollar. It is now basically worthless. <br /> <br /> 3) Continuously failed in all matters involving diplomacy, the economy and the army. He never did it in his first year at the Medical School and he was just in one real battle where he gave up a fully loaded weapon. <br /> <br /> 4) He took over Cuba's largest real estate created by himself. She had a yacht, a 60-inch custom TV from America, a pool and ocean views. So much of a material lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Today, Cuba is absolutely poor, and you have no one but Che and Castro brothers thank you for that. If you go to Cuba today, you cannot get out of the tourist areas. You will find slums, beggars and prostitutes. <br /> <br /> If you think anything I say is wrong, do some lessons: Compare Cuban exports 1950/60. who lived or had parents in the Cuban Revolution of the 1960s, read all the reports of the murdered innocents, read the people who served under Che and Castro, and fled for what he was evil, disgusting man, please, please always remember to read or view everything objectively. IT.
