What the hell is this !? It was my first reaction to this film (my first reaction contained more swearing). It's not Star Wars! Star Wars is a battle of space, this film has no one. Star Wars is a force, this film has only a slower witch with a magic circle. Star Wars is a flip-flop battle, this movie is not worth noting. Star Wars is humor, this movie is not. Star Wars is far, far from the galaxy, this film is HORSES !!! In addition, how did Lucas get the mad idea to take the lead of a five-year-old baby? Great, great disappointment. Do you like Star Wars? Don't look at it! 1 out of 10
