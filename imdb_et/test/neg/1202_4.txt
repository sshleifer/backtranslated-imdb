... But it definitely deserves only 4/10 stars and no more. A moral fool of a child's father is a fighter pilot who gets off an Arab country. They never name a country in the movie, its really ridiculous, they just refer to some Arab people vaguely, this film is very unknown. But Lamar from Nerd's revenge is here, he is the main character of the friends Doug Masters. Well, Doug Masters, who lives on the basis of the Air Force, is a pilot of his father's Air Force, but he can't get to the Air Force Academy, a plot (with the help of the spouses) to steal two reagents and go to save his father. Yes, exactly - it's one of the biggest movies ever made !!! Louis Gossett Jr is fantastic in his role. You can say that he wanted to kill Doug Masters from the whole movie. Anyway, you might think of the end of the plot, I can't believe they made three sequences for this movie.
