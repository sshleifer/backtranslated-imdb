It comes from an adult who first came to see a child-oriented film and surprised the adult humor that was in Emperor New Groove. I liked Kronk the most, so I was glad when I heard about the result (sp) that didn't contain anything other than "Kronk". <br /> <br /> I just looked at Kronk's new groove. days because i had to turn it off, i was so half so boring. Finally, I looked the rest of the day the next day and unfortunately the second half was just the same flat as the first. <br /> <br /> As a Disney movie, I waited for musical scenes, but they were full and they were not amusing. The great thing about the New Groove emperors was that it could be understood by a wide audience, toddlers to adults. Kronks New Groove honestly did nothing for me and my girlfriend, and we both loved the first. It is really aimed at small children, comedy is quite childish, the musical scene is not very well done and the plot itself is very bright. <br /> <br /> Save yourself money and rent this movie as far as possible for no other view. I was very disappointed and shocked when this movie was together. These films failed to make the reality (Kronk), which is amazing in itself. <br /> <br /> Obviously all of these opinions are different, but I'm very amused, I usually enjoy the sequel (sp) when others discredit them, mostly because I loved the first so much that I needed more characters and no matter what how bad the plot I enjoyed the movie. I can't say the same for that, I would never have guessed that I would have turned it off halfway because of pure boredom. <br /> <br /> Buy with your risk.
