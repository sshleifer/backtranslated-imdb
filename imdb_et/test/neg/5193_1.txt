Although the film has one redemption function, ie some striking images, eg. fired a sheep who had been hanging from a wooden raft on a funeral or boats leaving the village (which seemed to affect the approach of warships to the fantastic "Fellini Satyricon"). were more photographic than cinematographic and would be more appreciated if they were hung on a wall in an art gallery when it was affixed to a painfully slow-moving film that appeared in 162 minutes and suffers from a terrible dialogue, an extremely bad character. symbolism and heavy styling. This is the first movie I've seen in Angelopoulos and his reputation before him, I waited much better, but I can honestly say that this is one of the worst films I've ever seen, and I'm not going to look out for a director in the future another job. Four friends with whom I went to agree.
