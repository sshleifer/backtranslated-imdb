Again, I seem to be the only person on the planet who is able to criticize Japanese films made before 1970. The "Explosive Fire" (1959) is another seemingly endless "classic" line that will get any praise for obvious good reasons. As much as I love to generalize and psychoanalize all those filmmakers who have such a tough taste, it is almost impossible to rationalize why someone thinks that a badly made fluffy should proclaim a "masterpiece". What I find to be truly ironic is that the "classics" of derivatives, such as "fire plain", focus so much on making "movie inside" (orthodox standards like script writing, display, camera work, etc.). it always seems that the "classic" with the highest respect is the most inadequate in these very standards. For example, one of the most widespread copies for a filmmaker is a verbal exposition where the characters explain everything to the viewer, even if the design scenario is completely artificial. The most surprising is that the first scene "Fires on the Plin" uses this indolent tactic to the extreme. <br /> <br /> After a funny dizziness, the next senseless dialogue with the viewer is attacking: "Why can't you land Tacloban to the west with heavy fires, we lost two-thirds of our men, and our artillery was dumped in transit, trying to reach Burauen airport, crossing the average mountains," but without the artillery. The enemy counter-attack forced the valley over the valley. So why exactly is one sign that tells another character something he already knows? Oh yes, it's the film makers too lazy to think of the more natural ways of this information The quality film would actually look like these events actually, or at worst would involve dialogue with one of those who don't know about these events. Heck, even in the viewer-focused section, the summary would have been better than it appeared here. <br /> <br /> Such poor quality the movie is full of "Plains on the Plain" at the moment where this film seems to have been written by imbeken imbek. For example, a wiring harness leads to a Japanese brown wrapped skeleton. Instead of doing a natural thing like? oh i dont know? giving the depressive manners, the sign "Japanese soldiers" goes out. Thanks friend, but I could have thought of it myself. <br /> <br /> Even worse, this movie is saturated with too dramatic ploy. The most ridiculous scene includes a pair of boots. Picture it. The soldier travels along and finds a pair of worn boots. One might think that such a finding is totally useless, but it turns out that the soldier's boots are in even worse condition, so he picks up the worn boots and leaves his SUPER worn boots down. Well, I get a point. Soldiers in a tough form? a fact that has already been clearly highlighted by their worn boots. The scene is ridiculous, but I was ready to go until the other soldier arrives! You see, he finds that previous soldier SUPER worn boots and messages? get ready, cause here it comes? that her boots are SUPER DUPER worn boots! Happy man, he picks up SUPER worn boots and leaves his SUPER DUPER worn boots down. But you see, that's not all? because the Wednesday soldier arrives! He thinks that the former soldiers were spending SUPER DUPER with their SUPER DUPER worn boots. As both couples suck, he throws them both aside and smiles as he continues barefoot. At this point, I was ready to throw my television through my living room window. The difficult course of this sequence, overdramatism and ultimate absurdity are not making bad films. This is a bad film process by SUPER DUPER. <br /> <br /> There are several similar, completely stupid moments. Similar to the time when the token asks someone, "Hey, are you dead?" As a guy begins to answer "Yes" when he actually pailed. I am also the first to understand the performance of a leading actor who is the main posterchild of artificial response. I laughed at the opening head when her head slipped on that face, the buggy funny expression back to its place. <br /> <br /> The fact that this trivial fluff gets an average IMDb rating of 8.4 if it is a certified masterpiece, such as "The Vintage of Two Sisters" (2003) only 7.5, which is a massive height of stupidity. And to think that some people themselves think that "ATOTS" does not make sense. Well, every film may not have completely surprisingly worn boots on SUPER DUPER's side.
