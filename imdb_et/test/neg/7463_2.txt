ATTIC starts well. The somewhat harsh story is largely helpful for two major players and there is a similar character study that takes place here, but the movie goes down quickly when the Carrie Snodgress sign buys a monkey. None of them loves small monkeys. He buys a real big chimpanzee !!! <br /> <br /> This sudden plot device kills the movie basically. It is simply not conceivable that a woman like Snodgres will play, who has a hard time doing something about her dominant father because she buys a chimpanzee out of blue. I mean, come on! Forget it!
