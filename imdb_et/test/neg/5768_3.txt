The story is a marked requirement for the jumper to make an agreement with the devil to find gold and be forced to protect it forever. One of the friends finds gold and talks about the old miner and is forced to blow gold to send him back to hell. <br /> <br /> I mean seriously ... how does this film NOT win the Oscar movie? What is the weighty story of later youngsters from the late 20th century in the 1800s? I love how the monster can't kill the other movies, but they can kick it out ... this movie writes a monster so indestructible. <br /> <br /> Opening the film clearly hangs from Nightmare on Elm Street, but what the hell does not like this movie was the 5-star classic. <br /> <br /> Highlighting a movie is when we introduce a girl who has never been to school. The city, never learned to read or write .... still speaks perfect English, is hot for smoking and wears the latest fashions. How was that Oscar? <br /> <br /> OK, I've made some bad jokes, this movie is clean and just looking at it if you have nothing better to do and all the spice clothes are already in alphabetical order. /> <br /> 2 out of 10
