My first big disappointment with the BBC / Jane Austen flick. The tone is off, the costumes are off, the hair is off, music is out of space and Robert Hardy blesses him, he seems to be really annoyed at such a stink. Even some of the casting is off. No, I take it back, a good director can make a silk purse out of a silk ear. The performances in this matter are so up and melodramatic that it is almost a farce of Jane Austen's story, which is ironic because the Northanger Monastery is a kind of respect / sender of the early Gothic novel. I wanted to drive the woman after a while; who made the decision that he should be such a ninny? I had to immediately look at Pride & Prejudice ('95) to get a bad taste out of the mouth. Phew!
