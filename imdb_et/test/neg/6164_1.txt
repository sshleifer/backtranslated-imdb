Unfortunately, the House of D is just a terrible, ridiculous plot, terrible writing, some mediocre actions and in fact almost everything else about it is right. <br /> <br /> Tom flees from NYC to survive in a single child in Paris and succeeds in persuading a beautiful Parisian girl to finally marry her for French, despite her poor understanding of her language. She's shocked when years later she discovers her "secret"! Riiiight! <br /> <br /> She "presents" her son to her trouble, and we think she thinks it is the biggest birthday gift a father can give to his 13-year-old boy. If only such things were so simple! David Duchovny fails in his wife's role as Tea Leon and strikes again. Leon makes me laugh as a comic, but he's just wrong in this role. <br /> <br /> One of the problems is not a character's liking. I just didn't give the fuck what happened to them. I was rather hoping that Robin Williams and his trademark "child in adult body" fell into the village well, but unfortunately it didn't have to be and we had to endure our simple work all the time. <Br>> <br /> Anton Yelchin and William's daughter Zelda were not bad, but I suspect that others who give it are just because they were not as bad as everybody else in this movie. They weren't great, let me say so. <br /> <br /> This movie has so many stupid and viable aspects - Erykah Badu, bicycle, Catholic school and its moral staff, comfortably stupid characters, etc. - that this review will last forever, so I will finish just saying D The house is a very bad movie and I'm almost embarrassed for Duchovny. <br /> <br /> What bothers me very much is how online friends so strongly encouraged me to see that I was driving a lot of time. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't be so annoyed that this movie is so bad when I just waste a few hours at a local cinema, but I lost the whole day and discovered that my so-called "friends" are either foolish or dishonest, because it's a terrible movie!
