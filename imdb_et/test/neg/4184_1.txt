Just over the box I am writing now, I had to choose a number between 1 and 10 and evaluate this feature film. Unfortunately, there is no way if the number is less than zero, and I have to put something down. If I had my choice, I wouldn't put anything, no number, because there is no number to express the worthlessness of this movie. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch this movie after reading all these terrible stories, make sure there are no sharp or dull objects in the area, which will help you prevent yourself from being killed in the middle of the movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know how this movie was released to the public, it should be locked and guarded around the clock at Fort Knox. I'm angry that this movie was even available to me. I feel that humanity has been deceived, I had no idea that man could be cruel. Stalin, Saddam and Hitler had nothing on this Cowell shower. <br /> <br /> Don't let the movie cover deceive. 1) Scarecrows are not, no one knows why the head is scary. 2) No character on the back of the case is even in a stupid movie! 3) Tagline says something "new month, more victims", no fregging victims were anyone even dead. We don't know if the dam policeman died, and I assume the killer didn't die because it seemed he hit the head with a frigging whiffle ball bat. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favor and stay away from this movie, it wasted about 4 hours of my life. It's right four, I took an hour to watch it (I quickly transmitted a 4-minute zooming scene that didn't show anything in the plot), I watched the TV about an hour after she was gone, considering her life and the direction she was after this nonsense watching went, and then I started crying in the next two hours because I know someone out there sees this movie unfortunately and there is nothing I can stop it.
