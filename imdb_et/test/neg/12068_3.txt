Apparently, the composer of this composite DVD is a writer and director of Friday's 13th and other summer campers. This movie is all - a group of teenagers who want to spend a weekend in a fun, alcoholic and sex-abandoned summer camp called "Camp Blood", an old man who warns them not to go there; and, of course, a crazy machine that keeps on teenage assault and hacking for no reason ... The whole thing could have worked if it was done with a 35 mm film with special special effects. But instead, the special effects are badly done. The killer walks around as if he was a Sunday afternoon walk and the only good films about this movie are the performance of talented mainstream players and the sex scene in the beginning. Other than that - boring and forgotten. Jasper P. Morgan
