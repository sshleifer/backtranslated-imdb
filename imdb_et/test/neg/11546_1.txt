The purpose of this film is to show the middle class family's aspiration to find out what is in the late 1960s in America. Their trips to the rock festival are as far as their renovated old bus gets. Without exceptions, characters are superficial stereotypes. <br /> <br /> If you want to know which well-established Hollywood actors were in charge of these days, just look at the credit. Sal Mineo, I had forgotten how bad his career was! Thank God, his career was restored before his premature death. <br /> <br /> The turkey writers of this television were helpless. Outside the weeds, their gaze was "ridiculous".
