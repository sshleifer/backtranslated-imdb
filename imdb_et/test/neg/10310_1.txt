Oh boy! Oh boy! The worn VHS cover has a picture of Sandra Bullock and its title. I think only the reason they were able to sell the film in the nineties was because of the name of Sandra Bullock. Bullock fans don't have to be disappointed. Sandra is the only thing to watch in this movie and her performance is the only one that can act to call. The rest of the movie? It's fun to watch the first fifteen minutes because it's bad, but after that it gets worse. Much worse. Diverting is terrible. Action is terrible. The script is terrible. The dialogue is terrible. The activity is terrible. Music is actually pretty good. A typical result of the eighties action film. This movie is so bad that it almost goes to what Andy Sidaris has ever done. It is so bad that there is no right word to describe this poor attempt to be a film. But still was Sandra Bullock. And the super cool (sarcasm) Jake LaMotta, who tried to be Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> I think they can now bring out a movie on a DVD. It may be cool! And they should write on the cover: ACADEMY AWARD WINNER SANDRA BULLOCK HONEY <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
