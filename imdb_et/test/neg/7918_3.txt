If you just watched all the dogs go to heaven and learn that there is a sequel, don't look at it. It's terrible. This is absolutely terrible. They hurry to develop signs. For example, Sasha begins to sing how to read her for love. And finally, it seems like a dramatic romance flick than a comedy-adventure movie. They kidnap Charlie out of their character and replace him with a glowing, soft but still rebellious version. <br /> <br /> The humor behind Carface's character is simply lost. He's a completely different dog. He is no longer a cool voice, he is not the villain you love to hate anymore, but he is just one enemy other than SpongeBob, a mermaid man. Speaking of the voices. <br /> <br /> Charlie is completely different. And although it's not terrible, I don't like it. It is terrible compared to the excellent work that Burt Reynolds did for the first film character. Dom DeLuise is wonderful as always, as itchy. This character is true and that's why this movie gets 3/10. Just because Dom DeLuise was still itchy. <br /> <br /> Oh, and my last complaint. I know Ann-Marie's film was made and gone, she's older, etc., but did Charlie forget her completely or what? EVERYTHING in her second movie is not mentioned. I think even mentioning Small Itchy would have been acceptable. (ex. "Charlie, we have to go back. You can't take care of every child who needs salvation.) Or something like that, I mean he died with him, he deserves some kind of reputation. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it if you're looking for a wonderful sequel.
