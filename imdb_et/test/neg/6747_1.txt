Only in the Hollywood audiovisual fiction world could anyone, including the FBI, be so stupid. Good guys are stupid enough that everything they are interested in answering phones, going to the stairwells, all looking for a demolition expert who is all. Oh yes, and then we'll get Hollywood SUPERVILLAIN. He can be shot down, even if he has a vest, and then the long steps are dropped and then there is a surprise to his foolish followers. Every clich√© you can think of in the midline film was used. I only looked at it because Yuki Amami is so hot. Oh, yes, it's nice to see how this FBI agent is morally better when he's pretty sure the opera house is a bomb and he's not sounding. Who writes these scripts ????????????
