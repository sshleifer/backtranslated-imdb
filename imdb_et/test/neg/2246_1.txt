Hooray Headline Errors! After reading and meditating on my comments, my girlfriend and I confirmed that this movie is a perfect trash. This movie lost it to one of these rare Tarantino fans. I wish it was made for nitrate, and all copies are wisely picked up under Tarantino fanboy. This literally unnecessary violence, the plot holes, the drama of the Tarantino table, and the missing character made it profoundly painful and glorified. <br /> <br /> What did it do? And how much was it just because I was too busy with subtitles? I look at my fanubbed anime and ghost authenticity test, but it was superfluous for an English movie. Due to dazzling historical inaccuracy, the constant reading that worked there killed. <br /> <br /> Why pay money to a narrator who has absolutely nothing to do with any character, plot, theme, setting, or other thing? in the movie? If the film needs this manual explanation, it is provided next. <br /> <br /> Historical Research - When it was scattered with interesting elements, he used suits and props suitable for military personnel. even fetched the truth even for historical fiction. Kudos in Mata Hari's reference, although its use for prediction was a bit. Mata Hari was killed on a shooting site that was not hidden in an isolated room. It destroyed any meaning that the reference might have. <br /> <br /> Other reviews mention more than half a dozen respects to other artists in the first 15 minutes. Considering the audience, all these and other references lost to many who would see this movie and everyone who enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> I'm confused about his choices when to start the scene, finish it and what to add. In a movie that was advertised under the action film, why was it necessary to do some testosterone for almost 20 minutes? <br /> <br /> What I believe was a message was trite. The idea of ​​rats and how we act on their original and "who is the rat?" were the best clichés, but in the worst case did not materialize. The mention of American camps to American and German Americans would have added to the moral height of the issue. In the literal sense, the character of every film, who gets the role of speaking, is its own legend. Is this the world where Tarantino lives? <br /> <br /> I'm glad I didn't see it. I'm sorry I looked at it even though it means well-meaning hosts. A rich foundation of ideas was developed, but none of them was realized.
