After reading "The Heart of Darkness", the film did not make it fair. The film puts the book into shame and anyone who has not experienced the book steals the story and plot because the film depicted it so badly. In the film, the characters and sets were just a few of the hopes in the film. The director left out so many important and interesting aspects of the book that made it one of the best literary works ever made. Joseph Conrad, as a writer, was excellent in terms of vocabulary and intelligence. The movie doesn't even show it. Some very important and influential scenes from the book were completely omitted, as Kurtz was not in the boat when he died. Even when Marlow went to Kurtz for news, he reacted differently in the film than in the book. Another big difference was that Marlow saw a picture of a prominent lady at the end of the movie, not in the beginning, like a book. It was influential how the audience perceived Marlow, and the movie was completely confused. There were a number of cheesecake-backed backgrounds and a compliment, a number of bad participants who went with it. There was one exception for the terrible actors and it would be Isaach De Bankol√© who played Mfumu. His character was the best. Although the film was not so big, I would recommend it only if you have read and understood the book very well. So you can see what the differences in the movie and the book are and think about them. If you haven't read the book, I don't recommend the movie because it's a boring, lifeless mess. I loved the book so you should definitely read and enjoy it.
