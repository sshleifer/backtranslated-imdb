I saw it in the theater a few decades ago and the fuzzy memory suggests that I liked it. But in the case of a second sight, two things stand out: (1) Michelle Johnson very bad and (2) very bad music all the time. <br /> <br /> Not all music was bad. Some Brazilian music was good, but the theme song and others who interrupted their way were the worst of the 80s pop music. <br /> <br /> Johnson's voice seemed all wrong, maybe duplicated. It was annoying. <br /> <br /> Positive: (1) The story is not bad, (2) it's interesting to see such a young Demi Moore, (3) Valerie Harper is never better and (4) Johnson saw the inconvenience in stages.
