It seemed so promising in the rental store that the assumption was good and I couldn't wait to get home and watch it. It was an aposting dreamer that is terrible, the action is extremely poorly scripted and Plot takes a nose from the start. Gutenberg makes a miserable result, Sean Bean tries his best, but the script failed to do much. <br /> <br /> It's not even worth it, even if you get it for free (borrow it for example from a friend) Dont like you regret it and waste 90 of your life from mine. <br /> <br /> 0/10
