George Zucco was a fine actor who often played with a blindfold with the ability to. But even he couldn't save that stubborn and flat B-slip. <br /> <br /> Zucco plays the usual mad scientist, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron, who believes that the blood of wolves injected into humans can create invincible wolves who can win World War II (go figure!) Pedro Testing Handyman (Glenn Strange) Zucco Creates werewolf that looks like Dave Allen played in comedy sketches! Pedro is obviously based on Lennie Of Of Mice and Men, and you almost wait to say "Duh, okay, George!" There is one surprising moment when a werewolf kills a child, reaching through the window and grabbing it, but mostly it is a routine and pedestrian - a very pedestrian - 77-minute passage through all the old clich√©s, which are much better than the others. i a revenge motive that has taken a loan from Son Of Frankenstein per se! <br /> <br /> Zucco is wasted and you only have to see him in movies like Sherlock of Sherlock Holmes, Mommy's Hand and dr. Renault's Secret to see how wasted. Some atmospheric scenes are all he has to offer. And the scene where Zucco demonstrates his wolf technique to those who doubt him (again, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde tones) is inadvertently fun. <br /> <br /> Not one of the best 40-year-old B-movies.
