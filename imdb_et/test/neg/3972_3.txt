I'll say it first ... the film would have been a classic classic of the 70's if it had been much better. <br /> <br /> Let's say we'll look at the plot ... it starts with Peter Graves (or is Clarence Oveur?) working on behalf of the president, then this silly college campus-like environment, full of captive goofy truck caps and headphones and slowed down athletes who all act like they are forever ages 8. Shows one man who probably goes to America, having a party, then taken to a medical lab where he is stunned, packed in a plastic bag and then ready to be packed with vegetable packs for vaporizer packs ... okay, he's actually placed on ice so doctors can separate the necessary organs. <br /> <br /> Then it cuts to some other person who thinks that the place where he lives is a bit strange after the beer can be found on the river (from all the equipment on the plot) making him suspicious (damn those beer cans!). He and some equally foolish love interests that he feel they need to have it all, so he leaves him as he escapes through what is basically a big college administrative building with some evidence he discovers cloning. ..and how he is part of it. <br /> <br /> He escapes from his controllers after some have shot, and the old reporter head helps him find his "father" - the man from whom he was cloned. It happens that he is a clone of Peter Graves' brother. After discussing what to do with him and with his evidence, he goes back to find his girlfriend (who has been lobbying in the meantime to be even more stupid, harmless and ready for the SOL team). He has been caught and placed in a cold store, like a slower friend of his Nazi construction since the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Graves 'brothers' house confronted several deaths, including Graves. The reporter boy and his wife are killed in the midst of an exciting bomb chat. It seems that the conspirators have somewhat won ... <br /> <br /> Then it turns out that Peter Graves can survive when he is through the miracle of the cloned parts and the second voice. speaking to me, as reporters face cloning. <br /> <br /> Certainly MST3K feeds, but overall low levels of spectrum.
