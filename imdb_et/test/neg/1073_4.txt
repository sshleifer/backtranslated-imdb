I couldn't associate this movie. I'm surprised that people praise it for being so "realistic". How many people in your school were the victims of incest? How many homosexual jocket were there? How many silent people you never noticed have committed suicide? Hmmm. OK, you don't know, even if they were. But these are indeed explosive issues that many of us never do. And yet there are so many teenagers who have fine problems that could have been studied. But hey, where's that entertainment? <br /> <br /> With a girl who committed suicide, I find it exploitative. I really think that many people in high school at some stage feel invisible, ignored, and unwanted. But who owns someone who violently commits suicide one day when ignored and left unnoticed? The filmmaker decided that this girl would commit suicide to make the film more provocative. And the graphic nature of suicide to make it even more provocative. I didn't buy it as a real life scenario. <br /> <br /> Problems of other students I didn't speak to completely. Bullying has been investigated, but it has been done to death, we all know that it will continue and it is indeed a matter of solving this person. Cupboard for homosexuality? Pfft, the second cliché is rolled out. It's a matter of too many clichés. I thought the end started. If this makes sense, predictability was predictable. You have all these signs with explosive problems and probably none. And I thought about the nature of this character if he was not a malicious suicide victim? And definitely enough .. <br /> <br /> One thing I say, and this is the love of saving the movie, is that it doesn't glamorize suicide. Suicide is very graphic and heart-breaking. It is a powerful scene (no matter how it is) and one that leaves suicide as a simple choice. But the film is not really a very imaginative and usable stereotype. <br /> <br /> Not bad, but definitely not a groundbreaking OR worth a 17-minute standing in Cannes?
