OK box to look interesting, opening is great music and its glove original to make it all OK. But when the movie starts ... well its first video movie, I watched Ghost Lake and its very similar movie, except for her still worse. At first it was an interesting story, but the whole film looks like a film taken by a number of university students. The special effect that I am laughing on is that blood looks like a mixture of red and white. it was done with a program that I can buy at a local computer store. The whole movie is filmed daily (a very big movie that should be horror) and there is no gore (only 1 scene and it looks both home-made and untrustworthy) and near the blood (it can be considered a big deal) taking into account the appearance of blood and 1 demon for the whole movie. The story goes somewhere, it gives you the impression that it will never start, there are so many useless scenes that are only made to give the movie an average duration (if a demon searches for a dog about 4 minutes ...) Too much slower things . Well you can just say that this movie is a Z series and very bad. All the cool ideas are lost and you get a cheesy movie. This boring my long and I'm not the man who gets bored with the movie, a man who's even dead and alone in the dark, Uwe Boll and you probably know the name that is one of the worst directors but here seems too much like some guys who want to make the movie fun. Plus for us French speaker (harsh I understand English I prefer to watch a movie in my native language) there's a usual videoville bad translation. In a regular film, it is hardly seen that he is not an actor (you have to check your lips, etc.). Here you just have to listen to it and you know it. Very interesting
