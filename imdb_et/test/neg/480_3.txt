As a fan of Bruce Campbell for almost two decades, I was delighted to have the opportunity to see my last movie on the big screen where the man was going. Unfortunately, the "Screaming Brain Man" was disappointing. <br /> <br /> In Bulgaria - where the Sci-Fi channel makes its original Saturday night - "People Screaming Brain" is a curious combination of "50's B-movie horror, body-changing comedy, violent vengeance" and redundant dirty romantic reconciliation. If that doesn't make sense, there is no "man with a screaming brain". Campbell plays the General Director of a pharmaceutical company who visits Bulgaria with his foreign spouses in an inexplicable attempt to invest in the semi-completed subway system of the former communist state. Two of the former KGB agents led the cab driver and all three eventually met his dead wife in revenge. <br /> <br /> A local scientist (Stacy Keach) and his funny assistant (Ted Raimi), who has developed a technique that enables tissue transplantation without rejection, steal the bodies and places some of Campbell's damaged skull in the cab driver's brain. They also put their wife's brain into a robotic body that they just have at hand. <br /> <br /> Campbell flees, the voice of a skull and cab driver, whose transplanted brain tissue controls the left side of his body - with his head to find and kill a gypsy. (The robot's husband does the same.) <br /> <br /> But first try to mimic Steve Martin / Lily Tomlin's "All Me" when Campbell's two personalities are fighting over a restaurant dinner. Just as he played his evil hand at Evil Dead II, Campbell is able to live his body with more than one mind. <br /> <br /> Sometimes Screaming is the closest to another Steve Martin's film, "The Man With Two Brain", as it also takes a foolish approach to the 50's sci-fi clich√©s. However, it is trying to get too little results, and it is doubling in Ted Raim's semi-understandable Bulgarian oaf, who gets too much time on the screen. (There's nothing against Raim, it's just that he's better in smaller doses.) <br /> <br /> Finally, it's not as embarrassing (or funny) to satisfy as looting, nor is it serious enough to enjoy the B-movie Peach. I was pleased that Campbell was already behind screening when it was stopped, as I was afraid to say, "Gee, Bruce, it was ... nothing." <br /> <br /> The best praise I can give if a movie is that at least pictures are stuck in the emulsion. And it was twice as good as "Alien Apocalypse".
