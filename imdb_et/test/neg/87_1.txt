I can't believe the high marks people have given on this site. Writing is incredibly bad for people who come just in time and reveal exactly what the heroine does to try and escape. (Don't you just hate it when it happens?). And doing so is so, very bad, that you can chew on all the chewing terrain. <br /> <br /> The walnut keeps its hostage. to get help instead of clotting, if for a moment he was brave enough to worship these same children. <br /> <br /> He is finally free and alone at home. His chance to go for the help he does? Crashes around the house and falls behind. He's in the basement, locked. So what does he do? Takes a little nap. Come on! Most of the movie is a nut who deceives and finds he's sitting there when he wakes up. Four times! What? If the writer is too boring to actually write a real plot, why should we pay attention? I think the key is that it was originally a radio game, so they filled the heroine who just sat down, not pretending they were screen writers and actually wrote something. <br /> <br /> And the end is terrible. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is absolutely incredible, terribly written and almost comic. Keep this movie at all costs!
