Telly Saval says this Mexican revolutionary (though he has matched Chuck Connors as a military martinet) in this funny but rather boring pastiche in the life and times of the famous historical figure. Earlier test, VILLA RIDES! (1968) with Yul Brynner in the role and co-star of Robert Mitchcum, treated these events more enjoyably and on a larger scale. As such, PANCHO VILLA is a completely unusual European venture capital and independent of it, despite its powers; The end result is rather foolish, not amusing - although some moments, especially the action collections and the scene that encompasses the stroke inside the church, offer some joy. Oh, and even Savala can even sing songs!
