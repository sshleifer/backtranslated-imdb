I love the first and third Beastmasters, but that was abomination. For the same reasons, it was almost as terrible as "The Never Ending Story 3". They took the fascinating world of fantasy from the Barbarian tribes, agricultural villages, witches, supernatural beings, and the cult of religious fanatics who used the pyramid; and I thought it would be funny to mix our materialistic pop culture with rock & roll, sushi (I think it was) and flashy sports cars. These two worlds do not belong to each other. I don't want to see a lot of ancient barbarians looking for people dancing on the car radio with some rock songs. I have a sense of humor, but it's just stupid. That's what Hollywood does for good fantasy movies when they run out of ideas. Don't give up, Braxus's eye is much better. What I gave 10. This one, blog, I give 1. Believe me, I don't always give such high or low ratings. I just want to comment on such movies.
