I'll give it two because it has a lot of music, otherwise it would be one. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time today and this is the first "Road" picture I've seen. I waited better. Robert Osborn says it's the best film on Road. If that's true, I don't have to see others. The best thing about this movie is that it has a lot of songs in the first half, but it's only balanced with a single product number danced throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't like the movie. Neither Hope nor Crosby came all this well, their characters were not very charming, the film was not at all funny, most of the dialogue was just a flat filler, there wasn't much action, there wasn't much spectacle. br /> <br /> Waiting for the movie. Waiting for more roads, but not much. They do it quickly in the palace and then most of the movie ends. I was also much more famous for the "tea" style that broke the fourth wall, where the characters speak directly to the audience or comment on the plot. There were only four of this. One of them is an example of the funny humor of this script: <br /> <br /> (Hope confirms the plot to Crosby so far) Crosby: I know all this! Hope: Yes, but people who didn't come through the picture halfway. Crosby: You mean they missed my song? <br /> <br /> These are two weak punchlines, but at least they are actually jokes. Much of the rest of the script doesn't even contain jokes. For example: <br /> <br /> Crosby: Remind me to throw you a piece of cheese in the morning. (Indirectly invite hope to the rat). <br /> <br /> It's not funny at all, it's barely qualifying, but it's a funny dialog that carries most of the movie. Many scenes don't even come close to the joke, but use a general uninteresting dialogue like: <br /> <br /> Crosby: Hey, do you take me? You think you can throw me in dogs? I hope why not, you did it to me, didn't you? Crosby: Yeah, but that's because I've been looking for us. You can't see anyone. Hope: Oh yeah? Well, why do I pay a check? <br /> <br /> (I just have my memory above. It's not accurate, but it shows you what I mean). <br /> <br /> And so on .... just a general dialogue with no jokes at all. <br /> <br /> My class: waste of time.
