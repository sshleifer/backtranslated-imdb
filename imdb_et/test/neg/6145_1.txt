I have decided to leave this example out of my memory out of the toilet, unforgettable, frustrating, pointless, rubbing the TV show into hell. <br /> <br /> The Skyler man, who is the master / star / creator of this exhibition, is boring, uninteresting, incredible, not particularly good looking, and not at all funny, in short, why this guy on television and especially why he is in comedy when He's not funny, pretending he's a professional man if he's definitely nothing but an obvious contender? Others have already said this, but this guy is a complete fake and fraud if you think any of these disadvantages believe you should seriously consider checking your head because they are all fake, and those that may be true are so pointless , like spending the whole day for someone to give you an average meal in a restaurant? Seriously this man has to go away, glad that this exhibition is preserved.
