The characters were as uneven as the pain. Small skinny dorky computer geek, funny african-american with stupid clisch√© punchlines, cool white guy with compassion for cars and a beautiful driver who comes with pretty girl. The actors are at best mediocre. Ecsept from Norton, who does a pretty good job of halban. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is also stupid and a waste of time. All in all, this is a group of broken boys who use the world on their playground, where every big house store keeps them on the table with food. I mean, why work for livelihood if you can rob people? <br /> <br /> AND .. Who f **** gets into big European city traffic?!? And FRIGGIN in the middle of the day? Think of all the losses and not to say the death of innocent civilians. But all ambulances and fire trucks? <br /> <br /> I didn't create any sympathy for the main characters and the weather in Wahlberg gets his bloody gold or not, I couldn't give less torment.
