quite likely one of the (if not) worst films that have ever been prepared, cast and acted in cinema history. Who would ever think of being a couple of Cameron Diaz and James Mardsen in the green country of God? She looked like her mother. God forgive me, but I'm just honest. And that was the least of the many problems that plagued this terrible apology for the film. It was a terrible statement against women, but at least when you blame the women for the problems of the world, tell a decent story, not to anyone who has so many tedious loopholes and pathetic excuses for temporary and excitement. Everyone should get their money back, who went to the theaters to watch it or buy a DVD.
