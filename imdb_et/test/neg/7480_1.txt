Before the last call w / Carson Daly, my local NBC affiliate aired a lot of valuable programming after Late Night w / Conan as another city on TV, 3rd Rock Sun and Carline city reruns, and some stand comedy. There's nothing to look at these days because everything I see is Carson Daly and his terrible show. He's not a comedian, he's not an actor, he doesn't deserve fame because he's not a good speaker or comedian. <br /> <br /> On June 21st, he showed how to use the internet as a meme called "Rickroll" at his show. He failed. This event confirms that Carson Daly is terrible.
