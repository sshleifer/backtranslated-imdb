I could have a better movie. It is a waste of time and money. it makes me sick that such films are actually made and the people who actually do them think they are good. I happen to be like teen comedies when they do well. However, this film takes this genre to a new low. For such movies, people think it is very good to make it dirty and ask unsuspecting people to pay money to sit down. It's sadism.
