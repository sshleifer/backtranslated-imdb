Finally I managed to sit through this episode. I was very tired. It is clear that. I had to switch it off before, because I thought it was so bad. Watching the full episode convinces me that it's really so bad. I couldn't even say what happened, but I remember clearly not laughing. For people who think this is a new family or married to children ... have you ever seen these examples? They are well-written and well-functioning and, most importantly, funny! This show is not funny. You might think that if this is the first sitcom you've ever watched. I don't see who else. I repeat all the perceptions of previous seizures, etc. This is probably my own fault in watching television and not watching it, allowing foolish people to dictate what is actually in the air.
