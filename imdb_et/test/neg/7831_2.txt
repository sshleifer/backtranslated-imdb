You have to worry about seeing Michael Madsen lead the story of any movie. I'm not going through a list of shame that is his film career. <br /> <br /> I looked 45 minutes and was still not sure what was going on. The film consisted of the hatred of love between Madsen and Argento, which was basically offensive to Madsen, threatening violence and generally treating her as dirt. On the other hand, he loves him, he is not, he does, he wants him, he loves him again ...... what you wrong with you !!!! Script is a terrible, sad sound and pointless aggressive and raw sexuality that I think was added to attract some viewer because there is little to offer on film. I would have given film 1, but it was almost twice the excitement in the last 20 minutes. It actually responded to one question in the last few minutes, but I'm not going to share it, so I'll suffer for the whole movie as I did.
