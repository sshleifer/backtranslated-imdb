The fact that this film was freely distributed to a certain national age, which I do not care about, made me look down to some extent, but since I had come across a copy that the local charity did not give anything I felt I could see it with a clear conscience. <br /> <br /> There are moments in the film, waking up the location of Thameside is nicely done, but I feel that there are too many mistakes. First, Vinnie Jones is not convincing as a journalist. Although Vinnie himself is an interesting character, it is true that he does not simply have the capacity to act to draw such a role. <br /> <br /> Second, who would carry the lost manuscript that they are informed of is "priceless"? It seemed that everywhere Mr Jones ordered, he went with him! Thirdly, the whole story of Dickens' aspect, which seems to be important, goes the way that could have been an interesting film about high-ranking corruption. Maybe I'm just a little thick, but I really didn't see the story-story-story in Dickens style. It did not add anything to the film and helped to confuse it only when things became interesting in today's story. <br /> <br /> The praise that I give to filmmakers is that at least they tried something a little different. I'm all about British independent films trying to be "left out", but it's not a "red way" or "it's England". What it is is a bit of a mess and a long one. Yes, it is partly entertaining, but in the end it seemed that the two films were merged to make the whole, and if both did not. (Nor can I think I have seen something similar to what Ian Banks recently did on television), located in Edinburgh with Sherlock Holmes creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
