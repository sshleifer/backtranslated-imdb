Since THE MAGUS is a confusing puzzle with no real solution, you have to sit and enjoy the landscape. On Greece's remote island, he is a very close Michael Caine teacher who works at school for boys who remember the games with local wacko / mystery man Anthony Quinn and his funny girl Candice Bergen. Quinn, who looks like Pablo Picasso with white hair and a striped sailor shirt, is actually pretty good, but Caine looks like she's ready to explode. Bergen, though stunning, should not put a British accent on EVER. He's not very good at this type of thing. Guy Green's direction is good, but if you do not have endless patience with the film's circular logic, you will not enjoy it. The real sour remark is pouring effervescent Anna Karina in Caine's full-blown role. After seeing her Woman Woman and her APART, her presence here is rather dirty.
