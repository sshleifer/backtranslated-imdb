I played like Eugene Morris Jerome in adapting her playground, and this film certainly doesn't match the script or Neil Simon's imagination. I know this game up and down and I can honestly say it was off. Changes to the game script were badly done. If you really want to enjoy this game, you should see the real game, not the customization of the Hollywood movie. Eugene's character had no soul and was too sarcastic in everything he said. Other characters were also keyless. General disappointment, dirty, disrespectful, amateur-executed!
