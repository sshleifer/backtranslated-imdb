I wasted $ 5 to rent this complete mess. Dr Zack is the most undesirable driver I've ever seen. The film was full of clichés you could ever think of and contained no original OUNCE. There was a typical sexism depicted by harsh foreigners, all boys were "too proud to advise" attitudes that were as old as grandmother's Christmas cream. The concept and the deaths were really cool, but when the monster reveals, they all lose their novelty. (read the SPOILER at the end) Nothing else has really emerged, but the end is the biggest exhibit you've ever seen. I predicted everything before it happened, including who would die and how. There is no dialogue and it is far from underestimated. There are usually just random screaming, thoughtful bold and thick phrases. The actors are just GOD ONLY EFFECTIVE! I don't want to talk about this movie anymore, it makes me hate. I just don't know if the director looked at it even when it was done. <br /> <br /> (SPOILER ALERT !!! Bones for them to move around (even if it doesn't give any evolutionary advantage, and the ants killed everyone who was available, even though the movie works like they kill. the film made me sad.) with a leading idiot who killed her mother ant (big blob) that destroys all the other ants. Pretty cliché? She's almost at the end, because she is suddenly an emotional affair with the mother thing that crosses her. Leave me alone.
