If you are in the mood of a really horrible movie, it would be hard to find something that could even compare it. I've spent a lot of time watching a lot of terrible movies just for the joy I get from it, and the man, it's one of the worst. This movie was so bad, I had to buy a third Beastermaster. It wasn't so bad that is amazing because it was a direct video. It's one of those movies that is hard to see how it was first made. I think someone had to actually read the script (or many scripts) (I'm sure they did a lot of draft) and said, "Yes, that's it. There's money." In fact, they just wanted to make Beastmaster 2 before they even had a script, so they went all they had. Ack, terrible. So, if you're a fan of bad movies, check it out. It is a real classic and the film doesn't get much worse. And if that's the case, please let me know.
