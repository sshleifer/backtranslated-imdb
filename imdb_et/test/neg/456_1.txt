One is a very skillful exhibition, mostly because it is almost the only network that shows in the main times that hardly more than one person is watching. <br /> <br /> When I first heard this, I was thinking of "Weee! Show the second song song! We don't have them enough!" and then I stuck to my helmet and drove to my home, hitting blunt objects and sharp corners with my head. Because, frankly, it is not enough that the constant, year-round pain and suffering of only one or two "talent-based" realities are not enough. We need you. And not just one - "One". Few less attractive competitors with a little less talent. One with a little less point, though it's hard to imagine a scenario where it's possible. One who has a meaningless frame of competitors if they don't. Because I care what Johnny Sings-a-much does in his hours! I really do! Now you can think "Hey! I looked down on the first episode of less than 4 million people across North America. Does that mean it doesn't suck?" Well, I'm saying that less than 4 million people in North America are syphilis, so sometimes the low figures now bring good news, aren't they? Think about it. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, One may be terribly unpretentious, showing that even the incitement network cannot be disturbed because they also understand how absolutely worthless it is, but it is still not syphilis! Yes!
