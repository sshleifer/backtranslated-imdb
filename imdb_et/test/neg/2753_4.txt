If you like The Three Stooges, it will undoubtedly like this 17-minute short. There were certainly some fun moments, but like all the work of Stooges, it turns out to be a comedy of their particular style, and I have to admit that somehow Stooges has just done it for me. Their strokes always seemed angry rather than funny, and although it was obviously fake, their antics seemed to be more of a injury than a laughter. In this short perspective, the bump will be trying to find Shemp (who is a music professor in this woman) woman because she has inherited only half a million dollars, provided she marries within 48 hours of reading. One of his students is interested, but when the legacy goes out, there is suddenly a long composition of potential brides and there is a pretty good cash fight between them. Stoogan fans enjoy. For me it has all the elements that wrap me over them. 4/10
