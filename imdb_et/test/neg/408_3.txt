Angels and Demons: 3: 10: It's obvious that something bad has happened to Ron Howard. I don't know exactly, but something has gone wrong. <br /> <br /> Howard has always been a decent work team. Although he could never confuse both the artist and Cinderella Man and Apollo 13, the parents were pretty good and even angels and demons prequel / sequel The Da Vinci code was a fun romp. In addition, none of his films has been terrible. (Note: I didn't see how Grinch Stole's Christmas or his newest film, Heidi Montag, says plastic.) The more Howard managed to maintain this quality, such as the star-driven Oscar Feed (A Beautiful Mind), Starfight (Far and Far), Starring Revenge Fantasy (Ransom) and Comedies on Prostitution and Mariners (Night Shift, Splash). <br /> <br /> Angels and demons are a poorly directed and shot movie in the middle. The scenes are too dark, the corners of the camera are wrong, the participants block each other's frames and the whole thing is often out of focus. This makes the already confusing story even more tellable. <br /> <br /> Dan Brown gets a lot, but I found the Da Vinci code as a fun-loving romp (so dig me). The film version of the Da Vinci Code remained the same as they go on in the book and added an attractive casting and attractive location. <br /> <br /> Angels and demons, however, occur within claustrophobic boundaries. The city of Vatican, and because Howard wasn't allowed to shoot in many real places, we get a lot around the back of CGI. The whole movie is as if Rick Steves had made a special Vatican city and instead of actually visiting the Holy City and directing his camera, Rick had to use Lego bricks and used the book with all the tits. <br /> <br Although the Da Vinci code was what I think is an intriguing central mystery (again, appeal to me), the story of demons and angels consists of Illuminati (now eyes) to destroy the Vatican. Their idea was to bring deaf positions to schools around the world and rape the student every time. Sorry; apparently, the Vatican does not need any help on this issue. <br /> <br /> In any case, they plan to penetrate the big European patron collector, kill the head priest and steal three anti-vials. This raises more than a few questions. Can Hadron Collider Cause Anti-matter? Can you capture some anti-matter? Why does the EU collect it? (Maybe they fear Godzilla attack?). Why has an anti-matter leader gathered a Vatican priest? Now that they get the anti-thing they use their incredible destructive power to take over the world? not just joking. Unfortunately, the Illuminati have not quite understood that the level of complexity of Pinky and Brain is still there. Instead, the present pope is just dead and its conclusive time. The last four cardinal cardinals of the four Pope Tournament sown are all kidnapped, and the Illuminati kill them in seven styles one by one. They are good sporting events, but they leave tips for every murder like some Latin Riddler. Oh and the last robbed cardinal is an anti-thing, and if he's not found, Rick Steves will have to go straight to Venice next year to see some frescoes. If only one Latin-themed Batman to save the day? Whether this story is really terrible and badly talked about, but maybe it's one of those movies that have been recorded with great shows. Real Character Training? (Okay, you know where that happens). Tom Hanks gives an incredible wooden performance and just looks terribly (he's also old to play the character for about twenty years.) His love interest in Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer is zero chemistry with either Hanks or the screen. Ewan Macgregor plays the Pope's personal assistant / Kana boy as an Irish man who looks like he is breaking a musical number anytime no one steals his Lucky Charms. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Stellan Skarsg√•rd puts the Vatican Chief Security Officer on a fine footing and, when we know it, hasn't raped the violent children that puts it at least in one region before the Vatican critics.
