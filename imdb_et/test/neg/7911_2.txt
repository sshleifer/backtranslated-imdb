The first twenty minutes and instead spent all this time offenders and cast intelligence. <br /> <br /> This movie was able to suck and blow the laws of physics at the same time. If anything else, it deserves to be remembered. <br /> <br /> It's not a black thing, it's not a white thing, it's just a bad thing. Really, a very bad thing. Separating by points would be a waste of time. The best thing about the movie is that there was a purple plane. Do it yourself ... go buy a picture of a purple plane and get the best of what this movie was supposed to offer. <br /> <br /> This will definitely go to the category "What! ^ @@ & *! Did they mean ???? "
