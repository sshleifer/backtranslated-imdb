I was really looking forward to this title. It sounded and seemed fun. The idea of ​​someone making a cheesy 50s monster movie could have been a laugh, but it's just under that heading. First of all, there is almost no Froggg in the movie, which is the biggest disappointment. I have to sit over 75 minutes of flat drama and dialogue to get a few glimpse of Froggg, who worships the bare breasts. Why? In addition, the film has no fun plot. I mean, I'll give me something that is a bit more interesting than just talking. I wanted to see some hot chicks who were looking for a sex creature, I wanted to see some cuties who dragged their animal to desperately need salvation (Creature of Black Lagoon things), I wanted to see some funny scenes Froggg is going to kill a smile or maybe flees a silly trap . Something exciting! Geez, enjoy it, be creative! Who wants to sit through an endless and tiring dialogue with the creature of the scene? My advice to filmmakers: continue, your concepts are good, but your performance must be much more inspired. Be mindful of the creature, put humor into action and most importantly ... put more creature creature !!!
