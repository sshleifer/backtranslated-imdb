Why can't a movie be rated zero? Or even a negative number? Some movies like "Plan Nine from Space Space" are so bad that they are fun to watch. It's not one. "Horror Dungeon of Horror" may be the worst film I've ever seen (in some cases. I had to move fast!). Fortunately, my age of indiscretions and the age of my aging is that I have seen worse movies, but fortunately I don't remember them. Sets appeared to be made of cardboard and finished with spray paint. The special effects looked like the fifth grader C + diorama placed in the shoebox. The film contained unforgettable gaffe, as when the awning shot and killed his servant. Then he will immediately flee with his escaping victim who will take his staple and shoot with him without loading the gun! This movie was so bad that my DVD copy had just a title song. I think no company or studio wanted to be accused. Although I think that if you film in your garage and make it out of cardboard boxes, you don't need a studio. This movie is definitely in my basement with the worst films of all time in such terrible saints as "Manipulator", the worst film I've seen with real (single) Hollywood leading man Mickey Rooney. The only time I would recommend looking at "Harrow's Cave" (or "Manipulator") would be if someone would pay you. (I'm very cheap) I have to be $ 7 or $ 8 for a "dungeon" and at least ten "Manipulators". phil-the can can cinematography
