I'm a lover of bad movies. I own "R.O.T.O.R." and "Boa vs Python" and I am working on building up my collection for such big titles as "Troll 2" and "What is Superdoc?" But the "Storm Trooper" is not even bad enough to be on the list of amazing terrible movies. It's just flat. The man who said he had a better dialogue with his potted plants is right. All this movie is silly. When a robot boy drives into the car, it looks almost the same as he knew it was exploding, there was no reason why he would ever run in that direction. "Judge, Jury and Enforcement Officer", "The Perfect Police Officer ... but they went too far," I mean, come on, why did the people do these movies? R.O.T.O.R. it does this because it is hysterically horrible, but Storm Trooper is just a waste of cinema because it is not so bad to be so bad that it is worth looking at. It is part of someone's home video collection that they can be proud of, but that's all. I'm on p * that was on the HBO channel (only 1-star, so I watched it) because it was not. Even if you love bad movies, don't watch this movie. It's shameful.
