No no no. This is my advice if you want to see this movie. Anthony Perkins is one, and ONLY Norman Bates, as well as Janet Leigh Marion Crane. It looks just like a Psycho painted version, where a somewhat different touch throws a more modern complaint. Vaughn is boring like a sick Norman, and Viggo Mortenson's Sam Loomis seems too much cowboy compared to the original. Please, people, do yourself justice. Don't worry about that. One can only ask what Mr. Alfred Hitchcock and Mr. Anthony Perkins are thinking ....... <br /> <br /> * out ****
