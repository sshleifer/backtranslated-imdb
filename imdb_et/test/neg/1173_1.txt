I made an overview of this director's fictional vacation on BTK. I had seen this movie and it was terrible. Please save your money and time. This movie was terrible and this director is unforgiving. I do not understand how he finances these films. They are terrible. I have decided to make sure I check who is the writer, the director and the producer, and if that director's name appears, I will not waste my money. Nothing is worse than renting a movie on Friday night, making popcorn, and then realizing that you are duplicating at the forefront of the movie box. Stay away. So I think I should do some things to fill the lines? I've always checked IMDb, but I think I'm no longer going. It's ridiculous. I've been corrected too many times in my reviews. Not enough lines?
