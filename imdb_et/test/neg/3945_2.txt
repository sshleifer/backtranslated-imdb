Stay Alive has a very similar story to some Asian horror film that contains story technology. Some of these Asian horror movies are One Missed Call, Ring and Pulse.So, the idea of ​​Stay Alive is very cliché and obvious, but behind filmmakers it didn't know how to put something new or interesting about Stay Alive clichés. This movie is totally nonsense. But a very big mess. All the elements of Stay Alive belong to the worst class of 'horror' movies: low characters, no tension, stupid '' horror '' that makes you laugh and easy. note that '' director '' cannot create anything original or annoying. I'll give you advice: don't see this movie. I really hated it.
