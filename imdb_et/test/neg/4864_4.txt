I have rarely seen such a boredom action / temporary movie. No action scene is exciting because the story is nothing special, and apart from a few participants, it is bad. Charlie Sheen (storm, big league) stars as Chief of the White House, who gets herself in the midst of a conspiracy that wants her and more people dead. Donald Sutherland (Time to Kill, Fallen) plays a friend he talks about, and Linda Hamilton (Linda Hamilton, Terminator, Dante's Peak) plays a reporter who is involved in this situation. Charlie Sheen is like a star, Donald Sutherland is a good actor who gives a good result. Linda Hamilton has a bad record. Bad movie, I really like it when it's a good ending, but this movie is very cheesy ending with some almost ridiculous things.
