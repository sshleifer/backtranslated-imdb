A man on a black surface lands with a spaceship and meets a girl who lives with a monkey with a monkey. He grabs him on the phone and teaches him how Charleston is. Then they fly off the spacecraft leaving the monkey behind. This short film does not make sense if black surfaces are pulled away. I think it's a plot, but I'm not sure for a long time. You can't say it's Renoir at work, despite its characteristic humanism. But slow motion is good. Can be found in NY Film Supplement from Experimental Films Series no. 18, I believe.
