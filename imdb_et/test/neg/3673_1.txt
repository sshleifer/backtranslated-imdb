This is by far the worst film I've ever seen when it is next to the plot, and the plot it has is very scattered. The story is not about content, points, or subtitles, because what seems to be a story is in Russian. The set seems to be just one space with different lighting effects, and at the moment you think something good is going to happen because you don't let it work, drama, intercourse, horror, gore, story and mythology. Driving style is made by death (fish-eye camera). It seems that the only action in this film over the last 10-15 minutes is a worsening of the participants who are unable to properly portray the competition. The only interesting thing about this movie was my dog, who grabbed the surround sound.
