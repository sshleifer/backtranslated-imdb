I am an Indian resident in the United States. Why India continues as a stupid animal to emulate everything America is outside of me! The main problems of the film are not so much a plot and a stupid comedy. It is that this film has a lot of sex, women, women dressed in the streets and many churches that are not on television. <br /> <br /> For the producers and leaders of this movie I have this message: you will continue to weaken the strong family values ​​of our people by making such spam. You will continue to let young women continue to think that there is a lack of feminist attitude and morale. You will continue the dance story that belongs to the lowest adult clubs and bars. I am ashamed that I see such films seeing for India. <br /> <br /> In 2003, the US government suggested that the best way to destroy Iran is to "send minis" there. It is not necessary for India. We're destroying such garbage.
