I usually love Jackie Chan's movies, but it was terrible. There are only 2 or 3 fighting scenes that are all up to the standard standard more or less. The bad thing about this movie is that it focuses a lot on reversing / racing cars. Car chasing is not so bad (though not as exciting as fighting), but car racing at the end is exceptionally boring. Basically, it does all the things that make Jackie Chan's movie into Jackie Chan's movie and leave everything out except Jackie Chan. Even traditional challenges do not have ordinary humor. <br /> <br /> I think it worsened by the fact that I saw one of these terrible duplicate versions. I usually try to see a subtitled version ... I want to understand Chinese. <br /> <br /> I only saw one Jackie movie worse that it was one of his early future films in Hollywood that didn't come out so well. <br /> <br /> Avoid being really curious or a motor sports lover.
