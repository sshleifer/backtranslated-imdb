L'Humanité is the secret of murder. These films tend to be popular, <br /> <br /> and the 6.9 rating he is currently recommending is also this. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie has no redemption features. <Br Some non-spoilers, for example, contain a 5-minute scene where the main character eats an apple. More 3 minutes <br /> <br /> where he breathes. <br /> <br /> If you don't know, it's not really an art. Nor is it a human comment that the title seems to be trying to <br /> <br /> be. In fact, it's boring. There are several attempts in this film to say something about humanity. You may think that <br /> <br /> onesself, "How do I comment on humanity?" And the most obvious <br /> <br /> obvious and boring answers are, of course, sex, love and death. <br /> <br /> Not that these options are well done - just this <br /> <br /> they are canonical choices. Sex, this movie does its best to make it unpleasant and disgusting. Your first five minutes - <br /> <br /> So this is not a spoiler - you can see an 11-year-old girl killed with blood in a vagina; it's a mystery of murder, remember? Later some people have thrown themselves apart and they have what the director wants us to believe is "raw" sex, but in fact it is <br /> <br /> busy and too symbolic - but worse, interestingly so. <br /> <br /> I like to disturb movies. This movie showed me why: <br /> <br /> Disturbing movies usually show something inside a person, <br /> <br /> their humanity, which they didn't know they existed and are a little /> scared. L'Humanité tried to do it and failed, and I walked out of the theater, not disturbed, but disgusting, I thought I had wasted my time in the theater. regardless of the movie being seen <br /> <br /> for free.
