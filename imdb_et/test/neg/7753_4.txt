I bought a DVD to get Julia Ormond. Well, I got this pot. She was cute in romantic scenes; too bad Bill Paxton drove with the autopilot for all his effort. I almost lost my lunch when he jumped out of his flight team with his big fat to say "deal" with Julia. "I watched" Sabrina "with the French soundtrack to see if Julia duplicated her dialogue. They used someone else. In any case, Julia was chosen as a French-speaking mother tongue with enough English to communicate with an American airline. -o they wanted at least one familiar name for the British / American market. Julia's functions could be passed on to Belgium for her unknown eye. <br /> <br /> The whole film had an odd character. The national pride required the heroic Dutch to resist German invaders. The Belgians were much more passive during the occupation period than French or Norwegian. I saw in another review that "dbdumonteil" believed that Julia Ormond was an American instead of a real British citizen. Ib's Bey Julia's skills were big enough to leave that impression. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie several times, he suddenly found out about me how the season, film is. It was placed on June 16, 1944, as an American plane crash on a Belgian farm. The trees look in the middle of the autumn with lots of leaves and the weather is warm. People are walking with light clothing and the grass is still green. There is no trace of snow or ice. It must have been the softest winter in Belgium. <br /> <br /> The real plot plot was confusing. Where to start? For people interested in World War II, the film came as a farce. The exploration platform used was a big 4-engine bomber. Such aircraft existed, but they should have required massive deployment of combatants to have the chance to survive. In fact, smaller and faster aircraft were readily available and would be much more suitable for this task. The movie's vital code books would never have been on the plane. The team did not need this information to perform their task, while the compromise of this information would have been a major defeat of intelligence. Even if the film is supposed to be, the first items to be removed from the aircraft would be code books. They would be on their way to Berlin within 10 minutes after the German troops arrived at the accident site. <br /> <br /> Daussois home where "Major Brice" shelter was a farm where no one was interested in agriculture. Food in Belgium is currently very small. The Germans would have demanded significant quantities of locally produced food to support their forces. The family car would have been expropriated long before the American plane arrived. In any case, it would not be possible to use the fuel to operate it. <br /> <br /> The plot's twist, where Henri Daussois turns out of American jealousy, is pathetic. He should have revealed everything he knew about resistance to live. He should have acted as a double agent to prevent an effective opposition. A woman with secret radio would never have survived the war. <br /> <br /> Major Brice was stuck in civilian clothing at the end of the movie. It made him a spy under the laws of war and was responsible for execution without defense. He would not have deliberately waived the unimpeded interrogation of the Geneva Convention. It is better to force them to kill him and possibly to make friends. <br /> <br /> I haven't read the novel on which this movie is based. When this film is a faithful adaptation, it shows the little development of the novel. Regardless of the novel, scriptwriters could easily create a higher script that doesn't waste the opportunity to offer a much better movie.
