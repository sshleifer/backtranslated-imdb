I was very disappointed with this movie. Big actors in this and potentially a great plot, but it just seemed to slip along. <br /> <br /> Charlize Theron was masterful in her role and beautiful, but it seemed that 90% of her on-screen work was on a trip to Austin Minis. Product placement is wrong, so very wrong. <br /> <br /> The direction also seemed out. Edward Norton is a bad boy and it was so obvious from the start. Every time the camera passes through it, it would be too long and Norton would be jerky or something. C'mon, Hollywood, give us a little credit! It's okay to turn us off by surprise without a telegraph. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but this movie was just below average. I've always been the one who appreciated the work and talent for the film, but it wasn't.
