It was really necessary that the documentary contained embarrassing images of non-participants. And why are all foolish dog scenes and then repeating all the same stupid dog scenes? This film begins with a great promise - to expose international politics and wine business. It started very early and contained all the right signs. But production is confusing. The points started and develop mostly, then never finished and left with hanging ends. Very bad and disorienting camera work and editing. They should have used subtitles for British mumbler Christie. <br /> <br /> Too much fluffy and not enough for a documentary. <br /> <br /> Cannes is likely to be honored for US bashing (although I think it was too little). <br /> <br /> We left at 2:00 am - I have no idea how long it lasted.
