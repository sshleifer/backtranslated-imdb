Cruddy, innocent ... not smoking, drinking or cycling, but Jeremy Slate (good actor) and Jocelyn Lane (good actor) make it morally feasible for a bad biker-hit, post-biker (away) time. They knew it, we knew it ... Adam Roarke and the slate were wasted ... but they lived on. <br /> <br /> Of the 3 in 10. Best Performance = Jocelyn Lane. Lane is REALLY really getting the final exploiting biker movie after RUN, ANGEL, RUN (which also has good actors - like Don Stroud, etc.). It was over. They knew it. They tried to make a living. But Jocelyn Lane (two of Elvis's bad clips, TICKLE ME and something bad) from yellow and leather is a modern hot chick, which Mr Slate fights for. It's worth seeing, but it sucks. But look at it. Worth not-biker, non-smoking, non-boiking, "biker" type hot chicks.
