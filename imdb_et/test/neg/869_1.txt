This is probably the most uncompromising film I've ever seen. I looked at it because I have a soft spot for Leon (everything else Besson has, in my opinion, been terrible, except the Wasabi script) and Jean Reno. This is a testament to how bad this film is, that Reno, one of the most charismatic and relaxed actors (although he's here), can't watch this movie or the moments he's on the screen. br /> <br /> This is all in a movie school: black and white, no dialogue, people do things for no apparent reason, people who are behind each other, and what is in turn shaken by a shaky camera. And, predictably, no one is entertaining. <br /> <br /> It's not "French mad", as some people have claimed (actually I think they mean "Mad Max 2") - it's a superficial comparison based solely on the fact that both films have post-apocalyptic provision, and this is the kind of comment you expect from someone who doesn't know what they're talking about. Mad Max 2 was pulsating, Mad Max 2 was exciting, Mad Max 2 was worth it - Le Dernier Combat is none of them. <br /> <br /> I know it should be cool like black-and-white white French movies and just as cool to say that you saw something in other people (or you managed to sit through it without sleepiness), so I don't trust anyone who claims to like Le Dernier Combat because I don't see any value in it; it requires so much and does not give anything back. I found myself drifting about this in about five minutes, and it never paid attention. Anyone who can do it is not a human, or most psychotic. (In fact, they're probably just trying to "cool").
