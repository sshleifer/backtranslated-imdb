This film is a shame, especially since Andrzej Wajda is not a professional but a professional leader. But this film does not give something that could be expected. <br /> <br /> First of all - I am Polish, so I can say the whole background story because I read books. But how can you say that there is even war in this movie - a lot of people are going back and forth, some soldiers screaming ... Is it really World War II or soldiers are on vacation? <br /> <br /> Action and Dialogues - Poor, Poor Poor. A.olesmijewski, D.Stenka, M.Komorowska, W.Kowalski, A. Chyra fit into their roles, the remaining (Polish) casts are excluded (especially M.Ostaszewska, one of the leading signs of the unfortunate choice). 99% of the dialogues are not talking, they are simply placed, the difficulties of the actors were feasible and it is not surprising that what strange things they had to say. <br /> <br /> And this leads us to the most disappointing. problem - you don't know it. Everything is so theatrical, artificial. There is no real life, no sense. World War II has many original materials and I think what this material is more powerful, more dramatic than what Wajda did. <br /> <br /> I see only one positive - despite historical errors (like the acronym ZSRR; it was done for post-1945 propaganda work, so please Poland that ZSRS was lost, and now ZSRR, but in 1940 ZSRR was not !), fortunately it was killed in Katyn. Councils (yes, it's a fact, not some contradictory rumors). Great, two hours for a 5-10 minute scene. <br /> <br /> Anyway - waste time and potential. This is the tragedy of epic proportions, the will to fight in 1939 (barely shown), not against the war of the Polish authorities against the Soviet Union (not shown here), the imprisonment of soldiers soon after, living under the harshest conditions (not shown here), hope and fear followed (barely shown), and then ... destruction. Hand in hand with the Germans - The Soviet people were destroyed by the Polish people, targeting people who were the backbone of Poland. Unfortunately, it succeeds and the results are still visible.
