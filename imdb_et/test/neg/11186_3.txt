OK, this is a piece of making a historical film that caused uprising, shocked people and was banned. I give it, which is why I gave it to 3, not 1. It may be ahead of time, but it is definitely the same for ages. I'm a big fan of Salvador Dali and I loved Un Chien Andalou. This short was exciting with one creative scene after another. L'age d'Or was too long and boring - just a self-evident pompous film making that was simply weak to try to make Un Chien Andalou a full-length movie (and shamelessly amplifying Dali's name and fame, though he had little to do with it). Total spam, with the exception of (very) some "shocking scenes" that are separated by long, boring non-action. Waste of time and money. Both thumbs are down, down. It goes to my shelf that it will never be seen again.
