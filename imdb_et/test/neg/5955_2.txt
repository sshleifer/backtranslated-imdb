There is a reason the world forgets these creatures: they are bored. This is a hammer production, which means that anyone who made this movie should hit the hammer several times, if possible - and where it hurts. Most people thought more about dumping than these idiots have done to make the film. <br /> <br /> Seriously now ?? The film begins with some caves hunting the antelope. Now the antelopes have to evolve a lot from these prehistoric times, because they actually attack and kill people here. After that, it's time to meet the rest of the tribe: more bearded men, some fashion models, and even a couple of very old, gray haired grandmothers and grandfathers. These old geezers have probably never heard of caves that did not cross the age of 30; they refused to worship both the logic and the will of historical data, so that they stay alive. One of the conquerors is not beard; he's been cleaned. Not quite as shaved as Tarzan, the Lord of Humanoid Clean-Shaven Ones, who travels the jungle without childhood and razor, but nevertheless. <br /> <br /> The following is a mandatory earthquake / melt-lava destruction queue that causes many of our non-furry friends to enforce their punishment. It is interesting to note that before the earthquake, fashion models showed more breasts. After that, they must be shy or something because they covered their boxes for a while (maybe they were covered with ashes, so I thought they were covered). More action is followed in the form of two sand-wrestling fashion models; I think the next is the best mud-wrestling. How much of a desert has been overcome, our black-haired tribe - how else could it be - a blonde tribe. Yawn. <br /> <br /> There are more spellbinding things going on. It is a redhead fashion model who has worked hard to kill a cowboy. A woman who is so weak is also dying at birth. Finally, we can even meet a darker and furry tribe, the evil tribe. One of them becomes a WWF champion after he actually fights in (!) Wrestling. 1,2,3 ... and it's done: the bear is a loser. We also see that the jealous cave man miraculously recovers from two great injuries: first he gets a bigger spear to the thigh, but he walks away from it as if it were just zero. Then he is thrown into the rock - a big stone - with a blonde good two-foot cave man, but he walks away from it when he is thrown on a giant sofa. Ultimately, it is unclear whether he will die from the fall of an even higher rock or from a broken voodoo doll. Oh yes, voodoo was used in prehistoric times by white tribes who lived in the desert and whose women were fashion models. It is always important to learn about movies. <br /> <br /> The film's message is as straightforward as education: cave-dwellers wanted to fight for local power and they also loved their fashion models. Like any self-respecting cave man, he would have won as a leader of such an unfortunate cluster.
