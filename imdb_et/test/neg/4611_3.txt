<br /> <br /> I thought there was no building in this movie that was dramatic when the first film was. This is hard to achieve when the film takes place over a week. The original film will lead to climate change until the end of the decade and was still less violent than the sequel. One good thing about this movie was that the movie went relatively fast because the plot seemed rushed. When Rachel's best friend died, there was no fun in the movie. Another lowered the involvement of Amy Irving. All of his scenes brought the pace of movies down. The dialogue in this movie was terrible. It did not in any way reflect how children speak. All in all, this movie may have hit, but after the opening stage it broke down.
