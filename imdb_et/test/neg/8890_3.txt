"The Quickie" speaks of a decadent Russian mob who lives in Malibu and, frankly, this terrible attempt to comment on the drama is not. <br /> <br /> Jason Leigh introduces himself to Mr.. A Mob-man from "Pacific Deputies" with clear prominent stars saying "West Coast Exterminators". Finally, the mob-boys are in doubt because he destroyed the bedroom. (duh). <br /> <br /> In the second scene, Mr. Mobguy plays Russian roulette, giving $ 4,000 to bet on whether he lives or dies. He has 5 options out of 6 if he keeps money when he bets "live". Well, he makes "die". (double duh) Later he complains that he was not fair and wants to play again. (Triple duh). </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> The list of shortcomings continues and continues, while this insulting film smells and sinks mad music, mediocre camera work, bad direction, boredom, etc. about the loser. (D) <br /> <br /> Note - The Barebones DVD I rented did not have English subtitles or closed captions.
