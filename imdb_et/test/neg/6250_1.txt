Before I start, I must tell you that I love horror films with passion. LOVE THEM! I've seen thousands and rarely come up with what I don't like. I'm very spooky for the genre. One of the greatest features of film history is Ed Wood, where Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) freaks and sounds too critical for manufacturers to comment on "Plan 9" cheap kits and consistency issues. Have you ever heard of "stopping unbelief?!". “Well, I try to bring this“ stopping the belief ”philosophy into every horror movie I see and usually work on. Unfortunately, it didn't work for me to screen the Cheerleader massacre. <br /> <br /> Strike One: <br /> <br /> The first thing you will notice about this "movie" is that it is captured on video and it is a flip-on handheld digital home-style camera. The work and quality of the camera is so bad that the daily soaps look amazing. In fact, this makes Troma and Full Moon video outputs good. And it's bad. <br /> <br /> Strike Two: <br /> <br /> Jim Wynorski. This "filmmaker" is likely to be honest with the Corman chip, but nothing can be further from the truth. Roger Corman shot quickly, fiercely and under the budget, but was able to provide a tight original picture. While Wynorski offers a cheap movie, he deceives his viewers (and maybe other artists) when he steals the entire musical ball, James Horner's "Humanoids of The Deep" and "Battle Beyond Stars", and defeats them inappropriately in the Cheerleader massacre. Behind the art of the box and the beginning of the credit, the music score is mistakenly attributed to Dan Savio (extra Wynorski "Deathstalker II"). You'll also notice how Cheerleader's massacre jumps from the video to the movie and back when Wynorski lifts the whole scene both to "Slumber Party Massacre" and "Humanoids of the Deep". Wynorski used this fraud fourteen years earlier in his terrible version of "Not of This Earth". <br /> <br /> The third strike (you're out): <br /> <br /> There are some nudity, (40-year-old teenagers playing and the hardest fake breasts I've ever seen in a horror movie) are murders blooded. What the hell is that? The film is titled "Cheerleader Massacre", but in my opinion, a handful of killing killings does not involve mass murder. It does not even reflect the bite of bad mosquitoes. <br /> <br /> "The movie" story is fairly fair - the invisible killer hides cheerleaders (old gals playing teenagers) until the commercial ends with gas and "girls" are forced to detach the separated two-storey mountain home. I will not destroy the end, but it is one of those "films" where a person who is obviously a killer is probably not a killer. The Cheerleader massacre would have been great when it was filmed by Joseph Zito director and Tom Savin. Instead, it is ineffective by Jim Wynorsk in the video game. Oh. <br /> <br /> I ask you not to buy or rent this abomination. If we continue to support these clowns, the more they produce talented video footage. Go out and rent "The Prowler", "Last House on Dead End Street", "Delirium" or "Burning" instead. You're glad you did.
