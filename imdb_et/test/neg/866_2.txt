This film must be one of the most boring and stupid films that Perrugorria has made. <br /> <br /> It looks like a trade from start to finish. The director has always carried the tripod, it has no pace, no rhythm. This is illogical. what a mess. You can say what happens after the first 15 minutes and ends ... Wow <br /> <br /> ------ spoiler ------- <br /> <br /> Jesus Christ the fuck Perrugorria got? Are you serious? The worst scene if someone has ever shot! <br /> <br /> ------ Spoiler End ----- <br /> <br /> Bad Control, Bad Script, Bad Behavior ... Really bad overall. I don't recommend this movie at all. It's a waste of money and time.
