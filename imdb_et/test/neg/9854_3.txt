I thought this series would be another fun activity with some dynamic plots and great performances. I was wrong. Although I like Jamie Denton, this exhibition is hardly worth seeing if you do not want to look at people who have been brutally talked about and the actions of agents that are allegedly legitimate under national security. The exhibition is a great propaganda to the current government and expresses Jingoism as we speak it every day. After a few episodes, it was boring for me and I started looking at House Invaders attacks on BBCAmerica instead. Rather look at CSI and without Trace without a doubt.
