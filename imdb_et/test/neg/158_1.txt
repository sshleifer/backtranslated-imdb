I tried to look at this adaptation, but it was just so terrible that I couldn't torture myself as such. The performances were rather low, except for Ariel. The fund was in the top position that should be treated with some nuance. I've learned from Shakespeare and have seen a lot of adjustments and it is by far the worst I've ever seen. I have to think about why somebody made this movie on Earth. In many cases, Shakespeare can be nicely adapted. It's not one of them. If you have to watch this movie, would I recommend drinking? Whenever the Fonda moves, take a drink every time they leave the original idea and two drinks. You should be quite drunk in a very short time.
