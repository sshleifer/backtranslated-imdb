What I don't usually want in this film is that it doesn't allow the imagination, everything is said. It's like a documentary, but not as good as a documentary, because it's not a documentary. Fasting movie with no continuous story. Very superficial, nothing to think about, because the film already tells you what you think. Too many different problems are touched, but none have been developed to think of you. I don't even know if it's a funny movie that wants to be a serious or serious movie that wants to be funny. Many scenes are very unreal and the actor is pretty bad. The film is quite boring.
