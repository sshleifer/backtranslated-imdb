It's about some vampires (who can ride in the sun) that cause problems in South America. Casper Van Dien will be sent with his commando team to investigate. The movie opens with Van Dien & Co walking through the jungle and there is the big black guy who just can't do anything absolutely, positively. He only speaks his own line as if he had read the reading cards first. His voice is also so low that it is a fun one. A great way to start a movie! Anyway, they get into some of our vampires, they shoot (it causes them to die for about 20 seconds) and then they naturally live back. Van Dien notices that one of them was hanging on the trees and shouted to his friends to kill them with wood. Stunt work has to be seen as credible - vampires are on the wires that pull those trees up, which should look like they can really climb, but it just makes them look like they are bouncing around bungee cords or something. <br /> <br /> Yes ... later, later, a big black black guy is in South America where some boys (Van Dien are not included) and are being attacked by more vampires. It is really too bad if these men have never heard of cross-threads, because it seems to be the ideal weapon to kill small bleeders, but they use the big old wooden bets they try to spray the vampires manually. The big black guy gets stuck and finally becomes a great powerful vampire leader. Van Dien will fight later. It doesn't help that everyone through the movie, everyone forgets that if you shoot a vampire, they will be knocked for 20 seconds or so that would allow a person to easily contribute to them. They are simply trying to keep those bets in the middle of the fight against the hand. Yes, not exactly brilliant tactics. <br /> <br /> There's a hot babe (remember Veronicat in The Lost World TV show? Yes, it's her!) who are also in some of Vampire County. a sort of research mission, and he just happens to be a Van Dien former wife. Hey, what are the odds? It is a shame that he is not much more in the film than he is. Will he and Casper finally get together? Does Van Dien win a huge black guy who can't act? Do circus performers vampires make you ridiculous through all of the numerous action scenes? Can we hear that three music when someone does something funny? Has Lynda Carter forgotten how to act as a small comer (she is more convincing in more convincing sleeping places)? These questions and other questions will be answered when you make it to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know, it can get some points on such a bad scale, but that's it. Eh, this is a bunch that runs in the jungle, I think it's interesting.
