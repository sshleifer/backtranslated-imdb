This movie is ADVICE, CANCELLATION, CAUSATION, CAUSATION AND WINNING !!! It's not a inferior movie I've ever seen, but ....... how do I put it ........ There are some very nice landscapes and some smart dry spirits, but that's it. If it was advertised as a travel ticket, I would rate it as 7, but it should be a movie with a plot, some drama and a god for a point or a satisfactory conclusion. <br /> <br /> I read some comments about this movie and I was wondering if they saw the same movie as me. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie (awake) at your own risk ........ one thing for sure - it's really appreciated correctly = G Rating! (What is the greatest of the gods who are perfect!)
