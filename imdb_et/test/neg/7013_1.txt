Lucille Ball tries to look 30 years younger when she was actually musical in this poor apology. <br /> <br /> The film has some of the worst choreographies ever seen, constantly threatening that Lucy can break the song with his bourbon voice anytime. Lucy's complete lack of talent as a singer and dancer sucks the film before it can start and aside from the deadly Lucy fan, no one can be very proud of it. Bad costumes and cheese sets don't help. There is more evidence that Lucy was not good except for seeing fools. <br /> <br /> Director Gene Saks.
