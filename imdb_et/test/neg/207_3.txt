The sounds of the movie were both everyday and ridiculous, seriously hurting the door hinges for about 30 minutes, really splitting your teeth and hurting your head. <br /> <br /> I love bad bangs more than the next man, but come "no blood in our hands" by Matt Dillon's character about a million times, and when Matt Dillon's character is a generation I don't remember its name because i don't think anyone cares about blood in hand is literally. <br /> <br /> Background music with A-chord about 5 minutes is not my music idea. this garbage.
