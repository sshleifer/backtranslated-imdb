It must be one of the biggest television shows in the long run. <br /> <br /> Jose Ferrer played the title, Nemo. He made a part of justice and certainly looked at it. But nowadays it seems to me that Nemo, to whom he was put, was more than a transient similarity to Captain Bird's Eye, TV commercials. Or maybe it's the other way around. <br /> <br /> His terrible, Professor Cunningham, got Burgess Meredith great. He never seemed over his "Penguin" day from Batman. Although he does not make his penguin here, he is not parallel to the manic professor. Only John Colicos, the fame of Battlestar Galactica, chewed the landscape better than a manic despot. <br /> <br /> I can never recall what was between Nemo and Cunningham, but it must be serious because Prof. Never missed the opportunity to try and skupper Nemo, and vice versa. <br /> <br /> There was nothing special about the effect, although Prof Cunningham's submarine was better than Nemo. It also had a team of strange, fish-like amphibians who served Cunningham and made every offer. <br /> <br /> But the most memorable aspect of the show was the secret weapon of Prof Cunningham. Delta beam! He was forever saying "Fire Delta Beam!", After which the fishy crew member gently crossed the gun shot using a shoulder strap. Truly invaluable! They don't do them any more and maybe as well. But, like the other series of this era, those who remember it are always in the heart of heart when covered with cheddar.
