I remember through HBO channels and saw it. This, my friends, is one of the worst TV movies I've ever seen. There is no excitement in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Drew Summers (Candice Cameron Bure), who drives a small town during trance. He's staying with a couple who, incidentally, was a daughter named Laura Fairgate, who looked exactly like her and plays the same actor. Even the townspeople agree that they saw the same. The thing is that Laura was killed more than a year ago. His boyfriend disappeared while he was murdered, so he saw he killed him. <br /> <br /> If you live in this city for a while, Drew will have visions and nightmares. These visions and nightmares can prove that Laura's boy is not a killer. Throughout the film, you will learn that Ray Ordwell Sr (Denis Arndt) is the one who rape him often for a while and killed him. <br /> <br /> The film is too long and very boring. The movie drags on and on and on. Amazingly, I saw another TV movie after that named (Cloned) 1997 that was good, but I'll look back at it later. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie 1 star 10. Avoid this TV movie. It's not worth your time. This is the worst TV movie of 1997!
