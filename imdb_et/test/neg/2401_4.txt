When the American film industry tries to critically look at their government, they make it damn that it looks good even when it's bad. <br /> <br /> Film makes 1 thing right, it shows what is wrong with American politics. Moto seems to be f ** k with whoever takes things to do! Mix American Congress, CIA Agent, Jew and Arabic ... just f ** k Ruskies. Thanks to the US for giving Osama Bin Laden. <br /> <br /> The film's disappointment is facing problems: using Afghan child images without weapons and stories of Soviet atrocities, and then making a blatant attempt to show a link between them and the rationale behind American aid. Every sensible person knows why $ 1,000,000,000 was raised ... not for the dying Afghan children who are sure. <br /> <br /> As usual, serious questions are covered with the fa√ßade of the bull. "Here's for you, you M *** r F ***** s" Hoffmam sings at the end, all that is missing is the American flag background and stupid military solutions. Movies can't help but leave America's pride and joy the aftermath of how we (Americans) have saved the world. Even in the last 5 minutes, it can't be saved, trying to praise and awaken that it's just another American F ** k. <br /> <br /> and editing was good.
