As everyone knows, no one can play Scarlett O'Hara like Vivien Leigh and no one can play Rhett Butler like Clark Gable. All other bright, Timothy Dalton and Joanne Whalley are no exceptions. One thing I really couldn't do was Joanne's BROWN eyes. The green eyes were the best feature of Scarlett's good looks and in that order he cut them off. The new characters were not all memorable and I forgot who forgot. I felt like he'd done something to go to Ireland. It may be that I am only 11 years old, but I did not see any change in my attitude until the last 10 minutes, when Rhett said he had grown up. Had Rhett not told her, I would never have thought her attitude had changed. She really loved Cat, her baby. She likes this child best because she had it with Rhett, her only beloved husband. However, if you read Gone With The Wind, you would see that the children in the Scarlett world are no different. Frankly, it seemed to me that there was too much without Rhett. Everyone cares about whether Rhett and Scarlett get together or not, and Scarlett took too long to get there. This is practically nothing compared to the wind, but then what is not? If you've read the novel, it's better than a movie. <br /> <br /> I would only look at it because it is a sequel to continuing with the wind, regardless of whether it is worth it. It may not fully satisfy you, but it will take you there.
