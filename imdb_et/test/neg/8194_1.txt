Since I went through the canal, I came to channel 124. This is a city channel. I saw this movie and decided to try it. Because of this movie, I became almost a mass murderer. I've made home films and they are an oscar quality compared to that big Dookie. The lighting was terrible and the action was totally unreliable. I'd rather look at Star Crystal ....... The Holy Cow may not be a good example. The main question about this movie is ... Is this a moral movie? The reason I ask is that it was one line where this lady in the wheelchair says, "I'd be another gang of statistics" Oh my head will hurt. After that line I heard the kitchen and pulled out a knife ready for anyone who dared to watch this movie. But some thought started and I just changed the channel to see the man with afro color. That's all I have to say about this movie. If you want to hurt this pain, continue, but not recommended for those who have short fuses or bad breaths
