Last Thursday I borrowed the TV show version of 'Troilus and Cressida' and just couldn't believe their eyes. Where should I start? no effort was made to play in appearance, as was the case with the Trojan War, all the actors suffered in Elizabeth's dress. Besides, most of the actors were too old and terribly uneven - Aeneas (with his white beard) seemed older than Nestor, Troilus was at least 30, Hector looked like a Spanish pirate, Ajax was badly played and Thersites was transvestite. br /> <br /> Similarly, the action is bad, the duel between Ajax and Hector is short and amateur, the camera's focus is more on Nestor's face, so we only see what's happening in the background, which is self-depressing in itself. Also, "battle" is not at the end, given its proper respect. We don't see Troil and Diomed fighting, nor anyone else on this issue, Paris and Menelaus, just seem to thunder in front of Thers. Even Patroclus's death was left out. All this was a big disappointment, as I threw a very stubborn 2 and a half hour BBC costume drama to get to this point. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it wasn't all bad. I thought the Incredible Orlando was well played on Thersites and John Shrapnel Hector, even though they didn't see it right. I would say the same thing about Kenneth Haigh as Achilles because he had no striking face and was sometimes a little dry. SPOILER: At the end of the year - death of Hector - perhaps the best part of the film, the Achilles dialogue here is great and takes a cold, experienced murderer attitude. However, the horror of the scene (when the Achilles temple is with Hector's head), it still distinguishes it. <br /> <br /> Charles Gray as Pandarus was delightful as a buggy old pervert and I thought the actor playing Cressida was doing OK work. But Troilus, a war-torn man, was annoying, and I think this game would have been better if Achilles had been murdered instead of a hijacked head force. <br /> <br /> Summary? OK, but it could have been better if he had a younger costume and costumes that at least tried to look at the Old Greek, not to mention the lack of action. 5/10
