This movie was terrible. It was so terrible. <br /> <br /> Most annoying was the way to trial. The defense officer is allowed to question the witness without questioning and without charge. He is attacking the children who have been brought to testify to cruel fears and to repeat them repeatedly to lie. These are not just things that they are subjected to sexually abused children. The trial is stupid and it destroys the whole movie ... (Law & Order has clarified me in the courtroom).
