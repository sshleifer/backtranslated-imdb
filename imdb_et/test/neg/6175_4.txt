There are many different problems with "KillShot". There is too much coincidence for one. The man is a hunter and it just happens that the main killer will appear on the same day as some killer knows. Okay, I'll take it. The child calls the real estate agency that the woman works for and asks for the money to be ready when she arrives. Okay, I'll take it too. Before he went to cash, he decided to rob his killer who didn't kill him, but decided to work with him. It has started to be quite weak. Then they will appear on the same day that the spouse has an interview with the boss of their spouses. No one is there, but a woman and a husband who has decided to go to an empty office. They go to the office and a professional killer assumes they're talking to a better boy. It's just 15 in the first menu. <br /> <br /> There are many more holes in this movie that I'm talking about. Why not kill the killer not only in a real estate agency I don't know. Why didn't he let the woman down the porch, I don't know. Why did he keep that stupid kid doing all these foolish moves and messing up a whole lot of nonsense, I don't know. Why girlfriend even in the movie, I don't know. Why did he decide not to put the gun in the pocket and just leave it on the counter, I don't know. Why they even went to the witness protection program, I don't know. I know that the Casting Director did a great job, the photographer's director did a great job, the location Scout chose great places and the Production Designer was worth every penny. So my advice to anyone who is going to choose a script that would work well for the team is to make sure that every attempt to kill someone hit by a person wouldn't get to the top of the open window.
