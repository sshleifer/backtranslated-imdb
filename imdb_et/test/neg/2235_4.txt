One thing, he made this movie. This is the feeling of later films dubbed international films. The opening credit tells us that it was filmed in Vienna. <br /> <br /> Bey was pleased with the 1940s universal adventure movies. He was also a great film I could have seen ten years ago, but never heard of it: "Amazing Mr. X". Maybe it was Dr. X. I remember it as an exciting and frightening film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is wood. The plot is not easy to follow. When I got it, I was disappointed anyway. <br /> <br /> Francis Lederer looks great as a pianist. He was a very handsome head man ten or 15 years earlier. He has never really seized the big letters, though he should have. <br /> <br /> It's not terrible, but it's pretty hard.
