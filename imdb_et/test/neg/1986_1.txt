This is one of the worst films I've seen for a while. <br /> <br /> The problem is that he does not know whether he wants to be an intelligent political film, an "artistic", or an exercise in eroticism. As a result, not all accounts work. <br /> <br /> The actor is terrible, the narration is put down and the supposed symbolism is meaningless. <br /> <br /> Klaus Kinski is probably the best movie. but that's not good. Of course, he has an intense and unique look, but in the end he can't really act. Just see how he reacts when his mistress leaves. <br /> <br /> Really don't watch this movie, some say he needs repeated views. I say one is too much.
