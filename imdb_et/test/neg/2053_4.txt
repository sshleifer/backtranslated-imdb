just i just watched this movie just because i got it and i have given these 4 stars just for him, on the other side This movie was just one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was terrible. The script was not used. It was a film that in itself contradicted. The film was sloppy and mischievous. I don't like it when I was expecting a good movie. Just something to jump on to me or two. It wasn't even done. The worst thing is that the more I think about the general plot of land, the less sense it actually makes and the more holes we find. Really ashamed because I am pretty sure there is a good idea that lies somewhere there ... <br /> <br /> I may be a bit tough, giving the film 4/10, but considering the participants and again SARA is obvious in writing talent, this movie really should have given much more.
