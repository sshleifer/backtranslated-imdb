In the first fifteen minutes, the story of naile is interesting: two thirty-thirtieth men in a seemingly intact relationship with porn stars decide to leave the porn industry and try to sing and act. Two very relaxing and brilliant men are Colton Ford and Blake Harper. With the help of Kevin Aviance and Marc Berkely, Colton will make a dance track, which will then be marketed in New York in the hope that Colton Ford will become an immediate star - a unique disco singer who will bring his background as a Porn Star PR. /> <br /> The rest of the movie is robbing and commenting on ChiChi's LaRue, a producer of porn, and the film slowly seeps into repetitions and fears. It is not a bad idea for a movie to have a bit more depth during each character's ride to become a successful career (although both signs have had a significant impact on both characters) as an alternative. It is just that a single song carries a thin thin fast. Grady Harp, Nov. 5
