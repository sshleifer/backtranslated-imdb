Although this is the first film of a broken lizard group, it is the last thing I saw. Having enjoyed the Super Troopers and having managed to sit through the crap that is the club and the beer, I was surprised to hear that they made a previous movie. Now, I didn't sit with great hope, but I was hoping for a funny campus. My friend asked me to remember that they were younger (obviously) and their first invasion of the film. I did and I was still disappointed. They didn't take BL's boys' action and comedy skills. The whole film was tiring, clich√© and honestly boring. Some other filmmakers were poor in action. And the rugby game didn't even resemble a rugby. Poor showing. They improved significantly with Super Troopers and have since declined. We hope they will get back to the Super Troopers 2 form
