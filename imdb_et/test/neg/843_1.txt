It should be based on Wilkie Collins' _The_Woman_In_White_, but the only similarity that this story had was the character names, time period, and settings. If they intend to change it so thoroughly, I don't understand why they were stuck with the pretense from Wilkie Collins. Read the book. That's much better.
