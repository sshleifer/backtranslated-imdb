This exhibition is pathetic. I can't even imagine how someone whose IQ is larger than a crushed pea soup that has passed its end date can deliberately sit through that garbage for half an hour. This is one of those rare examples that are so desperately terrible in every sense that you honestly say you're less intelligent just looking at it. I did a survey and found that the average person loses 10 IQ points every fifteen seconds they're watching. This is just the second Comedy Network abortion, Popcultured (19 863 211 IQ points lost), and pretty many ties with girls. VIP keys are an excuse for everyone. When I look at this exhibition, I feel sad in society. How does it continue?
