The first thing that hit me about this movie was terrible action. The whole cast was so evenly intuitive to offer some of the features that I began to laugh in a terrible dialogue in the middle of the film. An even bigger problem with this movie is that we can never find out what motivates the action of each character. The somewhat redeeming aspect of the film is the innovative visual effects of Halfdan Hussey. However, when they are striking, they do little to make up for the above-mentioned drawbacks. A scary script mixed with community theater levels does not provide a pleasant view. I was frankly shocked at how bad this film was.
