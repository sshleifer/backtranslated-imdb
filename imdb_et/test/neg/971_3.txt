MINOR PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD !!! <br /> <br /> How did such talented actors contribute to this desperate retreat? Robert DeNiro plays the Dumb Hollywood version of <br /> <br /> violence that is a tough cop (ie he hits bad guys and rolls his <br /> <br /> eyes to the police who prefer to stick to the book), and Eddie Murphy is not such a harsh policeman who would rather act as an actor (ie he shouts, <br /> <br /> "Visit, police!" Under his "harsh appearance". when Bobby's loose cannon tactics provide him with the media with warm water and he is shocked by the reality starring <br /> <br /> A "copy" -like reality. Breathe, cuz, which is as funny as it goes <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> The scenario did not put any energy into it. br /> Jokes fall flat, action seems hopeless and nobody seems to be on time. It's dead on the screen. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. Excessive affinity for one actor - Avoid it and do them a favor. Becauze, if it <br /> <br /> make money, these scripts are totally acceptable <br /> <br /> for their quality participants. <br /> <br /> And Mr. DeNirole. You used serious movies. I remember them - <br /> <br /> they were good. You were called their awards - remember how it was fun? Now after "Analyze It" (which was good): "Meet <br /> <br /> Parents" (which was also good) and "Rocky adventures and <br /> <br /> Bullwinkle" (which wasn't good ), I think we have to see you as a parody <br /> <br /> less and watch out for yourself. The "casino" feels for a long time <br /> <br /> back. And no, I don't read "15 minutes" for serious Bobby. Anyone who has taken this media friend seriously, <br /> <br /> must receive their weekly world news
