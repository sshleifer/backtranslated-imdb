It is nice to hear 3 or so comments that indicate what "female footballers" are for women. The title alone is washing a woman of any kind of equality in the media industry or in society, reducing them to two-dimensional cartoons, as men have to behave women. This is a postmodern moronic farce. This can also be called "football player Wifey, who will stay home and know his place". <br /> <br /> On the one hand, it may be a parody of the British, gutter trash press release for celebrities and their role in maintaining patriarchal society. Thus, women can weaken stereotypes by acting like these stereotypes and having the image that they have created for men. Nah, it would be ironic and wise. I also like the fact that I should praise it. <br /> <br /> Zoe Lucker is just too camp and up to take it seriously. Just like even the cheapest Cruella De Ville. He just needs a manic, embarrassing but at the same time laughing self-esteem to show his true scope. Oh he does? Right. In any case, it almost takes to whom it is targeted. Are "clever wise men" journalists who think that this is an ascending sending of the proportions of the wolves, or people who think it is real. "Best Actresses"? OMG !! Stop seeing the coming of the pantomime and get life. <br /> <br /> His totally sexist and low quality that maybe those who enjoy it think they are "funny". Do participants really care or understand what they are communicating with? It falls on both women and men. They are not all selfish, selfish, football-loving materialistic jerks who think that women are nothing but a trophy to show to the public. It's so humiliating. I am sure that Mrs Lucker would easily accept their "real" life and turn them around their fingers as it is so easy for "football women" to do. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not really important. I mean its the only T.V. program. So please let him stay. It is terrible and will only be looked at with the same disbelief that "prison cell block H" was so pleasantly remembered. <br /> <br /> How did it happen? It is certainly not subtle or complicated. It can only come with the same mind as reading the FHM magazine, and I think his "right" look at soft porn and "do" so many women who worship their "will" and sing patriotic and racist comments as "their" Losses / winnings of the football team. It's completely crass.
