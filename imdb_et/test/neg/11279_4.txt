For a Senegal movie based on Prosen's Merimee's book, Carmen, make this movie widely, this film does not just achieve a similar story that is famous for opera and other films. > <br /> ms. Gai as the title of Carmen is a very good look. His fiery dance changer sees the screen as it is in his ugly love scene at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> This is Karmen, whose aim is to please all sexes, but true Carmen, we don't want to! <br /> <br /> We would like to see Mrs Gai in other films where her talent is better used than here.
