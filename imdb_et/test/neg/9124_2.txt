Like many people, I loved the original; "American Graffiti" was one of the 70's major films. For further American Graffiti, the film is a terrible and depressing mess. It was not funny, wide eyes, pleasant characters had become cynical and worshiped, and the stories were given away (like the "Laurie" character with another brother because Richard Dreyfuss did not follow and "Terry Toad" and "Pharaoh Joe" They can even work together in Vietnam, they even have a police officer named Falfa (the original character of Harrison Ford) who makes a "fire." He doesn't even look like Harrison Ford, who was too big a star in 1979 to even bother this garbage . <br /> <br /> Here's the word "funny." This movie is not even fun, Debbie (Candy Clark) is a stripper mixed with a bunch of hippies and trying to get her salesman boy out of prison; i and Laurie (Ron Howard and Cindy Williams), who are lovers of the original, have two kids and they have become annoying, struggling for a couple; Charming little tomboy Carol (MacKenzie Phillips) has become "Rainbow", another hippie child. Milner (Paul LeMat) is a loser racing uto leader whose fortune was predicted at the end of the original. Even Wolfman Jack, whose voice was an integral part of the original and gave him so much flow, only hears randomly. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was a different writer, a different director and a complete lack. a single story that makes this movie a shame. <br /> <br /> The episodic charm and authentic nostalgia of the original is not the result. It was a movie that was not needed to be made, and its best was just to remember what was a great movie "American Graffiti" and to avoid the title "More" movie.
