My wife noticed this movie in a local video shop. From the cover it seemed like a science fiction film, but after my wife saw Rebecca in St James's movie, she realized that it was a Christian film and we suggested it. We are conservative evangelists, but we also know that Christian films have a bad reputation in the mainstream. Nevertheless, we decided to give him a screening. <br /> <br /> To be fair, I had some things that I like about the film. The musical result - much of which was organized - was pretty good. The film was also pretty good, given that it was a budget with less budget. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film production lost all the flow with a regrettable script. The film begins with an interesting assumption - the UFO robbery - but through the intermediate feature, the story draws on a wild evangelical cruise that is driven by the two main characters of the film ... which then rolls a treatise to predators. At least Frank Visett-inspired "Visiting" (which was a deeply defective film) had a game that tied the film's premise. "Unknown" ends somewhere even near where it started, which is a huge backlog. <br /> <br /> What about an example? Supporting operate in a range of decent and terrible. (Rebecca St. James plays a little bit and is satisfying.) For some, some of the main characters are manned. Unfortunately, their talents are wasted by their individuals on both one-dimensional characters to be incredible. "Main" is something other than; you know it's bad when two Christian viewers find the most vocal Christian character in the movie, which is the most annoying. <br /> <br /> A final remark about the evangelical tone of this film, which is more interested in Christians than non-Christian readers. In short, it is embarrassing. Other Christian films, such as Carmen's "Master" and Peretti's "The Hangman's Curse", have been able to communicate a truly uncompromising portrait of Christian faith without hearing or oppression. This film, on the other hand, is a sledgehammer who knows such a difficult hand and has no impression that it would be difficult for non-Christians to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> I believe the filmmaker's heart is in the right place, and I commend the effort to create a good Christian film. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. If your church is looking for a good screening of a Christian film, consider "Mercy Streets", the aforementioned "The Champion" or (if you are Pentecost) a provocative "Apostle" by Robert Duvall. <br /> <br /> Like "Unknown?" Hire it if necessary, but before displaying it to a non-Christian or larger audience.
