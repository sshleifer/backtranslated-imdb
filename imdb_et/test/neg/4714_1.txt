Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. It's so much filmed, the focus is not even on this supposed "real half box", it's more about making a Hollywood movie. No cinematic significance, and if I could take back about half an hour that I spent watching this movie, I would feel better. <br /> <br /> At first it will give you the impression that you are filming somewhat in general, like the actual Hollywood production. But then they go to narration and have been filmed so terribly. It should be a "Blair Witch Project" because they use quite a lot of what you think is "real camera material", that is not, don't be fooled. <br /> <br /> The worst movie I have ever seen. . . on the positive side, it is the same as the semi-scary scene and the half-box visuals were not at all bad. DO NOT RENT
