Komodo vs. Cobra begins as an environmental protector at One Planet Jerry Ryan (Ryan McTavish) and his girlfriend Carrie (Renee Talbert) who hired Captain Michael Stoddard (CEO Michael Paré) to take them to the South Pacific. reluctance, because the island is the highest secret military research base, but will soon change its mind when offering money. Together with TV news reporter Sandra Crescent (Jeri Manthey), they traveled to the island and once found out that the army had funded illegal DNA genetic tests, resulting in a huge Komodo Dragon & King Cobra, who had eaten almost all other living beings there & Stoddard & co is the next menu ... <br /> <br /> Composition and directed by Jim Wynorski, the pseudonym of Jim Andrews, is just terrible, it's just hard to sit through & worse than normal garbage "Creature Features ", the Sci-Fi Channel has nerve air when possible. The script is terrible, predictable and boring, some giant monsters created by DNA-hit scientists, a group of people being caught with monsters and trying to escape. That's it, it's the whole Komodo vs. Cobra plot, maybe it was headed by AVP: Alien vs Predator (2004), but all 'vs' a little goes between twenty-two dumps, twofold, bored like hell and definitely big disappointment for all who hope they have a complete monster. The character is bad, the dialogue is terrible, the pace is slow, the story is predictable and the cliché is driven and the whole movie sucks really lazy with a manuscript that claims wrong that both Komodo dragons & Cobra's are amphibious, which they are not. Hell, Komodo vs Cobra is not even worth the accidental smile because it is so boring and hardly anything happens, though the eyes of a woman behind the smallest stone on Cobra Beach are quite funny for the wrong reasons. How does Wynorski redirect jobs? He is likely to be consistently the worst director who is currently working on how he gets fun sound-proof movies in beautiful places with half-decent lies and still such a horrible movie? I think it was cut to get PG or its TV shows because every time someone swears, it's parrot with a beehive! There's zero gore or violence and the monster scenes are limped, people just sort of stand, monsters just sort of standing there too hissing or roaring & that's it. The CGI computer effects are terrible, it's really a bad stuff that just seems terrible. <br /> <br /> The estimated budget is about $ 450,000, which seems as cheap as it was, Hawaiian locations are great to look at, but that's it. Action is poor cast interestingly. <br /> <br /> Komodo vs Cobra is an absolutely terrific Sci-Fi channel "Creature Feature" by Jim Wynorsk, movies won't get much worse.
