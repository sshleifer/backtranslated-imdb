Zombie movies are hot, I love it. Can't get enough. Why would I buy this caliber movie without explanation, I just love zombies. Surprise, it's really not a lot of zombie movies; with a small budget that I can handle, I have just been upset. <br /> <br /> A group of horror movie clich√©s hold a warehouse / lab that knows what to get out of the fire storm. This results in panic, screaming, low light and (finally) zombies. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for filmmakers, because it is obvious that they really thought they were doing something good; a serious, scary horror movie. It's not far from being a dull wooden-working, cheesy FX, poor lighting, excessive dialogue, and confusion. <br /> <br /> Things get in trouble when it takes 10+ minutes for characters to sit down and start understanding what's going on. It gets worse if it takes another 20 minutes and they still sit, trying to find out what's going on. All this is full of inactive and bad dialogue. <br /> <br /> Finally, some of them can be fixed (not a zombie) and I hope it just starts to touch before the characters smile again (just every generating emotion) how much it sucks. I, too, myself. <br /> <br /> Finally, zombies are mixed, but no one cares anymore. I think there was blood and gore, but I was too busy praying that the credit would be noticed. And when it turned black at the end of the screen, I felt even more deceived by its meaningless "Cube" inspired end. It and the punk chick were very hot when not used. <br /> <br /> Cannot recommend it to anyone except film students looking for no-no references. <br /> <br /> 4/10
