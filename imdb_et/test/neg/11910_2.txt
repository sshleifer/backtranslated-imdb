Jack Lemmon was one of our great actors. His performances on wine days and roses, in the apartment, some like it were hot, disappeared (to name the first ones to remember) were all the best actors. His only victory was Save The Tiger and it is a shame. He gets to the science of melancholy, but he can't balance this character with his leader. In fact, at the end of his career, he made one remark of the same character in Glengarry Glen Ross. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, Jack Gilford's wonderful supportive work as a Lemmon partner and Thayer David as a winner, they go a long way since the rest of the script is confusing jokes, angry, neurotic nostalgia. and meaningless moralization. Avildsen's 1970s style experimental directions are once observable.
