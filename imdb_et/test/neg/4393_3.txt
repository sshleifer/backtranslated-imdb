Me and a friend rent it on the second day of the movie. At first glance, it seemed like this was another teenage movie, which was what we hoped for as fans of simple horror and comedy. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to be a scammer for the viewer. It quickly speeds up something that has a lot of potential. Unfortunately, it never leaves the ground. We watched what seemed like after 1 hour, when, finally, when I was sleeping, I could say, "Dude, this movie sucks" It was just 35 minutes ... Dude agreed. <br /> <br /> The problem is: the movie isn't just funny. It was undoubtedly funny, but it failed. It failed in a way that made me sad. It reminds me of it. I had the potential to be something I wanted, and instead looked at cheap horror / funny movies all the time. I regret the makers of this movie under my heart. It's so sad. All this potential .. and nothing.
