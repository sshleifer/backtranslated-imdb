The government was far from a bad film. I'm not using this word loudly, because honestly the film was a bad excuse. Did I stop viewing this feature with just one word in my mind? "why?" To be honest, you could use this question at the end of every scene in this movie and it seems to be appropriate. There were so many contradictions that led to a lack of development (both story and characters), which ultimately led to a very confusing film in which the participants were moving, not an explanation. Scenes appear without predicting, without understanding or reaching a complete end. It would be as if I looked at several different ideas that would have been put together without really having any resolution. The actors set up ongoing events that didn't seem to fit their character or were actually solved. That was the biggest problem with my movie. The complete and perfect lack of this film brought all the foundations to crumble, proving a true "hanging effect" throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Allow me to further explain the lack of continuity of the film. I'd compare it to the carrot oatmeal with soap in it. It didn't make any sense, nor was it logic. Minnie Driver was the worst culprit of this act. The traits of his character were very blurry and almost transparent. She would do things like sex all the time talking to her sister, but she still seemed open to sexual experiences. She has the first passion in this film, and she has no pain or excitement. It happens, and it just didn't look like the initial conversation we had with Rosina and her sister at the beginning of the movie. She is a very intelligent woman who accidentally finds a solution to the Wilkinson problem and suddenly expects her invention to be full? It was confusing and completely random. Isn't it obvious that his teaching methods were non-existent. Anyone who had the right minds saw that he hadn't taught Cavendish's daughter. The sudden and uncomfortable relationship that occasionally forms between driver and Jonathan Rhys-Meyer was almost ridiculously ridiculous to me. I thought maybe I had discovered the magic of this movie, because Rhys-Meyers literally "stent" the scene and suddenly caused some necessary drama. He found that the director (or the writer) thought that the original story would not go anywhere fast, so by adding this random character we could move the plot a little further (or mix less with the film enthusiasts). Well, it doesn't deceive me, I saw that he was an almost "cut and sticky" sign used to strengthen the already weakened story. Don't let me start with an end that was not consistent with the rest of the story. Again, using the "cut-and-paste" method, the writer of this movie just needed to end the story and that was the only solution they got. Is it sad when actors are forced to do things out of character? but I think it's the name of the Hollywood game. Fix up completely broken or at least salvageable. The rest of the story was unexciting to drift. Perhaps there were a handful of cinematic moments where you saw that one look at creativity is trying to type through some decent, periodic pieces of music, but nothing to write to grandmother. More family structure with some stronger introductions could have strengthened this film a bit more, but as I pointed out earlier, leaving the open film around the film will cause a crack in your foundation. What may seem like a strong story, it takes time, and at the end of this movie I felt the house was falling on me. Wilkinson plays his normal in this movie, while Driver apparently did not want to get naked, but everyone else was (I have to see a doctor when these pictures were burned in my eyes? Eeewwww). He also wore the same dress every day. It was disgusting and I could smell her through television. Sex and dirty lingerie. Now you have a great movie! There seemed to be some potential here, but it was just garbage. Nothing answered, questions seemed like Alaska snow and mediocrity seemed to prevail. <br /> <br /> All in all, it would have been a decent film that combined the powerful themes of science and love, but instead it was just pathetic. I cannot stress enough the worrying fact that the characters went through the movements without any prior explanation. I don't need the moments of cinema that I have been given as a child, but I should have done something to build the foundation. Remember that I used oatmeal with zebra analogy. If you were as confused as I was, you understand the "Government" movie, while you prefer zebras in your oatmeal? then maybe this movie is for you! <br /> <br /> Rating: * Off *****
