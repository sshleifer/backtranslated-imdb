Oh my god, it just doesn't get worse than that !!! I always love stupid little sci-fi movies that are so stupid that they're funny, and I thought it would be one of them, but it was just so stupid that I found it completely regrettable that it was released. What did these people think? Of course, they are not real filmmakers and I really hope they have come back to their day-to-day projects once they realize that it is the best they could do! The special and non-special effects were not even close to the B-film standard with the lowest budget. And what is dressed with men, do they find any women who wanted to appear in this mess. No, probably not. <br /> <br /> I would give this option "0", it doesn't deserve even "1" terribly. Don't waste your time (and especially your money) on the terrible loser of a non-movie!
