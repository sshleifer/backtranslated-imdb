The thin experience (both life and industry) and cash dictated by Sofia Coppola's early short is almost generally a high school campus. The cast is quite weak and will not benefit if they are shot in b & w (they are difficult to distinguish). Audio editing does not just help the simple story of young teenagers loyalty. <br /> <br /> However, there are one or two things. Humanity's inconsistent editing at high school campus has filmed the balance of aspirant wide and intimate close-up shots. Editing music also creates interest and momentum (without the music video netorworld). Coppola clearly tried to change the pace of the movie. The dramatic move is cut quickly and to the point and the other is almost non-existent; we understand that it has actually been played for the first time, which is the point of the storyline of the narrator-crutches (who is otherwise the curiously added sign of this first act). <br /> <br /> Despite these comments, it is inconveniently short. 2/10
