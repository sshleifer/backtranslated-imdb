I gave it to 3 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> If you don't like to watch your time watching an anorexia actor, this movie is a Carly Pope who acts like a ditz, don't worry. / / <br /> Pope Carly plays a young college student, Sara Novaki, who is interested in a puzzle game that takes her down the subway tunnels to the city - a dangerous thing even for a well armed man alone. <br /> <br /> The film has a variety of intrigue-weirdo classmates who apparently chase Sara, a cynical merchant who controls some kind of off-the-wall-wall facility that seems to have been placed at the back of the ghetto, with a nerdish dim-hanging around the candle shop. wit and a woman named Emily Gray, who is back in prison. <br /> <br /> Sara's father is an attorney who deals with Emily's Gray case. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, Emily Gray tried to drown a 12-year-old boy. Emily was put in a mental hospital for 5 years and, for a somewhat confusing reason, they let her out again, although it is obvious that she is still dangerously confused. <br /> <br /> The only explanation Emily has ever given her is crime: I've never sinned. <br /> <br /> It's all part of the design. <br /> <br /> Well, my friend, don't wait to ever get a better explanation because no.
