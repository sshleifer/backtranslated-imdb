I was shocked to read all of these great comments about this movie because I hated it. I stuck to the end, but it was painful - especially the child's voice had to be heard. As Socact-1 pointed out, although the girl claimed to be in Chicago, she had no accent in Chicago - it sounded more like she was trying to emulate a NY-accent - but it didn't work. I was so confused that I was waiting for a punchline. Of all the wonderful actors who could play this child, why did they choose it? And why force him to talk like that? It was not just an accent, it was a script, a monologue created for him. The reason I even chose this movie was that the idea of ​​the plot turned to me - the history of the era, the poor and uneducated character, the type and the triangle of love. As far as I am concerned, it can and should have been much better. I was just soooo to read that at least one other person felt the same way I did about this movie.
