When you read the summary of the "Mad Max" plot, you just destroyed the first 1 hour and 10 minutes of the movie. You have also discovered that "Mad Max" is happening in apocalyptic Australia, which is useful because you have no idea what's going on. The film, made in 1979, is really trying to be Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" (1971), which is the only movie that actually makes sense in its strangeness and leaves it. This movie does not come and ends with a car / bicycle stunt runner that runs like any movie vehicle. <br /> <br /> The first thing that is wrong with "Mad Max" is that he tries to sell himself as a revenge story, if no vigilant appears to revenge until the last 20 minutes. If the first hour had been condensed for 20-30 minutes and then the last 20 was added, and then one more hour later, "the action film of Mad Max Bay would be the main protagonist of the big whistles. Instead, Mel Gibson must wait and act like a sister 2/3 of the film and then sudden epiphany to look for revenge. I have been following the sequel to "Road Warrior" and I have to admit that I'm excited about it just because I want to know This first movie was mostly a waste of time. <br /> <br /> George Miller is doing great things here, but his top symbolism is absurd and the intolerant reaction of the cheese will sort every time the character discovers something terrible, like a burnt hand or what you have totally destroyed these moments. , violence by strange cyclists does not say anything valuable. Even the villain Trainer recognizes Alex's "Clockwork" modeling, which is just a shit. put and completely unimposing.PG violence just does not allow this force to settle into violence and get the reaction from the viewer, it just chews like nothing. <br /> <br /> I give credit for how much the film crew blew up and crashed and Miller does a great job of knowing the intensity of the collision. Everything else is, at best, mediocre, and then one hour after mediocrity you get something good and the film ends 20 minutes later. I'm just going to overcome my fingers "Road Warrior" fulfills expectations where this movie ends, otherwise it's more time wasted. ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my website at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
