This sequel "In the Night of Night" will inevitably carry comparisons with its infinitely better predecessor. "Mister Tibbs" sees the TV-edited theatrical film for sight seeing, such as a TV movie edited for theatrical publications, grainy photography, cheesy opening titles and kits that look like they are made of plywood. The order of murder has a prominent continuity error: the camera shows two hands that stifle the girl, then the hand that reaches the statue, then the girl strikes again with two hands to suffocate and finally a statue that comes down to a deadly blow. The case should be simple: find the only man with three hands! However, poor product values ​​cannot completely hide the important benefits of this film: namely the result of Sidney Poitier as a cool detective who decided to follow evidence wherever it happens, even if it affects a friend. Martin Landau is also convincing because good preachers-activists are suspected of brutally murdering their prostitute girlfriend. In addition to the ghost of the incident, Tibbs is at odds with his home life, but there are no problems with race and Tibb's hardly hidden social resentment. So is the mystery of the murder that made "night heat" so weighty.
