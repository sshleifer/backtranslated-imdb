The endless repetition of evil the World Bank, the IMF, globalization and the Americans is accused of all African problems and the film is long, about two hours, but it seems longer. In the French reality, Mali, the country where the film takes place, was occupied for centuries, but there are only peripheral bad guys. <br /> <br /> None of the characters learn enough to deal with what is really happening they are completely insignificant in preaching that continues and continues. There's no plot, no character development, no humor (except for some pokes Bush and Wolfowitz, but it's almost cheating it's so easy) and the production values ​​are mediocre and there is no redemption there. <br /> <br /> It is amazing that the film can spend two hours preaching on such a big topic and transmitting absolutely zero real information. The Irish ballad "I was dying and then hunger" has more content. <br /> <br /> The film is boring, the subtitles are readable, the actual content is not on the subject. film and propaganda are relentless. <br /> <br /> Leave it out.
