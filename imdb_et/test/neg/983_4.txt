This film would have been really good, probably great if the directors had left the interviews and the concert materials separately. "Into the Void" is a great song, and I hate how it is cut off on the best to go to Ozzy Osbourne's mumbling interview. It should have been at the end of the movie or be special. The best part of concert DVDs is to play and play music, but "Black Sabbath: The Last Supper" is hard to put on and just play because music is constantly interrupted. However, this film has some strengths; the concert material, if it is playing, is great. The black tail returns to the stage after a long break without Osbourne, and this movie hits it well. Of course, the fans have a sweet advantage because they naturally see the band alive, but they also do not have to constantly interview DVDs. Shame on Jeb Brien and Monica Hardiman (directors) for doing this with the movie! It is also a shame for Wyatt Smith to deliver the film in this way.
