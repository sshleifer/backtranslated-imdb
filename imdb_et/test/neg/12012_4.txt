Junior and his father start a new life in the new city. It's the same life because Junior hasn't changed. She's still the same rotten as before she's bigger. This time he has a Trixie palm and he is just a little worse. Junior doesn't like getting to know his father and mixing every opportunity he has. Then the grandfather goes in and the dog comes. I thought these two would have made it a good movie, but they couldn't even finish. It's a movie for the most immature people. It has diapers, farts, doggy do and toilet humor. Only anyone under the age of twelve finds it very fun. I hope that if I have a son, he's just like Junior.
