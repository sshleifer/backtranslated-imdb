I went to the golden golden idea, thinking I was going to watch a documentary about Neil Young. Instead, I saw self-serving respect for the arrogant of an aging baby boom who has lost its edge and forgot its roots. Heartbeaters from more and more aging baby boomers, appreciated by critics of outdated baby boomers, are heart-shaped from start to finish, ie when you can sit around the nearby 2-hour movie. Neil Young and his team have long lost their edge and want the rest of us to join with the soft rocking chair in the middle of the middle. What happened to his brave guitar with his earlier solo aspirations? I think all his fuzz boxes rusted and his surging vacuum tubes exploded in his generation's hot air. As for Demme, is it something wild and Melvin and Howard? A student filmmaker could have made a bolder film than this poorly visualized top film. Don't waste your $ dollars on Heart Of Gold and go straight to The Last Waltz and Gimmie Shelter. And if you really want to dig deep into the rock and roll icon into your personality, drag a copy of Chuck Berry: Hail Hail Rock and Roll, which is very printed. And baby boom generations, don't worry about how someone younger has this review. I am also one of those baby boomers who listened to a cinnamon girl in acid and danced in the streets of Stones Street Fighting Man. Go back and see Don't look back or Gimmie shelter and then come back and tell me that Gold of Gold is worth the document.
