I think "Tank Girl" was supposed to be the "Buckaroo Banzai" of the 90s and it was marketed as such. The comparison is appropriate; both movies have so many movies on any frame that is as impossible as the story to find out, certainly not boring. <br /> <br /> "Tank Girl" is a fun ride when you turn your brain out before the movie starts. Otherwise, you will come to the skull with a splitting headache.
