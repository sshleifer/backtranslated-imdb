Ben Affleck, who's going to be married, shakes up as a result of an airplane accident and goes with another passenger (Sandra Bullock, forcing her to go crazy). Who is to blame for this innocent, ugly moral? It has been so badly changed when I did not have to read the name of the editor when looking at the credit - it was to see if the person actually took the credit! In classics, moods, and Sandra Bullock's raccoon eye makeup, the film doesn't even talk about creating chemistry between two main characters. Laughing no: The scene of a gay bar with Affleck may be laughing if it wasn't so stupid (bar patrons - big messy ones! - shout to Affleck to cut and start digging their money). It should not have any other significance than getting Beni a little open, but the whole scene is misaligned and the result is invisible because the idiot editor cuts off ... or was it a movie, was it? This is a small moment, but it is typical for this film, an amateur pop-product that wants to be nervous with modern comedy but without guts. It's tailored to the bottom of your video store. * from ****
