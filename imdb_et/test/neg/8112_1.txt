The first word I can describe this movie is Awful. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst films I've ever seen. First, the plot is a very thin plot (no comment on this part more) and a plot that many movies in this genre follow. It makes the movie so bad because you know what's going on. Secondly, the film contains many issues that are never disclosed. One of the questions (and not a spoiler) is: WHAT IS VERY HIGH, WHAT THE COMPETITIONS MUST BE LESS !!!!!!!!!! Third, the characters are very bad, not only because the film is bad, but also because of the excusing actors. They are bad because they can be. <br /> <br /> The last thing that makes this movie bad is that it is a horror movie. You should be afraid of killings or sudden shocks, but you are not afraid that you are not scared because you know what is going on. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: The film is as bad as a movie about killer ants! I was hoping it was a very great movie, but because the story is bad, the actors are bad, the film raises many questions and because it is not scary, the film is best seen.
