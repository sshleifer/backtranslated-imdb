Small spoilers below. <br /> <br /> The prospect of war was clearly in sight when filming TFW. From the European refugee opening to the final prediction that Nazism is the death of millions of Germans, this film is as much a propaganda film as the films made after Pearl Harbor. There is not much entertaining value here, although dust shots are interesting for those who are not old enough to remember it. The rest of the plot is pretty forgotten with Herr Docktor Coburn - pretty bad accent - and the daughter assimilates to America with Wayne's help. Other than dusty scenes, the only memorable aspect of a movie is to look backwards. The Coburn speech, which compares Nazism and malignancy, is worse than cancer and describes (then current) progress as the current outbreak of the patient just before death, and Varno dr. operations. <br /> <br /> From a historical perspective, some aspects of TFW are interesting. If you look at it for entertainment outside of World War II, you must say that this is one of Wayne's less successful efforts.
