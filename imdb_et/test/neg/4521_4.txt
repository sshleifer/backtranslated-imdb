There is a thrill of low budget movie delight. And there are frustrating, uninteresting movies made cheap. It belongs to the second category. <br /> <br /> Spot is the name of a nightclub. The film is about a cop whose father has been killed by gangsters. He drives them down. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was a bad print. Maybe it's me. But I felt that I saw it a hundred times, most of these times are better than here. <br /> <br /> This is also a promise: the policeman is fascinated by the woman who plays the records she introduces into the boxes. Then they meet. Now, though it was done before I was born, I've seen such a juke box. And that is incredibly exciting: when I was a teenager, I went to a bar that still had such a device. I always liked juke boxes in bars or eateries. But it was different. You talked to it and the laughing, loud voice of the woman told you! This is what is being discussed here, but it fell into a general, interesting burial. <br /> <br /> The film has one thing he does: In a small role, it is very young Anne Jeffreys. What a beauty she was and no doubt it is still!
