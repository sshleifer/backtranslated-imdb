Am I the only one who thought this film was graphic violence? I didn't know anything about Leigh Scott when I rented it, and wouldn't have done it if I knew that most of his previous films were horror films. I don't take it at all, I was expecting only the informative doctrine of the September 11 report. <br /> <br /> Instead, I got an almost incomprehensible, violent movie. The only good thing for me was that it made me read the report to find out what that movie was. <br /> <br /> I wrote it because I am shocked that we have become so immune to movies and television violence that bloggers whose comments I read should not comment on it.
