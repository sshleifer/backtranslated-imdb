This movie can't decide what it is - soft porn or sf movie. Not enough plot for a real movie, but too much for money. <br /> <br /> Galactic, far away, good princess (we know she's good because she's got long blondes, wearing a white toe) is polite and she's gonna die delightfully about her dead mother when we first get her we see), the kingdom is suppressed by his older sister who is evil (and we know it because he has dark hair and carries too much makeup, abuses his men's sexual slavery) despises and curves his lips all the time and speaks disgracefully of the horrors his queen doing it. An evil princess is upset and trying to conquer the coup, but a good sister goes to Earth. Of course, he will wear a damp T-shirt during the competition at the bar naked. It goes down there. Action is ridiculous, the dialogue sounds like it's written for porn and the overall story is ridiculous. There is not even enough skin to make such a person happy to look at this skin. I love "good" bad movies and it's not even "bad movie" level enjoyable.
