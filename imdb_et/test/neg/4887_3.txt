I bought this for a couple of dollars in a local video store because they cleaned their tapes for DVDs. I doubt they will replace it, somehow. <br /> <br /> I couldn't say it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but it's very boring. There are no real cannibalistic scenes. We Me Lai is not naked enough time (only 4 or 5 times). And he's not the goddess of Thailand I was expecting. So the two reasons for watching my movie were out of the question. <br /> <br /> Here are some serious violence leaders for those who enjoy such a thing. The great battle between the Mongoose and the great snake becomes quite bloody. Also torture of animals, some of which are real and fake. Fortunately, the fake is somewhat funny, but the real one is just a little sick. <br /> <br /> In general, this 70's film - too long, underdeveloped, not as deep as it would have been. But that's something else, right? ONE AND HALF SIGNS!
