Sam O'Steen, editor of the film in the capital, "Rosemary's Baby" since 1968, is here to lead a quick TV sequel, from which Rosemary Woodhouse (Patty Duke Astin, Mia Farrow) has been removed early - and inexplicably - would probably help clarify this devil's story about Satan's son on Earth. The most interesting is Ruth Gordon's return to his Oscar winning role as Minnie Castevet (with Ray Milland as his wife, Roman), but he is not given much to do - and seems awfully inconvenient to participate anyway. This script is a commodity with a strictly low rental price, and it must have shamed the original writer Ira Levin (who continued to write his stage). Quite Twilight and Bad, with poor photography and some distance or intimidation.
