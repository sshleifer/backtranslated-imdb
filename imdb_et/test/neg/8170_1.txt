This film really shows the farce and hypocrisy of Indian society. What he is trying to show is just one story. The other side of the story is the hidden emotional and spiritual abuse of the Indian children, which this film does not show. <br /> <br /> The "Indian Parents" are guilty of the following: a. Destruction of the individuality of children, making them very dependent on the child's age. Such children grow up in adults only in physical appearance, but remain with the children in mind. Because everyone has been given to them by their great Indian parents, they do not automatically recognize the need to work hard or learn to communicate with other people except their parents. <br /> <br /> B. I can show you that many Indian parents who try to keep their children friends go out or prevent them from doing something that will grow into adults. <br /> <br /> The reason they do is the same selfishness. Indian parents are "waiting" for their children to take care of them when they get older. They do not save themselves and when they reach the age of 50 ... They call LOUD ...... We are now old and we are dependent on your children because we have made YOUR SERVICE so that we bring you to this world and care for you and intellectually weak. <br /> <br /> Most Indian parents at the age of 50 have decomposed their bodies and health and are financially insecure. Most feel that they have no need to take care of themselves because they "wait" for their children to take care of them. <br /> <br /> The opposite happens in the West. People start planning their retirement at the age of 20 and when they retire, they are financially secure. I am a victim of my Indian parents (I am sure there are many other Indian children like me) who have physically grown, but are still fighting for their lives and continue to have 50-year-old enemies calling all the time with a HELP voice. <br /> <br /> This movie shows only one story ..... UTTER JUNK piece
