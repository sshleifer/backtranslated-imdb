I'm an avid movie observer and I enjoy a variety of movies. But I didn't find any pleasure in this movie. This is probably the worst film I've ever seen. I don't feel like he has a lot of story, the characters wouldn't be nice, and the relationship between the characters was at best uncertain and the ending ended up just against the film. This is certainly not the same category as the "cave", which I thought was the best cave film ever made. Even "The Descent" was better than this movie. <br /> <br /> It was a $ 3.79 rent and my time. Do it yourself and avoid it.
