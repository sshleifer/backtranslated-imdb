Bad, bad, movie, so bad it's worth a look. As long as you watch this movie knowing it is bad and you spend 2 hours watching a bad movie, it's worth it. Special effects are cheesy and animals see fakes and acting is bad, but looking at the faces of the actors when they are trying to intimidate is just very funny. If your sister eats a giant Komodo dragon, wouldn't you do anything to save her? If he did not eat, wouldn't you fall on your knees crying your heart? This man sat in the chair and ran his hair. How is it anti-climate? Maybe he had to be in shock or something. She joins her sister's Komodo belly - oh, she didn't want to spoil it for you.
