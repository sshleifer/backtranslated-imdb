This movie is a bad movie. But after watching an endless number of bad horror movies, I can say that it is a bit different from what I've seen. Not on a plot that is a fairly common story, but a way to cut scenes. The murder response gives us a lot of human dialogue scenes, but they continue for much longer than most such movies. Because of this, some victims seem to have a little less cardboard extracts. Just a little. It was a difficult time for me to figure out exactly what was happening at first and wondering if certain events were dreams. My favorite scene is when two men have killed to kill and shelter in the car. In the glove they are a handgun. "Thank you, God!" one of them cries happily. This boy's head suddenly sees the dummy's head and it just took time for me to think, "What's this? Where's this mannequin in the car with two boys?" Then BOOM! The head explodes, and I thought it was supposed to be one of the cars that shot down with a shotgun head. I love this scene, but the movie is a very bad movie. 3/10.
