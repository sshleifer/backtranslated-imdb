When I did not read the original book and did not see the previous film and knew nothing about the events of the current film, I came to the film openly. <br /> <br /> It is really a difficult message to comment on the movie because the whole thing seems so confusing. There seems to be a point or a message or something in the movie, but what it is is completely vague. <br /> <br /> Impacts were fantastic and very well rated. The idea was really well designed to clearly motivate time travel. Nevertheless, it was downhill. <br /> <br /> The whole journey seems to have only the most vague relationship with the beginning of the endeavor. There are some nice ideas, but they seem to be isolated events that really don't flow and make the movie inseparable and lost. At one point, there is doubt as to whether the main story of the film is the fate of the month. <br /> <br /> When Hartdegen arrives at 802 701 AD, the film becomes very depressing as it seems to be unable to detect anything important about Eloi, and although it seems clear that something is known, it is still annoying . This is a rather strange change from previous travel guides and one is wondering why all of this is suddenly abandoned by what seems like a whole new story. So many things happen that there should be an explanation, but there is no discovery. I really, really wanted to know what the movie was "getting" that was needed to be discovered but unsuccessful. Having read a summary of what is happening in this book, it seems that this movie is a very affectionate attempt to do, but it is so simplified and "dumbed" that meaning and context are completely the way we hope we finally discovered where all this is leading, the film dramatically takes on another major direction change and becomes a meaningless action film without actual action. It is at this very moment that the director has simply given up on the meaning of the film. There are now many important things without explanation. Hartdegen does not take the opportunity back to the past twice for no reason and then suddenly loses interest throughout the time. The film ends sharply when Hartdegen decides to stay with Eloi. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, after a good start, the film is very disappointing. Too much time is spent on the adventures of Hartdeg before Eloi arrives. But the worst part of the film is what I think is the most important part: creating a situation with Eloiga. The whole point is completely lost and it undermines the rest of the movie. After that, the film focuses too much on the effects and activities, and all attempts to return to the meaning and essence of the film seem to be forced and inappropriate. So many things happen without explanation, the film seems to be lost and loses direction. The final finals in which Hartdegen decides he is no longer interested in time travel are the most obvious. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it seemed that the whole movie seemed to be a set of incompatible incidents. Thought and context were lost, although the opening hole where it should have been was very obvious. It was all so depressing that there were so many opportunities here: it was by no means a bad movie, but just so easy it could have been so much better. The start was very promising, travel time seemed fantastic and would have worked if it didn't touch the tangents, and Hartdegen's experience with Eloi would have worked so easily when asked some of the right questions and wouldn't it be tempted to "fool" and simplify. I just wish I had the time machine to travel in time and advise on the mistakes made.
