Jeff Leroy wanted to joke about Scientology, so he built a horror film around a similar cult. The appeal is that, instead of the poor old L. Ron Hubbard, the cultural figure has been a monster of centuries-old space, making his followers vampires. Our hero is a dirty living college student studying occultism. His landlord is an attractive blonde who tries to cleanse his life with a cult. He won't take him for a long time to figure out he's just one thing: his blood. "The Screaming" was very cheap on the video and I just cleaned up. The space monster (which looks like a giant winged cat who looks eternally mad and has no skin) is an alternating clay memory miniature and big animated dolls, both of which look awful. Action and writing are both terrible and the manager does not even try to hide the fact that this film was made of something. Avoid this scary, merciless violence.
