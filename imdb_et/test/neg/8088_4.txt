If you want to see someone else accidentally eating another man's testicle, or look at the disgraceful counterfeit attacks or listen to the man, tell me how good it seemed to be with the girl during sex when she was throwing, then that's a movie for you. Of course, Tomcats is an interesting interweaving of neck fracture, romantic and crisp comedy. Lovely Jaime Pressly plays Horatio Sanz's husband (tell me one more) who has many other silhouette situations with other women, but surprisingly there is no nudity. Jake Busey thoroughly rebels as a dog that you wouldn't want as a friend. Shannon Elizabeth and Jerry O'Connell are both good and convincing, but the film is too busy to try and be good.
