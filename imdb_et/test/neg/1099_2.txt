It begins in Pennsylvania in 1913. The mine owner deliberately kills the mine explosion. Cut to 2006. Recently, Karen (Lori Heuring), her teenage daughter Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and a little girl Emma (Chloe Moretz) are moving to a remote house near this mine. What they don't know is the infamous forests of toddlers and kill anyone who is blind. <br /> <br /> Slow and boring "horror movie". The premise is obvious and has been done to death. There are also big gaps in the logic of the story. It has never become clear why these children are killing someone or why they later eat their bodies (Yes - it is shown). They're already dead - why do they need food? And why are they not hidden for a long time? He was around the area. Why choose this time to attack him? Also, the characters are not the least pleasing. Sarah is the worst. It has some saving mercies. The location is beautiful and unfortunate at the same time, some killings were very bloody and brutal, and the children themselves watched the horror by walking in the woods at night. All in all, I was bored and fought awake. You can skip this.
