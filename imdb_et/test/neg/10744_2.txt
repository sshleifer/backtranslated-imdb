I appreciate satire, which contradicts my own view, but it must be witty and well placed. This movie is ... how can I explain it. It doesn't do the slightest, much less intelligence. In fact, it is hardly terrible. Dead soldiers come to life, but they are not interested in the brain, but in the booths. Why? Cue's endless stream of the most idiotic, banal, swollen windbreakers knees "bad president, bad conservatives, bad Republicans." What was a self-defeating, messy, corkscrew piece of pig meat it was. <br /> <br /> Even if they agree with the "points" of the episode, only the stupid most liberals would say they enjoyed watching it. And again, the determination of fraud, anger, hostile, antisocial, and any semi-normal liberal spectrum for a certain degree of stupidity is in itself a long task. <br /> <br /> Avoid a liberal convention.
