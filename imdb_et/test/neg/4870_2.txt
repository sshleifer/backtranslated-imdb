This movie is full of so many idiotic moments that you don't know how it ever got. For example, they get into the Capitol sewer and during the sewers they see signs that point to different government buildings, and then they come to the center of the street! I very much doubt that government buildings would provide the public with access to the public sewerage system. Anyway, I gave it 1 instead of just 2 because of its comic value. I laughed at this idiocy of all the parties.
