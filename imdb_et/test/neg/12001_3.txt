Of all the films he had seen over the years, it was probably the worst. I took four children from 7 to 11 years of age and none of them liked it. <br /> <br /> The script seemed to be based on Willy Wonka's story, but it had nothing. <Br /> <br /> If you are considering seeing this movie, don't waste your time, it's bad. <br /> <br /> They make a sequel, so it may be worth watching if they can even make the movie worse, but I don't think it's possible.
