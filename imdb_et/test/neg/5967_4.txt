I saw the movie in the original Italian. It has to be said that operation and interpretation are the most contaminated by the tendency to talk with heavily muted voice, not by moving the lip, tightening tones, as it appeared in "It is in real life" and "Let's-raise" tears "-screen-playwriting. Recent Massimo Girotti towers have other characters for intensity, clarity, and intellectual integrity. The film has some good hints, but (like any other comment before me) does not have a focal point and it moves on many smaller and less important plots Some of the styles can be saved for the public, such as confectionery (the charm and aesthetics of cooking and the sensual load of sweets, see Chocolat, Lunch of Babette, Vatel, etc.) Hammam and fairies are certainly more real, it seems jw.org en Ozpetek has studied Italy in the early 2000s and is rumbling ... I give him the last chance ...
