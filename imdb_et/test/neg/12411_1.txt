No, it's sick. It's not sick. It made me want because I spent 2 dollars. Its boring, slowed and annoying. I didn't see the MST3K version that sucks because I bet the MST3K version was funny. It is sad that people spend money on such films. I'm surprised that this is not "100 worst movie in the whole time list". <br /> <br /> TromaDude rating - 0 out **** **** stars
