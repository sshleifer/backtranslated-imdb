The story of a good-guy-vs-evil tyrant, set in 19th-century Russia, may have been an attempt to extend Steve Reeves's career beyond these "Hercules" films. However, despite the different costumes, it is still a "Hercules" movie with a regular stylistic dialogue, random duplication and cardboard characters. On the other hand, there are many activities, speed rarely flags and Reeves can make one more of these scenes, where he has removed the waist, tied ropes and given vigorous whipping, which goes without saying that has little effect on his incredible character.
