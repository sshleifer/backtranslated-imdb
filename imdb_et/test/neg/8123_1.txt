I don't care if this show is supposed to deliver deep messages about human existence. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is crap .... how can anyone enjoy it? Yet it did so well. This reflects the sad situation for Joe Moron there. <br /> <br /> I tried to watch this program when it first came out when friends spoke about it. The two main characters laughing and the pathetic dialogue made me want to cry. <br /> <br /> It is incredible that people can look at this example. But I think the creators had the last laugh ... making themselves rich by taking those people who saw such an exhibition. <br /> <br /> I'd make them laugh until the bank.
