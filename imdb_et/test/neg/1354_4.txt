I believe that a whole book can be written about odyssey to redesign the classic film on which this film is loosely based. When Hollywood began talking about such a company, the reaction was always negative because there were too many aspects that would have gone wrong, starting with a solid band that made the original unforgettable, and that's exactly where things are going to pour here. Actors who are otherwise able to do significant work but are unsuitable for parts and are unfortunately sufficiently focused on the driver's heavy hand who does not understand or appreciate the source material. <br /> <br /> It would seem that there is no focus or direction, or that the direction taken to erase something that was good about the original movie. This is called an update, as we let the story of humor, a lovely dialogue and an interesting assumption. First of all, we prove that women have come a long way, except that the problem is that we really can't (at least watching this movie) where women really go. <br /> <br /> Starters, filming Meg Ryan's central role in the film is almost deadly because he seems to be in some way locked if women don't change even after 20 years of working in the film. His Mary, who proved to be a difficult role in the 1930s, somehow grew up in communicating with other stereotypes, such as Dorothy's "Oz Wizard", learning, observing, and knowing she had a choice on this issue. It may not have been the choice women would celebrate today, but it was fun to drive, and some of the fun was a silly, silly, sometimes dirty routine that raised this film to the greatness of the movie. Here on earth we are on earth. By changing the nature of Sylvia, the film has lost a lot of its sparks and it is still not the fault of Annette Bening. I could not admire how he tried to save that sinking ship and sank for hours when he fought the terrible lines he was on. Luckily, I am entertaining myself, looking at some of her terrible outfits and reminding myself how talented this lady really was. Her Sylvia is smart, but faulty, and she could have been a great creature. Unfortunately, Mrs English did not pay attention to her work and loses control of one character that could have turned the film into a new direction. . In the original, we have Joan Crawford apparently one of the best performances of a woman. His crystal is legendary, connecting lines, innocence, duplicating maneuvers and some very sexy images. He was in a relationship between a man and a woman and through him we knew what the whole disaster was. He gave tensions between men and women. He was dangerous, sexy, ultimate femme fatale. The intelligent woman we feared and admired, and most importantly, we wanted to destroy to save our heroine. Eva Mendes, as proud as she is, is on a two-dimensional journey because of weak writing and again because of poor casting. <br /> <br /> There are more atrocities in the film, such as the terrible role of Mensing as a dedicated mother who lives for young children, and rather Pinkett's rather annoying lesbian turn. Then the biggest waste of talent in the film, as Bette Middler, who is somewhat unknown in her structure, shows what could have been. His acidic supply reminds us of the current angle the film could take. His words revive and put a lot of indispensable despair into the film and it is exciting to see that it really flies, it is lost. She's in the movie for six minutes and she gets lost in the middle. <br /> <br /> Here is a movie that raised our anticipation and truly frustrated us, a movie that could have joined the successful "Sex in the City" who made an amazing transition to a big screen because he honored his source material and didn't compromises. It gave us more, bigger and better adaptation. It really refreshed what made it successful. "Women" in their current reincarnation must go back and work, as "The Hulk" did this year, found more suitable performers, really a good writer, and above all someone who truly treasures what are good movies. about.
