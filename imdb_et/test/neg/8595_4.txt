If you can watch a movie without worrying about the plot or acting nervously, Backdraft is definitely one. <br /> <br /> But if I like watching movies you can believe, Backdraft has some serious drawbacks. It does not offer anything new and there are hundreds of 90 action movies that follow the same formulas but are not quite as tough. <br /> <br /> After two firefights, I mean it has to go somewhere else, I mean, how many big fires in one town? Are firefighters sure to do other things, such as picking up cats? Well, I was wrong, and repetition continues over and over until the end. <br /> <br /> The good aspect of the movie is fire, well filmed, and I have to say that I was quite looking at it, suggesting that two hours of viewing without a story or showing would be more suitable for my taste.
