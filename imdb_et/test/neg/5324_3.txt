I saw the movie before reading the book. When I saw the movie, I was upset because I was wondering why Dean Koontz had made such a bad book / movie. The film was confusing and had no flow, it was dirty and made me throw a stone on the TV. I could not contact the characters at all, so I do not care about what happened to them (usually I love these characters because I can associate them with the person or problems). Then I read the book and loved it. I often read the book again and the film collects dust. I want someone to make a Koontz movie that follows his plot of land, so the movies don't so much. DO NOT ATTENTION WHEN YOU NEED TO AVOID MONEY!
