This movie is a big disappointment. Director Vicente Aranda has offered many interesting films throughout his long career, some of which were highlighted by the strong and powerful performances of Spanish actress Victoria Abril. JUANA LA LOCA also relies on a talented actor, newcomer Pilar Lopez de Ayala, but it is hardly the only positive element in the otherwise terrible confusion of the film. Although Lopez de Ayala tries to portray a yuan as a romantic and passionate young woman, loved by his nice husband, he is probably able to develop his character over this one-dimensional function; Juana was an important figure in Spanish history, and the politics of that time were indispensable at her scene ... but here she introduced a sabotage from a romantic leading woman; this is a real loss, and the film has no way of showing how personal life can affect history and vice versa. The worst thing is that Italian actors Daniele Liotti and Manuela Arcuri appear in real bad performances, which is a real problem for Liotti, as he depicts Felipe el Hermoso, who plays a central role in this story. There is a clear choice to attract young people to the audience, as both look like top models of this era. On the other hand, talented actors such as Giuliano Gemma and Rosana Pastor are completely wasting their supporting roles, which are clearly underdeveloped. Even when it was a big budget movie, little care was taken to bring a good scenario or to create "periodic pieces" on the screen. Costumes are particularly grotesque in some of the group's scenes, as if they were taken out of stock without real coherence. In summary, JUANA LA LOCA's main problem (and what makes the difference with much higher historical films than LA REINE MARGOT or ELIZABETH) is the lack of a director's position. This is a strange move during Aranda's career as he was able to develop it in other works (LIBERTARIA and AMANTES came to my mind), creating very personal and interesting films. and it's not very good!
