I only bought this DVD because it was cheap and it seemed interesting in its special way ("special", which means "slowed down"). The film turned out to be quite uninteresting - the boring work of the camera, nothing really telling the story, and of course it is terrible. It wasn't even a "bad" campy way - it was just bad. In fact, a handful of great dialogues, but mostly it's uncomfortable and weak. All I could think of while watching it was that it could actually be a good movie if the script was overhauled (if it was written by someone who actually understood the culture of the drug) and if a decent participant was cast. I wouldn't recommend "with a nanny at the weekend" unless you plan a career and want to learn what you can't do in the movie.
