Usually, I don't write comments about exhibitions unless I've seen them completely. However, there were so many positive views at the show, as I felt it was necessary to achieve a balance. <br /> <br /> This show is hysterically bad. I don't think it was supposed to be, but it is. I see the exhibition has a lot of praise and I do not understand why --- this exhibition has worked so badly, the dialogue is so terrible and the plots are thin around their holes. <br /> <br /> I think this exhibition is interesting because it is a firm litmus test of your standards. Some elements of the exhibition work and perhaps these elements are more important to some people than those who do not work, which makes the exhibition invisible to people like me. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy the fun at the show, if you look at it, you look at the clichés and the like, it can be enjoyable to show you ridicule if you have such time in your hands. <br /> <br /> The pilot is a fairly fair example of the entire performance. If the meaningless end of the saccharin cliché does not leave you stupid, it may be an indicator for you.
