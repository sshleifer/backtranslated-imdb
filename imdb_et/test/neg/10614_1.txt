I love these terrible 80-year-old summer camps. The best part about "Party Camp" is that it is literally not a plot. It just pushes the location of weak "characters" and then happens from time to time. The clichés here are unlimited (SPOILERS): nerds vs. pushers, secretive girls in the girls' locker room, hikers in the nudist colony, at the end of the race, secretly horny camp administrators and embarrassingly silly sexual everywhere. The only missing cliché is the presence of Corey Feldman. This film makes you laugh, but never deliberately. I repeat, NOT. The last note, be prepared to split the gut, watching the crap that is a "dramatic" scene where Jerry Riviera and D.A. share the beer late at night, pouring your guts on each other. Dialogue is literally pointless and action is at the high school stage. It's classic.
