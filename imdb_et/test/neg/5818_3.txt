This is the story of a news researcher who hates his work - which proves why actors - even as weak as Tom Cruise and Denzel Washington - are on the big screen and your neighbors are not! <br /> <br /> Say this - better moments show some reason to be really funny (not just nervous) to continue trying, maybe some classes and using the time to learn to do a good movie. ("Dude, where my car" and "Scary Movie" is in the whole ... college trial.) <br /> <br /> There was no lighting; production was not; and the script had moments (conversation from space - a very nice experiment convincingly). (It reminded me of "Dark Star" - which is about "lost space" - but this movie is just gone.) <br /> <br /> Talent was a bartender (he said the dog was so annoying that I knew that he had to act ... wasn't he ... ... now who's acting!), Mark Hammond boy and Marty. I think I gave the movie about everyone ... 3/10. <br /> <br /> -LD <br /> <br /> ______________________________________________ <br /> <br /> my belief: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
