This film begins with the main artist who is in the coma hospital department, where there are two orders. The unconscious main character is heard by voice, saying that the Order is gay. Orders kiss. I watched it in a DVD version and I have a doubt that it should be funny? he said the DVD case had comedy, and it will continue as if I had seen it.
