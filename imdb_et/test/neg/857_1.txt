Even those of us who love cute animal images --- and I abhor them --- would be hard to find any value in this abysmally bad travesty movie. Perhaps inspired by "101 Dalmatians" with its smart and loyal dogs, its stupid and frightening people, and its absurdly "happy" and predictable ending, the second title is "101 Turkeys".

Let me read how this is bad. Dizziness Primer? Asinine Script? Unfavorable performances and sophomore direction? Quickly Smart Animals? Endless clich√©s and predictable blow? In the second thought, I and the IMDb browsers do not have the time to complete their catalog of deficiencies. But would I be empty to make this substantive detail. Believe me, it's bad; Signal Monument in the Great Pantheon of a Really Dreadful (Canada) Cinema. If you have already seen it, my sympathy. If you are not, stay away from it as if you were SARS or bubble cancer. Or other movies with cute animals.

Maybe tonight, when I retire, I have a nightmare with worshiped animals rising from the bedside when I flee. I hope. This is a much better thing I do when I look at this beastly banal boondoggle. But then I can dream that I had to look at it a second time, and because of this sharp and cold sweating I want to stay overnight, trembling very much to see it even in a bad dream. I can even find something to look at instead. Maybe "Godzilla" or "Killer Tomatoes" Attack It is possible that my vacuum cleaner guide video.
