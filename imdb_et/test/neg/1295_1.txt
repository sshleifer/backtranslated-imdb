Avoid this movie. If you wait for "Poseidon's adventure" (1972), then you may have nothing more than a "curve" case. This movie offers nothing more than two extremely long and drawn hours full of boredom. <br /> <br /> Cast members are like being annoyed with bed bath water. insignificant petunias. The script is completely unrealistic and the film doesn't even have a catastrophic film. In fact, everything about this movie is bad, except Tom Courtenay. It is unfortunate that such a subtle actor swept away the flood of false pretense to appear in such a laundering. When this movie was made, Poseidon must shame his watery grave. And Shelley Winters rises again from the dead (directly from Poseidon) to haunt someone who dares to see this pathetic movie. I appreciate this movie from 10 out of 10, but it deserves zero. This film makes you avoid or completely resist water. And it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. It may even want to see "jaws" (1975) and make friends with a great white.
