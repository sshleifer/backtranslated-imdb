It has nothing to do with an absolutely fantastic first slip. And, of course, we have the Americans only have to succeed in English, because reading the subtitles is SOOOOO Hard, isn't it! From what I've seen in new trailers with the wonderful now pregnant Jessica Alba (well, no definite ruin in every teenage boy's fantasy is everywhere!) It looks exactly the same but probably double budget. I thought the original was one of the best horror / stop / mystery clips I've ever seen in every language. I would recommend looking at it and skipping it, there is no reason to look at it because there is no reason to call it "The Eye 2", except to take advantage of the excellence that was the first flick. Take advantage of the "The Eye" clock, which has grown up and ready to jump. I watched it on the headphones and I was pleasantly surprised by the direction of the Pang brothers. When The Eye remake does what I hope it will make Pang Brothers a career in the career, but at the same time it seems a shame that people do not see / see the original, because very often / almost always the remake is not as good as the original . Look at this if you want to be a little bored, but the original is not just a string that is just a name.
