I found this film a complete 96-minute waste. jones was a weird boy and is terribly confused! According to my memory, which may be wrong, wasn't he only 16 or 17 years old? ** Spoiler ** why did she leave college and rent an apartment with two crazy girls who are attracted to boys? and the cowboy who lived under you also dug me out how he knew what didn't go in the apartments in the past. I don't understand her thinking of a girl who was having fun and staying in her room when mandy moore was always over and it's pretty obvious she wanted to be with her more than friends. I really can't find this movie funny or artistic or dramatic or something I found to be a stupid and complete waste of time (D-F +)
