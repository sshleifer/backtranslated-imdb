Hire this only movie if you're in a mood to laugh (thin stupidity) because this movie wouldn't scare Halloween party! The problem is that the kiddies are too much gore, so be sure not to put this VCR on toddlers. It starts with a little promise that gives you the impression that the box cover artist may actually be watching this movie before designing the cover, but then quickly falls into epic stupidity. "Killer scarecrows" is a clumsy oaf that is about as scary as the Oz's wizard, but not quite as smart. If they had only the brain ...? I got this movie for $ 1.20 at a local discount store and even so, I feel a little bit. I think all the other comments here, if you really pay for it, can only blame yourself.
