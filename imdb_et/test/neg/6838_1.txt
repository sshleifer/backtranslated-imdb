Spoilers !! Bruce Willis, a part-time comic and funny man, plays a Spanish assassin nickname after an African trapper prairie? I think all good Hispanic nicknames like Sicatriz (Scar), Scorpion, Viper, Cobra, Snake, Tarantula, Latigo (whip), Navaja (blade) etc were not available? And why should some South American assassin get to know the Irish Republican army terrorist? The last time I checked, IRA does not want to open any branch in South America. And why should the prison's tough, anti-combat Irish terrorist look like medieval Richard Gerest? I thought this film would be "The Crying Game" fraud when Gere's character was introduced as a person who intended "The Jackal." What a bad pain! And why would employing the FBI hired terrorists to track down the assassins? It seems that the terrorist goes to mass destruction, and the assassin usually hits one target in a non-remarkable way. But, according to the FBI, Gere is the only person ever to have seen Will. I thought this movie was supposed to be a remake of the very big movie "Jackal Day", but this movie is just a silly version of "Assassins" with Stallone and Banderas. Both movies are really stupid and some of the stupidity is that when the audience is forced to look at Bruce Will through his routines and we should say "Wow! He's not smart!" PROFESSIONAL With Jean Reno, there was a much better film about the assassin. "The Jackal" is just a movie of two middle-aged millionaires who could pay for seeing them beautifully and pretending to be smart! "The Jackal" is so poor that I expected to see Sly Stallone, Dennis Rodman, Mickey Rourke and Jean Clod Van Dumme as "other" hit players or the FBI. Needless to say, "The Jackal" has prevented the FBI for twenty-five years, but as soon as Richard Gere comes to work, it is only a few days before the Jackal Gate! I think the positive message of this movie is: "Thanks to terrorists, our streets are protected from poachers." In general, "Jackal" has no redemption qualities.
