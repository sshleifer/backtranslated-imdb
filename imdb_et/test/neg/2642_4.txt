"Milo" is another answer to what no one has ever asked. Do we really need more slasher? I think we already have more than enough. I think professional high boys paid so much that we are dealing with a murderer who is also a zombie or ghost when he knows it. He has long lost, but it didn't bother him and he still kills people ("Friday, 13", what is it?). a big reunion and as a surprise, Milo must visit them. With some very bad images that show everything except murders that are cast, only the last girl is separated to find out Milo's dumb, I mean a dark secret. He and his friends are dead to find out. When he discovered, Milo is going to rush to another murderer (isn't it before bedtime?) And the girl screams a lot. barrel refuses to relate to it.Milo may from time to time be one horrible bastard. just can't save without big script or free nudity.
