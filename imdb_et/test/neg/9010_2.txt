I accept that most of the 50's horror is not frightening to today's standards, but what the hell is that? If you see such a title, you expect to see blood and blood thirst. Instead, we don't get any blood and beast who wants to take over the world or live in peace on Earth. Yes, what people wanted. <br /> <br /> The general story of a good astronaut returns to life and is one of the beast .... but the title really kills the movie. Beast's night would have made fans happier because there is really no blood to talk about. <br /> <br /> I like how the 50's movies had an end that was behind the space, but wisely never did. This movie is not the worst I've ever seen, but it's almost there. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
