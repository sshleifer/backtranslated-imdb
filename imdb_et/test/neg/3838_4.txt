I thought Choke had potential, but I thought it might have been a much better film. It had some interesting turns, but some of them seemed pointless. Looking at the two main characters, some seemed really terrible. Most of it was kind of useless and didn't help the movie at all. It wasn't Dennis Hopper's best lesson either. But the main sustainable arm of this film was Michael Madsen. His performance was great. In this film he makes almost Mr Blonde a beautiful guy. All in all, it was traceable. At the same time, I thought that some things might have been different. In my opinion, these things would have made the film much better.
