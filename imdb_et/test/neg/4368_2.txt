I've never seen the first Killjoy movie and I've never heard anything good about it. So I see Killjoy 2 in local blockbusters and pick it up and look back. Takes Trent Haaga and Debbie Rochon. Now it is a massive Troma fan that I have not rented this movie in any way, how can it be bad with these two initiatives? Oh, how wrong I was. Even Trent and Debbie can't save the excuse that the movie isn't as bad as it really is. Trent smells honestly like Killjoy, although it is probably more of a writer's guilt, giving him some of the worst liners in film history. Debbie is making a solid result, but that's not enough. The killings are terrible, as are the gore effects. For example, check when a man is supposed to be something or something. And just to the end, it's one of the worst I've ever seen in film history. The film doesn't even work as bad as good. Avoid clinging. <br /> <br /> 2/10
