Welcome to the world of Vikram Bhatti, who was once successful and had many hits with small actors such as KASOOR, RAAZ and also the multi-faceted AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA and his one movie Aamir GHULAM <br /> <br /> about this is that everything is Hollywood remodeling and some decent, like once that worked <br /> <br /> SPEED is a CELLULAR remake and it's too terrible. <br /> <br /> Look at the stars, we have once sold, but now developed, Urmila and Sanjay Suri, we have flop Aftab, Ashish Chaudhary, Zayed Khan and others <br /> <br /> A decent thriller, but many of the problems there are narrating are a number of cringeworthy scenes like Zayed Hijacking Mobile Company and many more and the stunts too are ridiculous, while the twists end up being too ridiculous The film also took a long time to reach theaters that lose their spark > <br /> The direction is terrible Music is outdated <br /> <br /> Zayed Khan screams, makes his face What he always does is Urmila's good, Sanjay Suri is not so convincing that Ashish Chaudhary is trying hard Play and she is okay Aftab is terrible and she makes you laugh in a negative role. solo hit KASOOR Sophie's terrible Tanushree is not an actress
