I went to watch this movie to kill for a while. I remember Cole Hauser in "Tigerland" and although her action is wood, she represents a harsh "leader" character. Same here. This film was about young hot scientists and divers exploring a cave in Romania. The original scene was very interesting, because the silly Romanian or Russian men searched for the harvest while searching for the cave. Flash on for 30 years, and we have a team of divers invited by some scientists and his team to explore some cave with some unknown scientific purpose. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of clich√©, useless call. Women are too hot for their work, let's face it. I hate to see that the lips of these women talk about the sons, being beer before exploring the cave. I mean, it was like we were in a bar, where the opposite was said about sex - not a group of scientists and divers. Every character had a ZERO personality, perhaps with the exception of a scientist who was at least a young and beautiful person. So, acting, though laborious, was not inspiring. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was pretty bad. At one point in the movie, Cole Hauser ("Jack"), the leading diver - his irises morphid into Cingular's wireless symbol and remain so. We must believe that as one of these monsters was scratched, it becomes one of them. Fair enough. But first of all, nobody tells him a thing: "What's your EYES, dude?" No. Everyone was just talking about how he had "changed" and that he should no longer be the leader of the group. And then this man says, "You see how he is NOT HUMAN". Ah? If they really believed he was a scary monster, why not act? Instead, the group is divided into two - those who go with Jack, and those who go their way, thought he was a monster. That doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> The best scene in this movie was this blonde diver who climbs the cave and attacks the goblin. His scream really wondered - but he fought like hell to send a goblin. <br /> <br /> Photography was good when the camera was STILL. But all the sequences of action, the director found it was useful to confuse hell, blinking bubbles, flashlights, dark space, god knows what. I wish they just showed us the scene right away. Just because you move the camera all over the place does not make the movie SCARIER. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been a lot better if the following changes were made: <br /> <br /> 1. Every actor replaced someone who seemed real. Let Cole Hauser lead, it's OK to let her be beautiful. I'm tired of seeing a 20-something supermodel scientist. Give me a break, people! <br /> <br /> 2. The filmmaker was fired and replaced the one who was just driving and sitting. It may be the director's fault, I don't know. A jumping camera (like Constant Gardener) is getting old, people. <br /> <br /> 3. We must see that goblins actually eat people. How do some times? There's nothing more in this movie. We barely looked at the beings - I felt a little bit of it. <br /> <br /> 4. The end was pretty flat. Until now, a sexy British scientist is a secret ... guess what it is? It's a little preserved. The end would have been better if they all died instead of the Black Boy (Morris Chestnut) who seemed to breathe his heart simply by expressing his compassion. All other participants had no expression. <br /> <br /> I gave it to 4 out of 10 because, after all, it was an unnoticeable fault and the concept was quite original. I'd like to see Cole doing more military roles - she's good at it.
