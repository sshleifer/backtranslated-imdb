I can't believe I actually sat through this whole movie. The friend rented it because the jacket did it good. The jacket was right in the defense; there was probably a haunted room where someone was sleeping overnight. Jacket it sounded like Freddy, Jason, or "The Shining". It cannot be beyond the truth. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of minimalist and / or surreal movies, you can enjoy it. If you are looking for a good scary movie or a couple of excitement, go to Jason vs Freddy IV for a better night.
