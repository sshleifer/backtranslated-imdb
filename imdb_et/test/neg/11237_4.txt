I have just captured this movie on TCM and I understand why George Murphy went into politics when it was the best MGM he was good for him. It's so slow that the attempt to make it a real film-to-knife effort doesn't come out. It had two of my favorite tunes <br /> <br /> Eve Arden (completely wasted) and Dean Stockwell (the best actor in the movie), but what really hit me was that the leading lady, Frances Gifford, passed about 90 minutes (it seemed longer!) without his face changing - his fainting was comic. John Hodiak played his role in OK, but the script promised him and the rest cast very badly. I gave him 4 stars mainly because of photography. This would have been in the first half of the program when dual functions were in progress.
