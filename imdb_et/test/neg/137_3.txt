this is one of the worst-made movies I've ever seen. Truffo must take something seriously; this is not just a B movie that has been pulled out by the cages. <br /> <br /> Truffaut probably couldn't decide if he made a knife or a sentimental chick. and did not get Deneuve, whose tens of (?) character flaps are simply incredible - not even bad; just didn't act at all. Among other things, how a woman, as beautiful as Deneuve, could be a person like Julie / Marion, is just someone who is capable of stopping unbelief; The role absolutely requires that no one be so beautiful. Belmondo also acts when his character is not as incredible as Deneuve. The end of the clich√© (which I do not describe) is unfortunately too suitable for this complete error.
