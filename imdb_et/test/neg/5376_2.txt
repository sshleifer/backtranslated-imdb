I think I should be fair and stress that I don't believe in ghosts. That means I'm very interested in the subject and I enjoy the scary story as much as the next man. I am a fan of Ghost Hunters, because they at least try to give their research a scientific angle. Even Haunted's early episodes had a camp entertainment factor for them. A paranormal state does not have any of these qualities. Cases have the potential to be interesting, but as with so many "reality TVs" these days, it suffers from overproduction, bad-acting and stupid scripts. The authors of the exhibition freely admit that the writers guide the stories. I hear that they even intend to worship young female demographic complaints on a novel sub-site. There are also many other mistakes in the exhibition. As others have said, storytelling is rapidly changing as a chalkboard. Above the top visual and sound effects quickly become the same irritating. I'm ready to stop some belief in the interests of entertainment, but this whole "demon with a brother" is just ridiculous. Given that the producers of this exhibition are also responsible for the dead feed of the brain, such as MTV Laguna Beach and Newport Harbor, I think it is not really surprising. If you are Ed & Lorraine Warren's deadly fan or a big "reality" show junkie, then I think you'll find a lot like Paranormal State. The rest of us .... suggest you avoid.
