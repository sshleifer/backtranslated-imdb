I loved blood and gore. Such violence is what Alien and Predator films are, no one has saved. It really answers the question of how it would be if foreigners were on Earth. The answer is simple. We're screwed. The effects were beautiful. How are the real problems with this? 1) The action was terrible on the part of human figures, from whom the witch almost slept, how dry and boring it was that really cut off the film's flow and was very annoying. Writers could have done much better for SOOOOOOO. A good part was an alien and a Predator who acted, which I thought it was very good. </p> <p> </p> It scratched my head. <br /> <br /> 3) Presidents whose mask was still in the ship. That irritated people and I don't understand why. It's not a plot hole like most people do. So I tell you, people soothe hell. Its not a big deal. If this helps you to feel better, remember that they have a face hugging in storage, so this could be a good reason. I thought it was a pretty stupid part of Predators. But then I started wondering if it was the younger Predator who was panicked. At least they didn't carry us, showing them through the forests in 30 minutes. so be happy about it. <br /> <br /> 6) Why did only one Predator go? I thought it was strange. But then I thought it was because he thought it was just one Predalien that he was not dealing with an outbreak. <br /> <br /> 7) Why didn't the ship's prophets destroy themselves? Well, when people pay attention, but he was killed before he fully activated it. <br /> <br /> 8) Unlimited blue melting. I thought it was pretty stupid. <br /> <br /> 9) Predator hides evidence of googling, but skinny policeman. It was also stupid. <br /> <br /> 10) Black out. Well coming people, the alien and Pred fought in the power plant. <br /> <br /> 11) Predalien was a half face and queen. It really pulled me out. I'm an alien and a predi fanat. I know foreigners don't do it! Just as they're not born as a human, as they showed in Alien4! Of all the comics, games, books and movies, 1,2 and 3 show CLEARLY's behavior. They need a king to lay eggs, the eggs hatch to the face-huggle, the toughest-to-infectious host, the parasite jumps out and kills the host and grows into a drone when it infects a four-legged animal with a human, Predalien with Predator and Runner. And then after years of living years later, they came to Preatoria (a mini-queen who does not lay eggs), I can go on and on, but I wont. But this scene has almost destroyed my movie for me. If the directors are smart, they would go back and change it, making the face of pregnant women hurt. <br /> <br /> Any way you see this movie, just go to the aliens and predators. . And when the scene comes up, where Predalin gets pregnant women ... Close your eyes so you don't see this insult in the Alien and Pred universe.
