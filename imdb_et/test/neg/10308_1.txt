Wow, there are no words to describe how bad this movie is really. I'm usually proud to be able to enjoy any movie no matter how bad, but it was just too much. I only recommend watching this movie as a means of torture. If you can go horribly and out of dialogue, watching it silently, even more frightening camera work and dirty special effects make this movie a real horror. If your idea of ​​seeing it as your Sandra Bullock fan, don't even bother doing it because it has less than ten minutes of screen time, and its action is totally cruel. Not to mention the rest of the pain that could be replaced by the baboons who would do a better job, at least we would not have listened to the terrible dialogue.
