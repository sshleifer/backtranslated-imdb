As a real Canadian, I always refrain from Canadian films. But now and then I'm trying to catch up. It's better than most that is mediocre. It has many common mistakes in Canadian films ... by acting self-consciousness ... over cinematic tricks and, above all, self-evident Canada's habit of using Canadian cities as American statuses. I am thinking of using the historic metropolis of Montreal for Harrisburg Pennsylvania. I was a generous mood. I gave it to 4. <br /> <br />
