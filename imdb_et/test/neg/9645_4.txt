Bill Boyd, Robert Armstrong and James Gleason threes are played by Coney Island's quarries who are fighting for Ginger Rogers, who works on salt water taffy. The outbreak of World War I was accompanied by threes and continued by Ginger. The first side of this RKO pathe production is difficult, with three male-dominated landscape chewing with one-liner and "gentle" dialogue that quickly grows tiring. The second half focuses on operating sequences, as the US Navy deals with both the German freighter and the U-boat. These sequences are viable and well filmed, but generally this is a long-lasting and unsatisfactory comedy-drama with a flat tip. Only for star fans.
