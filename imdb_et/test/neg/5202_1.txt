It's a terrible movie from almost any angle. Since much has been emphasized in previous reviews, let me concentrate on this "Serbs" and "Delta Force" guys. 1) The forms the "Serbs" carry are not Serbs. Helmets are also wrong, <br /> <br /> 2) Actors playing "Serbs" don't speak Serbian, not even Serbian, unlike "behind the enemy" where Czech actors did their best to speak the language and add to the movie at least a bit of reliability. <br /> <br /> 3) The gray bearded "Serbian general" looks and acts like a moor by shooting his weapon when US soldiers call him the name: <br /> <br /> - US soldier: "Gravic! Give up! " <br /> <br /> - Gray-bearded general: (fire his AK47) <br /> <br /> - US soldier: "Gravic! Come out!" <br /> <br /> - GBMG: (burns your AK47) <br /> <br /> - US soldier: "Gravic! You're surrounded" <br /> <br /> - GBMG: (fire his AK47 ) <br /> <br /> - Prop man: "Excuse me, Mr Gray-bearded general, look, we're empty and I sent the boy to buy more, but he's not back ..." <br /> < br /> - GBMG: (click) <br /> <br /> 4) When will the army deliver AK47 to Delta Force? I don't think they found enough M4s in Bulgaria, but there were a lot of old AK47s and practical workpieces. .. <br /> <br /> 5) In a scene where a DF officer hangs a rope while talking to a rocket scientist, he keeps his finger all the time. No sensible person with no weapon training or just mind would ever have done it. I think the actor thought his level of coolness would increase, the longer he kept the gun in that way. <br /> <br /> This movie is a common sense.
