I love camp movies, believe me, and Gordon Lewis' usual technical gateway doesn't bother me at all, but it's just one of his most stupid movies, even more than BLOOD FEAST, I'm not kidding. GORE GORE GIRLS is about a mad person who kills many girls in a nightclub. Detective and reporter are trying to find a great secret. Perhaps the performances here are somewhat better than those of ordinary medium actors H.G Lewis, but it doesn't speak much. Camera work is even terrible. <br /> <br /> But at least what can be done when the girls are running ... you start doing it well and the killings are very absurd very bad way: The girl is killed with a wooden hammer hitting her butt ( !) and just don't let me talk to you. You laugh like someone with it. But all this confusion is a better scene, which I only love in this camp: go-go girlfriend before being attacked by many feminists who dance in a very American way. Although it is important to note that this was one of the first films that got their X-class because of their violence. <br /> <br /> ONLY if you want to laugh and spend a good time (but only a lot, A lot of beer).
