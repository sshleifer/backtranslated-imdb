By reading most of the other comments, I agree with most of the comments. One thing I would like to add is how the film is staged and produced. I think some of these new wave filmmakers think they are smart, using unusual (sometimes withered) corners of the camera and sliding from one scene to another. These film festivals and some of these Indie-type critics fall well, but it is a film for me. I noticed comments, one comment that says that none of this filmmaker's films have become blockers. This may be my point of view because the film has the "rush to the end" feeling that makes you wonder why such a beautiful film does not seem to be smooth. As for the comment that Kiefer Sutherland has a big name on the poster, I would like to make sure he created the final cut. It is a story with real potential that has been broken differently in its production. It's worth a look, but many don't come back to the other.
