No, it's just a cheap 1940s series, using Capi's good name. If you are a fan of the comic book, you are very disappointed. They have radically changed their character. No shield, no bucky, no fight with the Nazis, no wings on the side of your mask and most importantly: Captain America is now a District Attorney and no longer a GI. <br /> <br /> Dick Purcell as Captain of America? Don't look too close when she changes her costume. It is quite obvious that he did not make the best physical shape by doing this series (can you say it's dirty?). It is also very obvious that the person here performs most of the activities. Almost every chapter has a mandatory fist fight that is done and done exactly the same way. The offender is quite bored and, although he uses the nickname (The Scarab), he does not wear disguise. The story is repetitive and very simple. The effect is ridiculous and the activity is average. On the plus side is sexy Lorna Gray as D.A's assistant and a good captain is driving in a cool looking motorcycle in one early chapter. Generally OK, but something special.
