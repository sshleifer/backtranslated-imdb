I think people who speak are a director or something else. It's bad, not Michael Jackson's song. Comparing the pace of this film with the progress of the snail would be an insult to the snail. This movie captures the eternity, all to introduce us to some scary zombie children who have silly makeup and some kind of brother or blood thirst or whatever. Believe me, you don't care. The mere idea that the mother would move her two daughters in disintegration and FILTHY's home is absurd. And worse, I just found myself caring. Zombie Children's Background? Snore. Threatening your mother and / or daughter? I do not care. <br /> <br /> In short, WOW was boring. Do not worry.
