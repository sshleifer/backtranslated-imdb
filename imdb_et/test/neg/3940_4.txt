Stay Alive is a horrible horror movie video game that kills people the same way they die inside the game. Friends who play this game will soon see it and then they will realize that they have to fight a video game in the county of blood or receive their destiny. We've had video clips in The Ring, a FearDotCom deadly website. It's now on video games. Leave some things alive well; character formation is a bit deeper than it would be in horror film. We really see the feelings and the past of some signs, and get to know them all quite well so that the audience can get some emotions. The film is also very tense. The movie is often used to play tense, irritating moments, accompanied by restless and horrible music. There are many jumps and beats for the viewer. It may be ideal once or twice, but the fears that Hollywood seems to play in horror movies today are Stay Alive. The camera tends to offer sharp corners or highlights to give viewers a quick glimpse of the demon or witch and try to frighten them with the sudden break of the screen. Why? Gore is probably very weak because of the movie certificate. The Stay Alive script is very fun and quite ridiculous, and the characters play it too melodramatically and confused. Clich√©s also come from every direction, for example, people who deceive each other in search of strange noise or when they have seen a figure in the dark, they go and explore it. However, the computer graphics used for video game segments are quite impressive and colorful and sharp, working well with other parts of the movie. But in general, it is not enough to keep that movie. Just over a hundred minutes stretching is not a battle to survive, but to stay awake.
