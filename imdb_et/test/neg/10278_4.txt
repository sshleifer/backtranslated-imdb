I watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and I have to say: I wasn't impressed, not at all. I have to put aside other posters when it comes to fine performances, but some good results don't make a good movie. <br /> <br /> In the discussion board, I found an anonymous poster that took some of the main points. He says, "Deed Poll" is a film that raises many questions, but hardly answers even some film that bothers and transcends every attempt to interrupt, an attempt and a very common sexual drama despite some shocking scene. Barbara Kowa and André Schneider are very partial impressive editing and good camera work (Steffen Ritter) make up the gross area holes and some technical slippers (especially sound). Unfortunately, this is true. I wasn't interested in the story at all. The main characters are cold, more ambitious and less people. They do a lot of drugs and they have a lot of (bleeding) sex. So what? On several occasions, the direction seemed almost non-existent, not to mention the technical aspect: the poor sound quality was very disturbing. <br /> <br /> What is the idea of ​​a movie? What is the message behind it? Anonymous reviewer said: "In no way did Biermann make a clear point, and so the film stays in the air without the message. So the film is boring. The film is reserved and emotional, cold, almost neutral, and it won't take long to see the mistakes: in the case of long stretches, the characters of Sean and Ivy are not believing (they clearly have difficulty pronouncing English), the nature of the silent brother is not developed very well though - in the scene where the spokesman is skinned (one and only true love scene), the intensity reaches the whole film I would like to see a long time. I liked the last scene, especially thanks to Gianni Meurer's and André Schneider's beautifully captured faces, but this was nothing compared to the boredom of the first 30 minutes. (Sex scenes were, however, aesthetically staged and perfectly edited.) practically without money. Perhaps, if they had a bigger budget and a more experienced director, it would have become a better film.
