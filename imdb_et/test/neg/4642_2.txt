Okay, given, I'm a fan of the low budget, which, along with it, is accompanied by random garbage that even the most hairy tentacle fan can't reveal ... TRANCERS 6, directed by DEMONICUS Jay Woelfel. <br /> <br /> The TRANCERS series started in the mid-1980s by Charlie Band and his Empire Pictures is basically a franchise that is Tim Thomerson and his excellent portrayal of Trancer Hunter Jack Deth. Well, low and look, thanks to the drowning of Full Moon features (which, despite what people have said, really high quality features like HELL ASYLUM and DEAD & ROTTING) have been highlighted, Thomerson did not bring the sixth installment. <br /> <br /> Full Moon writer Courtney Joyner returns and gives another one of the less than average scenarios that includes Jack Deth (played by Thomerson ... in rebounds that have been badly inserted ... he has a different hair style, like every time he is shown, and some "shampoos" that put down the table, drink a line in his daughter's body. Well, out of here, you have "Jo Deth" like Jack ... but it's a shame that he really does not give the same screen presence as Jack Deth. <br /> <br /> The 16 mm film hit is just embarrassing to TRANCERS ... not to offend young Wolf Productions anyone, I mean, I respect you who really want to continue go and make a TRANCERS movie without Timita, but a little more time (despite being filmed since December 2001) could have been better. <br /> <br However, watch this Full Moon DVD, which is the original Double with TRANCERS and having the last 10 plus lips Scooter trailers. <br /> <br /> In general, I would probably have liked the feature more if it didn't have the TRANCERS name, but like anything else, you can rate it based on someone's opinion and you have to check it yourself!
