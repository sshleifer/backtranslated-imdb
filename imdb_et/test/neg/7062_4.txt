Some speak early to become a classic. The 1929 "Squall" is a classic, but not as it was intended. Melodramatic story and action, today it seems ridiculous, especially Myrna Loy as Nubi, a seductive gypsy. Imagine that Nora Charles broke a young couple and drove a young man to steal. Embarrassing! However, as many people know when Loy first came to Hollywood, he did quite a few of these exotic seductros. is currently in Hungary (Spanish game) who runs out of his brutal captain and invited himself to Lajos's family home (Richard Tucker and Alice Joyce), basically appearing on the door. One by one seduces the men and the farm of the Nub family who speaks his English ("Nubi is not bad! Nubi does not do anything wrong!") And points to nice gifts. In the family family, Paul (Carroll Nye) is associated with beautiful Irma (Loretta Young) and can't wait to get married. He loses interest in meeting Nub. <br /> <br /> Except for the lovely Alice Joyce, Zasu Pitts, a woman living in a household and amazingly beautiful Loretta Young, the actor is equally horrible. Loy has features of his character - bad English, whining and hysteria. Her darkened makeup, peasant geting and curly hair, she is not only beautiful, but right from the 1980s - quite modern, although Richard Tucker turns to his back to remind us that we have just come out of silence. br /> <br /> Robert Osborne TCM commented that this movie is one of his secret pleasures. Although it is delicious, it is not delicious to sit back again. It's just bad - but it's a great example of how far we've come, and if no one got Myrna Loy's sense of humor, how limited his career might have been.
