this western / musical / comedy is not one of the best genres I've seen. I found it too slow. just turned the inevitable end. Superman.Randolph Scott is the keynote speaker and Lloyd Bridges is the star. but for my money Edgar Buchanan is the best bunch.Buchanan appeared in many western countries on his day, offering repeatedly comic relief, as he did in this picture, I liked Ann Dvorak as Rita.otherwise, but I can't recommend this movie. The film is based on Ernest Haycock's novel, who also wrote the novel Stagecoach, which was the same name for the crazy film in 1939 and recovered in 1966 and again in 1986. The 1939 Stagecoach version is, in my opinion, one of the best films ever made.
