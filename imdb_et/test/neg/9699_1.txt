I've spent quite a while to go through all the reviews of this movie. I totally agree with almost every reviewer, saying that Noah's Ark is a mess, a mess, a mess, a mess, a mess! Are NBC leaders not a class? I feel sorry to see both parts of this mini-series. The script is so stupid, so pointless and yes, SUPPLEMENTARY HEIGHT! I understand that we are making some changes for dramatic purposes, but this movie changed almost everything. God himself struggles to kill the entire population of the Earth, but he somehow remains a man sailing trying to sell Noah. Leave me alone! And what was the birth of Noah's sons like Indiana Jones, saving the girls in trouble? If everything that isn't bad is the part where God apologizes to Noah and says, "I'm sorry for Noah, I was wrong." NBC Newsletter, GOD IS NOT DEAL! This film is the most tasteless and shameful Bible film ever made.
