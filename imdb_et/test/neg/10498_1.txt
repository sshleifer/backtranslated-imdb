I couldn't take that terrible movie for ten minutes. The age and age of DV cameras seem to be captured from VHS without any color correction or microphone support. <br /> <br /> Like the filmmaker myself, I know the limitations of making a movie, and even with these things in mind, I'm amazed that movies can do it badly. <br /> <br /> The only praise I offer is that this film was distributed because I have seen much better films that are still looking for modest domestic or international release. I think the box is what it sold ... it has a good box of art, but it all goes down there. <br /> <br /> Side Note: The director seems to have 11 friends because no one on this planet would give "10" to this movie.
