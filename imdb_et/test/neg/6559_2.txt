I saw this movie recently and I said to myself, "This movie is bad!" William Shatner is a great actor but he's not a director! <br /> <br /> It's not just that it's bad, it's terrible. Instead of a plot, we have a very bad story called a plot! What was really bad was the beginning where Kirk and McCoy taught Spock to sing "Row, Row, Row Your Boat!" <br /> <br /> Do I have anything against William Shatner? I'm not doing it. But when it comes to the director, she sucks! This movie is not one of the worst films I've ever seen. But this is the worst of the Star Trek series! <br /> <br /> I noticed that after that, Shatner didn't turn to another movie. They probably didn't want him to re-direct the second movie after that! <br /> <br /> Generally, this movie sucks! <br /> <br /> 2/10
