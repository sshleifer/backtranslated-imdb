There is no point in detailing a complex, too melodramatic plot that includes the bitterness of civil war, the boss of a curved city, and other complications. It's all bad. <br /> <br /> Stella Stevens, Andrew Prine, Bo Svenson, William Smith, Tim Thomerson, and Lee Majors are all good actors who may not be big stars (or big stars), but always made fun movies > <br /> Here they are all wasted on a picture that looks like a western tourist trap created with costumes borrowed from a local high school theater department. In fact, it seems that most of the actors are also at high school level, which may not be as bad as it would be so pretentious. <br /> <br /> Ed Wood's name is too easy to use. I think that the comparison is justified in this case. However, I suspect that old Ed would have changed this more fun western.
