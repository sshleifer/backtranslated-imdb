Maybe I missed something, but I found that GOYA GHOSTS is an annoying costume for melodrama. As for the story he was trying to say, I found the confusing mish-mash that went in all directions. Perhaps it should have been done by a Spanish director who has languages ​​that match the subtitles, not in an incredibly emphasized English language. I can't appreciate the story of historical truthfulness, but it seemed to be moving along the line of a similar "artist's tragic fate" plot as a girl who is PEARL EARRING. Was the film a commentary about the religious injustices of the Inquisition, wrong sprawl, torture and now or what ???? I never seemed to have been able to exclude it. Natalie Portman's different characters also seemed ridiculously stereotyped. Ultimately, the film was crowned with the endless melodrama of Bardem's head and body, hanging on the edge of the vehicle at sunset? Ines and Goya followed ????? if it is?
