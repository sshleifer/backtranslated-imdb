Absolutely naughty film, played by Abbott and Costello. Even our little kids would become more and more annoying with the complete clutter of the film. <br /> <br /> Abbott as Dinklepuss. What kind of picture he was on. Of course, he had to be part of this terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Did anyone notice that Costello's mother sounded and looked like Fay Bainter in the movie? Fortunately, to Mrs Bainter, she was not on the film. <br /> <br /> Children are not really excited. Jokes, if any, are pretty old. Some of the song is well done, but the words are ridiculous.
