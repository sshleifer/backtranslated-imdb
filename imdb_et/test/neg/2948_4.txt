The film begins with Reeve (Ekin) and his assistant, who fights with the same vampires. This scene is probably the best of the whole movie. The rest of the movie is unfortunately cheesy, very unreal and Buffy Vampire Slayer ripoff. Finally, great time sucks. <br /> <br /> A few moments like a scene where gypsy and Helen (popular Chinese duo's Twins: Charlene & Gillian) are fighting over stuffed teddy bears are particularly sharp. The story is also flat, certainly they would have been more frightening than the "Day of the Night" book. <br /> <br /> Some good parts, however. Jackie Chan and Anthony Wong make the film acceptable with its comic roles. But the good bits will end there. Charlene & Gillian (Twinsist) has never been able to act well and irritate you and "friendly but clever vampire" was unfortunately given by Edison to Chen, a talented beautiful boy. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10 -
