Despite the fact that the film is completely frightening (more about it later), this movie is still tricky to watch because it celebrates two good actors: Barbara Stanwycki and Henry Fonda. In addition to one or two REAL Stinkers, I probably look at the film because I'm a big fan of Hollywood's 1930s and 40s. But no matter how much I love my movies, I can't recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a Fonda and Stanwyck holiday at a ski resort. These two have not yet met, but the film starts loud and reluctantly with the scene where the Fonda is terribly skiing. It was done so undoubtedly and made my teeth grind, but I stuck - especially when Fonda fell into a snowball and it stopped yodeling! Afterwards, maybe I should have just turned it off! Fonda will fall out in the fall and Barbara will get help. Back to the ski house, she seems to be fine, but fortunately she is a doctor and she has her back to the X-rays and her health. He, in turn, becomes attached to him and proposes to him. Despite the little knowledge of each other, they marry and so far the film seems sweet but very small romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> If you are not at home, it is not all rosy when he jumps back to his work as a family doctor and he starts showing signs that he is a controlling and potentially dangerous person because of his jealousy. The film plays everything laughing, but frankly, Fonda's behaviors were really horrible - smiling at him and his male patients, attacking or threatening EVERYONE he treats, interrupting a patient who already has backache and beating to surprise and demanding everything there (men and women) is stealing your wife. She is a combination of sociopathy and paranoid schizophrenia, but it should all laugh. Given that he seems to be a dangerous nut, you think Stanwyck will bring an action for annulment with a restrictive order! But weird, he's going to be crazy, but he just can't get crazy because he's so ........ I don't think about the right word - "horrible" is all that comes to mind! Later, with a multi-millionaire blue, Fonda will have a counter in the shop. Then, through magical thinking, he and Babs seem to think that his hostility and violent jealousy are all past - so work seems to heal anger and suspicion. When this work goes through, Fonda will end up buying his hospital, giving Barbara a job there and living happily. They don't go on the story, but I assume that by Fonda's character, he spent most of his time as a hospital administrator who beat all male patients. <br /> <br /> The first part of the skis and the next did not fit well and did not make the final "Horatio Alger" inspired part where the rich boy did the business world. They were like three separate plots, but nevertheless the most serious problem with the film was his vision to apologize for domestic violence and misleading jealousy! What a creepy little movie! Thanks to goodness, Fonda and Stanwyck are not known for this yechy movie, but for all other beautiful films.
