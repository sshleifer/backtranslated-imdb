I saw it on Sci Fi and retrospectively I'm not sure how I actually looked at it. It's a complete trash. It's not a B-film, it's a "D-movie" at best. <br /> <br /> In principle, this horse (and sometimes no one) is going to kill everything along this road in the West in the middle of America. The human load is missing (infact murdered) and a number of inappropriate spec op soldier types are looking for them. The best part of this movie, I say it now, is really cute girls. Let me now spoil it by telling you that everything, but the least cute, will get your head cut, split, or hit as hard as your head explodes. It's not a spoiler ... The gore of this movie is up and really grotesque. That's not the real goal either. <br /> <br /> Here's a good thing: the sets look OK, the actors sometimes act OK, outfits and props, some of them are decent. <br /> <br /> Everything else you mean, sucks. A lot of bad things are being edited. Occasionally, it quickly switches from a fast-acting scene to a real quiet and stationary scene. Sometimes the characters do things that are incomprehensible and they are always divided, but not even so, that the viewer can follow it. They seem to fall apart without being understood by themselves, but everyone also seems to know that they are all part time and well connected, even if they are in a really dangerous situation and there are bodies all over the place and people die right and left. Nothing in this film is the least believable, most of it is inconsistent and confusing, and I don't really get the chance to finish this immortal, indestructible bad guy killer, and frankly, I don't care. During this movie, too much stupid, funny bad stuff is happening, and I don't care about it all here. And they are all so serious throughout the trial, when it's almost ridiculous ... just terrible. <br /> <br /> This movie is a complete waste of time. There's no excuse to see it, unless the only channel you get is SciFi and you're in front of the TV. But if you're not bound, you're a better crossword, throwing Frisbee or even just thinking. There are many much better B movies you can watch. <br /> <br /> My older year in high school, my friend and myself, made a long-term film type deal for our film in visual communication and deign class. There was no full movie, but a really long trailer) and we did a better job of filming and editing the film with premiere. It was better than this movie. It really says something about it and I'm confused and worried about why Sci Fi would look like there are so many good low film levels they can show. <br /> <br /> The only movie I've ever suffered is that it was worse than Raptor Island (another brilliant SciF work) - although it was a smoother and more traceable stream than this movie - but that's very close and is definitely the second on my worst movie list I've ever seen.
