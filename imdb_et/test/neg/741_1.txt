Poor Jane Austen. This production dog does NOT make its wonderful language into cheek-like justice. From the beginning ... poorly customized. The Scene deserves extra lower marks to try - to think, I don't know what he was trying to do, but it is enough to say he missed the light years! Few that with all the overactive and terrible product values, this is one adaptation that should never have happened. It would have been much better for them to simply give all of this flop cast money and donate it to a worthy charity. Do yourself a favor, read the book. It is almost certain that you will enjoy it a thousand times more than trying to sit through this embarrassing production!
