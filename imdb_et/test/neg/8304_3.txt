Wow. Just wow. Never before have I seen a horror film that seemed like a bad self-enriching fan that someone wrote in one day in 20 minutes. And then I happened to Lady Frankenstein. This movie takes everything that you know about Frankenstein and makes it completely upside down ... and not in a good way. Once you've seen this movie, it stumbled on an Italian TV, or if you have a copy of the 50 Chilling Classics Box as I have, like number 24. And just lets say that these movies are here. Because they are not very good. it is enough for the film. <br /> <br /> It starts with dr. Frankenstein, who tries to make a monster with his assistant, who is obviously an igor for some reason. His college graduate daughter (?) Shows up and says how he just graduated from a medical degree, yes. there were so many female doctors. So he says he wants his father to do his job and he says no. And then he makes a monster and kills him. So he worships for exactly 7 seconds and then tells the assistant how he was a burglar. The monster escapes and goes to rampage. <br /> <br /> OK, I really can't believe they killed Dr. Frankenstein at the beginning of the movie. he dies like ... 20 minutes in and then his daughter takes over. which .... doesn't make much sense, but definitely. <br /> <br /> So Lady francenstein decides to kill the monster who is now runner-up. oh yes how i love his logic. so his new monster gets the body by killing someone and putting that auxiliary brain in it ... I know. just nod and go with it. So the monsters meet and wake up. I love how the assistant asks, "Why don't we just let the mobs kill it?" and he answers "They don't know how to kill it!" and finally he kills the ax with his head. haha. Oh yes, no ELSE could have guessed that one. So finally the brain was replaced by a new monster killing a lady frankenstein. End. <br /> <br /> This movie was just ... weird. it was serious, as someone wrote the fanfare you entered. There is no other way to describe this movie. also some strange naked scenes. like this girl was with the boy with the park naked sex, the monster pick up the girl and the guy is flying away. haha. nice guy. Then he fights a bit and dies from ..... to be absolutely honest, I really don't know what he died. But there is no difference. This is Lady Frankenstein. It doesn't have to be sensible. <br /> <br /> This movie had a lot of "Why?" the moment I just gave up. Movies shouldn't do that, but for some reason I see more than I should. So the last word, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen with this package, but it's boring and full of holes and random things. <br /> <br /> So Lady Frankenstein gets three Franken Scenes out of 10
