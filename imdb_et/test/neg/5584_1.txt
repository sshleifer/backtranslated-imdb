Positive comments on this page are made by filmmakers and their friends. This film is an amateur direction, acting, in fact, in every aspect. If IMDb allows filmmakers to dictate what their films are written about, this is a very sad thing. This film is a marketable premise, but it is absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> Film is subjective, so everyone has their own opinion. But this film is equal to Ed Wood's work, but without any charm. Think otherwise shows a bad taste in the highest order. <br /> <br /> It's not a personal thing. I don't know anyone who's involved with the movie. I'm just a movie lover who thinks the reviews on this page are completely inaccurate and that is why I felt the need to balance and give a more accurate picture of the film. It is very badly done and the direction is even below the number even for film making. Action is worse than ever before. The best thing about this movie is poster and DVD cover art. And it's not worth the time.
