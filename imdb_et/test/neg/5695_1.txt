I did half that, but there wasn't enough masochism to see it all. In the first half of the movie, there was no dialogue! Almost everyone had a voice comment to carry the story. The sculptor forgot that sometimes there were fewer and more attempts to explain the detailed history of several millennia. At the same time he forgot to do any character. Most of the science fiction fans do not require great character development, but it would be nice to know why the two main characters who lived through the destruction of the space park came against each other. <br /> <br /> The movie has good things. The soundtrack was well done. Some of the graphics created by the computer are very good, but others were just mediocre.
