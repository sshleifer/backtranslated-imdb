I'm afraid I was going to watch the first hour of this movie because it seemed to me that it was a frantic TV trash and a waste of talent. Liv Tyler has a gorgeous beauty, but his skills have not yet developed enough to make a real impact. As he slowly relaxes the barman in the criminal life, it is difficult to get some real concern. Even John Goodman brings out his weak comics because there is no need to read spiritual humor slowly if no one jokes. The end should be good, but the starter and the main dish left me with no appetite.
