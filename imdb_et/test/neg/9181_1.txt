The most racist and ghetto cartoon for children 7+. Children who look at this comic are likely to try to dress, talk and act as they are. I am disappointed by Nickelodeon and Nick Jr to agree to the incitement of this terrible program. Wayan's brothers can be good in movies for young adult viewers. They should stick to the movies and not make any more episodes of this comic. Usually, young celebrities start working on films and tuning the cups and when they get older, they move to young adult programs. A good example is Nick Cannon. He first started appearing with All-That, later playing in MIB II, then Drumline, and now his TV show Nick Cannon presents: Wild 'N Out, where comedians compete to talk about inappropriate jokes. This comment was originally for Thugaboo, but I wanted to show examples of how famous kids on television have long been unable to do non-child friendly programs. It is very sad that this happens, but all celebrities are changing and growing. It's just the opposite of Wayani Brothers' new comic. It is bad enough that we have to deal with ghettos of all the bad people, allowing the young generations to watch this program, it just makes children with opportunities for those who do not have a good life. Just my feelings about this comic and my beliefs about what happens to our children when they watch it.
