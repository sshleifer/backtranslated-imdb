I used to work in a company where this movie was originally released by Vestron Pictures. Vestron had the same problem that many small independent film companies had a lot of money to put their films into product value. Not that money alone buys a good movie for you. See, for example, Kevin Costner's Waterworld. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, if you have in-house talented people who make acquisitions or develops, you can create your new talent. But there was no such person in Vestron and they were always skimped in some important areas. In this case, it was the director and the writer. What makes it pretty hard to be a decent movie, even if this band is cast, is this movie. <br /> <br /> I think the main premise of this movie was: "Let's put space and see if something interesting happens." It's an intriguing idea, but it's not worth looking at your time. <br /> <br /> Most of Vestron's movies got a very special look and feel. My husband and I developed the ability to mark this quality even in non-Vestron films. Many times we could even look at this quality only when looking at a trailer or television ad. We would sit there looking at the trailer or the ad and after that we would turn to every side and in almost sync we would say, "Now this is Vestron movie!" This is Vestron's film.
