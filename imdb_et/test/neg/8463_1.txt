Five fingers are so bad that I hardly know where to start. Let me first admit that I've only seen the first half hour. When the first finger was cut off, I thought sleeping was more useful. I told my girlfriend the meaning of "five fingers" and she immediately followed my example. <br /> <br /> Didn't the producer, the director, and / or the screenwriter get any advice from a male-amateur? Like me? They should have used a digital chess clock, not an analog. This grandmother makes Martijn mentally laugh. How, when and why did Martijn make a Moroccan girlfriend? Such a thing is very rare in the Netherlands. <br /> <br /> Calling me as a retard is, of course, an insult to all those who suffer from the average lower IQ. What's more, as far as I know, retard does not play chess. I'll do it. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is of course the script. Just compare the small intelligent movie Hard Candy. This information must be one by one to keep the spectator busy. Nice twist now and then also helps. I realized from the other reviews that there was a big deal at the end of the film. Any wise person can guess what it is. Of course, this raises more questions - why is the travel guide killed? Oh, why should I even care? The whole film focuses on just one thing: chopped fingers. The creators have not even learned the Hitchcock lesson: it's exciting when the bomb exploded. It is more exciting to show that the bomb is hanging. But no, we don't see the paper cutter until the impossible counter is over. I don't waste more words on this mess. Go see Hard Candy.
