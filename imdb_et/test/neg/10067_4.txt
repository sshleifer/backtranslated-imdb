From the fruitful imagination that brought you irresistible HERCULES (1983), its more consistent (more readable) sequel: to the right off the bat, we get another clumsy "beginning of time" prologue that even exacerbates that the same events are completely at odds with being created on the first film! ; similar highlighted condensates will soon follow the SUPERMAN-like winding sequence. Narrative, here we have four rebellious gods who steal Zeus's seven (but badly animated) thunderstorms? a crime that, on the one hand, puts the month in a crash course with Planet Earth! Faster than saying "nepotism", does Zeus (a relatively young Claudio Cassinelli again with a white-haired bearded man) send his master? Who has now rightly taken its place among the elites due to one assumption that the first film has all sorts of tasks? Find your blooming thunderstorms and prevent accidents in the shop. <br /> <br /> When Hercules (Lou Ferrigno is as you did not know), he touched the ground that he was in contact with two attractive mattresses (Milly Carlucci and Sonia Viviani) who needed them out of trouble! the former (who would go to the Italian television personality) seems to be able to talk to small people (!)? that look like little sisters of GODZILLA VS. MOTHRA (1964)! Just so they can make as much useless material from the first film as humanly possible, the divine quartet of the resurrected villain, slumbering his skeleton, and once again against his eternal enemy. Typically, Hercules has a number of potentially deadly enemies, including Gorgon? the terribly underdeveloped sequence that should have brought a suit of a plagiarism was the filmmakers behind the much higher TITAN CLASS (1981) that I watched this flick (with the same "reflection shield"). Before the Muslim let the audience tactics before they show us how he's smart! And just to make it clear that he is wearing his sleeves, Cozzi's Hercules and Minos have become the cosmic version of "King Kong vs Godzilla" for one of their battles, and later, King Kong will catch a big snake, classic 1933 Directly drawn from the original. I swear it is: this is the whole truth and not just the truth! <br /> <br /> As with the first movie, have you been filled with old, reliable, as mentioned above by Berger, Cassinelli and Venantino Venantini (a witch who has a really bad hair day) and up and coming stars? not only Carlucci but also Maria Rosaria Omaggio (younger Hera!), Serena Grandi, Pamela Prati and again Eva Robbins (whose costume here easily crosses her look on the first film); for this, Pino Donaggio pays for this result to be recycled from the musical notes featured on the soundtrack of the previous film. If you have stayed with this review so far, you must now realize that it is one of those movies that is so incredibly bad that the reviewer is forced to choose which course to take: either leave it with one unlikely sentence or spend unlikely a lot of time to Get rid of your mistakes. I'm sure I've missed some of my failures, but I wouldn't forgive myself if I didn't mention any of the biggest ridiculous loud sounds in the movie that almost dropped me under my chair (yes, it even surpassed the animated titanium duel I mentioned above for the rebellious gods nest, which is the shape of a giant marble kettle !! <br /> <br /> At this stage, you may not know why I gave this movie (and its predecessor) rating (not totally unreasonable) instead of BOMB; In the past, have I had a variety of protracted online discussions about whether the rating of a star in a movie should reflect overall artistic quality or its enormous entertainment? but these are two cases where I considered it necessary for the latter to have knowingly influenced its final assessment. I don't know: maybe this is because I'm currently in a sword-and-sandal sense (about 10 more respectable examples are planned in the coming days!) just for the amusement they had in recent reviews? and that alone has to consider something, no?
