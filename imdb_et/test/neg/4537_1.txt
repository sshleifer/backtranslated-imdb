Comedy is a hard beast to conquer. Ishimoto fails on all accounts, writers and directors. Some things, like making funny movies, must be left to the professionals. 1 out of 10. Awful. It wasn't funny. I tried to laugh, but it wasn't funny. I was not the only one, no one else at the Chicago festival laughed, at least at the show. Just very bad, sorry :(
