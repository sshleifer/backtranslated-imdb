I've seen almost all Kurosawa movies and dozens of other Japanese films. Compared to these other films, it is the average of a poor movie. There are two warrior brothers on the plot - neither of which I was interested in - and it is very confusing to know who is involved. Music and cinema are pretty good, but sometimes special effects are terrible - rubber heads fly with the same reality as the average high school game! In addition to these complaints, DESTROYS will end the movie completely and UNDERSTAND the whole picture. It turns out that the end is not true, but was completely "fudged". What is that? Once you've seen this movie, understand that there are many better movies so don't give up!
