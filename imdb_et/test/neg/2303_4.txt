The Lumumba HBO version, understandable, is a catastrophic example of what appears to be a decent film. Some scenes are not meaningful in English, and actors bring zero energy to read the voice. Add your censorship to CIA's operational Carl Carlucci, and you have a movie that has been removed from both its drama and its power. We hope that the subtitled version will reach American TV at some point.
