I haven't been following this example for months, but for a while I was forced to watch it every day because I had wanted a roommate. So maybe it is very big throughout this time, though ads and the IMDb 4.2 rating aren't a good sign. <br /> <br /> It was clearly a quick Chappelle show. Even Mencia says so. And even though I wasn't even a big fan of Chappelle's show, his jokes were at least original and smart (and farther than Mencia has ever been). Mencia jokes are completely unrelenting and hidden. If you don't see it, then I don't think you have any hope. But in order to be fair, here are some examples: <br /> <br /> - Mencia probably takes Chapelle Lil Jon skit. Just take it. <br /> <br /> - South Park makes an episode of science. A week later, Mencia is kidding at her show how she is offensive to researchers. Remember, there is no fun about the scientists, but about how much he has offended at his exhibitions. Until then he has never done any scientific jokes. <br /> <br /> - After Hurricane Katrina, two AP pictures go online with a black guy who "robs" the grocery and the white woman "finding". WEEKS After millions of people have already seen it, Mencia will present it at its exhibition as if it had discovered it and it will be shown for the first time (the Daily Show would have been like one day). Pathetic. <br /> <br /> Even more annoying than stealing jokes is how Carlos has promoted himself and his exhibition, claiming that he will break any kind of PC barrier (whatever) and if you don't laugh, you have to be a weak bride who can't compete for race. Yes, Carlos, it's not because you're not funny, because we're too ridiculous (if that's true, why was Chappelle's exhibition so popular?). He constantly harasses his audience for not getting rid of it when he can't laugh, and often repeats and kills his own jokes, techniques that most comedies don't use at age 14. <br /> <br /> The worst part is Mencia doesn't seem very intelligent. It's kind of tragic that there are dozens of funny, more attentive comedies trying to do it when the guy runs out of money. His show is said to be the third highest price in Comedy Centralis, which is terrible (again, this site has 4.2 ratings). Where the hell are they getting these numbers? Comedy Central is trying to settle for itself as an "edgy" station, but as long as it tries to turn to a stupid audience, it will never happen.
