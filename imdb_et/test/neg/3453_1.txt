Creating a movie less than 1 million can be a line for a producer or accountant, but it doesn't do anything to the audience. The balance could have been pretty, but the viewing experience was bad. <br /> <br /> What is a triumph for Irish cinema is when people realize that production values ​​and scripting can't be sacrificed. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why people spend the energy they need to bring a movie together when the quality of production is worse than low-quality TV shows. <br /> <br /> The plot's drawbacks are mentioned in another site review and I totally agree with what was written. I would like to add that the film sank on the surface of several genres without ever being in any place. The film would have benefited from either direct comedy or social / political commentary. <br /> <br /> My overall impression was that the movie was rushed, thematically developed and visually not standard. In case of a positive note, the performances and music were very good.
