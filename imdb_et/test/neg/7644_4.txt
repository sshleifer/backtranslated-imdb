SILVER CITY (2 + 5 Stars) John Sayles' big fan is now for many years feeling safe, saying it is the worst film he has ever made. That means the movie isn't exactly * terrible * ... just very endless. Sayles throws familiar elements from his earlier films (corrupt politics, illegal immigration, the sale of young ideals), but is unable to put them together in any new or meaningful way. Even the dialogue (usually the strong point of Sayles) is disappointing this time. The film looks and sounds like episodes of a TV series that didn't change its third episode. There are many big letters in hand ... and they are trying their best to make their bit parts alive ... but this material is not right now. When campaigning on the spot, the governor-budding (bad and obvious George W Bush's stand-in) swims away from the lake for a dead body. The researcher is hired to try and warn people who have deliberately set it up to discredit a candidate ... but he will soon discover that deeper and darker (and more clich√©) secrets are being discovered. Sayles has done many similar topics in the past ("Lone Star", "Matewan", "Return of Secaucus Seven", "Men with Arms"). It's a disgrace that he went too well at once and came out with hidden water. One good line from Richard Dreyfuss: "Danny, you are a loser. It has certainly been established. So just try and be good, right?"
