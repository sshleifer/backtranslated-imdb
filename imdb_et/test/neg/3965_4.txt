The man is pulled out of London and taken to a foreign country where he is being tortured as a suspect in terrorism. Bored, banal film worshiped me from hell. Another idea, then, movie. I was half way through this 77-minute movie when I realized I had no idea who anyone was on the screen. Just as they took all other similar films and brought out all the ideas and put them in one place with the concept of the real essence. Certainly it was also passionate, but there is no emotional environment, there are only one thing the filmmakers know. This is not. And while the story presented theoretically important as a warning film is too boring to convince anyone about it, especially if someone has seen other, better movies of similar ilkis (like Reese Witherspoon)
