I only rented this smell because of my relatively high rating. It sucks completely! I can't imagine how someone would think it's a good movie - even an OK movie. No character had any redeeming qualities. At different levels, they were selfish and moderate clerics - or abused and damaged personalities who had no idea of ​​the spirit of Christmas (if it did!) I know the people of Canada and like them - but I don't even think they think it's good film. I'm rather sharp when I watch this offensive movie again. A waste of time and money. Do not believe that the person who wrote the opinion was "worth watching". This person would probably enjoy dentist drilling without anesthesia. Don't mean you would be unpleasant, but for my life I can't imagine what that person was thinking. If they have no rear motifs. Maybe he was a director or a producer. If so, I would like to ask them to give me the money back. If your money is important to you - save it instead of renting this drama - or rent something (nothing!). I have good reasons for not renting this movie. When I was in Canada, I was ASHAMED that it should be Canada's favorite. If so, I would say that those who think it will certainly need large quantities of powerful medicines. YECK!
