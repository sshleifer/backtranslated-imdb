I lived in this first hour and came back in the last ten minutes to say I saw the end. If you want a * true * mythology that has been executed flawlessly, look for Armand Assante's "The Odyssey". Great storytelling does not have to be twisted - the stories are fantastic in themselves. I just hope Sean Astin needs money. And Sophocles and Ovid must whirl in their graves - wherever they are. <br /> <br /> At least with the Sorbo version, the tongue was swirled endlessly in the cheek - we knew it was mostly balderdash, but perhaps there was enough interest. created on the back to send someone to the library.I'm surprised if Halmi could bring something so amusing (TV series) and follow it with something of such quality.
