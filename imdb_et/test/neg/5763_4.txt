"Forty Ninets Curse" doesn't deserve a long and detailed overview, so I'll make some random observations about it: <br /> <br /> - Cool opening loans. <br /> <br /> - There is no plot. <br /> <br /> - Is there anyone who has ever seen a horror film and can't guess who is going to survive in the first 20 minutes and who doesn't belong to this group of stereotypes? <br /> <br /> - Hey, this newcomer (Alexandra Ford) is pretty hot! <br /> <br /> - Richard Lynch (made about 100 years old) and John Phillip Law are fun, tongue-in-cheek cameos. <br /> <br /> - Karen Black has a bigger role, but she's not fun - she's quite embarrassed. <br /> <br /> - Martin Kove is on the screen for about 40 seconds, but I still got my name on video. Did they pay him for this look or were they the opposite? <br /> <br /> - I hate cheap computer-generated effects in horror movies. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of 4.
