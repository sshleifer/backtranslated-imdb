College students (who are actually at the end of their 20s) in Boston (which seems strange like the Isle of Man) are threatened with an acute monster (assembled during the Blue Peter episode). The new teacher has to save the day (though he is really ... Oh, who cares?) <br /> <br /> Start with the positive ... a nice shot from Eastenders, a new gal of Samantha Janus in a mandatory campus shower with her best companion Katy Lawrence. A bit of contiguous trivia: Katy was hired when she arrived in nurses, as a moral support for her brother, but ended up part of the landing. Oh, joy. Chosen from the glare ... flash your buttocks buttocks meaningless scene added to the titillation, then get killed for 30 minutes on his troubles. His last (and only the second credited role) is in trial no. 5 at conciliation. I don't know if he was chewing on Keira Knightly (if attachments and letters are allowed to mix) and wondering: where did all this go wrong? <br /> <br /> I give some tips to Katy: if all the other British cast members are asked to talk to the American accent in the massive destruction of mass marketing and the only person who can manage it is B-veteran US mother Todd Jensen, you know you are trouble. If you look at your pay slip and only cover your lunch and bus ride home, starring in a movie with a trillion dollar budget is not at stake. If the premiere of the fourth assistant director is involved and the laughter is provoked when the Stickyback tape moves through the sewer, it should make you not exactly Alien. Or even Critters IV, think about it. So Katy, in your next life (I am a Buddhist, you see) you may be more selective rather than an impulsive jump in the first run of yam that drives your way. The flashing skin of your first film does not guarantee long-term success. If you are not Sylvester Stallone. And he was a script for Rocky to pull him back. <br /> <br /> For all purposes and purposes, this is a 0/10 movie, as I've ever seen. But for unintentional laughter and the value of a clean camp, it gets well done;)
