This film was totally and unequivocally terrible. The plot was so predictable and boring and the script was so harsh and pretentious that I finally wanted to pull my eyes to the nearest pencil. <br /> <br /> Usually I don't write comments, but I was amazed by the number of positive reviews. While I admit that action was okay in some respects, the script's shortcomings are more than decent factors. The only reason I watched it was because some of my friends looked at it, most likely presenting it as the worst movie that the trailer did. We were not the least disappointed. The only sustainable arm of it is that it contained my new favorite selection: <br /> <br /> BRANDON: I just want to get to know you. <br /> <br /> GIRL: You just want to get into my pants. <br /> <br /> BRANDON: I want to get into my mind, heart, soul. I don't see you wearing any pants in this equation. <br /> <br /> In general, I'd appreciate this movie as the worst movie I ever saw, which took me seriously.
