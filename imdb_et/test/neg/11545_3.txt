One of the problems associated with popular culture, especially when discussing the popular culture of the 1970s, is that the mass media - especially television - are usually about four years behind the underground media, especially music. Many people think that the Woodstock generation was important in the 1970s, in fact it was in 1970 in Altamont. By 1972, the "underground" rock or "counterculture" had entered England and Led Zepplin, the Black Sabbath, and David Bowie, the early metal heads and the so-called "glam-rockers" who were all "peace and love" - ​​no, nor in the dark convinced Charles Manson's family. <br /> <br /> This obvious TV show pilot (which, fortunately, was never adopted by networks) is trying to reach a culture that was just like the flowers of yesterday. has been around for a couple of years - at the time of writing, Carlino had already recognized the stories of harsh mafia revenge, and cultural references are "Easy Rider" and Woodstock (1969). In fact, in 1966/67 - Woodstock Hendrix, Canned Heat and Sly and Family Stone had forgotten such folk pops. <br /> <br /> Film is a middle-aged family who goes to Wow, man, farout, outasight, this is a groovy desperate bag gear, but politics doesn't read anything - Vietnam - any place in Asia, right? <br /> <br /> This average (scaled and blank) TV movie is redeemed only by Jeff Bridges' surprisingly mature performances as a young college drop out who convinces its parents and grandmother to discover America. All other performances are standard TV fair-time TV players. The director uses some nice location for cinematography, but otherwise the film is a poor 90-minute way of spending. <br /> <br /> I knew it was all the time when Sal Mineo was talking about a young Runaway (who tells the characters they don't really have): "He's a hidden existentialist." Wow, far, strong. A few extra points "so bad are funny", but if you don't care about the 60's TV version, stay away.
