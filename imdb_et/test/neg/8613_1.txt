Well I watch tons of movies and it really ... BIG TIME. I'm sure we're all sick and tired of the low budget to make Vampire movies using some "Martial Arts Teacher" "actor" movies. I am also so tired that the man knows some kind of fighting method and then is able to fight his way somewhat boring with the film. I forced myself to look at it and one of the main reasons was that the lead actor was pretty real (Ha-Ha) Well I hope it helped a little and if you have the time and you want your brain to rest. Hopefully one day we won't release this type of movie, but then hey, where all the low-budget participants go :-) <br /> <br /> There's a lot of Bloops in the movie, but I'll leave you in to find it because it adds the viewing a little bit of fun at the time and also when you get a little perfectionist it disturbs you ;-) Cheers !!
