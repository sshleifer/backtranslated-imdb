Two little girls are making friends. One is trying to convince you that he is a witch. The other is a pusher who bends to have a witch's will. On top of the movie and beyond, the meaningless communication between two little girls is drowned, with a lot of dramatic cuts as they create "shocking" issues. You know what cute little kids should not be asked, for example, "How do you deal with the devil"? Oooh ... horrible. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the ascendant is sick of being controlled by his witchcraft. His conviction that his friend is a witch leads to a tragic end. But by the time it comes, you won't care less. a charming remnant. It just pulls on. It's boring. This is pointless. It doesn't need to be monitored. <br /> <br /> There are many who have a lot to say about it, based on their knowledge of the director's other work and of course the common denominator tells us all about meaningless films: "Ah, cinematography is wonderful!" These reviewers will probably have a point. But for those who found this movie without any previous ignorance, who didn't care about their "photography", its "atmosphere", or whatever ... anywhere else - for viewers who just want a good * movie that attracts them for an hour and a half Over time, do it yourself, people: <br /> <br /> Skip it.
