My Take: The Slimmest AIRPORT Movies And Probably One Of The 70's Disaster The Worst Movies. More activities, silly blocks, free characters and goofier elements. Trying to be the biggest AIRPORT, CONCORDE: AIRPORT '79 is the worst and probably one of the 1970's disaster films. With the results of their bad post offices, it is no wonder that the genre has surpassed its greeting. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a rather pleasant result by Lalo Schifrin, supported by some impressive title planes in his former glory (the same plane used in this film will be included in July 2000). But then the credit is displayed and we get a glimpse of "all the stars", which consists of more than the lost Hollywood stars, the TV show and the not-so-popular B-participants. The plot is quieter than ever: George Kennedy has returned to Joe Patron, now a Concorde pilot (a pilot pilot of Alain Deloni pilot project) in France after the Summer Olympics. There is a reporter Maggie Whelan (Susan Blakely) who just discovered that her boyfriend, Kevin Harrison (Robert Wagner), a well-known weapon manufacturer, is selling his weapons to terrorists. To prevent his news from appearing to the world, Harrison sends his fastest-running missiles and the best saboteurs to avoid the Concorde landing. <br /> <br /> Cast / subplots are more boring than ever before, even quieter than the alcoholic Myrna Loy or the singing nun. We have Cicely Tyson, who transports the heart of a living person into a cooler (!), Martha Raye as a woman with a bladder condition (and this sign doesn't go deeper), J.J. Walker aa pot-smoking saxophone (supposedly the most annoying character movie), Eddie Albert married "old" wife Sybil Danning, Avery Schreiber as Russian coach deaf daughter and finally love story reporter Jon Davidson and gymnast Andrea Marcovici (much more than coach Mercedes McCambidge sour view). Plus the movie gets much closer to the LOVE BOAT episode than ever before with Charo (and his pet Chihuahua) and Bibi Anderson's smoothest. Camp buffs will undoubtedly become a real kick-in-the-ball in this stupid entry into the long strain of 70's disaster films. This is more than a real disaster in the sense of the word. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/5 out of 5.
