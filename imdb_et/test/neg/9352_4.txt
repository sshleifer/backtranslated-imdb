Awful Star Wars gets a little more comic. Robert Urich marks the group of ice pirates as a leader who steals ice, because water is the most valuable substance in the universe (how all poor people in life are secret). She's caught up with Mary Crosby (Bing's daughter, about 25 years old and the whole cutie) who was looking for her missing father. Also embarrassed is Anjelica Huston in some fun sci-fi get-ups and pudgy, short ish Ron Perlman (whom I thought was seven feet long for his other roles!). And John Carradine, who sees the days of death and the Hollywood square funny (relative concept) Bruce Vilanch. If you ever want to see Bruce Vilanch lost, here's your movie. But then again, even it's not worth seeing, because it doesn't close him at all (I think he might have been a robot, but I nodded a few times).
