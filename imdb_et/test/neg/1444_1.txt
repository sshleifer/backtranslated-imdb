Put this movie out of your misery and burn the negatives. What am I saying? The whole movie was negative. Fortunately, this film would be the least attractive. It would be called a huge American majority too much for sex and violence. It will probably appear to be a shock value for some extra cable TV, but after changing nudity (most of the violence remains), everything that remains for 45 minutes will be very bad, 45 minutes long. commercials. There are just too many hungry actors in Hollywood.
