OK, if you are a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and love to make fun of movies, you will have a lot of fun. Otherwise, it can really be too painful to see. <br /> <br /> Plot: Obsessed cryptozoolog captures a huge box containing a cruise ship Chupacabra (probably not having to declare it or even mention that it will bring a live animal on board - "not really, it's research equipment, the vents are just accident "). Some of the measuring rods he hired to open the box, he found that he paid bunches of money, maybe there is something to steal. When WOOD CRATE is open, the steel bars inside Chupacabra will break and kill the rampage. <br /> <br /> Yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> Marshall (I assume that US Marshall, as he was in a Gulf War, not just a man, Marshall), is on board, exploring the ship's safely lost money. He wears an insurance company ("Lady, I'm the best insurance you have ..."). Other glowing characters are the captain (John Rhys-Davies and, unfortunately, his first film victim), his tae-bo teacher (snicker - Tae-bo), a tedious old stuck-up lady with a small dog that should be eaten by the cat (guess and what an inconvenient gigolo who might have been believable in the 1964 movie, nothing newer. Much of the action was really bad, and the characters were right there, so you were hysterically laughing at death. <br /> <br /> Generally - RECOGNIZED bad. Bad on many levels. BAD BAD BAD. What ??? The balls don't even make the Chupacabra flinch, but can Tae-bo bimbo beat him and scare him? Hey Sci-fi channel, do you want scripts or what?
