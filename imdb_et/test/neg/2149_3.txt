Hell was a disappointment. It was not close to the contents of the B-West movie and it should never be compared to a fantastic movie like Silverado. The dialogue was boring, the plot was tight, the soundtrack was too redundant, and the actor was terrible. Even professionals could have learned some lessons from Sunset Carson's showroom. The only positive thing about this movie is that he introduced some of the nation's main cowboy shooters, but you can see them in the right light of the SASS video. The package of this feature makes it very attractive and preview is decent, but after that.
