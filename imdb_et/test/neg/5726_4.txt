This is, in my opinion, a very bad film that promotes Arnold Schwarzenegger starring (despite being a co-founder) only to sell more copies. Obviously, the effect of thematic "Conan" films is that this film is not really enjoyable and cannot be entertained at all. <br /> <br /> The stars of Bridgette Neilsen are Sonja, a beautiful woman who has been given incredible power with a ghostly figure after her village was kidnapped, her family was killed and herself raped by Queen Gedran (Sandahl Bergman) soldiers. Gedran is the queen of tyrant who wants to control the barbaric world and is looking for a talisman protected by Sonja's sister. After Sonja has discovered, Sonja is revenge, and at the same time he must save the world from the anger of Gedran. Talisman's captain, Kalidor (Schwarzenegger), tries to defend him whether he wants him there or not. The first big problem with this film is the beginning. Events that led to Sonja's power could easily have made ten to fifteen minutes of a pleasant movie. But the start is being attacked for a quick one-minute "Earlier?" segment television shows. If they had actually taken part in these events and cut some of the fillers later, they could have redeemed this movie, but unfortunately they didn't (I don't know why director Richard Fleischer has only two films from Redist Sonja). <br /> <br /> This film also has some of the most annoying characters like Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.), who is a stupid character and just adds a general camp to the movie that sometimes works but in this case fails. Obviously he wrote a comic for the film, but due to the general absurdity of the film, this red was another expensive mistake for Sonja. <br /> <br /> Because of all these bugs, there was a good fight for scenes involving both Neilsen and Arnie, which are worth noting, but they are not somewhere for this turkey. The action is about as good as the movies of this quality, and even Arnie didn't seem too bothered about his performance. I don't recommend this movie at all; it is a waste of one and a half hours for me. My price for Red Sonja? 3/10
