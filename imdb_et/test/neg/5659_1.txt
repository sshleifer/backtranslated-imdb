Humongous bra (34C, which is definitely not the actors) and what is said to be talking - oh don't worry if your son takes his bra, then Stripping boys (girl pulls boys off) pants to expose Your Boxers - Kids are trying at home and at school. Beating men - something wrong. Exhibition likes to show underwear - panties next? bikini - mother can buy me one when I get puberty? To learn so much about sexual innova- tion: eg: "Do not doubt your ball skills." <br /> <br /> "I like to dance." Wet and sticky is very sudden. Sticky and moist mommy gets irritated. "<br /> <br />" I just want to close my face and go "bbbbbbuuuub". "" <br /> <br /> "I have brought out my best ideas when wet." <br /> <br /> "He sliced ​​my banana!" <br /> <br /> "Come on, let's do it" <br /> <br /> You never think where I found this fish, "<br /> <br />" I'll leave you two. .. "<br /> <br />" Carl y (about Sami): He just pulled iCarly to play with Jonah?! "<br /> <br />" You will not be honored if your back is not up. "it hangs" <br /> <br /> "What can I say, I'm a big ballman" <br /> <br /> "Look at me Dad!" great. Freddie's Mom: Thank you <br /> <br /> "Hey! Could you hold your hands off your devices?" <br /> <br /> Freddie: Oh, and last night I slept with my socks. Sam or Carly: So? Freddie: JUST my socks <br /> <br /> "They didn't want me or my fudgeball part" <br /> <br /> "Freddie, you know how I know your handling tools!" <br /> <br /> "You don't even want to know where the batteries are going to go" <br /> <br /> "It's like a whipped cream!" <br /> <br /> Spencer: "Well, it spread ... to places." Freddie: "Where?" * Spencer's initiative to Freddie, then whispers in his ear. * Freddie: "Ugh!" <br /> <br /> "Oh, it's just that you've always felt ... so ready." /> <br /> "I have to take my daughter to a specialist" <br /> <br /> "I send lots of guys, lots of places" <br /> <br /> "Yes, you have had all kinds of fun this morning .
