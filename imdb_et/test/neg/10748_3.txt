There are places in the film for political comments, but "masters of horror" is not one of them. I get enough of these things from Newsweek and all the other newspaper editions. Now, do I have to watch it in the fiction films? C'mon! All I wanted was a good zombie clip, not another "Bush is bad!" rant. If Joe Dante wants to express his policy, let him go to Air America. And if you need to ask for a "message" movie, be a little crazy about it. It was all that was dead on the face of the fish. <br /> <br /> By the way, Joe, do you really want the left voting block to be tied to brain-dead zombies? You may want to think about it before you make another political horror film (God help us).
