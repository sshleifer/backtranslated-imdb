This game comes from a genre of games that tried to take advantage of the whole Myst-inspired trend - to walk around, talk to people, solve puzzles. The riddles themselves are absolutely terrible, but I stick to action that is just a little better. If you are looking for convincing results from any character, you will not find it here, but this game is worth buying only if you witness Christopher Walken's truly fun performance. His acting in this game is so terrible that he seems to imitate someone who happens to be embodying him. He is himself a caricature. <br /> <br /> So buy this game if you're a masochistic, Walken fan or just want to hear a lot of F-words.
