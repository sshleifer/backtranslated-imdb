*** BIG SPOILERS! *** The 1970's "Flesh Feast" is more than a valuable conclusion of the excellent career of Lake Veronica. It has a wide reputation because it is a terrible stinker, and I have to say it rightly. However, as a big fan of fear and exploitation with a lower budget in the 1970s, I decided to look at it, mainly thanks to the gulf camp search, but after viewing it I had to admit that the picture really has nothing to do with the film. The image on this page is the title of the Flesh Feast in the DVD collection, which includes four films, including Sergio Martino's "Mountain of Kannibal God" and Dal Tenney's "I Erit Your Skin". What the collection doesn't include is boring Turkey. "Flesh Feast" is not only a camp and ridiculous, but mostly quite annoying, which is even more pathetic that the film is only 70 minutes long. Also, the title cannot be deceived, the movie is not funny at all. But it's traceable if it's just that trashiness and especially extremely stupid, but it is a somewhat fun ending. The film follows a ridiculous plot of Dr. Elaine Frederick (Lake Veronica), a brilliant female scientist who can somehow restore young meat through corrosive breeds (don't ask how). A number of criminals (or terrorists, or any) who are paid by a radical political group, assign the doctor a "mysterious" recuperation of youth. After an endless sense of futile fire, it seems that the mysterious commander is actually Hitler himself. Previously, it was obvious, but I still had to laugh because the film's finals were so unbelievably silly and inadvertently fun ... This is a movie that is very big as the last film of a great actor and former beauty like Lake Veronika. With the exception of the lake, the performances are ridiculously bad, even for such zero-budget support. The bad performance, however, is something I can easily forgive in such films. What I can't forgive is extreme boredom. Over the past five minutes, this camp has been watched by hardcore stuff fans, but I would recommend skipping it.
