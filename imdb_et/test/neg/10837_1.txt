Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen. Pathetic in almost every sense. <br /> <br /> I threw the DVD straight into the trash - I didn't even think it was fair to give it to a local store. <br /> <br /> The consequences are not fun. The dams control room looks like a cardboard. Water looks beyond the background - nothing works. <br /> <br /> The sliding plot is about the same depth as the Scooby Doo comic. <br /> <br /> I couldn't wait until they all drown.
