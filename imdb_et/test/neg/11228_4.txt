"Passionate" is a film that is disappointing for most stories. Where should I start? Content? It is desperately simplified and full of gaps. Direction? Reminds of a cheap B-movie. Acting? John Laughlin is absolutely terrible because he is a "good-willed wife-frozen husband" Bobby, Annie Pots is not convincing as a "frozen woman" Amy, and that's just Kathleen Turner (above average) and Antony Perkins (excellent) who gets satisfactory signs. Specifically, Antony Perkins provides an excellent result as the perverted admirer Peter Shayne, while Turner can portray the role of sexy Chinese blue and weak Joanna crane satisfactorily. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Turner and Perkins presentations alone are inadequate to help the film be higher than 4/10. See if you want to see Turner in some sensational scene (although even in this census you can easily match the movie to your competition - such as "Basic Instinct"), otherwise avoid.
