Every year, Nu produces a couple of "action packages", full of holy films. This little nugget called Shadowcaster III (as long as I visited this site wasn't a trilogy) is a great example of the good work that the company does. Frank Zagarino is as average as ever and does a good job of almost indestructible (?), Schizophrenic (??) android. I don't waste any words anymore because I don't want to reveal a terrible plot and destroy you with a few big smiles. <br /> <br /> Rating 2/10 (Revard for these heavy technicians. Man, this sort of garbage redundancy must be nervous.)
