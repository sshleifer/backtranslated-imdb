Boredom and great curiosity I decided today to show that this four-year-old niece loves it. I should have known that it was an example that only four years old could please. The exhibition was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> First of all, the show was not funny. Laughed at the most inappropriate times, which was very annoying, especially since no jokes were funny. At some point, the laughing track went out when a boy who was a cameraman said, "I'm going to shine my lens." How the hell is this funny? Its parts (like meat drums), which were supposed to be funny, were just a fool for anyone over 11 years old. <br /> <br /> Now I have the feeling that four years old are not target groups. But since I have a four-year-old niece who looks at it, this kind of thing touched me when I watched it: It doesn't show very good behavior. In the episode I watched, it shows that Sam steals a Carly sandwich and pushes him to the ground so Carly can stand up and do the same. I wouldn't want my brother to behave rude. I also don't like the idea that two young girls who have a web show where they give personal information ... If that were true, it would be a fan around him. <br /> <br /> This show is probably good and funny for someone who is eleven or younger, but someone who is older is just away. I'll give it the two letters because I think I can see how funny the child is.
