When Jim Wynorski first announced that he was making a new round of my all-time favorite series, "Slumber Party Massacre", I was ecstatic. I had been waiting for a new queue literally for years. So began the production and the very small bits and pieces of firing and the actors were released until they were packed. Then the title changes. No longer would this new sequel be called "Slumber Party Massacre IV" but "Cheerleader Massacre". I was a little disappointed, but a different title would be a very low price for the movie I had been waiting for so long. I was still very interesting and seeing it in my place. <br /> <br /> Maybe a month ago, some very sophisticated copies of the movie appeared to some extremely lucky viewers who had to watch the movie. months before its publication. A couple of reviews of the leaked network and judging by them, I was afraid of Jim Wynorsk's "Cheerleader massacre". <br /> Today I got to see the movie for the first time in full length and I'm still scratching my head. In the second review, I read the "Cheerleader Massacre" certainly not a new part of the "Slumber Party Massacre" series, but slasher flick it all. And it's bad. <br /> <br /> Before you get into the movie, let me first point out the huge fan of Jim Wynorsk's films. I thought he was a real camp genius with the winner almost every time. Yes, his films are made on rubber band budgets and do not contain the most top-notch action, but they are still fun. They are the ones they are: campy movies you watch if you want a good time. From "Sorority House Massacre II", "Hard to Die", "Chopping Mall", Jim has produced goods more than once. One reason I was glad this film was his last project. <br /> <br /> The "Cheerleader Massacre" (in my opinion) does not reflect any film I saw in the past by this director / writer. First, the production was extremely cheap and the film was actually filmed on a video tape I had never seen before. The actors were on average small, and the story is almost ridiculous. The killer is also extremely stupid and reminds you of your old grandfather rather than the escaped lunate. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is full of nudity. This is the people of Jim Wynorsk's film we are talking about. But some of the strokes seen here seem almost like they were made for a while. There is a very long shower that includes a cheerleading trainer that seems to be moving forever and largely reflects the shower scene, Jimi's "House of Massacre II". The girl even baths almost exactly the same way. <br /> <br /> "Cheerleader Massacre" is also extremely clich√©. Open scene is literally something that we all have seen with past syllables. Boy and girl who makes their relationship away when you thought. Brinke Stevens, whom I have never considered as a huge actor for the first time, also gives one of his tougher and forced performances in his small fire. We are talking about possible smart cards here. He recalls some of the incidents his character carried 20 years ago in the murder police, while playing the original "Slumber Party Massacre" material. Why was the original film used when it wasn't a new "SPM"? I have no clue. There are also two explosions in this movie, which I am almost certain to be reused from other films. <br /> <br /> This film not only processes FOOTAGE from previous movies, but also recycles the scores of other films. Some of the music used in "Humanoids from the Deep" (which was also "Coroner" before recycling) can be heard throughout the film. There are also at least two others that I can't detect, but I'm sure they have been used before. <br /> <br /> After this terrible, ridiculous story, non-existent gore / special effects and video camera - like quality, I have serious problems with Mister Wynorsk's career. Did a man who has rejoiced in past films eventually lose his niche? Shows only time. Oh, and let's not forget our latest movie. New part in "Sorority House Massacre" movies, now entitled "Final Exam". I think I can see the pattern here ...
