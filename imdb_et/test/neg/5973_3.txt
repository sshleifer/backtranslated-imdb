The title of this movie is very misleading. In no time will the documentary show how the introduction of the Nile perch fish into Lake Victoria has caused the problems facing Mwanza, Tanzania. The film attempts to cause Tanzania to cause environmental problems, but the truth of the matter is the problems arising from parasitic external forces. The documentary is very slow, without ever being so narrative. Instead, it relies on the absence of small text packets between any associated segments to display information bits that do not decrease to add or expand the subject content. There are only two attempts to discuss the environmental impact of Nile perch. One of them is a small segment for about 10 seconds, where they interview factory-run factory managers and briefly describe how 50 years ago the Nile perch was taken to the lake and consumed other fish species. The filmmaker does not try to go over the matter or go deeper into it. Another attempt is to film a second documentary about the environmental impact of a Nile perch in this film, and again, no real attempt has been made to wreak havoc on this problem. The subject that is not reflected in this documentary has nothing to do with perchfish and most of the problems facing most African countries. The film tries to combine the introduction of perch fish into AIDS, poverty and pollution in Tanzania, but never makes a direct link. Like any intelligent person with problems in Africa, the problems shown here in Tanzania are not unique, but affect most of Africa and have nothing to do with fish. It would have been nice if the filmmakers had shown how the local economy or life was before the fish was introduced and how it was adversely affected by the introduction of the fish, but not. The point is that many interviewees say that fish has offered jobs and opportunities for many. Yes, things are bad in the city of Mwanza, but they are much worse in the country and elsewhere on the continent. <br /> <br /> Weak attempts by document makers to link fish to a documentary about Tanzania's hunger problems quickly discredits itself. For the first time, Tanzania is a very big country and Lake Victoria is only a small part of the country. Many of the individuals interviewed actually say they can find a job for Mwanza, a fishing lake in the lake, and feed their families because things were so bad elsewhere in the country. <br /> <br /> This documentary is very weak, has no narrative, and does not try to show anything to the Nile perch. He plays people's emotions by showing pictures of poverty, hunger and the destruction of AIDS that do not try to show you how it is unique to Tanzanian lake or perch. In fact, most of the problems are more related to war, globalization and Christianity, as well as the environmental impact of perch.
