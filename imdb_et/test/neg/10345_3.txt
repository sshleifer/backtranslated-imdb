The idea of ​​Dead Silence is great: the zombie outbreak is taking place at a sharp paranoia radio show. There was so much for this movie. Unfortunately, as soon as the zombies reached their appearance, everyone disappeared. Zombies were so stupid! They ran around their hands. They saw a bunch of people who used a haunting house for primary school students. This is a stupid movie. You have been warned.
