I don't repeat what many others have said about this movie; I'm trying to add some new points. The Coolio-as-vampire is familiar to fans who know his "Blondie song" No Exit ", in which he takes on the role of a rifle (it actually works as a musical concept and is really a great song). Casper Van Dien is no worse than Brad Pitt and is actually more beautiful. And what really does Brad Pitt do to the eye candy? Same here, though it's badly filmed (see "Starship Troopers" instead). And, of course, Udo Kier is a little more than a cam, after playing Dracula on Morrissey / Warhol. Enjoy it when you can.
