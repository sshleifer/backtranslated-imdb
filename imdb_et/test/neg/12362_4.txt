Eight Legged Freaks is a modern monster movie, like any old "giant attack" (INSERT ANIMAL HERE) - a remake of 50, 60, and 70-year-old movies. Or rather it should have been a remake rather than what it was. So how was the monster movie made in 2002? Well, with a typical opening with some chemicals that make spiders growing in enormous proportions, they interfere with movies like Gremlins, Jurassic Park, Starship Troopers and taste it with some parody like Scary Movie. Gremlins is probably the best comparison, but the eight Legged Freaks were so full of parodies and stupid jokes that it was sometimes Scary Movie. It was too much, at least if you were looking for a monster movie and not just one parody movie full of jokes. <br /> <br /> A large part of the actor is not expected for such a movie, and that is exactly what it is. The story, however, was extremely thin, but a bunch of loosely related events to show some of the activities that were mixed with all the jokes that led to a slightly spotty and dirty end. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the 8/10 gap 4/10 and it also includes special effects, with pretty good and noisy spiders, where fun.
