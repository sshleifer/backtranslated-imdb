Remember, it shouldn't be, but it is. I saw it in a movie theater (being a big wrestler and a Hulk Hogan fan). Everything I remember at night, we're the only ones in the theater and I didn't really like it. I blinded the rest of the field and for good reason. <br /> <br /> A bad film that is equal to "Upper Secondary" and "The Pumaman", "No Holds Barred" is a film that is set for high stakes in the world of pro-wrestling. Maybe not all stakes are so high ... and frankly, I feel dirty, calling these people "professionals" something. And really, except for the first scene, there is no wrestling to talk about. So I think the film is a world of amateur-beating-the-c *** low-stakes bets. Hulk Hogan plays WWF champion Rip (never to say that Hulk Hogan was typical, this and movies like Thunder in Paradise showed how he challenged himself with deep roles) that really limited his talents). In essence, he plays himself, but a wardrobe that is more black and blue than Hulkster's red and yellow. He also has this hand gesture that he does. It's like a gloomy devil that people do on rock concerts, except when you put your thumb in the air and you curled with your finger. My friend said it should be like "R." Try and see for yourself. If it looks like "R", Mars needs women. But still, <br /> <br /> Kurt Fuller, who obviously has a fritz, has his own homoerotic heartfelt television file, which Rip is probably bigger than Elvis on his network. He does not get anything from it (And the winning hand out of the office is that no one but the camera), and so the film follows Fuller trying to increase ratings and come back to Rip. He does this when he creates his great title "Battle of the Tough Boys". Marketing genius, this guy. <br /> <br /> Many hands-on gestures, quite idiotic fighting scenes (all played as wrestling is very real and deadly serious), superfluous, too frequent images Hulk is nothing but panties, this movie has everything you do never want a stupid movie. It is frivolous, not too spiritual, violent and contains the phrase "What is this smell?" "DOOKIE!" "Dookie?" <br /> <br /> Classic all the time.
