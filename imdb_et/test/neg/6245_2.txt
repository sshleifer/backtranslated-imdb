In my continuing efforts to find the worst film ever, my friends and I got into this little jewel. It's fun through and out, especially if you don't know (as we didn't do) that it's another half of the horror. <br /> <br /> I'm not worried about the plot, except to mention that everyone complains about horrible snowstorms (it was equivalent to characters that just shouted "FORESHADOWING!" in the camera and cast their hands), and in some strange twists of fate there is a snow storm . Budget problems, I think. <br /> <br /> Add it to the magic door that opens or closes depending on what scary effects the director wants to create and cut off electricity until the gym instructor decides to take a shower with a lot of soap. I admit it; I had difficulty breathing points. <br /> <br /> The only true decent part of this movie, as it turned out, was from the original Slumber Party Massacre movie. Now it's so funny when I know it. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * End where it turns out that slasher did it because his drunk friends got into him and a female friend who did and then a friend who is driving a train or something is probably the most fun psycho the origin of the killer, which has been enhanced by fabulous and hidden film material. I am pleased that all slasher friends have completely forgotten the incident until a setback was needed. <br /> <br /> Drive, do not walk to pick it up and have fun. Of course, a continuum editor should be given a prize for it, if only they were not left in this horrific snow storm ...
