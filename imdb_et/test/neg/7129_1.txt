Don't waste your time or money to see it or even rent it. This is by far the worst thing I've ever seen. His two hours (too long) of your life you will never get back. If you want to be scared, look at something else. We went with someone who still has a nightmare about Gremlins and he is not the least afraid of it. <br /> <br /> There are so many things that make this movie an incredibly bad attempt to make money. Now, before I start, let me say I loved the first Grudge! But the other is a different story. The plot is very deep and complex. In the end, you thought, "What the hell was that or all." The pornographic film on list B is considered to be bad. I could place a number of examples, but I do not want to spoil it for those who are gluten for punishment, but I can summarize two terrible hours in two simple words .... it's spread.
