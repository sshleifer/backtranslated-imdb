First of all, I don't understand if I should use my imagination in this movie or if the director tried to save money or had a low budget! Here we go .... <br /> <br /> Basically, for so many years and the gaps I didn't understand, this similar movie jumped from 9 to 20 to 30 and so many loopholes that make you you ask questions how hell did it happen? and why? I think it's a big stream. Forget comments that keep history, this film not only contains facts of history, but also has so many mistakes. So most people say you watch it in the cinema, you lose all cinematography like rivers, ears, etc. It is true that they are beautiful, why I was expecting BluRay to release 1080p. OKAY! beautiful scenes, but what is it? 1 hour and a half after the movie turned off, I just lost interest. For years, the film had to jump exactly the same things (at least two years after 10 years after the director's post)! I mean, I didn't see a movie that I lost in understanding! Anyway I wish I could include spoilers, but if u decide to watch this movie, ask yourself how it happened? you know what i mean! Don't look at this movie as a waste of time.
