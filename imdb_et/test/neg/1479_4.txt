As boring as you sleep after the first 20 minutes. Excuse me, Mr Boutonnat, I admire your work (all those beautiful films that you led, like "Tristana", "Sans logique", etc.), but here the plot is very ... in vain! Except for excellent photography, everything seems stupid and there is no envy to know what happens to these "middle" players. In addition, dialogs are minimal. The famous question "where are the children" is repeated so often that it looks like a farce. Believe me, it's a waste of time (plot) and 3 hours long for a long time. Definitely the real reason for this box office!
