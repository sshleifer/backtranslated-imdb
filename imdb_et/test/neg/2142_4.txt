If I would only rate this movie on the basis of an exhibition / script / production, etc., I would give it one star. All these elements are terrible. I can partially forgive this movie in the light of the $ 250 budget. The movie has many entertaining scenes, mostly those that are unintentionally funny. Some of them are: A 14-year-old child who steals and travels by bus with teenage hooligans (one of whom is a sporty Joy Division shirt) who scares the harassment of the protagonists of the film apparently by a fake firearm woman. and visitation of plastic bulls skull in Arizona desert. <br /> <br /> I would have given him 5 stars for entertainment if it wasn't in the presence of its terribly annoying, morally pondering old grandmother. I only had one star dock for him. Who * lets * make a wedding cake with a black mat, what?
