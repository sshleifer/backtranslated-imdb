This is by far the worst film I've ever seen. What they meant. Stop me preaching already! That's why we all look at Walker Texas Ranger and don't recognize it for our friends. Terrible action and extremely fake. When the movie is opened, the story stops and the participants start listening to the audience. The director thought these two networks were good. It looked like a mess! When I saw the title of my local blockers, it seemed interesting. Their warning should have said that the wrong ad / adventure was religious. For the first time for a long time, I stopped the movie and couldn't finish it.
