WARNING: SPOILERS Dear Roger! <br /> <br /> During your outstanding career, you have made many different entertainment options, some good, some interesting. "Blood Beast Night" belongs to the last category. It's not as terrible as saying "The Phantom From 10000 League" or "Dunwich Horror". However, one of my biggest criticisms of this movie is that I could have made it faster, better and cheaper for you. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the foreword and headlines. Roger, missile sequences, see something out of Disney's "Man Into Space", of course not so good. Futuristic Rocketship looks like today in 1958. Why didn't you just use Vanguard, Atlas or even Viking? Better yet, why not give up the launch completely and start shooting space and capsule? That's what I would have done for you, Roger. Secondly, why has the spaceship collapsed during the attack? Even a middle-aged physical student could have told you that your astronaut would have reached the ground for extra crunchy and largely spread. I would have shown that your astronaut is a "monster" "overwhelming" (perhaps using the great "negative / positive" stuff you used in the "satellite war"), losing contact with land and landing in the desert. It would also explain how you "beast the blood" could impregnate during the impregnation of your astronaut, but destroy the fire. Even with their stupidity. The first half of the movie is pretty good. If you spent money on decent music, it would have been as good as the average episodes of "Outer Limits". But again, your writer Ed Nelson describes the landing system as a designer, then gives him some stupid dialogues about magnetism. The biggest problem on the other side of "Blood Beast Night" is Michael Emmet. He's terrible as a devastating astronaut. You should have dismissed him on the spot and replace him with Ed Nelson. You could have combined Nelson's responsibilities with those of John Dunlap and save yourself the cost of one actor. I don't know if you really understand these people; but at least you would have three meals a day. I would have dug the "burnt parrot" and spent the extra money with makeup to make the astronaut "blood wild". Maybe it was too close to you for "The Unknown Unknown", but it would have helped the speed of the other half enormously. if you have a "blood beast", doesn't it make sense to show a little blood? Yes, I know that the title comes from the blood embryos of the astronauts, but Kowalski could have done much better work for you when he poured some chocolate syrup. After all, it looks like black and white blood. What did it cost you, maybe two bucks? I would also have used some close-ups. For some reason, the uncomfortable dialogue and bad behavior in the neighborhood do not seem so bad. See almost 70s TV series and see what I mean. Finally, Roger, a note to your writer. You can't use a fluoroscope to show some poor schmuck full of foreign embryos if you don't have any electricity. Remember, did you fry the generator in the first roll? Oh, and I almost forgot. Roger, can't you afford yourself a fake? You know what type of blade goes into the handle. I had one of them when I was 9 years old, which also happens to be the "Blood Beast Night". It cost two more bucks. I think I knew enough to make you a better movie. I know I know enough now. So, Roger, if you decide to "Blood Beast Night", or if you're looking for a writer / director to work with you on another project, I'm your man. I work inexpensively because I really want to make you a movie, Roger. <br /> <br /> I'll give "Blood Beast Night" "3". SPECIAL NOTE: If you want to watch kitchy movies like "Blood Beast Night", the DVD I bought for $ 3.99 was of very good quality. You can also get "Bloody Night" with many other horrible horror / sci-fi movies, such as Bestbuy for about $ 6.
