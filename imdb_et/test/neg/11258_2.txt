I have to be honest and admit that this film was nothing but a disturbance to me in principle. It is loaded with a plot that revolves around the mysterious murders of several young women, which then relate to the discovery of a body over 40 years old. The story doesn't really look like, especially when Robicheaux (played by Tommy Lee Jones) starts conversations with General Conference General John Bell Hood (I've never done it before). Terribly messy was John Goodman as Julie's "Baby Feet" Balbon, who probably should be a local cellular figure. I just didn't think Goodman was working in this role, although I admit that it might just be because I'm not a John Goodman fan. Somewhere in the mix, Justina Machado appeared as an FBI agent, although I never knew what the FBI was involved in, which could simply mean that my attention was left on the screen. When it was explained, I miss it completely. Fortunately, this is a relatively short film so you don't waste too much of your life. 2/10
