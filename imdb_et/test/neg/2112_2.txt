How could such fantastic actors in such unfortunate creations be on earth? It's one of the most stylized garbage I've seen for a long time. Not only is it poorly written, it is also a product of dirty directions and editing. Cinematic art is so terribly manipulative and irregular, and the assembly is incredibly jumbled. The real ideas behind the plots (cloning, toxic waste, climate change) are good first, but when taken by the production / direction team, it is a big slag that resembles one episode. And this is a scientific series? I am a doctor and all I can say is that this film has a science certificate that is almost embarrassing to look at. I felt very bad for the parties involved because they were all extraordinary.
