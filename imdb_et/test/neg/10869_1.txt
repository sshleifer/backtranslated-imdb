When a movie called Hell Ride appears, you expect a certain amount of bikers. For characters like "Pistolero", "Comanche" and "The Gent" I pulled myself worse and just saw it. Dialogue, soundtrack and shooting style are common for biker films. Dusty Desert is blurred by heat when the bikes break the way when "CC Rider" plays and talks about sex and violence. Yawn! The three leadership was simply ridiculous and incredible. Seeing the old men like Bishop and Madsen (a nice roasted shirt) who drove off the dusty desert ride, I reminded me of two men who are desperately trying to re-live their youngsters. Bad Eric Balfour tried to get a goal back for him, but the ball went wide. Even Dennis Hopper's full appearance in Easy Rider's swing couldn't save it. And what about the store that bought us? Many have compared it to Tarantino's work. It's not even close. What makes Tarantino's work so great is that he knows it's up, so he just goes to the balls and takes it as high as possible. The bishop took the film so seriously that it became nothing more than a bad copy of the usage channel.
