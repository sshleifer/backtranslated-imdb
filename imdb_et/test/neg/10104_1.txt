This movie is really pathetic in every conceivable department. terrible, terrible, terrible. It's only about eighty minutes long, but believe me, you know how you look at Andy Warhol's film (then twenty more hours in the life of an empire country building would certainly be much more interesting). <br /> <br /> Where to start ... dirty script, nasty cinematography, as bad as bad works, remarkably unpleasant effects, horrible music, or just a waffle-thin plot that looks like a sieve. This movie is inconsistent shambles <br /> <br /> A particularly remarkable scene takes place outside the cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, the speaker cautiously watches through a coffee window commenting on the average English accent "God fuck". This woman's right. God is damaging this terrible monster. <br /> <br /> Anyone involved should be ashamed of themselves. We hope that the Director will not find the financial support again.
