Total shame! Really terrible! The scenario and the dialogue are a joke and are combined with a director who has no idea of ​​Saudi Arabia's life. It is not a surprise, quite a Saudi movie ha, a director of Palestine-Canada, a writer of Lebanon, a leading actor of Jordan and shooting took place in Dubai, and all these elements very well show that the film is far from representing the film in Saudi Arabian society. Yes, it contains some Saudi clichés, things we see in comics, but that's all. The film had the opportunity to show a real problem with Saudi Arabian society or at least give us something new and real about Saudi Arabian youth's worries and concerns, instead copying and pasting from here and there and the result was confusing. Even the alleged love story of the film does not exist, or at least we have not seen it. The only bright side in this complete attack is some good supportive pain. Veteran Khaled Sami was funny as his father's much-written role, which he obviously failed because he looks younger than his son's acting actor. The actor who plays the role of fanatic brother, Turkish Al-Yusuf, has done well, in fact he was the best actor in the film. The rest, for a long time, were professional, but the leader actor Hisham Abdulrahman was just bad. He was one of the appearance of a small divine bobby in all situations. She couldn't even tell her lines correctly. She has a charisma that made her win the Star Academy, a very famous reality show, and she's good at interviews and TV shows, but she was the weakest link in this movie. The main actor I did not know very much, but even in some scenes, he was badly acting and gave his sensuality in an unnecessary way. <br /> <br /> The film was a big hit, Saudi smiled in thousands of neighboring countries to Bahrain, and Dubai participates there when it was reviewed there, and it made money, then screened after watching, then on television and it was a few weeks ago . It was getting money from Saudi Arabia for entertainment, but unfortunately; the film was neither home nor fun.
