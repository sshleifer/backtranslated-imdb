"When the killer calls" is an unusually unpleasant slip with some very unpleasant and unpleasant sequences. The decision was to clearly try and cash in on the "When a stranger call" is made with this movie phone calls almost almost literally. They seem very compulsive. <br /> <br /> In addition, the filmmaker commits a cardinal (but too general) sin to heroic friends being reluctant. So at the beginning of the film, we like and take root for the babysitter (a nice believable work by Rebekah Kochan), but then she joins the usual slaher-flick teenage friends and the mood is gone. <br /> <br /> Flick-type works, but it's likely to be much more unpleasant if you have to wait so you need to be warned beforehand.
