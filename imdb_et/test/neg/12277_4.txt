The CBS radio program called "We People" helps find the American home, a qualified surgeon and a swimming pool for Charles Coburn (like Karl Braun) for the Vienna refugees. She arrives with her beautiful daughter, Sigrid Gurie (Leni), who is studying for teaching. They are relocated to small dusty Midwestern villages at John Wayne (John Phillips) and his uncle Spencer Charters (veterinarian Nunk 'Atterbury). Ms. Gurie is dusty and wants to leave. Immediately. But the prospect of romance with Mr Wayne can change his mind ... <br /> <br /> God responds to the many prayers of the citizens for rain, but it may not be enough to save the city of the farm. The whole city is recommended to move to Oregon. Wayne wants to stay and tougher. Coburn gets an invitation to a top clinic. And Gurie learns that her groom, supposedly dead, will come to her husband. He knows conscientiousness; but he has a dark secret ... This film does not inspire Wayne who looks out of his element. Gurie Binding, advertised with another Garbo, doesn't help. They have a lovely scene ("Jalopy, Italian car") in Wayne's car. <br /> <br /> **** Three Faces West (7/3/40) Bernard Vorhaus ~ John Wayne, Sigrid Gurie, Charles Coburn, Spencer Charters
