God blesses Randy Quaid ... his lousy Cousin Eddie on holiday and Christmas holidays were stealing from the show. He even made a terrible Vegas vacation worthwhile. <br /> <br /> I say he's trying to do it for TV shows, but that script is so funny that the movie can never be anywhere. Quaid and the other returning veterinarians (including Audrey, Dana Barron) are wasted here. Even the European vacation Eric Idle can't save the example on a short spot .... <br /> <br /> A pathetic and sad ... really painful look .... Christmas holiday 2 is the worst of a holiday franchise.
