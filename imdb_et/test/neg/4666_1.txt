I can't remember having seen a worse movie. The actor was burnt down, the dialogue had to feel painful to listen, the special effects of the second level and the general story ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I've never wanted to get out of the movie any more, and if I had been alone, I would have done it for about 30 minutes into it, and I saved myself on almost two other hours of expressing a nausea dialogue and plot with more holes as Swiss cheese "Texas size". "I can't just stress the unfortunate experience of this great cellulose colloid waste. <br /> <br />
