How can such things still be done? Didn't Seinfeld, Arrested Development, The Office, etc. kill this old fashioned, unforgettable mess? Obviously I'm not ... <br /> <br /> I'm actually a fan of Michael Rappaport and I've enjoyed his various firefighters and supporting roles (Copland, Friends), but he sucks in it, but no one is fighting this script. <br /> <br /> My wife enjoys it. But he's Brazilian. And if you've ever seen a typical Brazilian sit-com, you would understand why he thinks it's so funny. the next 3 or 4 plot development / lines would be looking at it for some time and would be almost literally correct! I felt very secret. It irritated my wife when she hated it when I do it (understand why, but I felt so screwed!)
