This movie begins with a promising enough, but it turns slightly twisted and under its stylish charm. The designs, costumes and music were excellent - as perfect as possible. But the more I got into the film, the more I felt it was the director's entertainment, not the audience. Although I loved to watch it, except for some short musical scenes, I can't say I enjoyed it. The director has enormous imagination, but when he enjoys this movie, he couldn't share it with the audience and at least with me. I didn't get a sense of mind and I couldn't suck into this universe. <br /> <br /> The big reason for this was (surprisingly) Zhang Ziyi. You can say that he is trying very hard, but he seems to have been so uncomfortable that he is almost amateur. He is a capable actor, but he has his own limitations. I have noticed in my behavior that he has not yet reacted to his companions, which creates a space for chemistry. The language barrier of this film seems to have only deepened things. He and Odagiri act as if they were on separate planets. He is not a very good singer, which made me sing every time, but fortunately there were not too many scenes. Odagiri was OK, but doesn't make much impression. <br /> <br /> I didn't even care for the characters separately. There's really a painful lack of character. The only reason for taking care of them seems to be that they are beautiful. However, in the middle of a movie without a good love story, it's hard to take care of what happens. The film also takes detours into smaller scenes that did not add anything to the story and were actually annoying. I had to roll back because after going to the subplot, I couldn't remember what the hell they were doing in the main round. There were scenes where it was hard to say what was happening because it was so stylized. <br /> <br /> For the most part I'm just disappointed because I really like the concept behind it and there are many things I like. Music and dance choreography is really great. Supporting performances are equally excellent, fantastic for both actress and singing. It's just too bad that the leading actors were so nice.
