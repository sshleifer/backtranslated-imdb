Unfortunately, another Costner movie that was an hour too long. Reliable performances, but the script was not where to go and there is no hurry. First of all, there is a series of events not related to you, some of which postpone the story. Does the script focus on Randall and his wife? Randall and Fischer? How about Fischer and Thomas? Finally, monologues from third parties do not artificially reveal the ever-developed real story and the characters themselves. The singer explains Randall, Randall explains Fischer, on and on. Finally, long after you no longer care, you learn something from script meetings. The three endings were undoubtedly presented and no one could do it. The end result? All three were used one after another. If you can hang from the 100th fog, you can pick them out. Despite a clear attempt to get points with the Coast Guard's commitment, it should have been washed from day one.
