I enjoy watching Robert Forster. That was the main reason I rented this movie. I also wanted to see that any story is going on somewhere in the middle, where characters could really displace each other without disruption. <br /> <br /> Unfortunitaly I found the movie to be boring. I couldn't be interested in the characters. I didn't get the story interesting, which seemed somewhere. <br /> <br /> After watching this hour, I turned it off. I appreciate the movie in 10 out of 10. It falls significantly below the mandatory 7 rating, which makes watching a movie worthwhile.
