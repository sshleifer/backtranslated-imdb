I don't think this film influenced me, which was meant: seeing American soldiers who shot wounded soldiers from the other side, and wounding the wounded prisoners to torture them to talk to them, made me the other half. It certainly did something like the "good guys" of the US forces. Was it supposed to be acceptable?
