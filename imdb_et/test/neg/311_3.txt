We were delighted to have it rented when we read some reviews and saw that it was so high. We got it home and couldn't believe what we saw. Its essence has been turned off if it was written by some hard-perverted old men who could not add their sexual frustration and fantasy to an anime movie that really lacked on the plot and humor. The main character is everywhere ... one moment, he's like an immature little boy, next time he's a mature and intelligent, then a heroic, then a perverted stalker. <br /> <br /> The worst part is all sexual content. I have no problem with the sex, nor do I have to complain about a movie that has some good sexual energy, but it's just presented as horrible. Nipple slips, close-ups of girls' legs (several times) with white underpants or swimsuit. It was totally inappropriate and it seemed that the person who wrote it tried to live some fantasies through his cartoons. We waited for something mature, but we looked at each other and asked what the hell it was ... after drawing cartoons and bad dialogue. If you want to see some cartoon characters cracking and swapping ... this is for you. If you are looking for something further, this film was empty. The characters and the dialogue were just irritating. <br /> <br />
