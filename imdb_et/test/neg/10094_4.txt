In short, the film is a gang war in the 1950s. Deuces leader Leon starts his gang after his brother OD "junk". He promises to protect the neighborhood. The leader of the rival gang has just come out of prison and wants revenge. <br /> <br /> The film didn't do it for me. "Good guys" were no longer good than "bad guys". Very little was shown that Deuces really took care of the community. I think the writers were realistic here, but I just didn't care what the party won. No character was pleasant or even able to give his sympathy. <br /> <br /> The plus side of the entertainment between Annie and Bobby was a somewhat spooky dialogue and overall action was well done.
