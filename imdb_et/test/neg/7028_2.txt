This movie could have been a lot better than it was if it hadn't been Disney Film. I thought the young girl who played Shirley was all right, you can say she's really trying to do that job. The young Shirley temple wasn't right at all. I think they should have spent their last childhood, the first hour should have been with Shirley, the last hour would have been older Shirley. It was a boring film, not the story of a good Shirley temple.
