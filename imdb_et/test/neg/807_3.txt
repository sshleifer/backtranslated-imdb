Arthur Hunnicutt has a very stereotypical role as a mountain man (probably Ozarks) who is hunting for his favorite dog. But the dog seems to be drowning when Hunnicutt jumps after him. Soon it turns out that despite the fact that Hunnicutt and his dog are moving out of the water when they both died in the water, no one talks to them and sees and hears people talking about his and his dog's death. However, it is strange that Hunnicutt is really slow, and he will take him for a while to understand that they are talking about him! I think it was really a cushion, because there was not enough material to fill half an hour. <br /> <br /> Later, in "surprise", he comes to heaven - or at least his place concept. He's been invited, but because they don't let the dogs, he has other ideas! In general, well-behaved, but with dubious spiritual value! Without twist or irony, this episode is a bit boring - not "Twilight Zone-y" to my taste.
