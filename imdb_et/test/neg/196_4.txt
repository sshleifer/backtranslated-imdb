I liked the films of Milos Forman because I saw "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "Amadeus" (Two Great Masterpieces), but when I saw "Hair", I wondered if it was Milos Forman. This movie is boring and less interesting. OK, the music is pretty good, but on the screen it looks like it's just stunned people (wait a minute ... that's what it really is!). In fact, the only interesting part and the only part where Milos talent appears is in the last 15 minutes (SPOILER !!) as Berger takes Claude as a soldier for the Vietnam War. It takes 15 minutes and is well targeted, but it is a shame that we must endure so much terrible material before that. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe this is one of the films you have to be "enjoying (the theme is marijuana, acid, and other drugs that the film worships).
