The idea of ​​this movie was great. The story of little girls who have been abused (both emotional and physical) and are trying to survive and survive. What makes a movie break is the terrible use of voice transmissions and brilliant dialogue. Participants must bring out the clearest things over and over again. There is also a very annoying, almost funny use of metaphors in voice transmissions. The highest point is the little girl. Nice to try, but it's a stink.
