To get started, I didn't see The Grudge's vision. The previews of this movie didn't jump on me, didn't scare me or amused me. But when a group of friends asked me to go to Grudge 2, I accepted the invitation, a little curious about how it would be. I went mainly for friends. Not even 5 minutes to this movie, I realized I threw $ 7.50. Escape service is terrible. At first, schoolgirls look like they never did in their lives. Then take the film picture. Let me tell you that I couldn't laugh at this movie. It's just so stupid. I'm pretty sure they were trying to scare it. They do not jump or do anything. It shows the kids, then shows them "attacking". It is based on this, it is not a "sudden" thing. And even in the middle of the movie, the core of the movie, the actor is still terrible. This leaves so much time between the dialog that someone adds to their comments. This movie is honestly one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Poorly written, terrible acting, terrible script, terrible "impossible to act" and terrible concept. The movie goes out and changes situations more than you think. Ultimately, each part plays at the end of the movie and then binds. I never pay to see this movie. I wouldn't even have looked at this cable for free. This movie is a joke. DON'T ATTENTION your money on this movie !!
