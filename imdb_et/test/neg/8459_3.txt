A nonsense and pretty silly film, which is essentially a summary of horror, science fiction and temporary films. There are unnecessary shots for the audience watching videos and Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen are members of the audience who turn to the camera to explain why we love horror films. It's not a bad idea, but all the explanations are obvious ("the horror of the movie helps us deal with a real horror", "you are in the theater with the grace of a filmmaker") and quite trite. Staples are also shown very quickly and the changes are sort of wrinkling. And if they are out of context, these bits are not very scary at all. And this is REAL short - I saw it in the theater in 1984 and I was outraged that I paid $ 5.00 for an 84-minute movie! <br /> <br /> However, it is relatively well edited and Allen and Pleasance seem to enjoy themselves. For people who are interested in finding out more about terror, it can be fun and interesting. But if you're a spooky fan (like me), it's probably boring. Good idea, poor performance (not intended). I'll give her 3.
