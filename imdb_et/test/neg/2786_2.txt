I woke up and it was a beautiful day; the sun was shining, the birds were singing and I saw a movie, something new, a horror movie? Like many other reviewers, I met what can only be described as a gold box poop. The front cover is large and the back side is mesmerizing - "it frightens the harvest from you" ... oh, how do I look back at ridicule and ignorance. <br /> <br /> One of the films that this film is worse is the skills of these "actors". I think not, I really enjoyed it as those "bumblebees" who wore some classic costume costumes. I drove quite quickly from past corn fields because I found they were scary at night, but after seeing this movie, I almost noticed (laughing so much) just on the horizon. <br /> <br /> I have seen the scarier omelette fairly honestly, not mine, I'm a natural hand in making omelets, and when somebody binds this movie to my omelette, let's just say that they would be forced to watch this movie three times in a row. <br /> <br /> If someone has good corn (crop) movies they recommend, please let me know. It's a great comedy, if nothing else, OK, it's nothing else. Enjoy, but little advice - before you press the play button on the DVD player, throw it out of the window.
