Wow! This movie is almost too bad for words. Of course, the writers wanted to associate it somehow with the Ghoulies franchise, so they got Pete Liapine first, who repeated his role as Jonathan ... only now, he is a cop and has no similar traits as the first. . Ghoulies in this are not ghoulies of the last. Cheap looking dolls have been replaced with even smaller costume costumes. Rather than being one of the major antagonists or being evil, they are rather comic relief characters that for some reason appeared for some reason. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the movie, it seemed like I had seen it before. Why was that? Because it's all stolen from another movie. All cheesy police lines and action scenes were Lethal Weapon. Ghoulies were pretty much like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, except they were not at all fun. Even the scenes of the original Ghoulies movie were sprinkled on this flick. <br /> <br /> I think the target group should have been an adult, but there is no blend of black magic, cartoon, police and bad deeds. work at all. I hope they don't make Ghoulies V because I don't want the film studio to lose their money. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 78 minutes. R for violence.
