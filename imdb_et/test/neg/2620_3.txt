Now this is a movie I really don't like. It is one of the most boring films of the 90's, mainly because it starts slowly and at the center of a boring atmosphere. The settings are not even attractive to the eye and are not suitable for film purposes. <br /> <br /> Dolls look really joyful, not in a good way like Puppet Master 80. What did they do with our favorite toys?! <br /> <br /> The story is flat, not interesting, and NOT really explaining the malicious origin of the dolls. There are no death scenes like in the previous movies and f / x are terrible. <br /> <br /> I felt asleep when I first observed it, so I can recommend it to insomniacs.
