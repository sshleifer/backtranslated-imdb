This movie is that it's the worst film I've ever seen, and the only movie I've ever given from 10 out of 10 imdb. I was disappointed by the rent due to cool H.R. This cover art is the only thing that is the least good of a little vaporizing pile. <br /> <br /> It was about frat-boys who were fighting in the strange, but not least interesting, apocalyptic world. Cities are ruins / chaos, but probably the suburbs are a safe and wonderful place where young men can threaten other men's braindead frat organizations. It makes the lemon all the time losing the most uninspiring performances in my list with boring characters, not just the special effects, the harsh, original landscapes, and generally the extremely poor quality of all production aspects. <br /> <br /> Final Price: 1/10 I want to give it to zero. <br /> <br /> Noob Aalox
