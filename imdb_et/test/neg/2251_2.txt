I am sorry, but I have to say that I really do not understand that seeing this movie creates enormous feelings ... <br /> <br /> When I saw it, I looked at my clock to know how much I had to spend more time with this kindergarten. <br /> <br /> So why does this decision fall? <br /> <br /> First of all, the movie tells a story that doesn't give any excitement! We didn't even know that the reality of Quentin Tarantino was a lot of fun. This story could have come out of every little head of the son. There's nothing intelligent about it, neither inventive nor sense ... the story is relevant in about 30 minutes. The rest are just terribly improved scenes that should leave some cool picture. Not working. Even before, cuts that Tarantino often uses are just confusing and not cool. Second: some men go to Germany and kill the Nazis. Ah really? Do they do? The only Nazis they killed were a handful of boys, one of whom was enough to die rather than betrayal of his companions. Is it a ugly face Tarantino wanted to give the Nazis? A bold soldier who is bolder than any "basterds"? Definitely not -> Can't And What Happens to the Dreadful Nazi Killing with Bastards? The Nazis are killing everyone except two who are taken hostages -> wow, what terrible revengeful monsters they are ... <br /> <br /> Third: All the characters? Yes one! The only role and hope of the whole film is Chritoph Waltz, who is building a really deep and very detailed character here. Great action! Brad Pitt really sucks and Waltz is totally out of action. Never had Pitt ever seen such weakness ... And the rest? Well, some Germans you never saw and never see. When the movie started and I saw seven basterd groups, I was hoping to see something like "Magnificent Seven": a group of extraordinary boys, each with a special character, doing its fate with fearlessness and unknown ... I was very disappointed when I saw " inglourious Basterds. No details at all, signs, real men, but some random men you don't remember, who wasn't given the chance to differentiate ... But you don't even have to distinguish, cause "Inglourious Basterds" except Pitt plays in this movie hardly a role ... <br /> <br /> So I was really disappointed and seeing this movie in # 40 is the only thing in the biggest movies of all time that leaves me open ...
