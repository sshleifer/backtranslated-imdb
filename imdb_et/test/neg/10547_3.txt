It is by far the worst series of toxicity. Working in Tokyo is terrible and can be understood for about half the time. The main problem with this film is the sudden change in the original. As here is another girl friend, it can be of the same character with a different name and played by another chick. Why is this movie like a Disney movie. After about fifteen minutes, it begins to work well with everything. There are 2 awesome killings, then the movie goes straight to the poop. After the movies there is 20 minutes of movie entertainment. H * LL IS EXCESSIVE. Well, if your drunk doesn't watch this movie. You warned me.
