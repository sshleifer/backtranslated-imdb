This movie would be quite easy to do: a girl who is a North Korean spy will be having fun but will survive. He who is on his brain is so long for knowledge and sex. He doesn't recognize him when he goes off with George W. Bush's cloned finger in his wallet, which is the key to unlocking the ability to use nuclear weapons. Just call it a romp and at least some people show the theater. I'm not sure how much he saw this four-year film when it opened in New York last April, but I sincerely hope not many. It sounds like a light and playful paddle flick, but it has art-house complaints and it's really just very boring. Many pink films have been successful in the past in their artistic endeavors, but the endeavors of this film change the time between sexual scenes. And then sex scenes aren't even good! I've seen shameful things in black Japanese films. I've never seen this country bring something that is dull to this sex. The Spice Channel is more creative. The only film in this film is the body of the leading actor Emi Kuroda. Otherwise, it is pure torture.
