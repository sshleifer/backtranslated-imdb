An epic story of hope, limited by budget and limited artistic ambition. I saw Terrence Malick producing it, I was expecting something strange and lyrical. Instead, we get typical Norwegian co-production ("Revolution" with Al Pacino, anyone?), Where - quite likely - good intentions are intimidated by the terrible scenario and where many characters are reduced to stereotypes. The "Me-Tarzan-you-Jane" English dialogue between non-English speaking protagonists is particularly noteworthy? might have speculated whether Nick Nolte and Tim Roth were their own because they almost sound like real people. The story is unlikely: Binh is supposed to speak English when he has lived his entire life as a peasant slave (his vocabulary, but unfortunately not a grammatical command, increases impressively in Malay's refugee camp, without the benefit of night classes). The coincidence is great; I do not know if an hour or two has edited the first third: he is following his mother in Ho Chi Minh City almost immediately - after thirty years younger brother, who recognizes him! Mom gives her a golden medallion (or something that is very valuable), but it has never been mentioned. His relationship with the "We Dead Inside" Link should provide a mandatory "love interest", but feels like Leonardo and Cameron in "New York's Gangs". <br /> <br /> The boat's rust bucket gives you a sense of the terrible conditions that human trafficking means. Indeed, the only time a movie is far from exciting and unpredictable is a shiny, hand-recorded film that has been shot on the bridge during weather conditions. (By the way, a cruise from Malaysia via New York through Good Hope and African coast, without stopping fuel or equipment, is definitely an epic journey). The beautiful image of the New York City skyline is reflected in the magic hour of Malick, but I want to know why the Coast Guard did not appear. Maybe they watched Super Bowl or something. Of course, Binh will be able to push his blind old farmer far away from Texas, with the same navigation slide he displayed in Ho Chi Minh City. I was impressed how Nick Nolte could climb around the excavation fields and feed the horses on a large beach without a guide dog or a white stick. To show how the story can be structured and deducted from the events for refugees, look at Michael Winterbottom's much better "In the World".
