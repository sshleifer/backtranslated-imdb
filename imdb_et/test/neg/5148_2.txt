***** Spoiler Ahead ***** <br /> <br /> I think you shouldn't expect much for a TV movie, but it was a bad thing, but the plot was a good idea, but it was badly done, not the actor was especially good. And the end of the movie was just terrible. The main character was completely normal during the movie and suddenly, when we learned that he was a killer, he just becomes a psychopathic mental challenge. This is totally pathetic. <br /> <br /> There is only one reason to watch this movie, Yasmin Bleeth, though we haven't seen her before the swimsuit? Don't even bother with wasting time if you want the film's beauty contest world, then look at "Drop Dead Gorgeous," it's just an infinite number of times better.
