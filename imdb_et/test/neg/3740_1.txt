I do not understand why people love this example so much. My friend is watching this and because I like sci-fi, I tried to watch because the plot of the show sounds promising, but in fact it's really a very boring show. The only thing that keeps you awake during this show is the CGI effects of video games and the full use of cups. Note that I call it muppet because they actually look like a muppet, not like the aliens they should be. <br /> <br /> Talking about it; Muppet and make-up effects are terribly superfluous in this show. You have the man who could best be described as an alien / dwarf hybrid, you have a pale girl who looks like a cheesy vamp-girl, you have a floating potty mouth-frog ... It just feels very unnecessary and besides, that you feel confused about the whole astronaut lost. <br /> <br /> Each episode is too independent. The creators of this exhibition directed it so that every episode seems almost an entire other exhibition. At least until you see the headlines / cups again, that means. The whole plot of basic education to get back to the ground is so much that it collides with the background. Operation is also quite bad. Conclusion: If you want good sci-fi, just look elsewhere. In my opinion, it is not even a real sci-fi, because the show is aimed at more fantasy elements with all the doll products and strange dreams. And if you just want to see the cups, then I suggest you look at the Muppet Show and I am glad that this show has ended. <br /> <br /> By the way; Does anyone have dejavu with the concept of a living spaceship? Ohyeah thats right; Doctor Who Started This Concept Almost 30 Years ago! This exhibition is like a collection of "sci-fi" residues. Scripts and events that were abandoned for good reason had to be taken up by this terrible exhibition.
