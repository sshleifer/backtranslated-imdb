The highly forgotten monster movie of the 1950s offers truly terrific special effects - this "claw" is a giant doll that would make Jim Henson kill himself. I saw the movie last Thursday and I can't even tell who it was. It's a bad sign. I have said that when the premiere of the film smiled at the audience, it was in the 50s when the special effects standards were much smaller. Basically I should have stepped out of the theater as soon as the words "Sam Katzman produced" came on the screen when I knew what was good for me, but then I also sat through Harum Scarum, so I think I'll do it.
