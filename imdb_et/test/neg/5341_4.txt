"Black Friday" made this plot so much better, so remember and "two-life man" is just a forgotten potboiler. "Shed No Tears" was the title of the work, and it would have been better because he had a profound character on most films. <br /> <br /> Philip Bennett has just been involved when he's in traffic. accident. Dr. Clark (Edward Keene) has been involved in some experimental operations with animals - they have come back from the dead. Her colleagues are calling her to try her out on Phillip, who is dead. When working, a dangerous criminal, Wolf Panino, goes to the electric chair and the transit of the soul. When Phillip awakens from surgery, he has a Panino soul. He's become a man, he's rude to his family and starts hanging around Panino's old ghosts. He takes over Wolf's old gang - after Philip Bennett's name, who is a former romantic Wolf girlfriend - who smells like a rat. Bennett, like Wolf, has even decided to raise the score and begin to eliminate his enemies. The bodies are piling up, including a girlfriend and a cop, and she will fall victim to her own family. <br /> <br /> But - I hate these "bad dreams" movies - you always feel down. This film would have been better if he had survived as Panino and if he had finally fired. His wife, Eleanor, would have gotten worse, but smarter with her brother. The star, Edward Norris, was in a big career mainly in B movies. <br /> <br /> Not really recommended.
