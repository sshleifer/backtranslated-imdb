From English accents to violent violence. Showing a murderer to Moses. People who really believe in the Old Testament are sitting there and shaking their heads. I'm not a religious person at all. But even when I felt that the writers of this film would try to change us all against God and the Jews. I wanted a stone for writers. I can't believe that day and age that Hallmark and ABC (Disney) would try to show such garbage. Do we have enough problems in this world?
