Sherlock Holmes and the secret weapon start in Switzerland, as the world's leading detective Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) crosses the Nazis & succeeds in smuggling the excellent scientist Dr. Franz Tobeli (William Post Jr.) out of the country and relative safety in London. But is London as safe as Holmes? Dr Tobel has created a revolutionary new bomb vision that will change the air bombardment forever and he has agreed to give it to the British government, but these Nazis want it to be just as bad and Holmes arch enemy professor Moriarty (Lionel Atwill) plans to steal the bombing secret and selling to the Nazis. Add Scotland Yard Inspirational Inspector Lestrade (Denis Hoey), Dr. Tobel's Love Of Interest to Charlotte Eberl (Kaaren Verne), Assassins, Mysterious Scientists, and Mysterious Encoded Message, and Holmes has cut his job to keep Dr Tobel alive so he can deliver his bomb sight ... <br /> <br /> Director Roy William Neill Sherlock Holmes and the secret weapon were four of the fourteen Holmes movie series from 1939 to 1946 to play Rathbone & Bruce as Holmes & Watson. The script by Edward T. Lowe Jr., Scott Darling and Edmund L. Hartmann is based on the short "The Dancing Men" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and is not the tradition that Holmes murders in mystery because it is more of a war-time adventure story. Regardless of what Holmes is all about, solving complicated crimes and mysteries is a big mistake as far as I'm concerned and the inclusion of Nazis and War as a background for the story seems inappropriate, uncomfortable, and simply not I don't sit well with me. The dialogue is not great, Professor Moriarty feels as if he was able to come up with a scoop and it is much less involved than others in the series. But at least it is short. <br /> <br /> Director Neill does his usual effective work, but you have to cut it a bit and remember it was done over 60 years ago. It has no real style or imagination and no atmosphere or intrigue. <br /> <br /> Technically, this movie, if it is remarkable, is a black and white cinematic film, although I understand that a colorful color version is also available. It's okay, Bruce & Hoey does his usual comic relief, and Rathbone's hairstyle is ridiculous and I'm glad he made it into later installments. <br /> <br /> Sherlock Holmes and the secret weapon were a disappointment Compared to some other great series, there is very little I recommend doing this, and everything that made it so good seems to be missing here. Leave it at last and look at some of the better ones for the dead hard fans first.
