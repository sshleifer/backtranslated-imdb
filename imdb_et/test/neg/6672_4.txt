Well done, yes. Very well, I have to say, though I'm not talking about Chezck. Nice cinematography. But the script is flat, really flat. Predictable soap opera where you know exactly what happens. OK, maybe the end isn't as predictable, but is it good? It's one of those movies that you feel you've already seen and forgotten in the day. <br /> <br /> I just received a note from IMDb that my comment was not long enough. It's really sad because I have no idea what else to say about this movie, what really says a lot about it, don't you think? The thing is ... It has no soul or originality. Compare this movie with Barrio or Riff Raff, who has come more than ten years ago (or an extraordinary recently released child). It is sad to see that this is a much worse film.
