Busty Beauty Stacie Randall plays with PVC-covered, bad ass bitch Alexandra, Faust's faithful acolytic, hell trapped in an evil unit. Being confident that he will release his master, a malicious minx will be broken in stock to steal the magic pearl that is essential to his success; but at the same time as the attendant's ritual of calling Faust, the silly mare accidentally enters the pentagram that he has drawn onto the floor, resulting in the release of the pearl and the release of two little, troll-like creatures, Lite and Dark. / Alexandre must now find a substitute building that is not easy: the only other stone that makes the trick is her former lover, police detective Jonathan Graves (Peter Liapis) around the neck. ) who is investigating the abduction of a warehouse and who knows only too well what bad Alexandra can do. In the meantime, the interdimensional interdimensional interstices, Lite and Dark, get into any difficulty when trying to return home. <br /> <br /> In Jim Wynorski's twisted film world, all women are big breasted babes with cheap whore fashion sense. Ghoulies IV is no exception: every woman in this movie - whether she is a police captain, an old curator or a mental patient in a shelter - is hot, hot, hot and does not carry much, and that is the fact it would otherwise make a completely non-slip CTV crap almost unsuitable . <br /> <br /> But be warned, although the presence of semi-hard quality gravel makes it easier to do, there is still a lot of this movie. justify that it is labeled as an ordeal: the actor is wood and the dialogue is painful; Black humor (as described on the DVD disc) is about as funny as the knee, so that comics are comedic catchers of Lite and Dark; and special effects are a favorable basement that consists of rubber creatures and visual effects that would have looked ten years earlier. <br /> <br /> 3/10 only for the high bimbo divider.
