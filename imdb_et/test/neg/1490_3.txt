I found the old version of the VHS movie in my parents' house, so I thought I'd pass it on. From the beginning, I didn't expect much of this movie, and I'm glad about it because generally the film wasn't good. <br /> <br /> The overall was very bad, even for Nicolas Cage's movie. One scene with a radio controller seems so pathetic that I found it fun not to cut the scene. In the first 30 minutes of the movie, there was almost no developed plot and I didn't know what was going on. <br /> <br /> The story itself was a chance to be decent, but whether the director was just bad or too hard to put his unique touch on the style of the film. I managed to look at the whole thing, but I will probably never see this movie.
