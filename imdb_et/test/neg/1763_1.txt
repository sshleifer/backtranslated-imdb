Critics fall over Weinstein's sphere of influence to commend this ugly, misleading and repulsive adaptation of the lyrical novel on which it is based. The ham-fisted direction of the Minghella threatening and gently episodic odyssey is one of many mistakes in this "civil-war love story". Are they kidding? After Mrs Kidman and Mr. Law meet with a small screen chemistry in a small town in North Carolina and steal a kiss before the end of the war, the souvenir of Jude and his photographs, which he has left behind, is a two-hour test of kidneying whether he lives a lot deaths to reunite with your soul player. Who cares? Philip S. Hoffman's amateur-style chewing out of the nasty and uncomfortable role talks about the appearance of Renee Zelweger as a corn-feeding dynamo, who crushes miraculously Kidman's lonely farm on the scene to save the day. Rarely is the performance screaming "look at me, I act". His shameful nerve awakens for a few minutes, until the winch is painfully thin. Miramax strategically released Oscar and Golden Globe (which is a farce), Weinsteins probably has a critical community with Dick Clark and won 8 Globe candidates for their crowded failure. The resulting crime is that prizes have become meaningless and small, less powerful PR-driven films become hidden. Cold Mountain is a concept film and a waste of bitter time. Cold really !!!
