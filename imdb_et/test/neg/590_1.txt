2001 is one of those films where, if you do not like it, it is said that you do not get it and you have to look at the deeper meaning and symbolism. You are told that you have a clear slow focus and just want to see sex, explosions and hit the ground. </p> <p> </p> Three minutes of darkness, something that sounds like a dying hippo in the background. Then we get the opening credit. One minute from Savannah's exciting picture. Then piles of monkeys find a black stone and start killing things with bones. Cut the first of the 20-minute ships that do things while the blue Danube plays in the background. A lot of meaningless dialogue and one month of scientists find another monolith. <br /> <br /> Cut a space ship that is too long for a crew member - three sleeping people, two Dave and Frank, who are just a little more personality than hibernating. And then the HAL, the "perfect" supercomputer that drives the ship. Predictably, he clicks and starts breaking the first robotics law. Now it has something. An evil, cold-ruthless supermodel who controls the surrounding environment and can predict your every move. And what does he do? He lets one man swim into space and turns off the hibernation equipment so that three sleeping bags die, leaving Dave in the swimming pond. He just uses an air cap, puts a space pipe and turns HAL out - agonizing slowly. Then, apparently, Jupiter has a psychedelic "evolution". <br /> <br /> Here is a movie that has been paused: Apes see the monolith, kill things. Scientists find the moon monolith. HAL kills people. HAL dies; Dave gets a preloaded message and develops Jupiter. <br /> <br /> It's not me that I can't. It's boring for tears that are completely empty. Of course, this is realistic, but I think I have no reason to care. No matter what the message is, no movie can be good without entertainment. Frankly, every sign could be replaced with Keanu Reeves and nothing would change.
