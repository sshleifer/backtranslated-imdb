I was disappointed with the third movie "Death Wish" and didn't recommend it if you didn't actually go to Bronson. He's his usual in it, maybe a little lighter than others; the rest is good if you watch the movie of the week - the whole movie has a product A bad episode and I like the show's presentation like the A team, but not on the big screen, even if it's an action movie that doesn't say it's more complicated. The film takes time to go, and when it finally ends, it goes to the point of ridicule. The plot is something of a "Highway to Heaven" episode, and Bronson seems to be the fish outflow by most older people, and playing weapons is so controlled that Bronson's revenge can't even get bad guys. Skip it and continue to the fourth part I highly recommend.
