Aubrey Davis (Amber Tamblyn) travels to Tokyo to investigate the mysterious disappearance of his sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellari) and came into the same mysterious curse that has killed so many people. With another group, he tries to solve and cease the curse. <br /> <br /> Grudge 2 rehashes everything from the first and only creates a few fears. The first Grudge was the best film. The assumption was decent, but the action was wood and some scenes were really ridiculous. Grudge 2 is even more stupid and less frightening than the original. Also, Scary Movie 4 has made these movies almost impossible, and it was difficult for me to keep a straight face during "scary scenes", which should encourage more than fear. How Takashi Shimizu confused his franchise was inexplicable, but he managed to create a decent atmosphere. Unfortunately, he kept the movie slowly with a series of tense characters and flat intimidation tactics. It's clear that he made this movie for the money and I'm glad it failed. The scenario was pretty bad, mainly because it didn't make sense and they didn't develop characters at all. There were three different stories in the film and each of them was somehow related to "mercy". The connections were weak and a number of people were killed for no real reason. They didn't explain the rules of the curse very well and ended up with a blood bath because everyone died, even though the PG-13 rating was interesting, so even some death scenes were flat. The dialogue was weak and none of the characters were pleasant or developed enough to really take care of it. <br /> <br /> The actor was on an equal footing and was much worse than the first. Amber Tamblyn was a tedious tree. She moved very slowly on the screen and all her emotions seemed fake. Sarah Michelle Gellar was fine, though she just had a coat. Jennifer Beals gave the best result, had a few good scenes and was effective. Arielle Kebbel was okay, little tear. The rest were either terrible or just too forgotten. In general, Grudge 2 was a disappointing sequel. It didn't have a lot of things and it's not worth watching. Rating 4/10
