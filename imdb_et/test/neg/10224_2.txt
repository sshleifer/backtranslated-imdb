This movie seems to have been made just to distract me. All I hate about movies is: fake sentimentality, extreme horror, bad child actors and more. It ignores the fact that it represents the extreme ignorance of American sporting events, many of them claiming that football is a lemon. What ?! It's a rugby ball. The story follows a group that has no hope of receiving a new teacher whom they want (who randomly teaches the class in a short skirt) and receive them against football. Of course, they are all garbage (don't forget they are not lotus) except for one child who has moved to El Paso. Blah Blah, etc. etc. And the children still do not become good football players, but a good heart is created and knives in the lottery do not change a lot of round children. Hell, even adults start to go around; drunks have become a caring parent, illegal immigrants are let out of the hook ... calm. <br /> <br /> This movie star Steve Guttenberg. Now, before you leave your local video store to copy, hold it for one minute. Guttenberg is a garbage. No no; Come on, let's face it, how was this guy ever in the movie? I have absolutely no idea and there is no idea in this film. The letters of Olivia d'Abo are not included alongside Steve. He just seems to be in motion and beautiful when he does it. Although I have no problems with the latest parts; his action does not let the movie credit. Children's actors who make up the rest are just as bad as waiting for such a movie. Most of them are disgusting and / or annoying and do not make any pleasant viewing. The film has a goat who plays a mascot and does a good job; but you wouldn't see a movie for a goat, so don't bother to see that movie.
