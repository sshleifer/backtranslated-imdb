I could no longer agree. The book is one of Dean Koontz's best novels and this movie is a complete traverse. I looked about half of it, then threw the tape in the trash. I have no idea what an idiotic director thought to do this chick, but I'd rather stick my eyes sharply than watch this useless movie again! All this movie is just wrong. First of all, the main character from the former sea becomes a high school KID. WHY ??? Secondly, in her life, love becomes a movie for her mother! huh I bet Freud has something to say! LOL. The dog is cute and the best in the movie and it's all the others! They are also played by the main character who helps them in the book. There is really nothing to say about the movie except that it is relatively short for at least one and a half hours. If no one has seen the movie yet, we do it ourselves! READ THE BOOK! It is so much better than this waste of worthless time!
