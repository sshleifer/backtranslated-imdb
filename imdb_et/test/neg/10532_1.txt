Every time and then some amateurs come out with tired action movies. it's just so wrong, I don't think I even need to comment on plot, actors, scripts, camera work. because he has nothing! If a muscle guy makes a cool leather jacket to walk slowly and throw a funky rap song, the main ingredient that makes a great action film is say actionon movie !!
