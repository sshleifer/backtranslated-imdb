<br /> <br /> I still can't believe Louis Gossetti Jr to participate in the movie. Everything about this move seems artificial, forced and natural. Air ducts are flat. Enemy characters seem to be dolls. It's just a bad excuse for the movie. At least Top Gun had air ducts that seemed good (external images anyway). Queen's songs are cool. Instead, rent a Midway.
