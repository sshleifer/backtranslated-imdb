There are rumors that the fourth underworld is happening. If so, the third part, which is also a prequel, would be in the middle of a franchise. With pre-formatted pre-forms, you always ask yourself in what order to watch movies, so it makes sense ... <br /> <br /> In this case, I think it's not that important. The third Underworld movie is not equal to the other two parts. They also had obvious mistakes, but it doesn't have a few things and it seems to be cash. It does not seem to go to full throttle, which is shameful because the actors are sure they could have used better material. <br /> <br /> The story is OK, but it's not special. Nice movie, but Rhona Mitra could not fill Beckinsale's shoes (yes, she plays another character, I mean blank that Kate B. left) ...
