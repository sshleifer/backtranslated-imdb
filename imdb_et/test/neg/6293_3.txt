1 review 1/1/2003 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Henri Verneuil): A sober drama of a well-functioning physician who gets into trouble communicating with a younger woman whose family lives with them they are married to the same household. Finding his happiness is not clear, but they bring out the cause of his accident quite well, showing the woman's line in his wife's line. Well played but predictable drama.
