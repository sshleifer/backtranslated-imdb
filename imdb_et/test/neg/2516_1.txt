Luchino Visconti was and is one of the most influential cultural figures of his generation, but Adam Low (director of the case) gives Helmut Berger a stronger voice! How is it? What's left! We come out of this challenge, knowing less about what made the Master a great and more thing that should not be cared for at all. Beautiful images belong to the world of Visconti, the embarrassing interviews with Berger and Zeffirell-like small small world of Adam Low. Must be avoided!
