Does the film's writer see the other three? I loved the original, I thought 2 was the best, I tolerated 3 (it was OK, something special). But I hated it. Who dare they kill UG? It was certainly not Ug who was almost like Charlie's brother number 2. Remember your speech? Charlie said, "You don't just leave me on Earth, do you?" Ug replied, "Charlie, Bounty Hunter," saying he is now one of them. How dare the writers dare to ignore this special bond between them and make him a merciful man who gets Charlie's death (especially into an awkward scene) simply because they realize that the film is boring. In fact, in the first 20 minutes, we get a new story and we have to wait for that long until we explain again what happened to Charli, the hero we saw. I was still expecting to say, "Come on now when Charlie's coming?" Angela Basset must do her best to deny that she was once in Turkey. Moving to the future avoids the possibility of seeing the original cast or our time. I think the writers decided that their film was the last and they could do what they wanted. This movie is in the very first two two times. And it didn't even look like it was written by the same people who made the 3rd at least 3 humor and what younger children could easily see. 4 is simply ugly and mean-looking (Eric DaRe) is particularly cruel and unnecessary. I hated this movie. Hated, hated, hated it. I hated that someone might like it and I hated the fact that it destroyed the classic of my favorite camps. I'm just gonna give this one a start just because IMDb.com doesn't let me give up.
