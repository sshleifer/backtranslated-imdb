I have to highlight this by saying that I love watching bad movies that are fun. This movie gives 100%. It's hands down the worst movie I've ever seen. It's full of crappy stock footage in town for casual things (people walking, traffic, silhouette, etc.) that don't associate anything. Then the "sex scenes" are too long. These include lots of pampering and frequent rubbing of the socks on each other's bodies. They are by no means erotic and are the most frightening thing in this movie. This is especially true of a shower room where two so-called "barely legal" girls, who cannot be over 40, are spraying each other with blood, but there is also a team member who throws blood from outside when one of the girls smiles at him. No one had to remember any features of this film unless they were clearly reading the cards, they had a magazine in front of them, where they were watching when they were fighting through an awkward dialogue. Then there is Mr Creepo. He throws Ed Wood's name around as he can compare, but he is far from that quality. He walks around the cemetery, which speaks about the random things that went wrong in the film, which really helps the total lack of flow that the film has already gone through. We could not stop laughing at this movie (except during sexual scenes where we were challenged and occasionally terrified) for a terrible movie.
