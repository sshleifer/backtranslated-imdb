Academy Award Actor Sidney Poitier from "The Lilly Field" reiterates his role as Lieutenant Virgil Tibbsi in 1967 for winning the best picture of "The Night's Heat" of the Oscar winning "Veteran Leader Gordon Douglas". "No one has Rod Steiger equivalent to exchange with. It is clear that both" Bullitt "screenwriter Alan R. Trustman and Robert D. Webb" Cape Fear "had put their predictive police procedure out of the gambler. Not interesting, not even the main suspect. Nothing far from exciting, frothy or surprising will happen in this tantrum. Meanwhile, things have changed a lot since Virgil was last seen in the "Night of the Heat." MISTER Tibbs ", our hero is working in the San Francisco Police Department. Moreover, he has a wife Valerie (Barbara McNair," Habit Change ") and a family, a young rebel son Andy (George Spell" The Naked Kiss ") and a younger daughter, Ginger (Wanda Spell) "Hickey and Boggs") Tibbs are traveling with an average blue Mustang and his wife is holding the house and pulling over his two children because he doesn't have it i spend a lot of time with them. In the literal sense of the word, there is no surprise to the murders of pedestrians. Indeed, the best thing "They call me MISTER Tibbs" is Quincy Jones' excellent orchestral work, which has a memorable opening theme, more memorable than this forgotten criminal thriller, which was wrong. <br /> <br /> Everything starts with a sensational, troubled prostitute, Joy Sturges (Linda Towne's The Adventurers), who has been seen dead by an attacker in her downtown apartment. Apartment master Mealie Williamson (Juano Hernandez, "Intruder in the Dust") enters Joy's apartment and finds a bloody forehead dead. He picks up the statue briefly and then puts it back on the floor and informs Joy's death apartment commander Rice Weedon (Anthony Zerbe's "License to Kill") and Weedon gives Mealie and a few dollars and sends him the pack. Later, Weedon reported anonymously to SFPD that popular Minister Logan Sharpe (Martin Landau "Nevada Smith") beat Joy's death and seemed to leave Joy's apartment. Captain Marden (Jeff Corey "True Grit") orders Tibbesi to resolve the case; it seems that both Tibbs and Sharpe have known each other for 18 years. Of course, Tibbin's wife Valerie cannot believe that a well-known, politically active evangelist could have committed such a crime. Just to give the film context, it should be noted that when Tibbs and the police investigate the crime scene, they mention the word 'sperm', a controversial term, undoubtedly mentioned in the film of the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> Tibbin Questions Weedon, whom he suspects, is a driving force or a pimp. Weedon explains that he has no information about Joy Sturges because he has rented an apartment from another real estate company. Tibbs visits the real estate company and real estate agent Woody Garfield (Ed Anser of "JFK") escapes and drives off, making essentially O.J. Simpson until he's after a long but tedious pursuit interrupts his car. If Tibbs proves that Woody did not kill Joy, he allows him to leave his satisfied wife, Marge ("Penelope's Norma Crane"), who is ready to file a divorce after revelation that he paid prostitution to stay in the apartment <br /> < br /> Tibbs follows the handyman Mealie and cleans him of the crime and then goes after Weedon. Fortunately, our hero, Tibb, is trying to evil in the middle of the Weedon drug deal. One of Weedon's henchmen attacked Tibbes, but Tibbs leaves him shortly before he starts a long footing after Weedon. Finally, he runs in the underground garage of Weedon and lets them out. Guess who wins. <br /> <br /> Tibbide household scenes are more interesting than exploring. Andy runs rampant, her sister striking and smoking in the garden. Our hero wants him to clean his room. When Andy refuses, Tibbs opens the jaw three times. These childhood scenes could never be treated today, as they were in 1970. At the end of the film, as if the family queued up, Tibbs was seen with a wife and children. Valerie and Virgil are at odds with the well-being of their children and the effects of their long working hours. <br /> <br /> Director Gordon Douglas leads competently. Surprisingly, the filmmakers did not play a competition card for the film released in 1970. In one scene, when Tibbs is looking for an African-American billiards room, we see racing with the hero when he finds Mealie and leaves with a tow. <br /> <br /> Total, "They call me Mister Tibbsi" is a bad follow-up to "In the Heat of Night". Keep in mind that Poitier offers a subtle yet subtle result, but everyone sees it as prefabricated. All kits are fake and there is no physical violence: one underground car park that won't last long and fight. Jones' endless jazz score, the only surprise and really does not qualify as a big surprise, what is a comfortable attitude? Donald Medford's "Organization" followed the second, more packed sequel of "They Call Me Mister Tibbsi".
