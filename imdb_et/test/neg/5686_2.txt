This movie was rented for free, I had no misconception that it was a very bad movie. I rented it for Thanksgiving because we eat turkey and then the family is watching a terrible movie. So you ask what makes this movie so bad that you gave it only 2 stars? Dialogue. The lack of dialogue makes this film ideal for deaf people. In fact, if you rent it, turn the volume to zero and put any heavy metal CD out of your favorite artist. I know you enjoy it better. The plot of this holiday turkey was both technically loaded and the geek needs a narrative translator. Now for all people who enjoy good sci-fi effects ... they are not much better than video game trailers or worse in cut situations. Both actors, neither of them, need not look at it either. They don't say much about the whole movie. Many technical aspects make you laugh like a scene where a hero straps a rocket and burns it in a town 70 km away (it never showed how it landed). Before we see that there is a girl with a cannon fire robot at 12 meters, she leaves several frames. It is also said that the political division between the antagonist and the protagonist is biotechnology (genetically improved people) vs. cyber technology (machine-enhanced people), but both seem to be cyber or enlarged people. What told me that this was a bad movie from a rental store was a cover that looked like a video game coat and there was only one copy, and good new releases have many copies.
