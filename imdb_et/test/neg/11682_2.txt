Hmmm, not the patch of the original Shaw Brothers. The struggle is average and seems a great trick. The story is expected from the 70s Kung Fu films that are confusing and embarrassing. For women, foolish voices called men in English. I turned it off early and I love martial arts flicks. Get the original, its so much better than this average movie, don't be fooled, I bought the wrong flick that I wanted Shaw's brothers. I just started commenting, I'm just making foreign and martial arts movies, it's just the beginning of my movie collection. I hope you don't waste time looking at it, just for the 70s Kung Fu fans.
