Since 2002, the Dutch cinema has finally improved. This film is still part of the bad school period of the Dutch cinema. <br /> <br /> The story has been unnecessarily talked about in flashback. All the "current" sequences in France are superfluous and do not add anything to the story, emotion, or power. For some reason, European filmmakers often need to talk about a non-chronological story. I've never understood why or what its complaint is. <br /> <br /> The story itself is not the greatest. It is not always clear whether the film is trying to go and what it is trying to say. The story of a young young girl who loves a wild young girl who later turns out to be quite psychotic may feel good enough on paper and even parallels with Paul Verhoeven's "Turkish fruit", to which this film was often compared before and after its release. However, the end result is far from comparable. The story does not take the right emotions, which are also caused by the unimaginable performances of the actors. The way the story is spoken makes the film almost always interesting or compelling. I lost interest in this movie in about 40 minutes through the movie. <br /> <br /> At the time of this film, both Antonie Kamerling and Angela Schijf promised with rising stars, great potential and ambition, but both of them have now quite drought their careers. Angela Schijf seems to be giving her family more attention than her career (of course, it's not bad), while Antonie Kamerling tried to start a career in Hollywood. He never went beyond playing some small parts on the 2 Renny Harlin flop. Frankly, I'm not surprised. It's not that he's a bad actor and he's definitely right, but his English isn't just good enough. Just listen to him at the beginning of the movie, speaking English, and you understand what I mean. They are not really bad actors, but for some reason it is not shown in the movie. This is probably also due to poor dialogue. I still liked Beau van Erven Dorens. He has been much criticized, but his actions seem very natural. He always keeps the characters close to who he is. <br /> <br /> It's not one of the worst movies ever made, but it's not exactly what I would recommend. Bad and uninteresting storytelling makes it a bad film. <br /> <br /> 4/10
