As I said above, I was finally impressed with this film. It's nice to look, the landscape is lush, but the story, especially the characters, is absolutely incredible. Movies do not have to be credible, but films that have a political edge and social commentary. Similarly, I have no problem with commercialism as such, but again, such films should not make decisions on a purely cash plan. This is absolutely the case with Sutherland, who is honestly garbage like Doyle. His accent was far from authentic, but he fell into the biggest trap, his accent is his performance, and we reach the Irish caricature who has no personality outside his nationality. In my opinion, it is very unlikely that everyone who participated was the best man for the job. All in all, this is clearly a commercial interest in quality and if you are trying to be a mission, this kind of thing creates your chances of success. <br /> <br /> Speaking of accents, there were still a couple of problems, one of which is the prominent modernity of Boy's accent that worked to dispel the feeling of transportation to another time. Surprisingly, Samantha Morton's much acclaimed Irish accent was insignificant. His voice bowed between the strong north and the soft south, even in voice commands, where I would have expected such discrepancies. <br /> <br /> But these are small grips compared to motivation and Sarah's actions. She never looks at home in English and almost instantly at home with her son and tribe, a dilemma of the life she knew, and the life she offered, just seems to be not the brain. Perhaps a lot has been lost in editing, maybe it should have been a three-hour movie or a mini-series where these things could have been developed, but I can only evaluate what I've seen. <br /> <br Now the biggest problem, Sarah's (Morton's) relationship with Doyle (Sutherland) is incomprehensible. The fact is that his affection for him is not transmitted in any way until he has to choose between him and his son, the conflict he is going through at that moment was honestly ridiculous and killed the film for me. <br /> <br /> As you thought. this movie didn't work for me at all, but it's the upper limit to watch, you can't see anything stunning in landscapes, some good results and my wife liked it.
