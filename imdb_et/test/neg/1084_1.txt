I say it again ... one of the worst films ever made and directed by a director who made one of my most favorite films - "Excalibur". I was on the floor to see that it was over six levels. This movie sucks. It seemed terrible. It looked like it would have fired for 18 days and Boorman must sleep under his direction. Arquette did nothing. Just terrible, purulent, unbearable, and probably the only mistake in the Boorman-marked career. <br /> <br /> 1/10 !!!!!
