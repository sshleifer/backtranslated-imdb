Five fingers rely heavily on the barbaric, shocking value of Hollywood tactics to make a seemingly positive film response. This is where this film fails, mainly because it is too graphic to take it seriously. I was rejected and disgusted that the five fingers were even made and soon forced myself to continue watching it. Torture itself is bad. Even the sounds coming from the room where someone is tortured are terrible. But obviously the filmmakers of this film felt it was not enough. It had to go beyond what was necessary, and simply and effectively destroyed all the possibilities that this film had any valid point. For this reason, this film appeared to be self-conscious. Five fingers dig the B-film status pretty much by manipulating their timing. In other words, we show that the present and then the past appear in fragments. It's a bit of a twist on the usual Hollywood time manipulation. When the viewer is usually shown at the beginning of the movie on page 95 in a 100-page script, the rest of the draw is essentially the end, Five fingers are dedicated to a flashing rebound. Movie. In general, five fingers made me feel stupid when watching the whole movie, because torture is obviously obscene, and certainly didn't have to be done. I'm surprised that Dick Cheney didn't make hospitality at the end as a super hero of some kind of torture. This movie is a great example of what happens when an important issue comes into the hands of greedy, pointless bucks.
