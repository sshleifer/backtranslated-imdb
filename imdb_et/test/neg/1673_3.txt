Like another reviewer, my wife bought 20 films as part of this film. I think you could say it was a decent TV movie in 1980, but it's super-predictable and the actor, except Robert Conrad, is generally sub-par. Soccer scenes are nothing special and seem to be mainly a film filler. The film is now very dated, but a decent transformation would probably make it a good movie. But is it really necessary? I mean, how much of an "underdog sports team for big games with an unbeatable boy working" really need? This is probably a good movie for your younger kids if you find it in a good binette, but it's missing from the sports movie buffer.
