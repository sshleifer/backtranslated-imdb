Another entertainer from the PM Entertainment group and luckily one of their last. <br /> <br /> 'Firetrap' is actually a very low estimate of 'The Towering Inferno'. if some effort is put on them - "Firetrap" has no effort on the stars Dean'Superman'Cain, who is an absolutely terrible actor, seriously that he has all the capabilities of a porn star, but he turns out to be the best actor here and it says something, the rest is just a bunch of any kind of lottery who hasn't been given different daytime soaps. The special FX is just garbage, the shots that show the burning building from the ground, one of the worst I've ever seen, looks like someone who photographed an orange pen on the front of the camera. besides, there are no signs that you actually root - you hate everyone and hope they all die well before 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The script is embarrassing - the red herring is well labeled before, someone else has mentioned it, but "The scene where the janitor fights with a glowing fire that covers the building with its bones .... fun or the same caretaker who goes to a room marked with "dangerous material", did these scenes have to be a tongue-cheek? somehow I doubt that this is one good point and only one good point was that among the day-to-day soap dramas that attracted my attention there was fair action, but so little care was taken of everyone. movie, I can't recommend it - see "The Towering Inferno" <br /> <br />
