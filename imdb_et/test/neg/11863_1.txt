I like dark humor and non-PC stuff, but not when it's without purpose, but to raise myself. Beating a group of people without the traces of self-consciousness is a mess. <br /> <br /> There are some people who could make funny jokes in the concentration camp, but who did the movie, unfortunately, wasn't even a very easy task to have fun with the Turks in Germany. This is a very simple task, but if you are a German inbred redneck (= inbred Southerner village, where virginity is often lost to farm animals), it is certainly and also alive. I've heard and seen so many funny things about minorities in Germany, but this "movie" (the piece that's listed here is an insult to the next worst movie) sucks like a calf that the filmmakers met a few years ago.
