I like to think of myself as a bad film owner. I like to think that the movies most people mark are the worst that I can easily endure. <br /> <br /> But ... there are exceptions. I can only recall three movies that I have had the misfortune of having repeatedly used the fast back and forth button for big pieces. These movies are The Mighty Gorga, Seagulls Night and the Little Crap, Deep Blood. In the world of Jaws ripoffs, it falls off the scale. Deep Blood doesn't have a real crocodile, nor does it have the incredible effects of Sea Serpent or Tintorer's comments. No, instead, a handful of teens are treated for any accidentally failed 80's public access booths that fight the bully and the local sheriff. <br /> <br /> Hai attacks are realized with fast cuts in documentary films, where the participants have got into the water, sometimes a little that seems to have been thrown in orange-colored water. This celluloid waste landfill has no original shark images. <br /> <br /> Normally, I or someone like me would read such a bad overview and say, "cool, I have to find a copy of it!" It was the same idea I had when I read another viewer review on this site. How wrong I was. <br /> <br /> So ... from one bad movie fan to another ... let it gather dust on the shelf ... Grasp the depths or the Great Alligator to satisfy your needs is something bad that lies in the water.
