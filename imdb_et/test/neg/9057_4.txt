I didn't hate it. I couldn't easily adjust that story. it didn't really catch me. Michael Mann is a very good director, but I don't have to agree with his methods. I'm also a fan of Daniel Day Lewis. some of the projects he has had are garbage but his action is great. my favorite Daniel Day Lewis films are blood and gangs from New York. <br /> <br /> One thing I loved about it and that was a musical result, it gave the film a lot of atmosphere. that's all I liked. this film also has a big voice that is a little random. I see some good people wanting this, but it is not enough to give an overall rating of 7.8. <br /> <br /> I would skip this movie when I was you, but there are many voices for it so I think you should look at it and make your opinion on what you think. I didn't like it .............................................. .................................................. .................................................. .................................................. .................................................. .................................................. .................................................. .................................................. .................................................. .................................................. .................................................. ...............................
