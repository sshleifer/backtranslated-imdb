I'm a big fan of enchanting and horror films when you put them together, it's my sweet place: a terrible slip. You're not going to get this movie in this movie. <br /> <br /> Surely, girls are abusive in the form of kidnapping and torture, which is nude with various things. However, Sleaze is not very slippery. It didn't record very high on my slider, mainly because no girl was the most attractive and did not try to act as if they even threatened. They seemed to think more about what was at lunch or perhaps when they got some gap. <br /> <br /> Forget these effects, they were extreme. Bad behavior contributed to the gap; the effect is harder to believe than even the actors and actors do not buy them. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was pretty bad, they could have hired a few cinematographers from porn movies and do better. In fact, it could have raised enough salmon factor to make it more enjoyable. As it is, there are many dark frames where you don't see very clearly, and what you don't see is too good. <br /> <br /> Factor is zero. Zero. Zero. Nada. Zip. Zilch. I've seen children's movies that were more frightening. There is no camp here either. It's just a movie that is trying to be shockingly slippery, but it doesn't even go.
