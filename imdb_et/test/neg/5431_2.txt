CONGO is probably the worst budget of the 1990s. It is so bad that it can be tracked over and over again. A lot of people with different agendas are getting deeper into darker Africa, where they experience a temple of wealth like KING SOLOMON MINES - but cannibalistic gorillas who guard these riches. On their side, people have a "talkable" gorilla called Amy, who helps to save one day at a time or another. So much on the plot. The whole dialogue is meaningless, acting almost equally scary, certainly campy (Tim Curry and Ernie Hudson have both arms to ensure a zinc factor) and special effects that are abysmal. Wait until you see cannibalistic gorillas. And lava! Oh yes, did I mention there is a volcanic eruption that brings you out of the grand final? Laura Linney of all people is the bump of this bump. What could he think? It is right around the time he appeared with Richard Gere and Ed Norton in the PRIMAL FEAR, a film that helped secure his fame.
