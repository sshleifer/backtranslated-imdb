This is the worst film I've ever seen. At first I thought it was good because I'm interested in the bermuda triangle, but it was terrible. All of this was to provide a number of flat explinations that didn't make sense (as time moves differently from how a woman did not get older, and her son aged quickly) and is a terrible cute ending. The next time the boys who did it go to Bermuda, they will take all copies of this movie with them. Please everyone vote for this movie so you can get the worst movie list.
