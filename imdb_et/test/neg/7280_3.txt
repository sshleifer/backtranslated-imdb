The infamous horror film is rarely measured by the surrounding leap and I have not yet met a worse offender than Wes Craveni's The Hills Have Eyes. Having looked back many years ago, I was really happy when I got it at Christmas and waited for the night when my girlfriend was about to live and watch - knowing her extreme reluctance to be really terrible. I don't have to bother. <br /> <br /> After a promising - as familiar - start that firmly fears the film's survival in the world of "Desolution USA", things are moving quickly as protagonists and antagonists like the abandoned wasteland. </p> </p> <p> </p> </p> <p> </p> An irritating bundle of blacksmithed WASPs who take a flight to California to look for a silver mine in a nuclear test zone (!). When they break down, they are a family of local carnivores and they have to fight to survive. <br /> <br /> While I hope for another Deliverance, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Vale Tour, or Devil's Rejects, I actually realized I stumbled upon something that should have remained in the bargain package of the video store despite the dust and the back. <br /> <br /> Together with gallons of tomato ketchup in blood and a couple of terrible wound cancer, I can see how 18 hours (in the UK) are justified, but for those close-ups that have been trimmed, it would not have been a triller ITV on Saturday afternoon -s. <br /> <br /> The entire silver mining / nuclear test site sub-platform is just McGuffin to justify biasing a civilized family against primitives, but considering how easily the savage can rub their donkeys, it pulls the belief that they have survived for generations to come. /> <br /> And then the end ... or the lack of it. The Hills Have Eyes seem to be missing a third act or at least a satisfactory deviation. Instead, I just thought, "Yes, and ...?"
