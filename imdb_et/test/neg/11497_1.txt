Such a BS movie. It's just stupid anti-Russian propaganda that has a completely BS plot, not in any way related to the book. <br /> <br /> It seems that the production team got more money from the people who ordered the movie if they ever can sell the movie. There are references to some recent events between Russia and other parts of Eastern Europe on the film plot, but they are placed so that it has nothing to do with reality. The film seems to be a brainwashing tool to help depict Russia as a place where evil people are always dreaming about killing someone. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are hundreds of foolish mistakes, such as the use of news from the Russian Soviet Union, showing the crowd with the Ukrainian flags and commenting that this is Russia's election, etc. <br /> <br /> There are also many strange episodes (ie the symbol works in Moscow with Red Square and the other in the center of Sophia, Bulgaria).
