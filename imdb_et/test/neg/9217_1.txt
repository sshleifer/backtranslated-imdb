I went to this movie, hoping that the second coming was imaginative. Boy, I was wrong. The BBC is giving a boost to the film, a set of idiots that create tension, fools at the intensity of the building. And this movie is no exception to how much the BBC sucks. <br /> <br /> Ugh, a tempo and a time-consuming laborious dialogue was just a painful sit. The first 30 minutes seemed 2 hours. I always looked in front of my watch, thinking that the futile, monotonous generation would end. They wasted a very good actor in the lead because the material is so lazy and sloppy, written. Everything that happens is just a time to kill. <br /> <br /> From 155 minutes it's just 15 minutes to be interesting (controversial end). What a shame. Reading a plot summary is more interesting than watching a movie. Teaching, endless blah blah blah-ing, stupid like wonderful miracles miracles ... UGH.
