I was actually quite surprised to discover that the film is based on the Far Cry game. The story here is not something I consider to be a strong point in the gaming world. There is no worry, though, in the usual Boll fashion, the story of the movie has very little to do with the game. Now, I understand that there are certain freedoms to transfer to another media, but it seems that he just isn't trying to connect. Not only that, but acting and acting sequences are so funny that you almost feel the whole project was a big joke. It has been said that a million times before, but why didn't anyone get more talented video game rights to create a movie ????
