When I first saw it 9 years ago when I was 9. I thought it was stupid. I'm 18 years old now and I think it's stinking. I mean geez no special effects or anything, it was boring and kinda anti-climate. My cousin looked once and George Takai (Sulu) talked about how it was supposed to be so much better, but they had to cut the budget. It would have been a big episode, but it was a terrible movie.
