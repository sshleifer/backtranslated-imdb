Hitchcock's original classic benefit was enormously not only in the performance of Anthony Perkins, but also in "appearance". He designed a kind of pure innocence: a young teen-idol-type person. He was not an actor who had been depicted before; nor was he physically fit for what the public could portray from the psychopath, especially in the 50s, when the ultra-cooling aspect of the mental illness (a shared personality psychosis) in the film was relatively unexplored. That's why he, as Norman Bates, was a true Hitchcockius genius. Surprisingly, the target groups were surprised. <br /> <br /> That's why it doesn't work again, even a little bit, despite trying to be an exact copy. When Anthony Perkins looked like someone you never thought of as a serum killer, Vince Vaughn is easily imaginable. He has no weaknesses in Perkins and his acting pieces are also worse, at least in this role (honestly - have there ever been an actor who could really pass on nervousness as Anthony Perkins?). Although it was pointless to do it again, the failure of the most important character of the story captures the film completely. <br /> <br /> As a side note, I feel that Hollywood's tendency to restore great movies because "young" people refuse to look at something that is not painted in color, not only stinks the company's greed in the high sky, but is extraordinarily disrespectful of its original work. As for viewers who are unable to watch black and white - this is their loss. Hopefully, they will sometimes mature in the future and no longer need to shine in order to pay attention. When they do, they discover that sometimes black and white work is much better. When the background is silenced, this story and performances are much more front and center. In many cases, the mood or atmosphere created by black and white cinematography is simply not a color.
