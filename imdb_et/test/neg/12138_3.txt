VILLA BASIS (2000) ** 1/2 <br /> <br /> WARNING: YOU MAY HAVE SOME SPOILERS FOR YEARS <br /> <br /> It's hard to know what a VILLA is, a gorgeous but low period, one whose only purpose is to earn Oscar nominations for the best costume design and artistic direction (one is cinematography and the other is also welcome). It has the same basic idea of ​​thousands of periodic pieces produced each year: a good-looking and intelligent woman who tries to love her in a strange place. He has a lot of difficulties, but in the end he finds happiness in the man with whom he did not. In this case, our lady is in Florence, some time before World War II. She is an English widow who is related to rich but old men (apparently not loved). One day he meets another man who does not have a good reputation but falls in love with him. Of course, he's a friend who helps him get better or worse, and a third person who suicides here in the woman's room, putting him in a risky situation. Guess how the story ends ...? <br /> <br /> A VILLA BASE is not a bad film. I was always interested in the story, but never excited. The problem is not a slow pace, but a scenario. It is adapted to the novel, needs more spicy, exciting, twisting and intercourse. Every time you think the story gets warmer, it gets cooler again. If you think there is a conspiracy that includes the middle police officer of Florence, then it is, but it doesn't change the story at all. It goes on and on until the predicted end. <br /> <br /> As I said, VILLA is not bad at all. If it is a bit happier, it will never become delicate and too sentimental. The actor is half and half, but definitely convincing. Kristin Scott Thomas made very bad choices after the ENGLISH PATIENT (a happy romantic drama HORSE WHISPERER and dull / irritating RANDOM HEARTS). BETWEEN VILLA IS BETTER than those pieces and Kristin is better, but he can do more. Sean Penn is always good, even if his character is a big guy. Anne Bancroft is a terrible actor (THE GRADUATE, my God!), And here she doesn't let her character be ridiculous. Now, supportive actors are pretty bad (Jeremy Davies is sooooooooooo irritating!). <br /> <br /> Leadership is good, but not cruel. It was interesting to know that the director is the same with ANGEL AND INSECTS (also Kristin Scott Thomas), the second so periodic drama, but it is more cruel. Visuality is important here. Florence is great, the costumes are big, landscapes, music ... <br /> <br /> After all, UP AT VILLA is an average romantic drama, but of course it would have been much better. It's traceable and interesting, but don't wait for a temporary movie - it's not! This film fails because it wants to have some secret, to see something ... But there is not much to say yet, mainly because of the lower scenario. Now, for Oskar candidates, don't worry - it's probably for them.
