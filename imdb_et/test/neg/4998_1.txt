So, you've seen Romero movies, right? And you've seen Jacob's ladder, right? And later Hellraiser's films? Okay, now we're making a movie from all three, but we're all gonna make it together and make a big mess, is it a good idea? <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. Absolutely godly. Yeah, this is the indie flick who gives the mess? Is it a movie to make a film of stools? The film strives to create credibility by focusing on character interaction, so much is obvious. Unfortunately, the character is not good at communicating with the writers. It is not the night of the living dead; The characters are inconveniences that call out wrong lines against each other, trying to catch them by the microphone. Dialogue is never interesting. For a movie that focuses so much on character interactions, you would think the characters would say more than "WHAT WE ARE" "I don't know" "THERE ARE ATTENTION!" What are we going to do? "" I don't know. "" We should leave. "" LETE OUR FATE. "" No, we have to leave. "" IMPORTANT: "" No, maybe we should stay. "<br /> <br /> This is not an exaggeration, there are shifts in this movie that will bring it together and fail. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this movie? Half of this is a dream, and it's really zero. Writers were unable to decide whether to make a zombie movie or a monster movie and so they did both, which is obviously ridiculous, the cheapest trick in the book, and it's insulting mad, especially since I'm pretty sure they broke the idea of ​​Jacob ladder that dealt with the concept in much more competent hell than those jokes could ever count on <br /> <br /> And then there is the editing. did not understand what changed their clutter redig in the foreground and confusion. Often in this movie confused, not in the good, on David Lynch's roads, but in the bad "Wait, I thought he just died, no? Then who the hell was that? Wait for this man? Is he coming? How are they here got? " It is constant and consistent bad. <br /> <br /> This movie is ridiculous to the trash and should only be searched if you want to have a friend in the trash and laugh. <br /> <br /> And as the last comment: like the comedy of other comedies, they all speak involuntarily. There is no deliberate comedy in this movie. All of this should be a great serious nature training, as filmmakers want to be credible in their horror concept. Unfortunately, their claims do not match their ability.
