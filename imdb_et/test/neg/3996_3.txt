I was originally interested in this movie, having read the summary and seeing a couple of striking pictures, and the promise was a horror film that captured the style of Dario Argento. Of course, I have to say that Argento films have been quite inconsistent from time to time and some know a handful of visually impressive sets loosely put together with a vague unifying plot. <br /> <br /> As Argento is a writer for this, I have to say that I'm not surprised. Even his masterpiece Suspiria, if examined, has the same tendency to pass through sometimes related scenes only for aesthetic effects. However, the usefulness of suspiria was also a unique main character and clear antagonists, as well as scenes that ultimately contributed to the final divorce. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the Church has none of these things. It has no main character, no main character; it also has no real plot to talk about, and no crescend, no climax, no denouement or no resolution. It is completely hollow, inconsistent work that looks like Argento sat down and thought "hey, what would make an interesting scene visually ... let's do it!" The film is a series of these scenes. <br /> <br /> Initially, it may be interesting and the direction of Soavi is great, I have to say. The soap cannot be damaged by the material because it is made as weighty as possible. This good direction, however, marks the terrible drawbacks of the script and makes no sense. There is nothing more than a test of the plagiarism of Carpenter's film Prince of Darkness. The events only happen because the script wants them and the reactions to these events are absolutely incredible. The narrative flow is irreversibly damaged after the point, simply because it is not possible to stop the disbelief; it is too ridiculous. This is accompanied by numerous factual errors that are so obviously highlighted that it becomes embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If it had been publicly more artistic and edited in different work, it would have been chilling or tense. If it had turned into a real coherent story, it could have seized. But it was none of them. The best thing she did was confusing and sometimes terrible. Plots are being put into operation, but they are not being followed. Characters are forgotten arbitrarily. No situation ever applies. Maybe it was scary or interesting, but to create such a feeling, the scriptwriter has more effort ... much more. <br /> <br /> Not all churches are worthy of anyone. but a whole Italian horror enthusiast that has more style than substance. This is the worst Argento style, and it is a strong argument for common criticism.
