I rented this movie one day from a local video store, a movie with a box of art that just comes out and tells you to 'rent me'. Well, if you see this dumb movie from your video store, walk on. Fight the urge, rent a porn, because this movie is BOOOoooorrrring. Despite the interesting opening, the film disappears for repeated murders and hard-wearing police officers dealing with common problems (female, boss, boss, etc.). Interestingly, does your VCR work fast? Rent this movie and test your worries.
