I was a little scared of this movie; the original is both written and actor's masterpiece and unfortunately my fears were realized. It's a humorous job and I sat in the theater, waiting for wit and humor to start - I'm still waiting. Updating history to date has not worked and making the characters into an absolute travesty - why did they introduce Bette Midler's character as he disappeared as soon as he arrived; The original 1939 was an integral part of the plot. Cinema women laughed a few times, but nothing touched me as funny, except for a row from Meg Ryan, who told her mother about her situation and told her "it's not like a 1930s movie. View the 1930s version. It was too funny that "nurses would stay together" and really needed some acerbic wit and smart dialogue from the original game - I still watch the original movie and pick up that I've never received before. There is no point in closing this new version, and even though the 1939 film is politically wrong according to today's standards, every thread was tied and when the movie ended, it was so strong. This remake needs to be labeled with a warning to all viewers - if you know the original, don't worry: I felt cheated by losing some of my life in the cinema, watching this unmemorable fluff. Bring Jungle Red !!
