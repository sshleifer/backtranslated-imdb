Supposedly a film about a magazine that sends journalists to study UFO reports where one is more or less tolerant or agnostic about the whole thing and another Aussie, a hardened skeptic who laughs at the UFO. It's all silver, some sort of money making racket. <br /> <br /> This movie is actually a trick and trap to actually proclaim the Christian teachings and the Christian explanation of UFOs I've heard before. It is an ad hoc explanation that is not biblical in itself, but has been developed by certain modern theologians who are all about everything in their mythology. Paranormal? It's real, just demonic, if it doesn't happen in a Christian context, of course it's God. Simple, if it's not God, it's fucking, stupid! So I think that since Beethoven's 9th Symphony was not inspired by God, it must be written under demonic influence. Or, so would the leading ad absurdum of logic. <br /> <br /> We are told that because the Bible does not speak of life on other planets in the Universe, there is no one (Ad Ignorantum's error) and that God created the universe so great, to show us our all-powerful power. I think Carl Sagan's remark that if God created such a vast universe and stuck in life only on Earth, it would have been a waste of huge space. <br /> <br /> What is UFO? They are demonic activities and will soon worry about the bursting of a Christian event ... I mean Rapture. Before misery, true Christians will disappear from the ground massively, causing massive panic, confusion, car and plane crash ... whatever. That's why Satan is telling him that his demons basically create an illusion of the abduction of an alien spacecraft and an alien, which can then be explained to explain this otherwise inexplicable event. All part of Satan's plan, which naturally keeps people from watching God or Jesus, and falls for Antihhrist's lies. <br /> <br /> This ad hoc explanation also characterizes theological theft by explaining one secret to another, unexplained, strange and mysterious, as far as possible, first known, if not known, to the unknown. <br /> <br /> It's like jumping directly into an alien robbery when the child is missing and has not understood it. I think I will first look at the daily explanations, as the child has escaped, lost or redeemed for ransom or kidnapped by predatory pedophile before turning to aliens or supernatural or Satan or some such. <br /> <br /> Such a fundamentalist deception or trap is nothing new, because young people are often seen as free rock concerts that can start something safe, then suddenly go over to Christian music, followed by sermon and altar call. Such a blatant scam would suggest that it would be more of a Satan ball game. But perhaps because Christian faith is soon to be put to death, these men feel that something goes wrong, deception or cheating or intimidation are acceptable to keep faith in life, facing both secular and serious opposition. competing religions like Islam, the world's fastest growing religion that can replace Christianity, because Islam is more coherent and more coherent and logically more resilient than Christian fundamentalism. Although it should be of little use to mankind, it would replace one intolerable thinking system with another. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the movie ends with a lot of Pascal wager. It is said that atheistic Aussie, who is almost all skeptical, speaks. Well, if you are right, that life is not and death is nothing but a tomb, don't worry ... but what if you're wrong? <br /> <br /> Basically, the testimony that the reality is not an ideological perspective or a Christian fantasy is a false dilemma or a black and white error. Even if atheists are wrong, Christianity may not be defeated by default, and if Christianity does not prove to be full of holes in theology, then materialistic atheists are therefore by default correct. <br /> <br /> For all, I know that the spirituality of American wilderness can be the best description of reality, and we can all use the desire that we treat the Earth and its beings a little better. <br /> <br /> This film should be stamped on a box: Caution: Contains religious propaganda and is not intended for informative or entertaining purposes.
