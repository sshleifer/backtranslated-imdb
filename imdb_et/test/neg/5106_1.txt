when I first read "berlin am meer", I didn't expect much. but I thought the right people, the right places, the right music and fashion could at least make a trivial movie about hip-berlin. but eissler failed, it is so ridiculously unfair. this is a complete mistake about what is happening in Berlin's so-called scene. Of course, this is not all about hippiness, but you should wait for more movies to be sold as a "flat Berlin movie". <br /> <br /> And apart from all the credibility of things, it's really a bad movie. mediocre action and quite boring plot. interestingly, some actors in other films have proved that they are actually quite talented. so it's really a bad routing skill. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about watching "berlin am meer" if you are not 17 years old, coming from some small towns in western Germany and wanting to move to school after a bigger city. then it can actually be enjoyable and totally cool.
