A depressed horrible teenager does a lot of bad things for a socially active older woman who doesn't want to use hues or curtains in her windows. She sharpened her things, hiding her, making prank calls and playing various unpleasant tricks for her. Strangely enough, he doesn't keep any secrets. At first, he doesn't seem to care about one way or another that he is bothering him. Later, he seems to start respecting him for cruel burning activities. <br /> <br /> Here are some illogical topics. One of them is that the boy strikes the night through a glass of light that is brighter. Such a thing would not happen in real life. The lighter side of the glass panel is a mirror. He doesn't see anything exactly. Anyone outside the night could also sit in his lighted room. The only customer every morning seems to be the woman with whom she chooses. Easy work when you get it. <br /> <br /> I saw in the public that showed love, SHORT FILM. Finally, there was no open eye in the house. SHORT FILM ABOUT US is a foreign language film for those who do not like reading subtitles. There are only very few words in the film, but much of the film is silent. A certain holiday in peace.
