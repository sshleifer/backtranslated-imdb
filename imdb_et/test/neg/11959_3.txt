The scarecrow Gone Wild begins as a high school teenager Mike (David Zelina) and his buddies decide to give some nervousness to interact with the diabetic Sam (Caleb Roehrig). Mike and his companion decide to take the Sami corn field, tie him aside to the side of worshiping peasants and leave him all night, sounds like fun? Well, things come back when Sam goes into a diabetic comic after he suffers from hypoglycemia and Sam's vengeful spirit goes horrifyingly living and hunting for the children who are responsible for Sami's deplorable life-threatening situation. Will Sami's best husband Jack (Matthew Linhardt) and his friend Beth (Samantha Aisling) save the day and Sam's life? <br /> <br /> Literature and director Brian Katkin Scarecrow Gone Wild is the third direct-video entry in the series of peacemaking, and if I didn't see Scarecrow Gone Wild in either of the previous two, I am certainly not in a position that is certain. The script actually has a pretty good assumption, because Sami's wrong soul is trying to revenge, and his friends have to live a real life in Sami, but how he's said is bad and I think it is basically just irrelevant to the fact that it's a movie a killer scarecrow that kills people not in gory or imaginative ways. Having said that there are one or two scenes that record it with one star, the chewing corn is funny and something that can be done by many immature cracks (like me), a bit when two men buried their companion in the sand and then stood up over him and pee is a pretty funny young man and cool when someone starts singing a terrible song so scarecrow throws him that bothers him! But these OK bits are little and far between the & a whole, it's a silly, boring, poorly written teen movie that has a very annoying character irritating. It is also very predictable and has a stupid twist, which does not mean a peacock, which is a problem, because when you look at the fish festival Gone Wild, you expect to see the scarecrow wild and have to admit that it looks rather cool when the horror goes. <br /> <br /> Director Katkin does a decent job here, though what is on Earth at the end of this hospital and all the neon lights everywhere and that there is only one patient and two employees? Cinematography is much better than late & ordinary video, which is low on conventional video, and there are some nice as completely unrealistic lighting. The film lacks real intimidation and tension, and some of the medical terminology that is used is quite a bit to say and I say it as an insulin-dependent diabetic. There is not much gore here, there are a couple of scenes where some actors are placed on their stomachs as fake bolds that represent them gutted, but it looks pretty fake, there is also a burnt face and a few impalents, but little else. Show if it's your thing, there are a lot of naked wife's breasts. <br /> <br /> The technically scarecrow Gone Wild is somewhat good considering some low budget abominations. in general. At least they said better about the operation. <br /> <br /> The Scarecrow Gone Wild is not as bad as any recent upright straight video-spiteful crap, but has said it is not so much better And it's still a bad movie when everyone has said and done. Not recommended, the two previous entries are in Scarecrow (2002) and Scarecrow Slayer (2003), both of which went straight to the video.
