Acted what you feel like you're watching kindergarten play. The story is full of holes and gaps and it goes around so you have no idea what just happened. Half of the scenes are meaningless. There is no character development. The result / soundtrack consists of about three songs, one of which is played about 70% of the scenes. I'm glad I rented a movie, but I still feel cheated. Avoid this movie at all costs if you do not want to see some decent actors who give terrible performances. Most of the budget seems to have spent some brand name actors on less than a bad movie. This movie is equivalent to visiting a striptease club, trying to get you excited and interesting, but just as you think something happens when you got into an independent scene and tried to find out how you got there.
