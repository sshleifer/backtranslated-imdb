That's the movie. A good God is the special effects of this film. It's hard to suck more than the film's graph, but the special effects can pull it out. Let me try to explain how bad this film is. <br /> <br /> First, there is a plot. There are four punk-ass teenage dirt bikers who drive in the forest of Duluth, MN. One of them is buggy and tries to make a ridiculous jump and break his leg. The paramedic must help her, but she will be bypassed during the helicopter breaks. Then all the way to realize that there is a forest fire that we see starting with some men who dumped gas across the forest. Everything they show us is his boots and they show the scene after the boys start footwear with gas and fire. At the same time, teenagers are trying to escape the fire to find that the launcher has somehow managed to keep them ahead (while they hurried through the dirt and bikes in the forest!), Throwing gas across the area they were driving and starting more fires. He does this several times, and the paramedic finally catches him and begins to fire him. I'm not breaking the end, but this defendant's resilience starts yelling at you: "WHAT IS HELL?!?!" on the screen. Anyway, they are now surrounded by fire and their only escape is through a mine filled with meta-gas. Yeah, meta-gas. I'm not even trying to describe the end because it's too ridiculous and you enjoy it more than you see it. What you don't do because you can't wait for what will happen. The reason for this is another big problem with this movie: consistency. <br /> <br /> Is there a lot of similarity to ask? Probably so. I can't even read the number of broken limbs in this movie (they break the bikes together). I think every symbol breaks at least in one part and in several more than one. They then slide until the scene ends, and then forget that they should have broken limbs. There is one scene where three of those who should have broken legs dance. But then their injuries suddenly return when they need them. <br /> <br /> Finally, CGI. When hell is, it looks at the fire of this movie. Everything they did for forest fires is aligned with dirt roads with CGI fire. You can clearly see that the only CGI fire is down the road and all trees that are more than two feet off the road remain intact. And then they zoom in and show that the entire forest is in flames. It's hard to describe with words how ridiculous it looks, but I assure you that ridicule is quite impressive. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of those bad guys. There are some cases where it falls into a painful bad category, but mostly it stays above the line and is ridiculously intuitive. I can't wait to look at other nature conservation films that came with these four packages.
