I have to say that when I saw this movie on 6.5, I thought it was a worthwhile view. I was very disappointed. From the very beginning, it is obvious that two supposed FBI agents are actually killers. Would they have made it more obvious? If this is the "twist" of this movie, it is quite sad. Although Pullman and Ormond are great actors, even their talent is not an inappropriately bad script. Pullman acts as a part of a sociopathic killer ... and that's a problem. There is no "I play FBI man!" "I just killed 12 people and a boy, if my hands are tired." You can't blame the actors ... the story doesn't succeed much more than one. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the movie, I was sure I was wrong that no director / writer would ever be so obvious about the "twist" of the plot. Ormond and Pullman just have to act strangely to direct the viewer's attention to the real killers, I thought ... which gave the filmmakers too much credit. I should have watched my instincts and turned off the movie before she even went past the 15-minute mark. <br /> <br /> For Lynch's credit, he was able to do a lot of things that make a good movie: sex, violence, humor, and well-trained participants. The wrong configuration was too bad. Hopefully, Pell James will be able to recover from this role ... I found his performance particularly impressive, because he was a spiritual savior who turned to stunning drug addicts. He should have rewritten this role to win the "crack whore". <br /> <br /> The people who have compared this movie with wild-born killers note: Tarantino made Mickey and Mallory characters condemned, yet compassionate. The artistry of this film goes beyond gore, and it is never seen in tracking. Surveillance only wants it to be a natural born killer ... actually it has wet dreams to be even a fraction of this movie. People who have not seen surveillance ... stick with a little more intelligence. Like Camp Rock.
