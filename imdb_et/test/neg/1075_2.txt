This film worked well in the cash register, and the manufacturers of this confusion thought that the stars had so good chemistry that they threw in a much darker screwdriver, The Gazebo. To be honest, I am shocked to see all the positive comments about this ridiculously drawn inhuman comedy. Both lines have maturity from seven-year-olds and are much less interesting. Supports an excellent support veteran who supported the cast work, including Fred Clark, Harry Morgan and Eva Gabor. And the beautiful cinema definitely makes the rich Spanish landscape lush. And there are four or five really funny scenes with two clever and whole recycled and inconvenient clutter. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend it with a kiss.
