I'm a big fan of big bad horrors, cheap horrors, b-movies and all those 100-year-old movies, and I'm not denying what's the biggest thing ever on a big screen or even your home video on this issue. Some of them, eg. The infamous Manos hand fate is really bad and watching them, especially without friends and beers, is torture for a good cinema taste. <br /> <br /> La Momia The Azteca Contra El Roboto Humano was not so bad, however. Well, of course, this is BAD - it's stupid, dated, horny, cheap, etc., there is a stepmother, a tin robot, a fat-damaged villain, a crazy scientist, Mexican mobiles, and so on. Well, let's say the lines are not theatrical, FX and SFX are the best that Mexican low-budget production could have provided, and so on. it is so bad that it makes you laugh happily within one hour. Of course, it depends on a sense of humor, but I'm pretty sure La Momia should teach every newcomer a cinema how to enjoy it. Note that the film lasts about an hour, and I think it's just enough time to be able to digest stupidity easily. <br /> <br /> There is also another thing - watching La Momia can give you an idea of ​​what the whole SF / Horror genre concept was like in the fifties as compared to the contemporary cinema entertainment Matrix era. I think it also shows how both the industry and the audience have evolved, because watches like La Momia are still attracting a full house to some specialty shows in theaters (such films are special), and often they get stagnant.
