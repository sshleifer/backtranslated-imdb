This film reminds me of old B movies, but not well. <br /> <br /> When I saw the first scene, I thought it was a looting of one early SF movie. This impression was caused by terrible action, plastic props and noticeable visual effects. <br /> <br /> But no, the movie is really so bad. The story is complete nonsense, the effects are lower than the level of television broadcasts; even editing is a mess. <br /> <br /> The only thing that kept me in the theater was that I wanted to know the end of the story, although I was pretty sure it was stupid (and it was). <br /> <br /> There are many ways to spend your time and money.
