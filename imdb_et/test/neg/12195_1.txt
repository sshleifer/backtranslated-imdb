It wasn't a good movie !! Why do you say that to people? There's a nice little story and then some sexy girls and then BAM vampires !!! Why? Why are Vampires? Where did they come from? What the hell ?! There are all these "super human" vampires, but George Clooney and three other random men dominate all of them. Also fast. It is not like there was a long struggle with lots of struggle. There were only three dude in the bar who killed those vampires like a fatty man killing twinkies! The next thing you know about Clooney and the stupid girl is saved by Cheech and leaves the family in the middle of the less homeless in Mexico. End of story. Literally. Oh and the striptease club was the Aztec temple, which is funny because it should be South Mexico, not the border. Why are you lying and telling people it's a good movie? Don't try, buy or even watch this movie in a friend's house. You want you to be back in this life.
