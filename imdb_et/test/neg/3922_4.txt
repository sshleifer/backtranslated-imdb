1950s Sci-Fi director Lesley Selander. Of course, the special effects are very primitive but pretty good compared to what was still there. Dual function of portable film; still interesting to watch. Two leading men, Arthur Franz, brilliant young scientist, Dr. Jim Barker, and Steve Abbot (Cameron Mitchell), a direct and reputable newspaper reporter, have joined a male flight to Mars Carol Stafford (Virgina Huston), another scientist and two other space specialists (Richard Gaines and John Litel). When the Red Planet lands, the passengers of the room will meet friendly and mentally advanced residents. In reality, Martens are led by Ikron (Morris Ankrum), who has the idea to conquer Earth's civilization. There is a beautiful Mars (Maruerite Chapman), which Dr. Barker plans to return back to the trip. He's the redeemable element of the movie.
