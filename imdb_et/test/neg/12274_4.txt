I was much more expected of this movie than what I actually got. The act was terrible, and the story was far from impressive. It took a lot of something I wasn't even going to follow because it was so funny. An example of exemplification is when Paxton's character's Bath is disrupted by the South Vietnamese colonel, so he throws some sand out of the "sand map". It was not possible to get any idea of ​​what he felt and his actions were robotic. To make things worse, I have no idea how I should feel about the bath. He is obviously the protagonist, but as soon as he arrives in Vietnam, he begins with a Vietnamese English teacher. The only thing the film had gone was that it wasn't very boring. I'll give her 4 stars out of 10.
