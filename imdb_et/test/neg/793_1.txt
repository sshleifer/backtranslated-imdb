The first time I ever felt I had to write. <br /> <br /> I've seen thousands of movies in my life and I like a lot of movies. I'm reasonably open minded and I can just say that I enjoyed the movie, saying, "yes, it wasn't good, but I enjoyed it. I appreciate the mastery of great movies like Shaw's stem salvation, godfather and American history X. I can like movies like horror or comedy movies, even if the film may not be so big. I can even enjoy a bad movie that just happens to attract me (Bloodsport). I am also trying to fairly evaluate the film even if I didn't like it. Chapin City Light was not a pleasant film for me, but I appreciate the exhibition and the story that is by then. <br /> <br /> I think some people who visit this site, rather than randomly click on the rating, should take some ideas into consideration Try to evaluate the movie based on how good it really was.Do not let your personal bias affect the rating See other moves you've rated and compare the movie you rate. > <br /> This "movie" was the worst garbage I've ever seen. 2 hours of my life where you just stolen. Operation was terrible, everywhere. Scenes where the best cases are unpleasant. But the real shame was the story. In the first 20 minutes we actually had a story that tried to make sense and take the viewer from point A to point B. But after that it was a nightmare. They tried to add new elements, but nothing was explained. Something really didn't make sense, was the steward dead, is he alive, did he hit the lighting, was it really lighting, was it an alien, was he an alien, etc.? The only positive thing was someone we care to leave the theater. <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 ??? What's wrong with some? I admit that we 8, where we saw this mad, thought "what would be better?", And we decide to tell some of our friends that this movie was good for them to suffer and see this movie. What I say is that affliction loves the company. This is really the only reason I see 6.5 ratings. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your life!
