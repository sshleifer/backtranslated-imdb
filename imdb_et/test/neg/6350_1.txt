If you want to watch a movie, you have to watch it. I myself, without the experience of making movies, could do better. The script is laughing at a weak plot and there is no effort to see an intelligent structure. To compensate for this shortcoming, you think this action would be decent, right? <br /> <br /> As the movie's performance, editing and overall splitting are amazing, it's the only sustainable arm. terrible result of the leading actor. The reason he is rescuing grace is that he is so bad as he is acting, that he should win for it. At least some appreciation for making so much laugh at me. <br /> <br /> In the body of a dead woman after all the men come out (where did she come from?), pull the semi-automatic trigger ten times while the soundman pulls out two impact effects, the camera crew reflection in School Mo Dee tones, one and only track for WHOLE film, a unigenous script that has no logic; is a perfect recipe for a really bad movie. Its actually more fun lubrication flaws than actually trying to find something positive. Avoid at all costs.
