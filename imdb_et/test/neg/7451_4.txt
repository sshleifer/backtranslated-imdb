This movie started off perfectly; the first 30 minutes are very funny and smart some interesting characters. This is good news. The bad news is that the movie becomes too repetitive and then it gets stupid. <br /> <br /> What we are finishing is Santa Claus, who has "magical" powers, with lots of New Age coins that are mixed. It's just ridiculous and hardly such a "Christmas movie" that I'd expect from Jim Varney's "Ernest". <br /> <br /> To be fair, he still had a good laugh, and he was a free, but not just a movie I could recommend.
