I have to admit that I just picked this film cast, and when Sutherland, Scacchi and Prochnow were - as usual - great performers, the rest of the film was such a shot. It seems to have been put together by a team of low-scripted adolescents, ie scripts lacking any depth, terrible photography and editing, and a fun sad score! I can't believe I could look at this seemingly long movie ... the sad thing is that it could have been a great political thriller for the plot. All the possibilities were to hit it; that is, there are two main components: a great story about a national conspiracy and a big core (although many other actors are pretty much the quality of soap opera). But maybe I'm missing something; Until then, I don't think it's more than three.
