There was a time when Michael Jackson was honored as King of Pop. Then the time came when he pulled out the negative publicity as much as the lemonade attracts the wort. Finally, it's time we feel really sorry for this man. <br /> <br /> This movie is another reason. I promised fierce Michael Jackson fans to see it together. You know what type of fan - someone who tells him he likes everything that a love object ever did. Looking at the movie he had already seen twice, I realized how far this fandom was going. Probably far enough to evaluate this movie over 1/10, as some people did wonderfully. <br /> <br /> The film tries to be a parody of many other movies and series, especially Cast Away, Lost and Jurassic Park. Unfortunately, it fails at every level. The actor does not record an absolutely terrible story, filming is too often the quality of the video tape being played, the special effects were better filled with Be Kind Rewind (for those who don't do this: with aluminum foil). All this would be funny if the movie was lucky, funny. Unfortunately, this is not the case. It hurts to look at it. <br /> <br /> And then this is the waste of Michael Jacksons. He will appear on the projection screen to give an important message, and will be able to meet both mobile and Jabba Hutt and as serious as 4 years old. Just when I thought "who is a terrible person who attracted this poor person to participate in this movie and again was completely stupid," I finally came to (ultimately) end credit and discovered that the movie is actually part of Jackson's Neverland ranch. In other words: He. Like. This film, and Jackson's participation in it, are truly disturbing. Don't even look at the "haha, film IMDb Bottom 100" effect. Or warn.
