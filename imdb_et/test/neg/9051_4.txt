I love Umberto Lenz's police movies - ROME ARMED TO THE TEETH is my favorite - and his DESERT COMMANDOS justifiably justified Italy's Euro War phenomenon, actually leading a pretty good movie. Give him weapons, machines, some guys to talk hard and it's hard to miss him. <br /> <br /> What a shame it is to meet her EATEN ALIVE and CANNIBAL FEROX. They could have been somebody, really and one follows them in the sense that he was under the contract, told them what movies to do, he was assigned a cast and a team, and he was given a budget, deadline and script. Lenzi then went out and made his films in the same way as McDonald's man fixes French fries. Two of them are the most original of EATEN ALIVE - which is amazing in the way that it has a wide range of film material from three other cannibal films - and it's easier to enjoy than CANNIBAL FEROX, though not much. <br /> <br /> I let others introduce the plot: what fascinates me about the film is how it all is staged, and a somewhat infamous reputation that this film has on any kind of good taste. This is not the case, although the film is a bad-tasting exercise with a title-earning scene where two pretty supportive ladies are literally cut and eaten by cannibals, the highest point of the film. The problem is that Lenzi allows us to get a good, long look at cannibal boots and this is a convincing ring of the 3rd season STAR TREK episode with a fake jungle set really gory close-up. And I don't know anybody else, but if somebody splits his person and eats them, I wouldn't just be lying there and seeing him. <br /> <br /> My problem with the film may be that I have a lot of respect for Lenz as a filmmaker and that could have been led by someone. All of your cannibal film conventions are touched, but it never feels that they are filmed with any real conviction except to try and tempt Ruggero Deodat out of the sandbox. Both directors must definitely get to know each other and have some kind of rivalry or actual reluctance on the part of each other's work and a conscious need to raise them. Lenzi invented the cannibal genre with MAN DEEP RIVER, Deodato blew it with JUNGLE HOLOCAUST, Lenzi fired with EATEN ALIVE, Deodato blew her (and all others) away from boss CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST and Lenzi fired last batch of salvo with CANNIBAL FEROX, which is about as realistic as the Krazy Glu commercial, where the man superglues his hard drive beam and hangs in the air. <br /> <br /> This movie is less desperate and a bit more hesitant to push the audience into the abyss of everything that is consecrated as FEROX, which remains a sort of mistaken challenge to CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. It's more of a mish-mash, an interesting jungle adventure with Jim Jones like a suicide culture - kannibals seem to have been added as a successor rather than a movie. I think fans of the genre will have a better impression of the film than fans of Lenz's films, looking for something new in a terrifying director. It is not as much fun as the SLAVE of the CANNIBAL GOD, as adventurous as its own MAN DEEP RIVER, and certainly not the wall of CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. Combine these considerations with recycled material, animal abdominal fatigue scenes, sexual violence, and stagnant misogynist scenes, film making techniques, and what you get as an OK-jungle thriller with two or three tripods, and Umberto Lenzi was able to do so much more. <br /> <br /> 4/10; Gore freaks, however, nuts.
