The combination of animation and live action is the best and most frightening thing that makes you wonder why it was even decided to make a movie in this way, how clearly this technology really didn't exist. Harris is no more than a human proportion and animation are some of the flattest and most lively things I've seen, with the mandatory "trippy" moments (especially when it comes to animation of the cell-type Subtracto character), which made countless copies at the end of the sixties began immediately. The Don Black scenario gives a convincing argument that the traditionally flexible lyric adheres to what it does best, and the pace is so slow that even very young people are bored. Like adults, stay with Jonathan Swift's original novel.
