The main prerequisite for this film is that everyone in the world knows that the person is gay, except for that person. And that man who loves to show stories, has a good taste and has a clean look must be homosexual. Yes, the movie is partly funny, but the basic assumption is homophobic and offensive, that the whole film crumbles something that is quite painful to sit. Performances, especially Joan Cusak and Kevin Kline, are very good.
