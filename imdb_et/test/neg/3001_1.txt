"Northfork" is what is wrong with indie movies. For all of these hard-edged comments and big topics that are attacking, it's not our sacrifice. For nearly two hours, I was tortured and hurt by a film that begins in a new place and ends with the migration of blind people without covering the new land and fortunately dying. <br /> <br /> There are parallel stories about this detail being dying and dying. Two black dressed men (one James Woods) must force the rest of Northfork's residents to leave before the dam opens and floods. Another story is the boy's back to the priest (Nick Nolte) who gave him to his parents. He's dying and visiting him, I think, angels. Among them are Anthony Edwards with bizarre spectacle plays and Daryl Hannah with a weird costume that reminded me of Seinfeld's pirate shirt. <br /> <br /> Although this is a "plot", it's not a movie. Film is nothing. It does nothing, says nothing, goes somewhere and has nothing interesting to show. Perhaps by design, it is more likely that a different, surreal, David Lynch wannabe - we are an important artistic film that you do not see - the direction. The whole film is filtered through a gray background, which I think is suitable for film death. Instead, it makes the movie much more difficult. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie about black men, watch the men in black, not too impressive, but compared to Northfork, they're being promoted to Citizen Kane. If you want to see a movie boy who dies, see Lorenzo oil. If you want to see a movie that destroys the city through the water, look, "Oh brother, where are you?" If you want to watch the movie better than "Northfork", there are hundreds. If you want to watch a movie that is worse, there are only a handful. 0 * out ****
