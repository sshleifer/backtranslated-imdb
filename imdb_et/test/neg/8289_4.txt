A high school woman dies of blood clotting after she has won a community race against trainer George Michael (Christopher George plays him as a big head who is very demanding for his athletes). After school, he can be preserved by allowing his flick to motivate as a possible killer. Some frustrated psychopaths (as many as Michaels have often seen), using their timing of executions, kill a group of dead female runners. Soon the parents were disturbed by Elder Guglionet (Michael Pataki), who knows why their children didn't come home after the prom. Inspector Halliday (Carmen Argenziano) is starting to worry about the campus around the parents' request. Immediately, the imprisoned Michaels become the main suspect after the gym body is in the closet. The gift of Anne (Patch Mackenzie) returned home from Guam to her to get her dead trace of her sister's diploma and soon the killer herself got into a climatic chase scene. Kevin Badger (E Danny Murphy) is a tired boy on a lost journey. <br /> <br /> Rather, the slow-paced slasher spreads the sequences of deaths, trying to mix humor and unhappily. Low-quality killing sequences increase laughter, such as a soccer sword in the stomach, or a pair of garden handles used to leak a poor soul. Linnea Quigley has a fun role as horny student Dolores, who sleeps with her music teacher at a higher grade and always pursues a male plaque (the owner of the wells before she has the chance to stay in Dolores bed). Vanna White has an early role here as a ditsy blonde who discovers a dead gymnast body cabinet. Virgil Fryel has a silly role as an initiative.
