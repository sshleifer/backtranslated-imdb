Seriously ... I'm surprised how good this feedback is. There are two foolish children in this show who make this annoying laugh and make funny things about OCCASIONAL only ... 2 shows, while most other miracles ... as they comment on music videos that I can't stand personally if they either love or like it. <br /> <br /> In most episodes, the only thing you hear is the repetitive "let's go with a little chicks" or "I'll beat your ass into the beaver" or even better and the commonly used quote "it was cool" and above all their annoying laughter. <br /> <br /> If you want a good animated show, try The Simpsons, Ren and Stimpy, South Park This exhibition is not just worth the time or energy it takes to watch this terrible MTV series.
