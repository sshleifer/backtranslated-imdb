I think this movie can be called a film of misguided rage. <br /> <br /> The characters of Joe and Bob were relics of the World War II generation who did not understand their children against war, drugs and listened to rock and roll. But I think their real rage was that America began its long fall from the heights he had left behind. <br /> <br /> Joe herself is a small rented Archie Bunker who is attacking things that have made her angry, quietly desperate, until she and her team are with Compton, who wants to apologize for her daughter's destructive hippies. <br /> <br /> Frankly, most of the film looks stupid, the characters are worse than one, they are ridiculous. Peter Boyle was better off.
