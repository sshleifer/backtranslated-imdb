Don't get me wrong, I love Stephen King! And it's a pretty good movie for everyone. Rabid Cujo is very scary and the film is tense. But after the first few minutes, when the poor Donna and his little son Tad held their Pinto in captivity by St. Bernard, I began to wonder why he did nothing to help himself. <br /> <br /> He could have shut the door and pushed the car back (I mean, it was in Pinto Pete's interest and they were downhill) and rolled up safely, but it would have been a very short film. When he got the car, did he jump it upside down and hoped he could get down at least partially down the road? No, he's trying to make a three-point turn in a bad generator. He managed to get out of the car and look around for 45 seconds at a time to try and get to the baseball bat near the ground - a waste of time! I want to say that if you start running a bat, do it and at least you have something to hit the dog. But forget the bat. Were there no tools in the car, such as the iron of the tire or anything? I didn't see her looking at the car's spare body. Really, why wait until you are bitten and weak dehydrated and your son is in a cramp before standing against the animal? <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, he was beaten and torn, but God was still high heels!
