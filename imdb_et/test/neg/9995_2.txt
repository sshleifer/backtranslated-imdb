Many people said it was a great movie with Hoffman, who gave a great result. I went to a halt of disbelief, despise boredom, almost out. there is not there. <br /> <br /> Hoffman goes all out. he is committed to execution. but sometimes it looks like he is playing the affected man, as if chewing on the affected actress's terrain. <br /> <br /> No movie other than the hood character is much more than placeholder - nell, jack, perry, shawn, sheriff all in one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film shows the tampering, pranking, dishonest side of the bonnet. it shows them so many times that I started thinking about why - do filmmakers think we need to say everything? and again? and again? it often refers to the genome of the bonnet, but does not show it. it shows that it is surrounded by fans and flatterers, but never convinces us why. <br /> <br /> But my goal is not to deconstruct the movie. I'm sure others have other interpretations. for me it was a two-hour film that seemed like five.
