I'm surprised that so many comments on this movie are positive. Having read the book several times (and all other Mika Waltar's historical novels), there is nothing good to say in this film. If I forget the origin of the story, I can consider it a reasonably good epic. Of course, such a book has been commissioned to bring to the big screen a task that should not be envied, but it can be done with a class. I don't understand why even the name of Nefernefernefer had to be shortened only by Nefer. I love Peter Ustinov, because Kaptah and Marlon Brando would probably be better Sinuhe, but the general attitude is too Hollywood to make the book fair. Mika Waltari left this film in the middle of the ledger exhibition. He liked him so much.
