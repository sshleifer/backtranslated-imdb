In the first 5 minutes of this movie, I knew I was one of those "pick the mistakes" for a certain movie. Operation was terrible, the script was even worse. Whoever lets those people write this kind of crap for a movie must be Komodo's own feeding. In the case of Russian Mig gases, which are US Air Force jets, and pistols that can miraculously shoot 50-60 rounds of fire without charging, there is a bad detail for each story. One scene kills the forces of special forces at night in the Komodo, while in another they explain how the chest and beaver are cold with blood and do not come out at night !!!! Also with the fantastic special effects that are available in today's movie industry, they were just on average with this low budget movie, even <br /> <br /> All that was said, I was looking at it in the end for curious what other breastfeeding bad film production could produce. Shame shame on shame, making such a rotten !!! <br /> <br /> This movie should have been on the floor of the cutting room !!!
