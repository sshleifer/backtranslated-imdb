Was it supposed to be a comedy? Black navel and skeleton mask are fun. There's like a baseline. The archaeologist and his assistant start the film. They mention a little reputation for their excavation site. And then, look and see ...... dropping a Halloween costume man dressed in a shiny black cap, with a scarf mask, holding an ax. So he kills these two people. Then we cut off Predator's poorly-imitated forests, the Halloween costume man, now riding a horse, only hunts! More manners are shown, but these people have to be a hidden group. Yes, production probably ran out of costumes. Do you say a low budget? Anyway, they come to a single Indian man sitting in the woods. He's just too funny. And he's gonna hit something, but you really don't know what he's mumbling, so they come back to some Indians who kill. None of them really make sense. And then we'll go back to our commercial community where more will be killed. And it is basically a plot. It's so ridiculously bad, you just can't really look away because you want to see how low it is. You can make the same movie with a camera, a Halloween costume, and a lot of friends with fake weapons. Don't look at this thing if you want a horror movie. If you want comedy, maybe? Or just skip and get something real Predator.
