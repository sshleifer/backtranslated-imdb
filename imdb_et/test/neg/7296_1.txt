I watched this movie with the Nazis, a French archaeologist and my former girlfriend on a small island in the Mediterranean. <br /> <br /> When the tape started, I and my girlfriend were tied to a wooden stake farther from the cave than the area. I told him he would close his eyes and what happened to not open them. The Nazis and the archaeologist did not close their eyes and after a few seconds they started shouting. The Nazi faces melted and the archaeologist's head exploded. <br /> <br /> After a few seconds, the VCR came out of the camcorder and landed back in the box and the upper clip closed. I and my girlfriend stayed intact. <br /> <br /> As a result of this experience, the video cassette was placed in a wooden box and stored in a huge storehouse of identical wooden boxes that was never seen.
