to think about the future of Iron Eagle. In this case, once was enough. Iron Eagle was good at watching the movie. Although unrealistic, it is still fun. Iron Eagle II has a nonsense plot and can be used to treat insomnia. I didn't even bother watching Iron Eagle III, but looking at the R rating, I assume it's more violent than the last two movies. Well, Iron Eagle IV is probably the most uneven sequel. Lou Gossett Jr. Always a pleasant "Chappy" Sinclair. Another Jason returns to fill Doug Masters' role (Canadian Jason Cadieux, who looks like Jason Gedrick from the first Iron Eagle). But wait (here's a spoiler) ..... Did Doug not be killed in Iron Eagle II? Writers must have given hope that they would revive Doug Masters by saying that he was a Russian prisoner. This film was the cheapest of all Iron Eagle films. Why do filmmakers need to follow up on unpleasant movies? (eg police academy films). I've always liked Gossett Jr to work in these films. He was the only one who kept this turkey together. We hope this was the last Iron Eagle sequel. let him rest in peace.
