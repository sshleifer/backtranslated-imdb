I really don't know why, but I looked at it quite cautiously. Unfortunately, it was placed incorrectly. First of all, it is not horror, it does not scare and (if it was not even worse than I gave it credit - which is possible) does not try. It's a dirty comedy and the fact that I smiled once means I gave it 2 not 1. This movie hangs from Gremlins in a really special way, I can't say I've ever seen a movie that devotes more to itself. Very, very bad - avoid.
