OK, it was a "risky" move to rent this flick, but I thought I had nothing to lose. Well, I was wrong. This is the worst "horrormovie" beside "Bloodsoft" I've ever seen. Crappy actors, dirty technical output, dirty story and so on. But music is not bad. That's why I give him 2 votes and not just 1. And of course the cats are a positive surprise. By far the best players in this movie ..... Don't try or buy it. Stay away from it and hope that this terrible, terrible movie will disappear into some hidden existence and will not become a "cult class". It certainly does not deserve recognition.
