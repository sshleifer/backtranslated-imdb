The person who wrote the review and the sloppy review of this film is either an idiot or a fan of amazing films. From the very beginning, it simply spoke of "The Descent" cheap ass ripoff, which is a much higher film that certainly won't start slowly. <br /> <br /> Since the first "Cavern" moment, I was surprised how bad it was, how it was involuntary and superstitious, as badly written, badly behaved and badly targeted. This is undoubtedly one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life and that says a lot, since I recently suffered from "Pulse". I can't believe that this garbage actually won prizes, which simply shows that marijuana and other illicit drugs are much better in Australia and other countries than in the US. <br /> <br /> Scenes where a group moves from a "creature" to a poorly targeted, especially slowed "upside down" camera, designed to show disorientation, but that come only as a cheap effect by a first year film student in a suitable way for their teacher . <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this "director" will probably go on to other films that are likely to be of the same low quality as this "film", because I'm sure he hasn't learned about his mistakes that were excessive in this picture. <br /> <br /> If I had my way, the whole cast and the team would be sent to the river without a password. This film is a crime against humanity.
