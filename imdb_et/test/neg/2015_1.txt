Greetings from Lithuania. <br /> <br /> This is the first question that will appear after watching this "movie". <br /> <br /> You know, I saw a lot of bad movies in my life, but after watching it, I only had two questions: 1) Was it just a parody (junk) <br /> 2) How can people create such a thing!? <br /> <br /> If you never saw this movie, you really don't know a bad movie. I mean BAD. Script - are you kidding? Acting is so terrible that I'm an "actor" where it's just fun in this movie. I know it's a "B" movie, but come on? Should this be the reason for the garbage? <br /> <br /> Oh! And what ends !!! Must End! Just when you are that it's the worst thing you've ever seen, wait until the end - because it will end up seeing you (and I hope you never see). <br /> <br /> Avoid this "movie" at any price and don't say I didn't warn you ...
