I once spoke to my parents who said that in the 1940s and 50s, British cinema visitors would check to see the film's country of origin before seeing it. It doesn't matter what plot it was or who it was when it was an American movie, people would like to see it and if it were British people, he wouldn't want to see it. It may seem like a ridiculous generalization, but after seeing ASTONISHED HEART, I understand why people these days preferred American cinema to a home-grown variety. Back in the 1940s <br /> <br /> British equity lacks working class members and it shows this movie. Everyone talks about the English lad dee daa top class accent that makes the British royal family sound like a working class and what it is to dispose of a large number of potential British audiences who would undoubtedly prefer to see Jimmy Cagney at WHITE HEAT because people would have it if it wasn't bound an empathic violent gangster that is more cinematic than some high-class contractions in 1949. It's entertainment, the reason people go to cinemas. Even the names of the characters seem strange - Leonora! How many British people were called Leonora in 1949? And the main characters drink cocktails. And they use words like "Auster". You will feel that it was not sold to the British public in 1949. But why should this be the case when most British cinema visitors in cinemas are in cinemas to watch much more fun American imports? <br /> <br /> Watching HEART HEART In 2005, I was surprised when everything was all, in fact, it's dated so I thought it might be HARRY ENDFIELD SHOW. What was not surprising to me was that these types of movies were close to the British film industry's sinking, an industry that didn't start investing US money in folks like ZULU, ALFIE and James Bond.
