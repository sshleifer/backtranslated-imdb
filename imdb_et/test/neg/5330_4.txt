I was frustrated by watching many friendly comments here. Boy, are they down again! In order to give it 9-10 points and call it "one of the best films of the 1990s", it is simply unjustified. The big problem here is the lack of pace and the paper plan. It's like Prozac's stroke. Everything trickles down predictably and countless. The plot's start is weak - two dumpers laugh at their foxy neighbors, murder and destroy the conspiracy of waste disposal - and the film will never go further. There are some fun situations and good things to do, but it's not anywhere near enough to record the movie football. your time?
