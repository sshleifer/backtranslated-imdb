Let me say that the new He-Man comic does not destroy the memories of childhood, because I also did not like the old He-Man comic. I loved the figures of the deeds, but I found the cartoon to be funny and I hated logic (He-Man, who I liked, was a very early comic cartoon where He-Man was barbaric, the power sword was divided into two parts and there was Prince Adam, neither Shazami-ripoff nor Orko). Anyway, we leave old things alone. <br /> <br /> The new He-Man comic (or at least this pilot) is shameful in itself, it is the worst joy of both old exhibitions and the worst tendencies of today. I watched it because I had heard of the old show's morals (luckily) gone, and that was more of a sword game and character evolution. But I met the terrible mishmash of the worst clichés in the genre, the signs I couldn't but hate, and the inevitable visual style of Matrix-esque. <br /> <br /> I think it was a good idea to give the characters a little bit in the background, because it showed the skater before the face peeling, but how far the character's development goes beyond the normal age I see in the following episodes, where it Teenybopper Adam learns the responsibilities of his new acquired powers, blah blah. At least in the old exhibition, Adam was not spoiled! I found myself hating in anger. We can do this by putting out a pre-teen adventure exhibition: beautiful faces and wishing-and-and-young clothes. I have to check for new episodes to see if N'Sync is a special look. Is it human, does this exhibition remind me of the 1996 Flash Gordon Stinkbomb! <br /> <br /> Dialogue? Ha! That's why all the clichés of the book, from good lil-two shoes from Randor to the opening image, to Skeletor's immortal "Oh and He-Man ... I lied!" at the end. And Skeletor's voice is still as high as in the old series. 20 years and something we haven't learned. <br /> <br /> And nowadays, there's nothing to do with remote control that isn't Matrix-style. Leave Anime Japanese, people, think about fresh ideas. Not seeing the character in the struggle did not help. <br /> <br /> Of course we have the usual PCness dose: Evil-Lyn (now I mean who the hell is giving up) names?) is not yellow, but gray-ish. Oh, so no Asian people offend. I bet Jitsu won't show up for the show. The 1996 FG tones again, where Ming Merciless was green, a toad stranger! <br /> <br /> People complain about Cringer's freedom of speech. I don't think I would have liked it any more or less when Cringer was talking, he's funny enough. And you have an extra amount of Orco for your cheese! This is a shocking thing, probably many people who (rightly) hated Jar Jar Binks could be big fans of Orko ... <br /> <br /> I looked at the length of the function and I have had enough. Leave the series alone. 2 out of 10.
