I don't understand why some of you (or many) have given this movie upwards of 8 stars out of 10. Do you realize that the reason is lower ratings? Of course, it can be a zombie flick with some splatter, but that's it. I'm not a zombie hacker, but it was terrible. Really, I really should call it more than zombie soap, because that's how it works. Production is ... well, okay. Barely try the plot development, terrible actions, stupid effects, clich√©s and a sudden end. Go ahead and like zombie movies, but never give it over 5.0. Honestly, the only reason you want to watch this movie is to laugh. Seriously.
