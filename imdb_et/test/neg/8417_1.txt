Okay, enough. Every time I think I have seen a movie that is so wrong, so bad that I think nobody can find a praise, I just came to IMDb where I welcome the usual failed masterpiece "" big movie "- frankly, what kind of movie are you looking at because it's not a confusion I just watched on a new Fox / MGM / UA DVD. There are about three amusing lines and a plot that will give a new meaning inconsistent. it just stops and the final credits start, then there is another scene. The DVD is relatively sad for the film. The source material is almost completely faded to the ugly brown. It's hard to imagine that this movie followed Get Carter. Critics and the public got it back - It was a lamb and a box-office catastrophe and justifiably, but you keep trying, and I'm trying to keep finding a movie that doesn't have anything to talk about.
