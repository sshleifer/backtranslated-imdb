I just can't believe that the people who did and did this movie took it seriously. The SNL sketch looks more real. Everything was ridiculously fake. Silver armed forces, ridiculous fists, dialogue, fast-paced background music and even Bo's eyes. If it had been counted as a comedy, it would still make more sense, but it would still be bad. I see it as "entertainment" only when you get a room full of stoned college kids watching it as it was in the Rocky Horror Picture Show. Imagine some of the things you saw in Blazing saddles, as Mongo knocks down a horse or an old lady with a stomach stroke. Now imagine that the manufacturer wants you to take these scenes seriously and you will get this disaster.
