As far as we could welcome a film that deals with people who have different challenges with romance, I can't let it be recognized that this movie was intended for a direct-video class C porn movie in which either A) participants supported explicit scenes or B) manufacturers ran money for adding money (amazing thing if it was true). <br /> <br /> I had to go into the background Why I had rented it on the ground due to the amateur gutlibity that showed that it reflects the sexual theme of John Waters' style of humor festival. Okay, I laughed a couple of times and it certainly has a sexual theme (although most can't be stimulated in any way). But for some movies, you can rewind to make sure you've heard the dialogue right - about moving on because you already know what they say. But there's nothing to go on, so just go back and forth on the shelf.
