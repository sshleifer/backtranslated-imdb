The Boston Blackie films have some strengths - mostly because the pace is fast and the hero is happily uneven even in the worst conditions. But drawing is often cruel, and uneven comics often kill the temple (if the plot is atypically good) or just uneven and inappropriate. Shelter (Steve Cochran is a very poor result) who has become fixed to the beautiful Nina Foch (who puts on a nice, rather fine job). Of course, Inspector Farraday believes Blackie has gone into a murderous maniac (at least it has evidence of that) and is trying to improperly imprison him because Blackie goes after the real killer. The plot has opportunities, but at any time when the real tension goes, we get no funny comedy. It doesn't seem like someone in Columbia realized that in a movie about the quest for a truly dangerous maniac, the cute little comedy scenes from hiding an inconvenient body from the inspector would disturb any incredible will. (One concludes that our wise hero is an idiot - a deadly movie like this one.) <br /> <br /> It's not worth the time. For a well-drawn episode of this series, see Alias ​​Boston Blackie.
