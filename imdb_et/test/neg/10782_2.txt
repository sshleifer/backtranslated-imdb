If the dear reader has never heard of, this film was the main inspiration of last year's Samuel L. Jackson-Eugene Levy clunker The Man. This 80s-soaked girlfriend-comedy couples briefly with Billy Crystal and the late Ethiopian Shim-Shammer Gregory Hines together as a witty Chi-city policeman who doesn't follow the rules. This is the scope of the film. Hines is somewhat higher than the delivery of Hines lines, which is horribly similar to Will Smith and now well-known famous actors like Memento Joe Pantoliano and Jimmy Smith of NYPD Blue. My favorite scene is, I know, car tracks the tracks, I guess. Basically, I just look at this movie as an important handicap to take action. Well, this and deadly weapon 4 ... and hurry 2 ... and man ...
