Yes, I was in trouble watching this movie when I was in a younger friends' house because her mother was a teacher and she wanted to watch the movie and see if the parent had any inappropriate scenes that the parent could object to. Of course, as those who aren't funny jokes, I thought it was clear, funny jokes and a strange scene where the look like Ernest strikes the girl. So yes, Ernest is thrown into prison because of his appearance and he is trying to escape and there are other things as he magnetizes at one point, taking pictures of electricity and very painfully flying to the finale. There are a couple of jokes, but nothing to mention, except the soap carved weapon. I think this is the only scene I or my friend's mother laughed at. That and the camp are the only two Ernest movies I've ever seen, and what I've seen in them won't watch other movies. Ernest was good in small doses, but the film is very much, even if it is just as short. I can see that the movies made money, mainly because everything you need is Varney and its location and theme and you have your own movie.
