A young woman, Nicole Carrow (Jaimie Alexander) and her boyfriend, Jess (Joey Mendicino), are targeted to the kidnapped serum killer when they stop at a "stopover" at a distant stop. <br /> <br /> What could have been more intimidating in more competent hands, proves to be a confusing, unreasonable confusion in John Shiban's sloppy direction (who also wrote the script). There are lots of juicy violence, short nudity and confident performances, but the silly script leaves so many unanswered questions to the viewer that can't help but be disappointed. <br /> <br /> There is a surface, the film plays like a usual "killer-on-the-loose" movie, but Shiban (ex-writer of X-files) throws some of the subtle supernatural elements that suggest His goal was something else completely: a ghost story, the rest of the stop acting as a home of a charming spectrum to punish sinners. <br /> <br /> Reading a movie, looking at the theories of viewers here at IMDb, and looking at the extras on the DVD, some plot elements will make a little more meaningful (although there are still many unanswered questions for even more information). In my opinion, not every film that requires a lot of research to understand itself (only partially) is especially good.
