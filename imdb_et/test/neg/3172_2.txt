Trying to make a somewhat comedic but serious film about Marijuana Cultivation, Stephen Gyllenhaal (director) fell into a couple of bongs that fell short of a good movie. Although the majority is amazing, this movie is not very difficult to sit around. The behavior of Billy Bob Thornton, Ryan Phillipe, Jon Bon Jov, Hank Azaria and Kelly Lynch was unable to record this movie for failure. It would be wiser to tow a three-dollar bill behind the toilet to check this movie in a local video store. <br /> <br />
