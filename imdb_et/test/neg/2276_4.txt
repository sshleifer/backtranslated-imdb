This four-hour minisport production is about two hours longer than necessary, mainly because the filmmakers had no clear idea of ​​how to adapt the novel to the screen. They do not seem to know what should be kept and what could be safely omitted. The film opens with Sir Walter reading from Peerage's book, which is his main comfort in his worries. It introduces the family - who we all become familiar with in the next four hours - but has little other purpose. Similarly, scenes where Muslims are saddened by "poor Richard" have no purpose but to drag the story down. Part of Austen's actual dialogue is separated into different characters, and some of its narrative is reused as a dialogue that is inconvenient to the character languages. Some dialogue is also there and it is equally horrible. Scene where Charles Hayter bored Henrietta with his worry dr. Shirley's damn, the book was only interesting as a narrative; as a scene in this production, it is stunning. The Cobb scene where Louisa falls and is "inanimate!" Is absolutely urgent and I was wondering if the Wentworth line "Does anyone help me?" it can target writers as well as other participants. <br /> <br /> This production often looks out and seems to be filmed rather than a real movie, and it's the most obvious action that is a fine contrast: flourishing line delivery, exaggerated gestures and actors who have no idea what to do with their hands, feet or faces if they don't speak their line. Charles Musgrove stands in his salon, in the width of his legs, and seems to be talking to the balcony (if there is one) when he talked to other people. The face of Louisa Musgrove, if she did not actively simulate or strangle, seems to be confused. Louisa is a dirty, giggly, ditzy creature, and I have not believed for a moment that Wentworth would be interested in her. <br /> <br /> Costumes are mixed, but mostly the terrible and Anne Elliot green tartan dress is probably the toughest alleged period ever developed. We are given dates at the beginning of the exhibition - that is, at the end of the 1790s or perhaps already in the early 1800s - and many costumes seem to be Victorian in design and so about 60 years too early! The hair is just so wrong that I don't even mention it here. Except to say that I don't mention it. :-) <br /> <br /> This production does the right thing. Mrs. He is given the right importance to Smith, and his history with Mr Elliot, his dispersion and his intrigues, has been fully addressed. I was also delighted to see that at the end, the "reconciliation" scenes agreed between Anne and Frederick, which are a valuable reward for the reader, were glossed in the 1995 production. <br /> <br /> If you love this book Feeling confused and even dimly like the 1995 film, don't waste a moment (or penny) on that production; you find it very bad.
