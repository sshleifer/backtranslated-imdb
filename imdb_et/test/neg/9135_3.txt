The first two films of this series stand out with their natural world and ordinary people in the middle of society. This film does not have the kind of natural material I understand, is part of this point, but it really makes the film like a part of the video as random images - these and zeros fly around, computer models per person skeletons, and so on. Sometimes it has a good film effect (nationalism / finance segment about 35:00), but usually it does make a video of inadequate content and requires you to accept the context of context photographers rather than context. Director. It is no better than the video displayed on the karaoke machine. Three stars have been added to the Philip Glass soundtrack.
