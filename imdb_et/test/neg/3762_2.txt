I bought "Rocketship X-M" on a DVD in two packages "Destination Moon". Now I see why the distributors did it: someone who ever saw this movie shouldn't buy it. <br /> <br /> I can't figure out which school system has shown RXM is "big for its predictions about how space transport would take place ..." Run up straight and make a 90-degree better circle and circle faster and faster Until you reach the speed of escape ... I don't think I'll remember this Apollos program. Do not forget that astronauts should be weightless without switching off the engines, gravity changes the directions each time they pass through the engine room. Month, but "missed"? No problem, it's just jump-jump and jump (with a helping hand from the divine province) and you're on Mars! And if you want to put Mars to life, given the planet's knowledge in 1950, it was a forgiving convention for storytelling, but can you look at them at least with LITTLE's alien? These marches looked like "10,000 B.C." I can accept some scientific mistakes, but it does not move above the middle class. <br /> <br /> And this is aside from screaming plots: 12 minutes before the launch (as you are reminded), the ever-annoying PA voice, saying "X minus so many minutes") astronauts give a press conference! I think the time crisis is why Dr. Eckstrom did not change his hair and tie before going into space. And how comfortable that, although they were planning to go to the moon and had the appropriate pressures, they brought hiking mechanisms (and rifles) just as they arrived at Mars. They are happy that they landed somewhere because they were probably designed to land on a method that Dr.E should look out of the window and say "to the pilot" (Lloyd Bridges) to turn them off from time to time. Note for XM-2 Designers: How do I give a pilot a window location? <br /> <br /> Based on earlier comments on random sexism, which had eye-crystallizer Dr Lisa (Part Massen) doom them all, turning their fuel calculations repeatedly, but hey it was in the early 50s. He was there to fill his sweater, not a useful feature. <br /> <br /> "Rocketship XM" is remarkable because it is one of the first films to say: "ohmigods we're all going to beat us here with A-bombs," but it can be noticed without 77 minutes of waste By the way, this message could have somewhat more impact if the budget had had money in the ruins of Mars city, not just the matt paint. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the "good" bad sci-fi, a unique "future" he'd seen it before, and with a natural sense of humor, you'll find when we look back 60 years ago to the audience's nausea, but this movie must be offensive even then. "Rocketship XM" doesn't even fit into MST3K style lightning. Sometimes it's just bad ... bad. /> <br /> Anyone want to buy a DVD? I use only once, I swear.
