This movie was terrible. This is not something people should see. It seems that some Christian group did it to transform people. I do not understand why it appeared in theaters and not on TV. <br /> <br /> It started as an old-fashioned B-film sci-fi movie from the 50s, but quickly changed. Approximately 30 minutes into the film, the characters start talking about "God" and "Do you believe in Jesus?" It quickly moves to a clean area of ​​religion. <br /> <br /> I thought I was going to a Sci-Fi movie. The film has a bad performance; bad camera angle and it's amateur. <br /> <br /> PREVENT IT!
