The basic idea behind ENCHANTED APRIL is great - two very unhappy women meet and decide to spend their money on renting an Italian villa for a month. To cover the costs, they get two more strangers. What makes it interesting is the relationship both before and during the holiday - especially that shows how this beautiful environment actually changes their prospects for life. Unfortunately, this good idea completely breaks the two main performances cast by the ensemble, which are so bad that the film is destroyed. Ann Harding has the most important role in the film in a way that makes her ridiculous. His "doe-eyed" expression and free stares make you doubt whether it is a zombie movie or just an idiot! And by making it worse, Reginald Owen plays such an unpleasant and bombing character that I was very close when he turned off the movie - he was terrible and incredible. I noticed that at least one reviewer gave this film 10 - which is very, very difficult to understand. Of course, the film has a great atmosphere and a good plot, but these two amazingly silly performances cannot be ignored as they undermine the rest of the picture. Sorry, but this movie was painful to do again!
