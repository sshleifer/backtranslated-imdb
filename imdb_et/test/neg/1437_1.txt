I do not recommend you watch this movie when you are easily offended. I wasn't even easily offended and this film made me disappointed. It's so nasty. And that doesn't make sense. The whole thing on the Internet is a clich√© and the manufacturer probably did not understand all the "Internet rules". When you talk to someone you can track your IP address. Really? (see sarcasm here). It was stupid. Nonsense. And I didn't even see the end. I can always say, "It doesn't make sense, it's not ..." This film is a nonsense of his best. Nice comment?
