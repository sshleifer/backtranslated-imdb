What exactly is it like to pretend that people "change" things like ski passes and pizza? I can't see the point. I wouldn't be smart or original and it seems to me to be extremely pointless. <br /> <br /> Skyler Stone doesn't seem to be very down or even a nice boy. He has very little charisma and almost everyone can do what he does in this show. The worse thing about this nonsense part is that many phone calls are updated again so that not only do the poor people associate with the other side of the phone, but they also connect an audience that does not have enough time to read the "unresponsive" display about the screen half a second at the end of the show at the beginning. <br /> <br /> Not only that, but he also claims to live his whole life. What's wrong. No one could live such a life, and it says it is not yet another example of getting his show, but it is also one of the most made, blatant bulls hit I've ever heard. This guy is @ $$! <br /> <br /> What makes them think that they are going to all the problems, such as writing and recording a song, getting someone into a painful picture of you and your two companions, getting a dance lesson, and actually skiing in a ski resort is just worth getting free ski passes and free food? What's the point? It's a tremendous effort to go to just a few ski passes and a little snow. <br /> <br /> As far as "comedy" is concerned, it is at the bottom of barrel affairs.
