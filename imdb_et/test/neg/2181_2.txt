I bought this video from a video store to the table, waiting for a good lie, which was rewarded with the award-winning Brit sex comedy. I think I should have read a finer print. I rarely write a review, but here goes. <br /> <br /> These gay role players really play a lot of precious movies with your memories. This comedy was a very cruel joke at the expense of actors, theater and all of these prestigious films. <br /> <br /> I repeat: there is a joke about the exhaustion of the actors "Other very respectable people on the screen who have this dirty trash?" Is the reference to Austen's classic "pride and prejudice" and "mind and sensitivity" something else? How big is the political statement to produce this melodrama using these letters? Are we just going to take it out when all the participants are gay, and so is their role play influenced by our screen against our faces? I'm sorry, but I don't think so. I'm telling you NO.
