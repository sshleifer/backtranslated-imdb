The killing track is the western part of B, with some major complaints. But it has fallen in Hollywood's history for the most terrible reason. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie with a musical score that can only be described as terrifying, I have the feeling that Howard Hughes was trying to do. singing for cowboy RKO movies. They already had Tim Holt, who was as confident as the B-cowboy hero, but he wasn't a singer. I think Hughes saw what money Herbert J. Yates was spending on Roy Rogers and decided he would get one. <br /> <br /> So Terry Gilkyson, who was a very good performer and a much better song writer, and sang some of his material that wasn't his best and worse, seemed to be fermented. But worse than that, this annoying bark that sang much of the story and honestly overpowered the actors, the extras, even the horses. Needless to say, Terry could never be a cowboy. But he wrote such classics as Bare Needs and Dean Martin's great hit; <br /> <br /> The plot is an internal woman who is stagecoach jewel robbery. That's right, illegal, who are Gig Young, Myron Healey, and Ken Koutnik's Virginia Gray travelers, who get the word, carry some valuable jewels. <br /> <br /> This is a great action for Gray and Young. Young takes her away from the coach, probably fatal to death, and they behave correctly in listening to the scene's passengers, but what she does slips her. The last places where the authorities could watch it not run away. <br /> <br /> But when they flee from robbery, they are tired of horses, so they stop in the cabin to take some substitutions and shoot three Navaji who is against it. It makes Navaj back to warpath, not helping one of the victims was Ric Roman's brother. <br /> <br /> This is a situation where Captain Brian Donlevy's fortress has to deal with when the coach and the laws come under protection. How it all works is predictable, but it is a terrible sort of excess. <br /> <br /> This is actually a problem with the killing track. It is simple, not in the west of B, which has become something almost grotesque. <br /> <br /> But the real cause of the killer trail that came in history is that this movie seems to be the official start of the blacklist. Originally, Howard DaSilva was supposed to play Donlevy's part and maybe had his scenes completed when Howard Hughes officially fired him for Communist compassion. His scenes were fired entirely under the leadership of Brian Donlevy. <br /> <br /> Given what this movie has changed, I'm not sure if Donlevy or DaSilva should have thanked Hughes or won him for private storage.
