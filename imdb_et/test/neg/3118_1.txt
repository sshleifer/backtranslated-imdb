The film has a very short scene in the Deneuve bath. She looks absolutely stunning to a 56-year-old woman, but it is the only sustainable arm of the film. Otherwise, it would be pointless, an unmotivated script, and no leading actor in Deneuve's complaint. The director obviously watched too many Peter Greenaway films and Pola X came over as a student imitation of Greenaway's style without her inspiration.
