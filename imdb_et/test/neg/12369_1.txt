San Franpyscho: 1 out of ten: So you want to make a sequential killer movie. But your budget is non-existent, your camera's equipment is elderly and your stars are Joe Estevez (Martin Sheen's younger brother and a very badly-made headquarters) and Todd Bridges from different shots. You will probably be able to watch at least a watchable movie. Quiroz brothers have no clue. <br /> <br /> First of all, it seems that much has been cast in the desperate attempt to make Bridges and Estevez look like Oscar caliber. Really how hard is it for a priest or a glorious mother to play? Certainly, a city in San Francisco has some professional participants who want to work a few bucks and screen credits. It is clear that Chris Angelo and Bonnie Steiger, who play these roles, also have other talents, such as a landscaper or waitress, which they should fine-tune. <br /> <br /> Joe Rosete as a killer (yes, the serial number is just a "killer") is quite terrible also for the mentally ill method, but I'm almost ready to give her the suspicion that her character is written in zero style or personality. A boring almost ridiculous serum killer is a problem with a successive killer movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, Quiroz's brothers seem to have originally planned this week's ABC family movie. There is no nudity or violence to talk about, and the R-rating is clearly an adult-style pace. It moves like a 85-year-old woman who is surrounded by sunglasses and her introductory signal. The only occasional horrors come from the illumination that Estevez's face dazzles to look like his lower jaw. <br /> <br /> I wasn't expecting a big movie when I rented San Franpyschi, but I don't even remember boredom.
