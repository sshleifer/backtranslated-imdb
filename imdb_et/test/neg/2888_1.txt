This flick is worse than terrible! It took a good story and made it schizophrenic in the cinema. Photography is extremely amateurish. . . Looks like the fifth graders home-movie project filmed with an 8mm child camera. . . it seems that editing has been done by someone with psychotic repercussions (drugs and booze), where the scenes are short, followed by other, independent scenes and then segments of the cut scenes. . . totally unnecessary and free. . . missing scenes. . . day scenes change inexplicably at night, then suddenly back in the day. . . obviously there is no consistency. Tom Skerritt, Wendy Hughes and James Mason's good skills are wasted, as are the "key" supporting abilities - forget the villain and the Anderson women - a very amateur actor. This movie is a good candidate, even if Skerritt and Hughes. . . just do it this time professionally.
