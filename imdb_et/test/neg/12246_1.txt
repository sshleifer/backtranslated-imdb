I'll prosecute Comebacks for everyone who enjoyed Date Movie and Epic Movie. Your people encouraged the Fox studios to continue their desperate parody films, and now we are faced with what just might be the most downright and desperate one. Comebacks is barely a parody. Heck, it barely qualifies as a movie. It is a theoretical comedy, but not a filling. Someone, not even the people involved in this confusion, could have deceived themselves to think they were making a funny movie. Director Tom Brady (The Hot Chick) has done something that is really sad here. <br /> <br /> The plot, if you call it, focuses on Lambeau fields (David Koechner). When I heard her name in the first few seconds of the movie, I knew I was for a long movie. Funny names are rarely funny and become even less funny, the more you hear. Lambeau is one of the worst trainers in the world, but his best friend, Freddie Wiseman (Carl Weathers), has given him another chance on behalf of the coach of the Comebacks, a high school football team. Lambeau must not only lead the victory, but also teach the clichés of inspiring sports films. She hopes her children will have poor ratings and problems with alcohol and will laugh at them if they don't. If it seems that the team has the chance to play in the big Bowl Bowl game (whether the 10-year-old wrote this script?), Lambeau is shocked to discover that Freddie is a great rival team coach to whom his team can play. It turns out that Freddie only encouraged Lambeau to do the workout because he wanted Comebacks to be lost. <br /> <br /> Comebacks is both a forced and pathetic movie, I was almost hard to believe what I was looking at. Hidden movies have recently become a "movie reference" and continue to tradition. He tries to squeeze as many references to other sports as possible, but he doesn't do anything about them, expects us to just show the screen and laugh out of the unknown or try to be funny and fall on our face. Some of these films are Field of Dreams, Bend it like Beckham, Rocky Balboa, Friday Night Lights, Stick It, Radio, Miracle, Remember Titans, Gridiron Gang, Invincible and Dodgeball: True Underdog Story. But wait, did Dodgeball not be a parody of already inspiring sports movies? In other words, we look at the parody of the inspirational sports parody. If that makes sense to you, you're just an audience that this movie is looking for. Some of these films refer to the plot and some (like Rocky) are simply thrown away for no reason, because the filmmakers wanted to try to refer to as many films as possible. There are some that the film even needs to explain to us in our dialogue, just in case we have obviously referred. You know the movie is in trouble when it comes to writing our jokes to us. The worst thing is that the scenario of TV veterans and first-time writers, Ed Yeager and Joey Gutierrez doesn't even know the first and most important rule of the parody - you have to play it directly. Participants must pretend they are not inside the joke. The reason why classic Zucker Brothers films like the plane, the secret and the naked gun are remembered so pleasantly is that they put serious actors like Leslie Nielsen (yes, she was a serious actor before she turned to comedy) and then threw them into ridiculous situations. It is funny that they acted like they were not in comedy, and kept the stone's face against the wonders around them. These films would not have worked when they were playing their tasks widely. This shows that all participants are forced to play their roles as funny as they scream at us. David Koechner keeps his hand bleaching, swelling in the eyes and screaming at the top of his lungs so he looks like someone who knows he's trapped in comedy, and just tries to feel he has a good time. The film also does not understand the art of celebrity art (also an important factor in parody films). What kind of comets we get in Comebacks? Andy Dick and Dennis Rodman. <br /> <br /> By the time the movie threw out and the very useless musical number Journey "Don't Let Believe" for some reason, I was almost ready to leave the theater. I was the only person in my screening and the idea of ​​the movie that was his ruthless way to the totally empty house that I liked. I sat through the rest of the Comeback and I didn't get paid for my efforts. The sad thing is that Fox hasn't yet made a spammer. They have a parody of 300 that will come out next year called Meet the Spartans. I'd say it might not be much worse than that, but I saw a trailer, and I wouldn't want your hopes.
