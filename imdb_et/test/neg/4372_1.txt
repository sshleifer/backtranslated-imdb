I really don't know why I agree to watch this movie, but as I did the perfect fool and for doing it! I had seen the original Killjoy, I say I've seen it .... I started watching it, but I found it bad that I looked at it at 4 times to get over it and get rid of the annoying dialogue, but I I said I look at it and did it even when it was 4 times. <br /> <br /> Killjoy 2 will cut off a long story to kill Killjoy. That's why I don't mean a plot, I mean a complete and complete dirt bag called action and bargain. I have nothing against low-budget movies, I really enjoy them, they are something other than Mega budget blocks, but this movie is just terrible! The action is devilish and the script ... well, I think you could give Stevie Wonder a pen and paper and he would have brought something much better! This movie is just annoying, not to mention the annoying laugh of a clown that is so obviously dubbed! I didn't make this movie anyway, about three-quarters of the way through it was time to turn it off and throw it through the window. Maybe it was buying DVDs, but the frisbee was a bargain! <br /> <br /> Please, humanity will love you. DON'T look at this miracle, it is probably the worst thing I've ever seen, and given some muck what I've seen to say a lot! <br /> <br /> My rating for this movie would be .... Nailgun on / 10
