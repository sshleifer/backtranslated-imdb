As the title suggests, the film has a philosophical, meritocratic thread: if a person has a talent and expects to find his way into society and money, what could be the result of not being taken from the X factor for failure? This question is insufficiently solved in the adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's book and left me quite cold. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon is headed by Ripley and, in addition to knocking his way to the funded squads in Europe, is under his ordered Dickie Greenleaf (Law). Homoeroticism and social insecurity are all confronted with a violent confusion that widened and made it harder for the rest of the film. Damon and Dickie's girlfriend are a bad pleasing Paltrow. I liked Freddie Miles, the head of Philip Seymour's Hoffman, a friend of bluff society, that Ripley could never be. The problem is that the story is without arch or redemption, which makes it difficult to swallow. 4/10
