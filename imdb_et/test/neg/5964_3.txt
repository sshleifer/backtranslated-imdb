According to the masterpiece of this film-making script (red intended), Charles Darwin was utterly pointless in presenting his development theory because he did not mention any alien intervention. You see, the foreigners sent the Chupacabras to the earth and they form the missing link in the theory of evolution. However, the rest of the film clearly seems to have emphasized that Chupacabras is usually a Puerto Rica phenomenon, so I don't really know where it fits. Do they say that all Puerto Ricans are foreigners? Whatever it is, it's all quite irrelevant. The only thing you need to remember is that "El Chupacabre" is a completely inexpensive and glamorous amateur B-film that has no tension, character formation and any style. Many people carry this goat munching monster (much like the Pumpkinhead demon dwarf version) through the ugly city streets and ghettos. We have an untalented dogcatcher and a cheerful female writer, a couple of unpleasant policemen, and allegedly an evil scholar who is with her twilight accomplices. Because they are all very incompetent in what they do, the monster can continue to incite the neighboring Latino immigrants disinterested. The monster itself looks okay and its impact on the victims' surplus is high and bloody. Functional performances are unredeemably terrible and cause headaches. Especially Eric Alegria is in his first and only leading role as an animal worker too ambitious. Yes, it is an incredibly stupid movie, but you definitely have won yourself with the worse and less fun low budget garbage.
