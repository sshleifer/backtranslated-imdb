This movie is so modestly bad, NOT that it is worth it. No effect, no relationship and no lack of dialogue has been badly achieved. Oh, and neither CAMP nor FEAR contains it. Take advantage of yourself and see the original Friday 13th or (preferably) Sleepaway camp, but what you will ever do DO NOT look at this movie. <br /> <br /> Even the appearance of Michele Bauer does not save it from the beginning. Typically, such films are expected to have violence, intercourse and small color and some R&D. Violence was badly done, "intercourse" was ridiculous, Gore and R&D were not abundant in the first 5 minutes, NOT. At least one of those things that has been done properly would at least have been traceable. <br /> <br /> To say at least one nice thing to say, Buck Flower is great, she seems to be the only one who understands that they are striking and rightly hugging it. If everyone else had matched that tone, it would have been fun and fun.
