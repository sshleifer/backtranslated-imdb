I wasn't really HATE Mirrormask. I just wanted more than just visuals from the movie. The film starts with a young girl named Helana, who works in the circus. But if other children (probably) want to go to the circus, he just wants to go out of the circus. Helana wants her mother to have a hot argument to die. Bad movement. Mother sick ... something (probably cancer) and needs surgery. At night before the operation, he dreams of traveling to a wonderful world consisting of his dreams and nightmares, where he "finds himself". Personally, the film started to dream for me. Earlier scenes show the circus's strange and wonderful world, and then contrast with the delicacy of the hospital and the flats of the apartment building. But as soon as he dreams, all the movies go to the CGI country, where almost everyone has a computer image. The problem is that this world of dreams has no secret and no wonder what it should have. while movies like the Oz Wizard seemed tempting to look at Mirrormask, cast pictures on our faces, and then grab them to give us another picture. There is little clothing or reason for designing this film, and while some things are very beautiful (the librarian is a masterpiece), they just disappear so quickly that they will soon be forgotten. Helana and her sidekick Valentine are at worst annoying and tolerant. In general, Mirrormask is like a real bet that you bite and find out is actually ash. Stay with the real world kids.
