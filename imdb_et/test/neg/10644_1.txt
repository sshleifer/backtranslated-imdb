Hellraiser: Bloodline is just a movie. I believe this is the fourth part of the Hellraiser series. <br /> <br /> I missed the beginning and all I remember was some topless women and a box-shaped thing on a computer screen. But, using my intelligence and intelligence (and Info button), I soon discovered that Pinhead was released from Pandora Box, which I think is a gateway to hell. <br /> <br /> In any case, Pinhead comes out of the box and terrorizes the Toymaker family. And that's it. Oh, and not to mention the occasional torture of people who cross his path. Yawn. <br /> <br /> What is happening mainly in this movie is that Pinhead strikes the child and releases the dog on his wife and then kills the random person. Then comes his wife, blah, blah, blah. Who cares? Why it fails because Hellraiser: Bloodline is too scary to be scary. Look at the Pinhead creature: a cheesy dog ​​that looks like it is outwards, two men whose heads and bodies are connected (Siamese twins in a horror movie?) Sort. (I haven't seen the previous movies.) Now look at the main cable. His name is Pinhead. Isn't that the name you call when they're stupid? He has his fingers on his head and his hooks coming out of his fingers and has blue skin. I think he will do a decent cable if he doesn't have such a frightening name and hard speech. Somewhere in the movie, the two police approach and say, "Don't make us hurt!" Pinhead answers "Pain? How do you dare to use that word? I'm a pain?" blah, blah, blah, blah blah. It seems to me a little cliché when you ask me. <br /> <br /> Don't forget the last half of the movie. Characters (and the audience) experience more torture when Pinhead attacks some futuristic shelters. Someone we don't know (Maybe he was in the previous films. I don't remember him at the beginning of the movie.) This scene is basically one thing that is played over and over again: <br /> <br /> The guard goes to mysterious noise control. <br /> <br /> Some other guards: "Oh no! He's down. I'll check him out!" <br /> <br /> After that he dies, the same thing happens again. <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS) Here's something I couldn't. The movie finally ends up with Pinhead at Oblivion. So how does he return to the four more movies? Are they prequels? Why didn't he die in the previous ones? Geez. The makers need to come up with an idea for the second series. (END OF SPOILERS) Hellraiser: Blood is embarrassing and full of torture scenes, but with little excitement or frightening value. Just forget about it. Bad special effects with bad everything else makes it more stabbing than a good horror. <br /> <br /> Good: Some people may enjoy topless women at first. Plus, Pinhead's voice is pretty cool. I think if you like ultra-violence, you can also like it. <br /> <br /> Bad: None of the above reasons make it a very good movie. Drought and recurrence are quite bad. And who calls his cable Pinhead? <br /> <br /> Feel free to send me a private message about this comment.
