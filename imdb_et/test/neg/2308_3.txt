I remember when The Love Machine first appeared in theaters. I was only 13 years old, too young to see a lot of ballyhooed movie images, but not too old to take my mother's laptop copy from Jacqueline Susan's novel to school and get her to go with her schoolmates. br /> <br /> Although I'm not sure what my problem was at such an early age, but I was in the book. I bought and wore an "ankh" circle like a paper cover, and I remember the perfume, "Xanadu" ads that were promoted cross and raised in the film cursively. Despite this interest, I did not see the film several years later. I should have left things as they were. <br /> <br /> "The Love Machine" is the hands of the worst of a number of bad movies that are adapted to Susan's novels ... which, of course, makes it the most fun. There are a lot of mistakes: from your jump curve script that jumps from one case to another with the connecting thread; its dated, horny (brass instruments, I mean) ersatz Bacharachi music score; flat, first appearance; Dull Sexuality - I've never seen such gorgeous gowns before the movie. It's like a fetish! Every time a sex, nudity or something slippery is called, a blue cloth appears! Very strange that; and definitely also the terrible 70's fashion circus train that is endless on the screen. Poor Dyan Cannon's performance (which is by no means large but the rest) has consistently undermined the jaw dropping he has to bear. But the main responsibility of the film is stoic, stone-like John Philip Law like (enough) Robin Stone, the affection of every girl (and one of the top-burning male photographers). <br /> <br /> The law is just terrible and works as if it was pulled out of the street, the pages of the script hastened, and said they were giving a cold reading on the spot. Just inanimate! Not only that, but he seems to need a blood transfusion or something. She can hardly and sick and have several pounds smaller than most of her female costumes. Robin Stone should be a hunk, not a hankie. <br /> <br /> For anyone who finds a movie hard (it's quite slow today), I ask you to stick to the climatic "fighting scene". Here, Mrs Cannon (balancing 23 pounds of bullied hair) finally gives up her current starchy style and lets her get rid of this infectiously frightening laughter by moving to a truly memorable one who should have been the cinema clip now. Trying to get the rival "Puppet Valley" infamous wig-toilet scene, "The Love Machine" finally does something right. <br /> <br /> The unique trash can from Jacqueline Susan has been left behind. Maybe somebody in there has their rights to Rona Barrett's "The Lovomaniacs" and revives the genre.
