With so many horrible movies, this is, unfortunately, a breath of fresh air for the genre. Compared to classic classes like an airplane or a naked weapon, it is terrible, but compared to recent films like Meet the Spartans and Disaster Movie, it's very smart and original. Don't get me wrong, but it wasn't a good movie. I laughed a few times, and there are some inspired gags, but all the references to pop culture fall on this face, as do most jokes from the movie. <br /> <br /> Lambeau Fields (David Koechner) was a bad trainer in the past, but now he has returned to college football and this time he does a good job. Her husband (Melora Hardin) knows her far and her daughter introduces a big stroke of football to her father. Plays the incantations of various recent films, as well as many visual disturbances and stupidity. <br /> <br /> The best parts of the movie are gags that do not rely on references to the latest films. Radio, Rocky, Dodgeball, Friday Night Lights, Invincible and many other sports movies are not at least fun. These are the little gags that can make a few laughs, such as strange foot scratches, or chewing tobacco jokes. These little thieves can't carry the movie and it is hard to see it finally. You have been able to sit in the last 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The characters are surprisingly developed for the spoof movie, but I'm sure the characters are built on clich√©s of the genre. However, they are not too bad. David Koechner can turn off the movie. Too bad they gave him so much worrying material. Matthew Lawerence has a beautiful comic timing not always in the comedian role as a ballet dancer who has a cross-sectional father. Carl Weathers rounds cast, playing again in the right sports film (not in Rocky movies ... Happy Gilmore!) In general, it's a comedy joke. It is funny at times, but more often it is just very annoying and predictable. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 out ****. 90 minutes. PG-13 for language, sexual humor and drugs.
