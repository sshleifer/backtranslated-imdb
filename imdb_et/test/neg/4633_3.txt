I appreciate the "decline of the American Empire" almost below average because it was not terrible, but also not great. I liked very open conversations from people so incredibly selfish and ugly inside and out. This was probably the most original aspect? a sexual film about dialogue with people who are very far from models. It seems ironic that these French-speaking Canadians have a film about neighboring society, which is good when it is condemned. A group of women friends and male friends spend half of the film smiling with their infidelity and accepting such behavior, and the other side is "intellectually" talking about how powerful they are for their speech and action. These are traditional targets in typical sitcomites, where the main characters entertain most of the party occupied by college professors. Unfortunately, my "intelligence" and "history" do not interfere with my mastery. It is their pedestal that is made of ego and more powerful than your attitude that pulls me away and not one sign can be related or similar. If one cries, I don't care less? this is your bed. If anyone complains, I barely bother. What made me beat was a symbol, uh, red. (Another example of fire.) Of course, I understand that this happens to some people, but it was hard to see. And I sincerely hope that he will wash his hands, because he had no trouble eating someone. At the end of the full opposite of the nose workers, they introduce a stereotypical nomad. It made me ignite because someone seemed real; Everyone was as low as their laughter in society. Unfortunately, if no one remained rooted, you were as empty as the souls of their characters.
