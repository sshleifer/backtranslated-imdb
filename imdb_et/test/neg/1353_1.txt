First of all, I should say that I've seen the '39 version at least 100 times; I know the whole dialogue and read the '36 game that differs from '39 and includes its gold clothes. This version is the same as with a live movie adultery. There is a reason why you did not see this expensive TV advertising campaign. According to Entertainment Weekly, Bening hated the evil tone of the original, and how women spent war with each other. GUESS??! It was Booth's intention. It was slippery, a theatrical night of rumors, adultery, and back bites that contained good carriers for Manhattan's social life. The crowd who made this new version did not intend to respect the original source material. They choose it strangely by placing half a scene here and half of the scenes coming from the first version. Bette Midler (who is in only a few scenes and works in the old Count's grid and grinning) has no context in this version. He mentions that after "Buck", which is the main element of the original, he is never mentioned again. This movie is so boring that I'm not going to analyze it, but here are some things I believed:> Mary Haines hugged her home workers: "I can nail the nails out!" Right. Great Letter. Norma Shearer could have read this line and got the Oscar nomination, right? > KOMPASSIONATE Sylvia Fowler !!! ??? Annette Bening got what she wanted, and the film was just like that. Claire Booth used Sylvia as a cartoon engine that played through the game. As Rosalind Russell was immortally portrayed, he was an unknown, stupid woman who still kidnapped a classical and quotable small, ridiculous, irresistible dialogue. He didn't cross Paulette Godard's ankle. The 2008 filmmakers decided that this character must die. When they were killed, they killed the movie.
