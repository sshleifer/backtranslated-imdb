I don't even know where to start ... <br /> <br /> It's not worth the review that I just quote what another user posted because I agree thoroughly, but I give it 1/10 instead of 2 / 10 "I'm sorry to find words to express how bad this movie was. The initial injunction was promising, but it was absolutely terrible. We ran through the main points. The idea, but really terrible development when I thought" no, no one is doing such a fool. "The end was amazingly anti-cyclical. Characteristics - all the characters were totally blissful or grotesque cartoons. Music - intrusive, inappropriate and generally terrible Direction - totally amateur, cinematography - doubt about it being heard by camera corners / stability / zoom levels are often very bad. I'm completely confused about how this movie was so high. It's the worst movie I've been in the cinema for years, if ever. ‚Äù
