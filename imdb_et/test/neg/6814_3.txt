Very rough, very drab, real drama. Why not just make a documentary? That's not exactly Joan's Arc's passion. The only reason to see the chronicle is listening to the performances. I love Bach's music and even it was hard for me to sit in the misery of this movie. Big Gustav Leonhardt plays Bach in two ways. We cannot feel him as an actor because he has done so little to do dramatically. In most cases, he can walk with determination or anger from different rooms. Of course, Bach's life was not Errol Flynn's film. It was indeed quite drab and more than a bit difficult. This probably means that life is not a terrible candidate for the film. Music is, of course, another story. I recommend Bach stations. Much more information, one thing, and some understanding of the music that is, after all, why Bach is interested in us first.
