It is convincing to see that other IMDb reviewers have had a good idea of ​​putting this frustrating film at risk of fighting the great Vadim, Malle and Fellin. <br /> <br /> These leaders can be talented and artistic in their own right; trying to exclude this erotic event and the fiction of the 1960s as somehow * associated with the fetus of Edgar Allen Poe, they were themselves cheating. They (A) did not bother to read Poe's stories, or (B) they read them, but their own egotistical agenda was that they did not pay the Son any kind of mind. <br /> <br /> Imagine Metallica being connected to his guitar, pulling the amps up to 11 and creating 3 chords claiming to be Beethoven's 9th Symphony. It's the feeling you get after sitting on this movie. If you are a Vadim / Malle / Fellini fan (Metallica) then you will miss it. If you are a Beethoven fan (Poe) then you will. <br /> <br /> METZERGENSTEIN ... <br /> <br /> Here we start with the bizarre version of Store. OK, "porn" can be a bit of an extreme haha, but at least you need to call it Barbarella (including, I don't doubt, some of Jane's outfits coming straight from this sci-fi). Vadim gets into his old clichés: a girl who is on a bed that a person enjoys, while a pillow can see apathy in her eyes; a woman's general mercy and foretold who does not find satisfaction with hedonism. Cute stuff, but "Metzergenstein" is not the place. And besides Barbarella's outfits and insignificant erotic themes, Jane Fonda made a terrible American accent and persuasive power as the European county's worst pain from Julia Roberts to Dr. Jekyll & Hr. Hyde's Madness version. WILLIAM Wilson ... <br /> <br /> Here's a great Poe story about the madness that says a man when he realizes he's no longer unique in the world. If you really want to see a fantastic visual interpretation of this topic, see the Star Trek episode # 27 "Alternative Factor". But here, Malle glazes on this central theme and instead focuses on ... any guesses ...? yup, eroticism, sadism and robbery. Ho hum. Brigitte Bardot's role is to complete this completion and once again the director distorts the classic Poe story into her masturbating catharsis of her own sexual issues. Do it your time, Malle. I thought we were here on the Poe coin. <br /> <br /> TOBY DAMMIT .... <br /> <br /> The absolute worst of the three and perhaps the worst movies I've ever seen. At least, Fellini showed some tactics in changing the title, but his departure from the original plot, the theme and the story of humor is so great, I don't know if he chose this reel from the private collection of his households, with the "Store Story" stamp on it and put it to this collection. I made a great effort to find some kind of knowledge about Poe's works, but there was absolutely nothing. <br /> <br /> The original Poe story ("Never Bet the Devil Your Head") is a short and fun dark fabel man who constantly shouts, "I fucking fuck in my head ..." It's a misty morning to fuck to his offer. The result is the worst and brilliant thing you've ever read. It was a tissue, comedian, at its finest (yes, Poe wrote a lot of comedies. Also look at "A Predicament" and "Devil in Belfry" if you want to taste his witty, satirical works). <br /> <br /> This version of Fellini? It's happier, breathless, and not at all funny (if you don't find it funny when you get drunk within 45 minutes). Here, Fellini's egoistic bead is an artist who struggles with hypocrisy, defiance and mediocrity in cinema. Most are set at a prize-giving ceremony where Fellini strikes us with a headache with sarcasm, cynicism and the classic "sour grapes" attitude found in all the film's Fellini films. Note the "sarcastic" "sarcastic" critics that are repeated in Fellini's films. Someone who held himself up to the critics certainly spent a lot of time talking about them to Fellini. In any case, I feel that Fellini just took some outflows from 8 1/2, cut them and sold the story of this store. The worst "adaptation" ever. <br /> <br /> I think I put more effort into writing this review than any of the three directors in making a Poe movie.
