Well, I've been to the British University, actually I went to this movie, and it wasn't like that. It's a terrible, badly made and acted film. The worst thing is that it could have been really good if they were worried about spending more than 12p, in fact, if he really wanted to represent real British students, it should work like one and took out Â£ 15,000. It doesn't say anything about life where there was shrub diving, drinking tea until 4 o'clock, endless conversations about group dynamics ??? Where was diversity and fun? Maybe I'm just romantic, but I don't remember that Fresher's week is so terrible and I'm general. And finally the question remains ... bed or wardrobe?
