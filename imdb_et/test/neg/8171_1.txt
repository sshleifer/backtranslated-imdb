Two days ago I got the chance to watch this movie cable (TV-Asia). I've been very disturbed since then. "Baghban" has been very successful only on one side of real life. It is very partial to parents. Have you ever thought about the other party (kids)? There are few parents in this world who give birth to their children but do not provide better parental care. I'm the victim of it. Why do you want (your parents) 5 children in your life if you just earn Rs 2000 a month? I had worked on the streets with my brothers. I have no idea how I got the IIT from there. It has been a long time since then, but I don't think so. Now I'm a US researcher here. I have given my parents all the necessary measures carefully with my two brothers who are with them. They couldn't give us the basic things when we were kids. I find this film very outrageous. Its very partial. This has deeply damaged my feelings. I strongly urge the film producer / director to look at Indian society from a different perspective and another film.
