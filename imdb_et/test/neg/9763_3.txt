I loved the wonderful Greek landscape, but the story you couldn't follow anyway was even harder to watch in the movie. I can't imagine how someone who watches a movie gets any grip if they haven't read a book, and then, like me, they would probably wonder why Australian Allison changed to French Anne and many other seemingly meaningless changes in the story . The secrets of the book seemed to have been cut or omitted in the film. I saw it coming out for the first time and had the same problems because I had read the book several times. I recently looked at it with my grandchild (very smart at the age of 20 and usually in the movies I like) who were surprised when the young Michael Caine and Candace Bergen were, but he couldn't imagine why he would look at it except landscape.
