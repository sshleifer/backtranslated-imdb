Knowledge of Minnesota, directed by Steven Baigelmann, and starring Keanu Reeves, Cameron Diaz and Vincent D'Onofrio: The tense relationship between two brothers, Sami (D'Onofrio) and Jjaksi (Reeves), is pushed when Jia arrives at Sam and goes down bride, Freddie (Diaz), a former stripper, getting married to Sam to pay gambling debt to the nightclub owner Red (Lindo). Baigelman's writing and management debut is a frustrating confusion, full of hateful characters and lack of coherence. Placing Keanu and Diaz in the same movie should give at least some eye candy, but Baigelman even tries to score this score by trying little to have a positive effect on its participants. Very bad.
