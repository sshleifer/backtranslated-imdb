When one of my friends suggested it to me when I was talking about how well it was filmed, the underlying themes and the overall high glory of the film, I was probably expecting an amazing, at least fun movie. <br /> <br /> The hours I spent showed that it was a huge disappointment for my time. <br /> <br /> I understand that this movie is intended to be surreal, but even in surreal films there is something that confirms it, even if it is to a certain extent. In contrast, this film felt forced and fake. Many shots were unnecessary and watching me thought the director was trying to be artistic. <br /> <br /> The actor was poor and the characters' relationships were not nearly enough. Maybe it's just something I missed by others, but I didn't even realize that there was any attraction between Dae and Migo before they accidentally went through the rabbit to go through the movie. And again, maybe this movie was just bad. <br /> <br /> I am not opposed to film violence, but that's all it takes. During the whole fighting scenario, I felt hunched when it was painfully clich√©. <br /> <br /> And the plot? Remember the word ridiculous. I would be amused if I hadn't wasted my life after two hours of a poorly thought-out and ridiculous plot. Despite all the film's mistakes, I was expecting something interesting at the end of it. I'm not talking about the end because I wouldn't want to "spoil" the movie for those who haven't seen it. Just that metaphor "Let it be a stone or a grain of sand, they will sink the same." it cannot be used to explain everything. <br /> <br /> This whole movie was made for shock value and shock value only. I just hope that sooner or later people will end up being so embarrassed and bad about what it is. I have seen many other great Korean films and it pushes me to have the best of Oldboy.
