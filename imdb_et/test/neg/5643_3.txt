I couldn't believe the original rating I found while watching this movie, 9.5? Unfortunately, it looks like I'm not alone. <br /> <br /> The film is slow and boring, one of the sad things is that if the film had a real rating of about 5 or 6, the expectations would not have been so high. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was not the case, so when you watch the movie and the poor stories and act, I leave him a 3/10 score. <br /> <br /> Vinnie Jones is an excellent locked store and also Snatch, and he plays a very heavy man, but he should play this role. It's a bit like when Stallone and Schwarzenegger have made comedy films, they just don't work. <br /> <br /> He also can't play a leading actor. When he plays a leading position, his acting talents are too "observable" and shown to be not very good. This is another good example of the machine.
