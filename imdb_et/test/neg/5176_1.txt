This is probably the worst genre of chefs' gangsters, beaten by the British film industry, as Mockney Guy Ritchie triggered Lock's ship and two poorly operating barrels. This "True Life" Story from Carlton Leach (Who?) Has everything that is wrong in this genre, a truly terrible script that consists of people who scare "Cant", "Fahcking Cant" and "I kill ya, ya fahcking cant" nauseum. The action is equally terrible, as the two most well-known cast members are two former soap stars quite visible from their depth. For some reason, the film assumes that we have heard of these people and I can assure you that no one is north of Essex and that we should be interested in some low lifestyle. Why? This is not Goodfellas, despite the DVD cover. The story focuses on a football hooligan that turned to a bangers who got into a gangster whose friends finally hit. Boo hoo. The fact that these people are completely insecure is the only small plus in this movie. In all scenes, it seems that the camera was tied with a string and whirled around, while people pretended to fight and the story of which most people never heard and something very interesting does not happen is a waste of time. People talk about how the film is violent, as if it were a great movie sign, and while many big films have violence in them, it's just an excuse for the FX man to show what he can do. In general, this film is a reminder of why the British film industry has disappeared and the sooner we stop financing these miserable abortions, the better.
