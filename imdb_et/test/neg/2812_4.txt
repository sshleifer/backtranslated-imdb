The glory reports of this film seem to be greatly exaggerated, and when other observers did not watch another movie, I cannot see how anyone can find this film other than dull, unpleasant, consistent, long-lasting, and sometimes unbearably irritating. I'm not a fan of horror. I love j-horrors and euro-horrors every day of American horror, but I feel the need to warn all potential viewers of this movie before investing in it for two hours of their lives. <br /> <br /> It may have been so big. The reporter investigates several bizarre deaths and events that seem to be seemingly disconnected, but it seems that a series of nervous thrones are united by them - dead pigeons, noises, strangely connected nodes ... Our reporter goes from person to person by interviewing them, in films and then on. Three important characters are among the people, the young, shy psychic girl, the tremendously irritating, crazy psychic man and the crazy old woman and her boyfriend whose importance is not revealed later. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the movie is not even far from interesting, which makes this two-hour duration unforgivable. It's not even scary or horrible. Allegedly frightening scenarios, such as clich√©s of faces, are done incredibly badly, shown twice or worse, we are told when they will happen. Other techniques like telling us that the family that was interviewed "died five days later" just doesn't make me care, let alone lightly slipped. <br /> <br /> The film will not let you go to the end when our reporter, operator, psychological and cursed wife goes to visit to "remove" those deaths that bind all these deaths. But by that time I was in a state of catatonic boredom and I couldn't care less, so all pretty horrible camera work and punches wasted me. The "final tape" is pretty good, but again I gave up the care and just wanted to finish this movie. <br /> <br /> Bored and boring, not scary and scary. Out of Norol. It has promising moments, but it is a film that was badly done and not worth your time.
