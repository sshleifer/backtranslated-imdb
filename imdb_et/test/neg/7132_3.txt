Let me start by saying that I loved the original Grudge. It was a bar that was not one of the most frightening, hair-growing experiences I've ever met in the cinema. I'm not kidding. My self-declared Japanese philosophy has also improved my eyes (if the device had become a suburb of America, I would probably have hated the film). <br /> <br /> That said ... this movie is a complete mess! I'm not saying it sucks because A) has some good points on the film, B) "it sucks" is the flattening of a flatter bet. So what does it do for the film? Well, the starters have this pretty cool look: with the use of filters and blind, washed colors, Takashi Shimizu creates an almost original downturn, an original atmosphere. Some scenes are truly shocking and unpredictable. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is just bad. Time period. <br /> <br /> The story is all over the place, unnecessarily talking about the style of Tarantino, ie scenes are not in chronological order. This method is meaningless for this film and it just makes things confusing. Frankly, a simple graph would have worked better. Originally, there was no plot-wise, but it made sense and the film is more than a thin plot with a lot of fear and a really intense atmosphere. Grudge 2 doesn't have any of these elements, and it's just a waste of time. Do not forget that TV shows are skills that make the face of the original Grudge look like Emily Watson and Katherine Hepburn. Simply put, the movie doesn't work. It's too slow, too boring, and just not scary enough to make up for the confusing plot (which by the way doesn't make anything new, so even Grudge fans aren't happy). <br /> <br /> Oh, and what is it like when an old man plays a Japanese peek-a-boot on a bus? Should this be a comic relief? Artistic statement? Or what?
