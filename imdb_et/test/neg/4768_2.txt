I've recently watched many of Wixel Pixel and Sub Rosa Extreme movies and found them a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> This SRE movie seemed a lot easier than everyone else I've seen. Perhaps this is because it is more like a comedy / horror movie than a straight horror, and maybe it is because humor didn't register well with me. <br /> <br /> It's a little less than seventy minutes long and credit starts at the beginning of the last ten minutes. There are some extracts, goofs, and behind the scenes of ongoing things, while these credit rolls are. <br /> <br /> SRE films tend to be short and tend to feel padded. This is no exception, some scenes that tend to go too long. <br /> <br /> The story includes a poor child in Christmastown, California, who has been chosen by all his classmates. He had stolen one shoe and he couldn't replace it, he was called "Oneshoe McGroo". Because of the obsession with pirates, his parents gave him an eyepiece with Christmas tree embedded in the eyepiece for Christmas. <br /> <br /> Many classmates are killed and a few are left to decide what to do. They are chosen by McGroo one after the other, lurking in the ring-shaped bells. <br /> <br /> Characters are pretty much all the broad stereotypes, such as Dorkus, etc. a scene where a kinky couple has sex; The woman is handcuffed and eyes closed, the man wears large paper watermelon over his head. It reminded me of some of the strange sex scenes from director Rinse Dream. <br /> <br /> Image quality is good and there are many add-ons. But basically a pretty silly movie. <br /> <br /> Well, I think you will never get too many Christmas horror movies. However, there are many other poor holidays.
