It's a flick of space or at least I think it's. You have half-hearted female prisoners in a prison room and a monster in a space station using a virus to infect humanity through sexy encounters. His Friggin fun. Action is so bad that space nuts look like an Emmy award winning film. The story is simple. The prisoner of space will be able to reduce the punishment by exploring a space station that has lost contact with mankind. He finds the doctor "experimenting" with women and angry with the alien. He fights with them, so on and on. This is a film that you should see to moisten your pants with laughter. If you like real sci-fi, it's no-no, but it's a great mood for a setter amateur film maker because I can make sure their movie is better.
