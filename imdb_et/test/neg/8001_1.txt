This movie doesn't have redemption features. The story is incomprehensible and the script is harsh, sadistic and stupid. Sex Scenes is a joke, as is the inevitable chase of a car. Music is terrible. Action is largely limited to chewing and smile. Half of the stars. Shame on DirecTV for being paid for. In the theater, people can throw the screen soda.
