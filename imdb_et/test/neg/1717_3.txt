I've read all the reviews directly on the video. I agree that the film is not of "Armageddon" or "Deep Impact" quality. However, if you are looking for a way after ninety minutes, it is a film that is tolerable. <br /> <br /> I started watching the movie at the beginning of AM when I did some geek things. It was very nice because I was able to switch back and forth between what I did and when I was watching the movie I couldn't win. This is a predictable film and the actor is not equal to some veteran artists (such as Dennis Hopper). <br /> <br /> But I should note that I only paid $ 2 (US) and when the old message goes: you get what you pay! If you are looking for a movie with a deep meaning that needs to be viewed over and over again, this is definitely a long video. On the other hand, if you are looking for something that passes out of time, there is nothing wrong with Talk (which was also called Mexican "Comet: Final Impact", where I found this video).
