I've been watching hundreds of kung fu movies and I've heard something good about this movie, so I decided to try it out. What I saw was one of the worst examples of film making I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can't help but feel the director wants all the muscles in Hong Kong to be in this movie. Everyone goes beyond stupidity. Even Conan had some civility with the barbarian. This film has semi-developed men screaming in every scene and foolish women who have no self-respect. The narrator's character would have had to suck so much ... he didn't want to end. The whole film was a melodramatic mess, terrible, bad leadership and bad action. They should just have renamed this movie "a fool with an armed cave with a blade". Here's the question ... why do some directors use fast cuts for some movies? Answer: To hide the shortcomings of the participants. each scene was close and quickly cut without any flow. The film tried to show this intensity, but it became almost ridiculous. Please leave this movie away if you have any taste in kung-fu movies ... or the taste of movies.
