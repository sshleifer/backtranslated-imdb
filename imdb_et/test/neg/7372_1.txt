Please don't waste your time and money on this turkey blow. <br /> <br /> This is a surprising melodramatic love story set in the background of New France (aka Quebec in the 18th century). Or is it a new French historical saga with epic romance? I don't know, and here I don't care anymore. <br /> <br /> There is a rich story that tells about the irrelevant French adventures, criminals and other experts in Canada and the United States. That's not the case. The characters are complete clich√©s, the story is over-inflated, the breath and all the magic, and before all the viewers want to do is get the hell out of the theater, whether its head is controlled and to get this movie was my biggest disappointment in the cinema of the year, especially since historian and french Canadian or Canadian French origin (or any) Canadian I am a) a believer that my nation's story in this country has not yet been talked about as it could be on film b), which is of interest to c) filmmaker who thinks that cinema these days can do wonders with this spectacular and tragic story. <br /> <br /> As I said, don't waste your time with this frustrating little trap.
