There is no way of avoiding a comparison between a cat's hat and The Grinch who stole a Christmas so we take that part out of the way. First of all, let me start by saying that I think Grinch was an underrated and invaluable film. The cat was ... well, just terrible. <br /> <br /> Jim Carey was thrown off because he is a brilliant physical comedian, and he is relentlessly devoted to injustice. Mike Myers fell back on his old trick bag. Why, why, why Mike Myers? Children can be less cared for and Austin Powers demographics are not going to spy on this movie. So, what was the thinking of the studio? <br /> <br /> The cat was probably associated with Linda Richmond. Could we talk? Why the New York Accent? Not fully consistent with what dr. Seuss has ever written. Myers was even allowed to go sneak in his Scottish shtick. I don't know how many different voices the director and the studio tried before they just gave up and said, "as long as you don't say the Fahklempt", you can keep the pressure. "Meyers never felt any comfort with costume, make-up, or dialogue. <br /> <br /> The jokes that were few were inappropriate and old. When Myers picks up a garden shed and delivers it to the camera:" dirty ho " except for the rim of the rim, and even it would not have helped. <br /> <br /> The same people who create "Whoville" were obviously in the hands of creating the city and the "Cat" houses. Dakota Fanning was the only actor who seemed to be aware that she was in a movie based on Dr. Seuss's classics and remained true to the genre. <br /> <br /> Call the SPCA. This cat needs to be castrated and never reproduced again.
