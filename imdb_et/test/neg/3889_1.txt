Heavenly Days is one painfully boring and pointless film I've ever seen. In no way would I recommend it to anyone ... if you don't want to sleep with your children or someone with God, give someone an aneurysm. If I could go back in time and do one thing, I would put the rolls before they were sent to theaters. Why? Heavenly days are simple but extremely vague. Long sequences with no dialogue make up a large part of the movie. The characters are too shallow and ridiculously stupid to associate with them. The climax of the story does not affect you: by that time your brain has worked so hard to find out the plot and hidden metaphor array your ability to think is gone. The only things that work are your eyes and unfortunately your ears, who have to listen to the story of Linda's little girl who speaks like a man. I'm sad about seeing this movie now. Don't let this happen.
