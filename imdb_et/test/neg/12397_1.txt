After the meteorite "Boston" (indeed somewhere on the Isle of Man) landing, a terrible, intertwined alien monster is released, which is loose in the local girls' school, causing the stuff and making the students into zombie-like creatures. This film is obviously the same name as the 1986 release (and stress-free) as it has the same monster but different plot. Both films are terrible, but for the 1986 version, it was traceable. This is not. Let's start with all the problems, acting, especially the leader of the professor, was very bad. This movie should be in Boston (we know it because the filmmakers had a brilliant idea to put the "Boston Police" or "Boston gas company" all), but everyone seems to be quite confused about British accents (at least they didn't try to use Boston accents, thanks to God. Script The best example of how stupid to write is to know that you can return zombie pupils to people by removing a necklace containing a meteorite piece. Will our brave heroes do that? Around Paul Zombie Students, Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote / guided a weak 1995 monster movie "Grim", is not clear on how to further develop his films, the film is sometimes terrible. One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of significant gore: 99% of death scenes are related to the creature coming out of the dark corner and dragging someone away while when we hear that they are "terribly" screaming at a distance. This convention did not work well in the past and certainly does not work. Visual effects were effective. The CG opening order in space seemed to have been created in Microsoft's Slide Show for God's sake! The "explosion" of gas tanks at the end was just as terrible. Okay, I like to consider myself as fair criticism, so I'll give credit when the credit deadline is - the effect of the creature was actually pretty cool. You should love the close-ups of slippery, comforting teeth! <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie "The Breeders" is a terrible, cheap-made horror film that should be avoided like the Ebola virus. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10.
