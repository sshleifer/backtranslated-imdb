Every great romantic comedy needs a conflict between romantic leaders to skip the plot, wait and tempt. This story is absolutely flat in this area. There is no conflict - at least one that does not hinder the actual joining of the two leaders, and so the relationship is smooth, is not foreseeable, and there is no temptation at all. <br /> <br /> Chemistry between Richard Gere and Diane Lane is the best friendship, and with the talents of these two specific participants, I was quite surprised. During the movie, I waited for them to play more checkers and talk in the weather if they saw a moving passion. <br /> <br /> Although I'm a fan of both actors, I believe this movie was off - or maybe it was out and it was affecting their supplies. Writing was very weak, which could also have influenced performances; certainly the script could have used some help from some Harlequin writers who have real experience in romanticizing the heat. <br /> <br /> This movie may be worth the rain on Sunday afternoon, but only after that cheap shelf. <br /> <br /> (Sorry Diane Ladd and Richard Gere).
