This movie started with some promises: a big name, good-looking sets, but then broke down. <br /> <br /> Most of the time you can't say whether it's a serious movie or comedy. One minute they talk about not having fun in killing and the next is a fighting style set for funny music and funny beating. Piper Perabo. He also gets some nerve lines like: "When I get married, it's love." Ugh. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about this movie is that it's just boring. Not enough action, not enough humor, not enough plot, not much. Just a lot of clich√©s and cheesy moments. <br /> <br /> The movie "Dragon" should also contain much more dragon than some (and pathetic CGI dragons) that appeared in this movie. br /> <br /> Can a SciFi channel show * no good movies?
