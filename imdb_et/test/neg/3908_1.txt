About five years ago, I visited my friend and I had a video rental shop to see something. My friend saw a room on Truckers shelf and so we got it. When we arrived home and started to look at it, we realized what the absolute piece it was! Beer can swim in space? Is the boy who takes the dump? A man with a mechanical dick trying to get women out, saying, "shout, hell!" WTF !!! The most stupid, stupid, slowest, terribly thrones that have come into contact with the trash. My friend and I still call it the worst movie we've ever seen. Only one other movie has come close to its crappines (and it would be stupid Jackie Chan flick, "The Medalion"). If your eyes see this piece on the shelf in the video store, do the following. 1. Take it off the shelf and throw it on the ground. 2. Turn it on for at least 30 seconds. 3. Continue setting up the fire in a closed room (bathroom cover). 4. Finally, take it immediately to your local hazardous waste disposal facility for proper handling.
