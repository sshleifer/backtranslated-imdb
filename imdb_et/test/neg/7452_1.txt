I've seen this movie many times, it is definitely one of the cheaper action strokes of the eighties. So, I think many viewers would definitely change this channel when they find it. But if you're in a big trash, then you've got a Dragon Hunt. The main characters (McNamara Twins) are athletic big mustache and see ridiculous dresses as ridiculous. One of the best scenes is when one of them starts to shoot and hitting the enemies is still nirvana. This movie is really terrible, but then again it's a great party ribbon!
