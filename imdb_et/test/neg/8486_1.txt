This film is a real shame, not just because of the plot, the lack of characters, the director and the whole team's creativity, it is perhaps one of the worst films ever made and it is hard to believe that this is one of the 90's most famous films. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of The Mask when I went to watch the movie I was expecting with a good sense of humor, film with acceptable graphics, a very bad copy of Chuck Jones and Tex Avery cartoons, the movie was not Funny for my 7-year-old sister so I don't know: What was wrong with New Line Cinema Was it trying to repeat the success of the first movie or trying to create another masterpiece like Lord of the Rings, because when they did, they were completely in their minds.
