Back in the cold and scary at the beginning of the 90s, "Family Matters" exhibited and became an instant class. The trick was to buy a manual in normal family situations and their solutions, and add some experiments to the sarcastic remarks, and you were a cute little stealing-on-the-wrong, the parents are right-handed. So it worked well, so Bickley-Warren had a new ambitious plan: to make the exact same show. <br /> <br /> Here's the difference: "Family-related" was Urkel. "Step by Step" is a "Kickboxer" son-as a result of no one saw. He says things like "dudette" and "dane-master", but somehow the audience doesn't have to hate him. I mean seriously, "dudette"? How can you even get it against your lips? <br /> <br /> The rest were mostly white versions of the Winslow cluster with some one-dimensional or zero-sized characters, such as a stupid boy (JT. Well, Eddie), a smart girl (Laura) and a beautiful girl who spends her day beautiful (theoretically). Grover and Cookie Monster are deeper than the Lambert family. All the milk in your stereotypes is just what they were worth. They weren't worth much. <br /> <br /> Supporting a massive laugh-and-cheer tape for something stolen from something funny, this show aired for a whopping 7 years, which was degrading competition. Although, you 'll notice that this is the time when the family sitcomid were pretty big hits, everyone just ignored their crappyness because well, it was 90s, another dirty show didn't hurt.
