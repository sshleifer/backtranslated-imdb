This is a classic type B movie that you don't want to waste your time and faces. It started well and I thought it would grow as a good thriller, but I was wrong. The whole film will have the feeling that something interesting will happen soon and it will suddenly become a tense thriller, but it will not happen. It runs slowly and peacefully to the end, but there's nothing interesting about it. Just the ending was unexpected and original, but that is the case. Vote: 2.5 out of 10. Oh, one more thing. Why is this movie R still rated ???
