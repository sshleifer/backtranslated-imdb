I saw this movie because he had a giant man and it was labeled as a monster movie. I don't understand why it's called a monster. Film is drama. I was expecting a lot of destruction, but what did I get? Most of the film was a relationship-related problem, and people thought the woman was loony because she saw a spaceship collide with a gigantic interior for an unexplained reason. The activity started a few minutes to the end. Since the woman was killed, is it not a murder? Wouldn't they have done anything but his murder? If you look at it because you think it is, because it's marked with a monster movie, don't look at it. This is not a monster movie. It's a drama.
