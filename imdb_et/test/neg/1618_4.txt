Thanks to foolish horror films such as "Troll" and the indescribably frightening cult-favorite "Troll 2", it has become virtually impossible today to make films with goblins, gnomes and various other green green hobby blobs. Just recently, I watched a 70's "Do not be afraid of the blind" movie, which is basically a rather terrifying and seriously toned film about the monsters of domestic small goblins, but I was unable to think back on the laugh-inducing potato drinks dressed in the trash bins that ran "Troll 2 ". The same happened to me now. As far as I tried to get into "Settled" with a clear mindset, subconsciously I compared the allegedly horrible and intimidating garden fairies with badly sculptured goblins Nilbog! Even without any prejudice, "Settled" is a remotely entertaining, albeit unmemorable, direct-video-horror flick. It is a delicious, soft and politically correct family drama and a paste of Northern European mythology. The tedious and murderous little creatures of this movie are not your usual average goblins; they are "Huldre": the evil small Norwegian demons who live underground and are trying to trace the families of their families through influencing younger children. It goes beyond the Russell family when they move to their ramshackle dream house in a remote small town. MILF actor Megan Gallagher's cubic blonde daughter starts to behave strangely when she is at the back of the garden in a horse house. She says her friends are fairies, and while the bold masters also warn of strange events in the past, Gina's parents just think she has trouble adjusting to her new neighborhood. When he keeps himself on fairy tales, they organize a meeting with a recognized psychologist, Dr. Werner, while "Huldre" has slowly come out of his botanical shelter. This is not very special here. Speed ​​is acceptable and attempts to establish intercourse are pretty cute. You understand that this is a family-friendly horror movie, so there are no bloody murders shown here. Heck, even a family member pet cat is kept on the screen. This is a fourfold absurd horror film that opens Malcolm McDowell and almost always depicts an unreliable, greedy and selfish authority.
