This movie is a dead tie whose original is made for the worst film. I think it may be a little worse than anything. SPOILER ALERT !!! Here are the surviving ships that have long been covered. Unlikely? No - POSSIBLE. The whole assumption is so ridiculous that it's not funny. There are some pretty big names in the movie, and even they couldn't save that. I find it a waste of good cellulose. After that I also saw, unfortunately, that it was a waste of my time. Don't bother about that. Or the original of this thing! I gave it to 2, mainly because they threw 1 vote.
