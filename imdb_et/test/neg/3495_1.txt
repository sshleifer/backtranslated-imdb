I went to the movies to wait for a big movie based on all the verbal and horrific reviews. the moment when the starting sequence started, I knew I was in trouble. music and loans struggled with such hard emotions that I wanted to bring. all I got from this movie was clich√© characters, thoughtful dialogue, and a meaningless script. director / writer Paul haggis' has managed to get great comments with his manipulative, independent writing, but it doesn't deceive me. some results were good. Don Cheadle is always good. I think Terrance Howard is a bit overestimated, but he was decent. ridiculous was on the nose. he should stick. Brendan Fraser was good. Jennifer Esposito made no impression. I can't find anything interesting about him. Sandra's bull is always the same for every movie, she's just fine. Matt Dillon was very good and I enjoyed watching him work. Ryan Philippe was also good. but as much as script and sadness management - it is actually one of those films that is so annoyingly bad that I actually wrote it since then. I do not recommend this movie to anyone that is a waste of time.
