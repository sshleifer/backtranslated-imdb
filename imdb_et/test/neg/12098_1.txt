This is one of the worst anime series I've ever seen. When I looked at the review of the manga in the magazine, I thought it might have been interesting, but when I got the chapters, I realized it was a total stupidity. <br /> <br /> OK, the first 2 or 3 chapters are OK, and the series has a standard. But as the plot progresses, it becomes completely inconsistent. The series is trying to show a mystical, based on Christian mythologies, but it is a total stupidity. It has some demons and stigmat scenes ... Totally crap. It seems that the series tries to look deeply thought-out, complex, or mythologically reviewed, but an observer with some brain and cultural references will soon realize that all of these elements are not in the real sense: they are only driven by the latest chapters full of nonsense elements: battles with cat-like demons, references to the alleged fight between demons and demons who control time (for no apparent reason). The final is completely pointless; an unknown observer sees a floating finale on it, giving them the opportunity to meditate; but the truth is: END AND FULL SERIES IS AN INDEPENDENT AND MISCELLANEOUS NONSENSE.
