Jerry Angell, the best mullet of the Zombie horror, returns more to Undead's action at the daunting homemade gore festival Zombie Bloodbath by director Todd Sheets. This time Jerry plays a buggy low-life cut-throat who, together with his equally despicable partner, some escaped convicts, several teenagers and a number of screaming girls, is facing a battle game. be even worse than the original? the impression I thought was almost impossible to achieve. The action is evenly weak, the impact is amateurish and inexpensive (most of the gates are nothing but cuttings, offspring and blood of local butchers' shops), the story is incomprehensible (as far as I can understand, zombies) rises out of the dead because of the scare commands they !!!) and the direction is frustratingly loaded with cheap-looking video and a totally useless cut in black and white. <br /> <br /> And as it wouldn't have been enough to convince you of the lack of complete redemption of this movie, just a mysteriously moral end should make a trick: some of the remaining survivors stumble upon an abandoned truck that comes comfortably between bacteria that eat meat. the passenger seat is just what it takes to dissolve the Undead (but strangely enough, it is not damaging to maintenance).
