This movie was overwhelmed by Amazon.com. Had ever heard of this release, but three reviews were given to him by five stars and robbing comments, being a lover of German films I bought a copy ... <br /> <br /> I have to say that I was not impressed. The production values ​​are cheap, the story is derived, the characters are less than involved and for comedy it is surprisingly short with a smile. <br /> <br /> I wanted to do this, but I found it just empty and dull. Or maybe I was expecting more independent German cinema than gay-spin The Full Monty and stereotypes. <br /> <br /> The movie has a bite that makes no sense, like one leather coat trying to get Eck's insane - as if he'd even look at him twice? Or a terrible ex-spouse who got up in the competition but ended up with his stranger gay? Bunkum is not a word! Well, at least it explains the movies in the UK title, I guess ...
