just i just watched this movie just because i got it and i have given these 4 stars just for him, on the other side This movie was just one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was terrible. The script was not used. It was a film that in itself contradicted. The film was sloppy and mischievous. I don't like it when I was expecting a good movie. Just something to jump on to me or two. It hadn't even done that. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the more I think about a general parcel, the less sense it actually makes and the more holes we find. Really ashamed because I am pretty sure there is a good idea that lies somewhere there ... <br /> <br /> I may be a bit tough, giving the film 4/10, but considering the participants and again SARA is obvious in writing talent, this movie really should have given much more. <br /> <br /> This movie is just nonsense, I can't put it otherwise. It is known from the beginning that this is a mess. <br /> <br /> Story, dialogue, acting, special effects, make-up, pretty much everything sucks. I like vampire movies and I know they have never been Oscar winning movies, but it's not even worth seeing, I can't believe how someone produced this thing. <br /> <br /> It's not even about vampires, it's still a dream / reality experience. The film's development is inconsistent, the motivation of the characters is ... There doesn't exist, everything seems to be a big joke. Maybe they tried to do that, but I doubt it. I'd like to know what they were trying to pull, but it's just upside down, it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life (and I've seen a lot of bad movies but nothing compared to it) Please do it yourself and don't look at it. <br /> <br /> PS It's also full of clich√©s! P.S. 2 Bad script, bad management, bad cinematography. P.S. 3 I looked at it when I commented on it for everyone.
