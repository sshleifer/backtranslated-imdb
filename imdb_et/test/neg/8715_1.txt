It's amazing that some people saw it as art. We saw this as a badly filmed (dirty hand held camera and all), (generally) malfunctioning, unscrambled confusion that seemed more like a high school movie project where children experimented with black and white film making. The poetry injection instead of the story is not an art film. When we looked at it in the theater, people began to endure their revenge, endless confusion with endless stupidity. And believe me, it seems endless. If we had finished our candy and popcorn, we would have gone out of the theater with two other dozen people who offered up and looked for something interesting.
