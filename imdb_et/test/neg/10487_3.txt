What? - Was that so? City sheriff (John Agar) blows a mutant gorillas in a dummy with a hidden dynamite stick? Did I just write it? Did I just see it? <br /> <br /> What is Wildcats' instrumental, "Night Fright" is a momentum that has never deserved to be done in 1967. Gorilla's flowering period was much over and no one other than the Ray Corrigan monkey suit just needs problems. Repeat this in black and white and the story nearly thirty years ago and you would have at least 4.0 on IMDb. But unfortunately, it would never have seen the daylight. Sorry, there is another rainbow - you can never tell if the story is day or night, because they seem to be interchangeable. <br /> <br /> I'll give you that, a few early scenes from the malt shop seemed like they could have aired as Coke ads. Thinking about it now, they were probably the best and the best illuminated scenes in the picture; Coca Cola has to pay for them. Had they seen the film, they could have avoided this release better.
