A colleague from work said that I was watching this movie because he thought it was one of the best films. So I watched it. First of all, I have to admit that I don't like traditional movies and prefer to watch the true meaning of movies. <br /> <br /> And that's why I don't like such a movie. It does not mean any meaning. It's just a funny, silly, boring, fun, absurd and exciting part. <br /> <br /> First of all, I thought this movie might be a real mystery thriller (reading German packaging), but the movie it was too mysterious for me. <br /> <br /> David Lynch may be able to combine the most diverse images, but the composition tastes good for me as well as the combination of milk and beer. Both are pretty good, but together?
