The quintet is celebrated by Paul Newman and the only action of director Robert Altman in science fiction. Newman was told he couldn't do comedy, but he tried until he was genuinely successful with this genre. But the failure of this movie left him in the arms of the shy and he didn't try it again. <br /> <br /> This is one of the biggest downsides I've ever seen. This is a futuristic ice age brought by the one who knows what, but it is probably a nuclear weapon. Even in the thousands of years of ice age, the equatorial parts of the earth still survived the lives of animals and humans, but probably not here. The seals have been preserved and Paul Newman is a hunter outside. <br /> <br /> But hunters need a small R & R and Newman goes to a futuristic city where things are so boring that natives play some kind of game for six people and it's sort of Russian roulette. To win, you have to kill five other players in your game. <br /> <br /> It's sad to see what a person has achieved. What is one of the reasons I just didn't get this story? The atmosphere is gloomy, the story is gloomy, people are blind, it's all so grim. No wonder this thing came to the office in a short time. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that almost everyone thinks it will never be in the tenth list of Paul Newman films, including me. <br /> <br /> This is the future of the human being.
