When I saw the icon on the TV, I was surprised. I know the first clue where this happened was that it was on the Hallmark channel - to be told - sorry! I was hopeful when I saw that FF itself was an Exec producer, but saw very quickly that the only real way the TV movie and the book were similar was only in the name and characters. Telecom had the slightest to say, but I agree that the action was worth three stars per se. In my personal opinion, Mr Swayze could have portrayed a valid Monkit, but I think it would have been a much longer film to make the film fair, and I don't think Hollywood would have gone to the plot. discrediting. One example is the frightening version of "All Fears", which I want to say more?
