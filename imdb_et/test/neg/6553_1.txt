Sherman Hemsley was great at Jeffersons and especially at the Family. He was also very good in Amen, why would he have this movie on earth? This movie is a terrible script and it's a very funny waste of people. Luis Avalos is doing his best, but it is terrible. This film was the beginning of the bankruptcy of Sherman Hemsley. I think he's very funny, but it's a terrible, terrible pointless story. Stay with Ghostbusters.
