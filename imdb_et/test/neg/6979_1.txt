I just suffered this movie to satisfy my curiosity. It must be one of the worst films I've ever been sitting on. I'm surprised that this movie currently has a rating of 7.5 stars. Operation is terrible, the script doesn't exist and characters are both predictable and hollow. For a funny movie, I don't even remember repeating once and see how it could be defined as comedy. Take advantage of yourself and stay away from it and look at some of the more valuable alternatives that would give you much more enjoyment. Watch movies like a vacation or 27 dresses, these movies would offer much more satisfying cinema experience. I sincerely hope that more educated filmmakers will vote negatively on this film, as it really deserves, by giving it a more realistic assessment of what other film fans can make. Come on, let's be honest with everyone involved and give people in the film a real reflection of what they've created - an extremely mediocre picture that deserves to be forgotten very quickly.
