Like most other people, I saw this movie after I heard it from Patton Oswalt. Oddly enough, it was easier to find if I thought it would be. Although it should not be a surprise that I found it to be used. <br /> <br /> The plot title is masterfully assembled. It's a bed that eats. Something more, not less. Trying to throw a story, but not very good. <br /> <br /> The blood of the demon came to bed and as a result it becomes dominant. It eats everything it happens by absorbing and then dissolving what seems to be orange Fanta. There is an artist who fell victim to a bed but was sick and arrives at the house where he lives. Narrative is fully spoken through him. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't talk terribly anything, even if it's bad. However, it is not a trademark without its own charm.
