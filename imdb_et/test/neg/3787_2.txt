Pretty terrible, but not completely unobtrusive. The second review mentioned "predictable" - and it is almost inaccurate. You can play out the next line. Each character is either stereotypical or archetypal. A good man in a bad situation, fighting older and younger priests in reception and discipline, a repressed, sexually / emotionally absent woman who returns to a small town after she was not in a big city, busy with young, weak-minded youngsters. , irrevocable bad guys, two "missing boys" who are looking for a family feeling - they are all here and none of them are even new. In the first few minutes, you can find out what's going on at the end of the movie. The story is not completely flat, but direction, action (even from some talented members) is thrown out without skill.

It is also one of those films where the ignorance of small details is reflected in even more striking light. (For example: a nurse and our hero travel to the city, but park several chapters of their destinations (post office and hardware store) - but both walk between empty parking spaces for no apparent reason or during the morning-to-night hours that seemingly should take no more than half an hour. such things and then they are unlikely to be unmarked.
