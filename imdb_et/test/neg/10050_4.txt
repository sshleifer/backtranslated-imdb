From time to time, it is highly desirable that aristocracy look at the silent film of the ordinary people's harsh life to remind them of the privileges and comfortable life they have enjoyed since the beginning of humanity or even before? Compared to the difficult and hard work that ordinary people have to endure on a daily basis, because the aristocrats rule the world. <br /> <br /> And this happens in Dame France Marion's first movie "The Love Light" is now famous and talented in the world thanks to her work as a screenwriter; it is better for him because his career as a film director does not impress that German figure. <br /> <br /> The film speaks of Dame Angela Carlotti (Dame Mary Pickford), a cheerful Italian girl who lives in a "picturesque corner" (a major difference between upper and lower classes; aristocrats prefer to live surrounded by "picturesque luxury"?); he has two brothers and a secret admirer, but everything he gives him is indifferent. The fate begins to work hard and soon the war has been proclaimed and the two brothers of Dame Angela are recruiting and the next roll is both dead. But fate is even cruel and Dame Angela falls in love ?? german !! And worse, he doesn't know that his German sweetheart is a spy and that the light signals that he is sending him every night from the lighthouse he claims to be a signal of love, does not mean "Ich Liebe Dich" but "sink any What a fucking Italian boat on the sea "<br /> <br /> Fortunately for Dame Angela soon her sweet German spy will be found with her house neighbors, where she hid her (not a strange fact, indeed, because it is not an easy task for a German to miss? ), but German spy prefers to die before these Italians grab it. an unborn child (evil Destiny in full swing?), but a greedy neighbor who has a special idea of ​​motherhood, takes her son with the consent of the Catholic nun who has taken the Trent Council to the extreme? a fact that puts Dame on the border of Angela's madness. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Dame Angela's secret admirer has come back from the war and you may think that Dame Angela will eventually improve her sad life; a big mistake because Destiny keeps her that the returned soldier is blind. But as they say in Germany, it may be a hidden blessing, and finally Dame Angela restores her son and starts a new life in a dark Italian village with her dark gold, which should be a happy ending as the German said earlier, Dame Frances Marion was much better off he continued his screenwriter career, because, as seen in "The Light of Love", he had a lot of imagination to invent incredible stories, and wohl! ?? but a completely different topic is directing films and his silent debut lacks emotions and rhythm despite Dame Pickford's efforts to engage the audience with many shame. The missing film story gives the spectator an indifference, making it a movie where only Dame Pickford himself offers interest and not his circumstances. <br /> <br /> And now, if you promise, I must temporarily take my departure because this German Count must send Morse signals from the Schloss North Tower to one of his wealthy heirs.
