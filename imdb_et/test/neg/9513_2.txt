It's by far the worst version of William Shakespeare's tragic masterpiece I've ever seen. It seems that filmmakers do not read Shakespeare's text. No, they just took what they wanted from a movie by Lawerence Olivier. The plot is uneven and has diminished to the imperative need, but by the time the canon Olivier created an intense hint between Hamlet and Queen Gertrude. Could we have instead replaced "something in a dead country in Denmark"? Casting is another problem. I understand that Branagh's much better film had its weak bits (Robin Williams and Charlton Heston come to mind), but it has very few good moments. I like Laertes and Polonius, but the rest is hidden. Mel Gibson's horrible shadow is irritating and often wonder whether he has a clue what he says. Many actors seem to have just remembered some of them - they know less about what is said as high school sophomores. <br /> <br /> If you want the Hamlet version, check out Kenneth Branaghi or even Lawerence Olivier. To be honest, even Disney Hamlet is better.
