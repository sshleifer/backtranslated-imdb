We are not in the distant future, it seems that globalization has reached a high point, languages ​​are intermingling (although the English language is over the rest), the races are united, human cloning is a fact and the whole territory is divided into two zones: one valid and non-valid ... a brave new world (Aldous Huxley style) where people are genetically presented and blood relations are strictly prohibited (for health reasons - this is the title code 46). In such an environment, there are two souls who are not bound to meet. <br /> <br /> Winterbottom had an important story with great potential. A nice recipe he is destroying, giving him such a slow rhythm, narrating it so tired, removing all the emotions ... Cold, it's all code 46 transmits. Cold and boredom. Nothing can be done to record a movie, even if Samantha Morton and Tim Robbins (both play a great role), as well as the visual and audio power of some sequences. Damage. <br /> <br /> Code 46: What could have been and never been. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 4/10
