This movie is bad, but if the producers had used REAL KANGAROO, he would have killed an actor with whom he was a boxer. I am from Australia and I have seen two male seven-foot male Root who fight against each other, it's not quite prominent because the object is against one or the other to kill that opponent (this is the way to secure the female herd) and there are incidents, where somebody has put a canopy box on and is damaged or dead, so if you see a kangaroo on a TV or movie, it's probably a woman or animated because it's a good idea not to harm the participants (they can interfere with the loss of breathing ability. It's a strange idea that Australian animals are cute and spooky, this is wrong, many are dangerous (10 of the most unfortunate snakes live here 10) and most of them are just ugly (Koala is as soft as stealing the wool) so when you come to Australia BE MAINTENANCE !!!
