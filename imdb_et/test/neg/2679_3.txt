You will never get into the story ever since it's not a very well-built and buildable film. symbols in it. Dr. Loomis seems to be just because he's in it. It is a real shame that it was supposed to be Donald Pleasence's last film role. It's a nice and kind of costume that her last role is on a Halloween movie, but she's definitely deserved to be better. Michael Myers is never threatening or scary. Perhaps it is because it is too prominent in the whole film, quite early on. He does his usual things again, but without excessive class or originality. Also, Myer's past does not try to reveal, because the main reason it just isn't very well explained. It is obvious that the script went before filming and also very likely through filming. Several scenes that were even taken off again or added after the first cut were far from pleasant. <br /> <br /> The film's appearance is more often made on TV. This is also due to the lack of a real good gore. In the absence of a horror film, it is basically everything that makes it good or even original viewing. <br /> <br /> So far the series is the worst! 10
