Get a CD instead. Exhibition is tame and editing sucks. The crowd gets too much screen time, as does Till Lindemann. Cameras spend more time with the same child, shaking their head in the same way (which makes me believe it's exactly the same shot) as Richard Kruspe's solo Weisses Fleischis. The scenes change so fast that it is impossible to tell where the camera is directed, and repetitions are simply superfluous. It is not worth the tape that is stored.
