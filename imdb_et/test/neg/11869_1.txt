Okay, bad. This movie was not just bad, it was very bad, with line4 like "if you are dealing with a devil you are expecting * not from your shoes" then you will feel your ugly movie territory. After watching the movie, I wanted to kill myself and my family, it gave me the feeling of feeling I wanted to kill. don't look at this movie. I will kill again. but when I do this, it has been terribly edited by making a pathetic soundtrack and stockpile for postpay and bad shirts. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the flipside, its first action film, has three doors to the ford sierra. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it reaches the roof of the trash can: (<br /> <br /> Ps: worse than Marksman
