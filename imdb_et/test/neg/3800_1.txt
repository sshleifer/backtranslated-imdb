Empty. Talk botched. AFTER POSEIDON'S ADVICE is bad in every sense. Salvagers Michael Caine and Karl Malden decide to pull the name of the ocean liner wreck on the name of a really lively tugboat. They are challenged by the ruthless Telly Savalas and his gang with a machine gun. This part of the sequel, part of the remake of Caine, Malden and another group of Poseidon survivors make a similarly dangerous trek out of a sunken ship. This group includes Shirley Jones, Slim Pickens, Peter Boyle, Shirley Knight and Slim Pickens. Jack Warden plays a blind man. Surely you want to see the blind after that. Sally Field is especially frustrated about keeping Caine on board. <br /> <br /> Captain Irwin Allen not only produced it but decided to drive it.
