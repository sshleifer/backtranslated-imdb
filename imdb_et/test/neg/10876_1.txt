Or what the filmmakers would believe. <br /> <br /> This movie tries to be so cool to be cool, it's ridiculous. Everybody, from film appearance, cinematography, editing, dialogue and actor, has come to a very cool mode. Just to keep someone from sticking to how cool this movie is, the movie has really cool rock n roll music and twangy west-surf-tex mex guitar. Finally, as a reminder of the coolness of this film, all the actors have ordered to speak with a voice, because, as we all know, it is bad. <br /> <br /> The plot (if there really is one) seems quite simple. But, as someone else has already pointed out, the film's director and star seem to be very determined not to talk about this story, but to focus on a number of naked babes and a dialogue that should be bad but grow tirelessly quickly (do they have a contest to see how many times could they put the words "pussy" and "f * ck" and its derivatives into an 80 minute movie?). <br /> <br /> This movie was absolutely terrible.
