I'm a spooky fan for a long time, and I bought this hype from all the message boards on this movie. Well, let me tell you that I don't know who it was all about, but let me tell you a few things. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie is a lot of things. It's not scary, NOT suspicious, NOT too expensive, NOT too sick (except for one season's MAYBE) NOT BEAUTIFULLY WONDERED .... ALL. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite for this movie is that the couple will flee to a small island in Greece because they are a little nervous in London. We don't even know what they did, but they are expected to kill someone. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler Warning ** <br /> <br /> The male leader kills some of his perversity by "cleaning up the perverted island" strangely. The killings are cheap, the characters are cheaper and the effect sucks. <br /> <br /> There is a part when he rapes violence because her husband does not give her any chance in the morning, but even without any care about doing it. End of Spoilers <br /> <br /> The end of a movie is the only thing that is not entirely predictable. I especially liked the "herder" helping a man. Anyway, if you can rent it and get 2 hours of waste, go ahead. It is nothing better than a processed sandwich with bread. <br /> <br /> 3/10
