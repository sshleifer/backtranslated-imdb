I saw Hurlyburly in Broadway and liked it a lot. I don't know what happened to the movie version because it was terrible. Perhaps a simple dialogue on the stage just sounds insecure on the screen. Anyway, I couldn't wait for this movie to end. Operation is universal. Only Kevin Spacey has it together and it looks like he knows he's in a bad movie and can't wait to get out.
