It may seem strange, but I only saw the first movie (The Imperial's New Groove, yaddayadda) a week ago and only one TV episode. I just adore Kuzco's character, but Kronk is not so bad. Anyway I finally decided to watch another movie so I could have seen it. I hope it is as good as the first, but ... I'm sorry to say that, but the more humor the American got, the more I created. I agreed with Kuzco when he started to cry for the whole cheese material. <br /> <br /> Still, younger kids and probably veterans love this movie bits (if they like the old school moral Disney, which is), but I just had expectations that were eensy teensy a little hell much higher than they would be had to. Kronk is a lovely character with a good heart and buggy at the same time, but it was Pacha and Kuzco who pulled me up at the end of the movie. (I ignore Rudi ... as far as possible). <br /> <br /> Anyway, a great movie, just not my style, and as they say, you must always be true to your groove.
