As a mass fan of the three TV series, I was very interested in the fact that LoG was moving to the big screen. But in my more honest moments, I questioned the likely success of this concept, and whether writers could maintain a high level of clergy, comedy and horror that put the original series in. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, my fears were not unfounded and the film was a big disappointment. I'm trying to understand other comments on this site. Obviously people have a right to their own opinion, but the guys I looked at all agree with me and they are just as big fans as me. <br /> <br /> The actors were not convinced, but they are so good that even if they are not the best, they are still very observable. The main problem was the plot and script. Some laugh, but not enough, for a while, disgusting, but not enough. The worst feeling was feeling emptiness after living in the cinema. So rarely am I so unfamiliar with the film and so motivated to discuss it with others. <br /> <br /> Write this comment as a warning to other League fans - get a broad view of this movie before we see it. If you love the League, you can persuade you to convince them that they have not completely moved. If you are unable to convince yourself, you have an unnecessarily disgusting genius that illustrates the TV series. <br /> <br /> LoG Cinemas? More like a log. (or little brown fish).
