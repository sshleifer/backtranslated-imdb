Why was this movie ever made? They have faded the original Caddyshack against this mess. I was only half and I didn't laugh once. At least I didn't pay to see it because it was t.v. but i can't get back that hour from my life so i spent this terrible confusion. There wasn't one first letter from the first, except Chevy Chase, and he probably regrets making this movie. you want to laugh, look at the first Caddyshack. If you like a terrible movie, it's a movie. This movie smells like in July.
