This movie isn't even good enough for a $ 1 bin in a grocery store. Guess he wouldn't be too selective about his roles at this time. <br /> <br /> The film itself was hard to sit on. They seem to have grabbed the straw in the scene. "The boys at night" had to be the most boring thing I've ever seen. One minute they talk and the next poem? Even the arguments were difficult to follow. Most of the action was lacking in depth.
