Bigfoot Catching is one of the oldest and worst movies. I love Sasquatch and Bigfoot movies, but it's just a waste of time. Great, terrible, terrible! I watched this movie last night, and that was all I could do to finish watching. I realized that this strange crazy man wanted to hit Bigfoot, but that was the only thing that made sense in this movie. It had some fun parts. It seemed to be too long for a movie. I think the director tried to fill the time. The worst thing was how Bigfoot looked. The obvious man in the suit seemed like a pink faux fur Bigfoot. It was ridiculous. Personally, I wasted my time and money for it!
