In Thailand, American Americans Connor (Colin Egglesfield) and his girlfriend Amanda (Meredith Monroe) quarrel in the Muay-Thai fight, and Amanda leaves alone with Connor. He asks the hotel to the stranger, indeed the middle-sized vampire Niran (Don Hetrakul), and he bites and robs his evil vampire gang in motorcycles. Connor joins the "good" vampire clan led by Sang (Stephanie Chao), trying to rescue Amanda from Niran's claws. <br /> <br /> I was expecting "vampires: turning" to be a good movie. Locations and cinema are beautiful; very hard music score is great; Stephanie Chao is proud and attractive; But unfortunately, the scenario and the director are terrible and Meredith Monroe's very flabby costume doesn't help her fallen breasts. The story is very short and unknown Marty Weiss uses a long scene with motorcycle races, battles and a boring setback to complete the minimum working hours of movies. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Vampiros: A Convers√£o" ("Vampires: Conversion")
