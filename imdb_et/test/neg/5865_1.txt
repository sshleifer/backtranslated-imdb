We sat down to think about why this or that scene is in the movie, what is it about the plot? We hoped that eventually everything would be a little clearer. I didn't think it was that way. <br /> <br /> I think the director, who was spicy, threw the script into the air, and then some small (and revenge) substructures gathered it randomly, without taking into account the filmed scene (maybe scissors and glue-proof). <br /> <br /> The movie's motives are bad communism? Nihilism is bad? Bad parenting? Threesome bad? TV Bad? Consistent Scripting Bad? Deconstruction is good? It's not really clear. No German water taxi would ever have an IGA hidden staircase that would allow passengers to get into the water. Achtung marks everywhere affirm this fact.
