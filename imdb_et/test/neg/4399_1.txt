National Dorm Daze is the worst film I've ever seen, and I've seen Kaza. Anyone who reads this, who thinks that the film was good in any way, shape or form, doesn't know what a good movie is, and should never look at another movie again because they are really so stupid. <br /> <br /> It's hard to name anything wrong with this movie. First off, the plot is all over the place and can't follow all the many "misunderstandings" very well at all. Operation is terrible to say, and the whole thing was badly done. Everyone and everyone who worked on this movie should not be in another child's movie that is ever again! <br /> <br /> It's only one or two paragraphs to make a summary of this movie because it's so bad, but no one who read it is not to watch this movie! If you want to watch a good movie, turn on the TV. Even the US has better movies than it does. <br /> <br /> _friend.
