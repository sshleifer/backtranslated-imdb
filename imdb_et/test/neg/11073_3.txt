If it is true that the film costs only 150K, it explains a lot. But that doesn't explain why he doesn't have a real plot. In the middle of the film, I was not honest about whether they did it or not. I just wanted to stop the movie and go to sleep. The end was really stupid and wanted me to just turn off the movie and go to sleep. Really good action, bearing in mind that there wasn't much to go there. If you really have bad movies with terrible light (even a cave) and bad camera work (even a cave) ... then you like this movie. By the way, when the boy's plane collapsed in 1980 when he was about ten years old, how would he forget how to talk and build so much anger? Wouldn't she have wanted to get help from the first people she had seen even when it was 14 years later?
