May contain spoiler or not. <br /> <br /> Inuyasha is not a good anime. It is actually very overpriced. Why? There is no story, no plot, and the display pulls on ... and ... and on ... That's because there are more side lights and fillers than episodes that change the plot. And fillers are just the same stories that are repeated over and over again. The same episodes seem to be on the same plot: Kagome, who sees a jewelery card, opens a worm / mucus / tentacle demon, Inuyasha says, "Wind Arm", "Iron Reaver Soul Stealer" etc and kills the demon. they get a jewelery card and then we repeat this scene 160 times or more. <br /> <br /> In addition to repeating episodes, there are repeats of comics and they are no longer funny. Wait, they never were. Sexual harassment is not funny. Viz rated Older Teens, 16+. I have no idea why they appreciated it. There's nothing wrong with that, except for the so-called funny sexual harassment that is kind of hateful, and that can arrest you these days. <br /> <br /> Now we know that Inuyasha is overpriced. Video games. They're all miracles. Especially Mask game. I played it in my friend's house. It wasn't interesting. The game was slow, boring and had Nintendo 64 like graphics. In the magazine, he got a rating of 4/10, saying, "... this role play is slower than the cocktail that touches the cocktail arms." Then all these foolish Inuyasha toys, action figures, trading cards, stickers and coloring books are. COLORS IN BOOKS! We thought that Inuyasha was 16+! Maybe not ... But after the membership of Inuyasha groups in MSN, about half of the people who lived there were 10-13. I think Inuyasha is a little boy. (I think it's just a little bit of an exhibition, it can be shown in Tony.) Over 40 manga. I can only help but do not know how many miles are cut in the forest to do them. Sad ... <br /> <br /> Then there is music. Music is so annoying. We hear the same 5 songs for each episode. After 10 episodes, music is really annoying. On the second animation they have music that fits the mood and we don't hear some songs very often. There are about 15 different Inuyasha soundtracks. Don't waste your money on this garbage! <br /> <br /> And how do you think I know all this? Because I was a fan of Inuyasha before. I feel ashamed. I'd rather look at Kim Possible or Pokemon. Unfortunately, these two shows have more romance between the two main protagonists than Inuyasha ever ...
