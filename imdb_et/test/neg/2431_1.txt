This show is not, in my opinion, good, but again I haven't enjoyed any Disney Channel drawing. Except for the "proud family" because it is a normal female service. This exhibition is very similar to the Lilo and Stich series. It was a mistake to make the movie comic because the movie was great, the comic is terrible. Disney Channel did just before adding all these foolish cartoons like Dave Barbarian, Brandy and Mr. Whiskers, Lilo and Stich, American Dragon Jake, and where it all started: Kim Possible. The shows would have been better when they came to PlayHouse Disney! As for this example, Kuzko never gets out of school, as Dave Barbar's parents never come home and Brandy and Mr. Whiskers never get out of the jungle.
