OK, before I get there, let's go on and get a warning: this movie is SLEAZE's key "kinematic" concept! There are movies that can definitely shock or disprove this film, which has more artistic validity than WAY, when it can be said about this movie. What makes it so stupid? Let's take a closer look at the "Wet Wilderness" for a moment ...... <br /> <br /> Created in 1974 for practically nothing, this "harsh" doesn't have a real real "plot" to talk about anything other than imagining what happens, when the family went to the wilderness to relax and spend the day while the fat guy is a ski mask that holds the machine looking for a stroke ..... one that ends up being forced to be sexually with each other, while the masked slip systematically kills it. Hence, sensitive subjects are encouraged to look for sensitive people elsewhere. Then, really, to prove the level of surrealism or just to show the complete failure of filmmaking art, the "daughter" of the group runs away after being forced to have sex with her brother and finds a random black guy (!) Tied to a tree branch ( bitch left me here for 3 days ... ") almost no explanation! He's saved ..... or is it? Of course not!! They are caught before they can escape, where our killer forces them to have sex, forcing the mother to join, ending with a dead black guy (cross-section through the chest) when everything is said and done. Then our killer daughter and mother force her to give her oral sex when one of the women grabs men ........ and the movie ends abruptly !!! Just like that! No warning, no open ends ..... it's just over. It is now possible for this film to have the right ending (I don't know for sure), but I've only seen the extremely raw version of the Alpha Blue Archive. Their version seems to have ended completely or ends. If it was deliberate, when making a movie 101, I'm sure the end of the film is some kind of rule of thumb, but it shouldn't be done like this! "Psycho" fans should listen to music music because it's through the movie! I would be willing to contribute that no right is licensed or anything. Even if it is a "violent" movie, there's not much hell, so gorehounds can't find real use here. No violence is graphically shown ..... only results (one of the victims is sprinkled directly on the vagina). There is also sex in the UGLIEST sex I've ever seen! The interesting thing about this movie is too ugly film that works effectively on erotic porn or turns on everything but those who have a tendency to things bad, nasty and ugly, but not violent enough to gather true fame for those who are looking for something really brutal, like "Cannibal Holocaust" or other such flicks. The only "notorious" thing about this steaming stack is that violence was added to the adult film, which was a rather new concept at that time, especially if you think that pornography was all the rage and floors that filled the 42nd street. most jaded group pornstars. It was not and is not general pornography. <br /> <br /> If you were in a film school and had a movie list, this movie would be a shining example of this lesson! This cinematography shows what happens when motivated filmmakers are given a "budget" (in this case probably about $ 142 ..... cuz it looks like!) And ignore all "failures" and make them "doing". yes, this movie is so bad! Another thing: those who offend racial epithets are also encouraged to look at something. The black man of the movie is constantly abused by his color and the killer is obviously racist, but there was no political correctness in the early 70s. so that this movie can be done today. <br /> <br /> Frankly, it can't "shock" anyone or blame anyone but those who are out of stupidity. look at the erotic, so if you win, thank you for the quick back and forth button! "Acting" if you want to call it is the best amateur (I mean, it is even bad for PORNO!), not for any reason someone or something for that !! If you still need to see it, download it because you feel like a heel when you buy it. Some things are just worthless ... and "Wet Wildernes" is. The only thing that is more unpleasant than watching this movie is to watch the movie that sits in the theater and watches others who watch it, and suddenly feel threatened. Probably not the largest group of thinkers and intellectuals in society. But if you're a fool, but for SLEAZY porn, give him a crack. It's 54 minutes and it looks much longer !! Crackheads would love it! And again, maybe there's something wrong with me to first look ...... LOL! Caveat emptor, sleaze-lovers!
