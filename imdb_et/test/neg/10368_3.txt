So I decided to look at the whole Puppet Master series and looked at parts 1-3, which I thought were all great. They had a unique charm and some intelligence that I really appreciated. About a year ago I even saw Puppet Master Vs. Demonic toys, of course, were bad, but still a terrible joy and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of this movie, I knew it was in trouble. Cheesy Power Rangers-style Egyptian skull-scout who looks at the Psyche glass through Puppets' Rita Repulsa-style, came straight from the left! All the additions to this franchise in this story were completely absurd! Suddenly, we have a huge selection of all new and random characters and plots that are far from the first three movies. I seriously doubt that when the first Doll Player was a penny, the writers one day in the vision of the Egyptian Power Ranger criminals, totem monsters, annoying twenty times, seriously unable to act (and should be brilliant scientists, but never say anything intelligent) and flat " Decapitron is a doll who can go to Toulon's ghost. <br /> <br /> Another thing that really deceived me about this movie was that it completely ignores what happened in the last entry (Part II because III was a prequel). Suddenly, the dolls have returned to Bodega Bay Inn, back in their case (minus Blade), and for some reason Toulon is ready to help his dolls again (he puts them in Part II against his Elsa love). This is not explained by AT ALL ... and so it all, and all this other junk was thrown away, was no longer amused. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of ridiculous B movies if you like. I've even gathered rare B-type laser discs that aren't found on the DVD, and so I have to say a lot that it was one of the most absurd films I've ever seen in my life. I still love those dolls, original, Blade, Tunnel, Pinhead, Jester and the rest, and if they had just what they had, instead of trying something that wasn't broken, good, but the series can be alive and health. Nonetheless, the reviews are not so big that I am really interested in taking out Puppet Master Retro, it seems interesting as respecting the original themes.
