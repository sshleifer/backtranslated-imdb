This movie is really bad. The hero can't play. You see too much that he learned the heart of his walking movements. And believe me, he walks a lot. Nothing happens 45 minutes. He walks only to places and goes out ..... Like the story was so short that they had to expand it by adding useless and boring "look-a-suspens" scenes. Dialogues are very bad. I read a lot of "hello" and a little "hang up" in the first half. <br /> <br /> Blood is orange like Mercurochrome, which you put in baby's blisters. And the scenes themselves don't follow. Bloody neckline on the scene, clean the neck as follows. <br /> <br /> The story could have been improved. Yes, I mean, what the hell is the story? Martial Arts? Where? Is it a martial art? See how hesitant and slow you move !!!!! If striking and striking is a so-called martial art, then I'm Bruce Lee !!!! <br /> <br /> The only good point I found is on the battle scenes: they don't play zoom and swap scenes that give you headaches in most action movies. <br /> <br /> There are many low budget movies that are great. It was just earning money. Nothing else.
