The plot of this movie is very thin and there is not much action. Val Kilmer - I don't know why he approves this movie - plays a small role as a gang leader. In short, the movie is a tedious look. <br /> <br /> A man who resembles a professor of archeology / religion is studying an area in Moscow that has a history of railway construction and a Bolshevik revolution. The tragedy of the Church in this history makes the "spiritual" and the spirits of the study of spiritual intent the underground ruins. The professor's friend decides to find his friend on the subway and hires a couple of Russian tutors. The entire film is based on this plot and contains many repetitive material from the subway and some camera effects; similar to what is seen in "Daylight", "Night Watch", etc.
