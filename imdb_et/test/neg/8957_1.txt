It was a shockingly bad film and I literally pulled the blue screen for the first time. Imagine the worst blue screen special effects you have ever seen, make it worse, and then connect it with poorly made, rubber and Play-doh dolls that look like a semi-pre-school art class. Then add a somewhat funny, Yngwie Malmstein-esquire, melodious metal guitar solo stuff that is too loud and takes too long. The overall movie is absolutely terrible and makes "Feeders" look like "Rashomon". This is one of the worst films I've ever seen, with every metric spiral being down, just like the eternal, slow bubble water of a broken recreational toilet. But it shouldn't be a bad thing to miss the Actium Maximus movie, even if only on YouTube or anywhere. This movie is a bit of an eye opener when you can drive on the stomach. I think this director can be mentally ill, which is a bit worsening. Looking at her when discussing the project, you feel that she really believes she has created something wonderful. I think he is a "Star Wars child" by gonzo filmmakers. What a mess. :-)
