The worst part is bad scripting, resulting in superficial action. <br /> <br /> The character of Dreyfuss is intensely repetitive and annoying, and Dreyfuss himself has a tedious face that fits. <br /> <br /> The character of Holly Hunter is too self-centered and Hunter himself is serious as usual. <br /> <br /> Brad Johnson was wooden. John Goodman did the best. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the whole death / ghost thing has since been somewhat superfluous and now it's pretty flat. Hardly traceable only if you like the old planes.
