I saw this movie on the public service channel yesterday. They had advertised it as a terrible movie and so I was drawn to see it, and I didn't descend. <br /> <br /> A group of 18-19-year-olds go to a castle in the old Vikings in Denmark to try to discover the myth of Berserker's Vikings. Strange things happen: nothing is in the woods and people are getting lost. <br /> <br /> The movie that really disturbs me is that the story should be in Denmark, where I happen to live. There were so many places in the film where Danish reality overlapped with the Hollywood style. In fact, it made the show and drama ridiculous in my eyes. <br /> <br /> You will never see characters interact with any of your surroundings. He seems to be mini-Hollywood in Denmark and it loses the credibility of the film. If at one point you hear someone who speaks of "old Danish", it sounds exactly like today's Swedish. A really bad study, given that the director is from Denmark. <br /> <br /> Movie characters used GPS and maps, and it's really funny because Denmark is around your backyard. Nomatter, where you are, is never more than 50 km from the sea and 500 meters from civilization. And when you are at the castle, there are tourists everywhere. We see a lot of forest reviews in the film and sometimes we see what North American vegetation seems to be (?) The story didn't turn to me, maybe because it was so bad. When the characters see the bog creatures for the first time, they are not even scared. I think their operational skills were not enough to show realistic emotions. Finally, there is an unexpected twist, but it does not impress me because I didn't care. <br /> <br /> Raging creatures are cheap, but they had the potential to be scary. Unfortunately they fail because we look at them standing by the forest when the characters arrive at the castle. There are also no really scary scenes because bog creatures are usually just around. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the conclusion: Ignoring the facts is a typical B horror strike of the film. I think people from other countries can enjoy it more. As long as you don't know the reality, it's not important. Just as I think of the US as one of the great feature films, everyone else can think of Denmark as a castle forest and some dead people in their lives.
