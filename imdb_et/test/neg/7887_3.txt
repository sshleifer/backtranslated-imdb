SAME <br /> <br /> (US: Hypnotist / UK: Hypnosis) <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Dolby Stereo SR <br / > <br /> After a strange and obviously related suicide, the experienced Tokyo detective (Ken Utsui) will experience the help of a young psychoanalyst (Goro Inagaki) who believes that the victims acted on a hypnotic suggestion. But their later research shows even more dark power in the work associated with a young girl (Miho Kanno) whose life has been attacked by sadistic abuse ... <br /> <br /> Based on the novel by Keisuke Matsuoka, this tightly-shaped mystery is inspired from various sources (Italian gialli, traditional Japanese ghost stories, etc.), although some of the climatic showdown images show a more direct effect: Hideo Nakata RING (1998) recent commercial success. But to achieve its full goal, the SAIMIN is a routine boiler that stumbles upon opening the power source ("suicide" is particularly impressive, despite some weak CGI effects), although the director Masayuki Ochiai, who wrote the script with Yasushi Fukuda, is gathering for the extended trial finals where narrative The amazing secret finally manifests itself. Ochiai is the most well-known adaptation of his film made for the new reversed video game PARASITE EVE (1997), which also celebrated the leading man Inagaki (Japanese pop group SMAP member) - and although SAIMIN repeats the strong visual meaning of this film, it falls short as drama , and most signs are mere ciphers that undermine the emotional profitability of the story. What a shame, because the last half-hour has been galvanized with a series of dynamic sets - especially the concert hall sequence where Dvorak's "New World" symphony is turned into a murder tool! - and Ochiai is well served by an excellent production team. However, those who are attracted by predators' pledge may be disappointed - the film is long in the atmosphere and short spraying. <br /> <br /> Performances are different because of script restrictions, but Kanno (TOMIE) is outstanding as a young woman who suffers from multiple personality disabilities - what the subtitles in this publication confirm to us is not recognized as a viable medical condition in Japan! - Who will fall prey to the evil TV hypnotist (Takeshi Masu), who is the main suspect murderer. Inagaki is one-dimensional and is constantly Utsui, a veteran performer whose career goes back to the 1950s "Sûpâ Jaiantsu" series. <br /> <br /> (Japanese Dialog)
