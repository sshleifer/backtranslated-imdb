This is one of those movies I just knew I hated, but it didn't get as bad as I expected. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of R&D here, and even the DVD menu is shocked by the breasts of women. The first scenes of the movie have a lot of sex and nudity, and I thought I hadn't used nudity at all to make money a popular pre-8MM. <br /> <br /> As I kept watching, there was more sex and nudity, and the main characters I care less, but then the story started to come up and I saw it all and it was better. It is about a man who is the daughter of a fianc√© Ambasador, and all of them have a promising future up to the nude photos of the shelter, where the tribe of the trois appears and blackmail is in the cards of the escorts. The man and his groom must now get the one who sent the pictures and how to close them. <br /> <br /> First of all, the first part of the movie is not about anything to do with 8MM, this sex video, so I see similarities as small as they can be. <br /> <br /> The actor is neither good nor bad, its just individuals playing parts that anyone could do. The value of film production is in the middle of the road and its pure drama awakens. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed riding to reach the motifs of the runners. I was waiting for answers that are so much more than I could say for the first thing I consider to be a garbage. This movie also has some nice glitches that are always welcome. <br /> <br /> It's not great and it's very slow, but it's finally fun. I was not on the edge of my seat and I wouldn't rattle my friends that it was black, but if you look at a lot of movies and always look for something new, it can attract 90 minutes.
