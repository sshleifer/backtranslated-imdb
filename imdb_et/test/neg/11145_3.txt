All the leap! Everything adds! I was leaning over that I missed it on the big screen. When that movie worked, it was small. Otherwise, EVERYTHING failed. Arnold has been doing so much better in recent years. I thought the days of Commando and Last Action Hero have disappeared from our lives. Unfortunately, this film has put the lowest common denominator and reduces Arnold to a relaxing, terrible, face-to-face muscle that just knows how to shoot weapons and break down. At the last moment (and another time) that was predictable from the beginning, we see that an actor who has proved to be more than what he paid at the beginning of his career has seen. I was impressive with the film because it never crushed a new land or went anywhere, but where you expected it.
