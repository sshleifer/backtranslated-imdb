It is sad to say that the film is really terrible and is trying to find ways to say it. But this is a terrible movie. Gene Hackman wastes time (and one suspect, many dollars) playing his most famous and mostly revived role in "Gene Hackman". Otherwise, television participants will be given the opportunity to become film stars and successfully resist the temptation. Patrick Swayzel is a small part and went on to bigger things for which he must be grateful forever. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie as a result of someone else's review, and I felt that the other perspective was worth it. You may not agree with my review, but now you are at least warned.
