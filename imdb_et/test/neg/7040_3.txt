Two escaped convicts stepped out of the forest and shot two main camps. This is the first scene and it made me scare, the map that was in stock. But at the end of the first half of the year, I was flooded with pictures. Not because I cared the least of the characters, but because I was amazing how the film was and was curious to see how really low it could drown. Woolvett) are former prisoners. After the murder of two innocent campers, they plow through the forests and cast their way to Dean Stockwell and his two sons, lawyer Keith, and an innocent homosexual Behr insulated cab. The first pretended that their car had broken down and had to use the phone, but they gradually discovered their identity. <br /> <br /> Well, it looks like a familiar territory. Maybe "Desperate Hours" or "Funny Games". But - hanging - gay boy has two hands. It seems that Stockwell, when he discovered his son's flag with another man Billy, turned Billy around and threw him out. Billy died and Behr now blames his father for his death. And indeed, the father is a neanderthal for paraphilias, the fact that he found a cohabitation despite his secretary. <br /> <br /> Behr was looking for a search for someone else who had known Billy, someone with whom he could share despair. It turned out to be one of the refugees, and now Behr has decided to see their freedom. <br /> <br /> After that, it's all twisted. People are talking. They speak and speak. They are constantly talking. And NOT about two crazy killers who just can't wait to put their eyes between them. No - the dialogue goes like this: "You were just so frightened inside that you even drove out your Son." This is Behr, a young gay, talking to Stockwell. Just as in the afternoon, the domestic drama genes were mixed with a murder thriller in some kind of transforming device or cocktail shaker. <br /> <br /> The only real performance is from James Remar as the most eloquent and ominous two escaping. And this is mainly due to his terrible but liquid baritone, which sounds like Lance Henrickson and his wide guppy-like lips. It is easy with eyes and ears. <br /> <br /> Dean Stockwell has given decent performances, including his invaluable bizarre turn, "Blue Velvet", where he was my supportive player, but here laziness, advanced years or a relaxed direction have shaped my every movement and every expression into a stereotype . It would be like he read the productions - "Look Surprised" and "Scream Angry" - and follow them literally. There is no surprise in the load of the goods. <br /> <br /> If gay boy Jason Behr ever blinks, it must have been at the same time as I flashed because I miss it. He has a long neck and only one expression in his instrument. Woolvett as a secondary scraper disappears from pine knot wood. The lawyer's son is Robert Glen Keith. I hope he did not leave his day. <br /> <br /> The direction is pedestrian, staging is functional without being the most innovative. Sometimes it's confusing. I lost a trace where everything was supposed to be because the killers are moving around the porch of the cabin and the family is locked with a gun. I also didn't understand how Stockwell could break the cabin door, sink to Remar, and knock him in the back porch, and then Remar could just stand, dust and get tough. like "Okay. Two play this game." But why go? Check it out if you need to.
