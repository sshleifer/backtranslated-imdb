Opening the "Jungle" promises us a safari adventure with the element of science fiction, but mostly what we get is a travel book with lots of stock footage and padding (and an odd leopard attack). The film is pleased if you want it to grab, and tries to inject interesting procedures between different wild animals in poorly staged competitions (I had no idea that the lions and wild boars were wild enemies in nature, big cats were hunting for herbivores, but probably the producers knew the better). <br /> <br /> As for the actors, Cesar does his usual big mustache tilting work, and Marie Windsor is reasonably believable as a gradually thinking daughter (nice eyebrows, btw!). But Rod Cameron is hardly traceable when the hunter returns to his expedition as the only survivor. I'm sure he was on demand for his day, but here he comes out with Rent-A-Center Bogartina: tough looking, but no Bogey range or timing. He spends the movie back and forth on the stoic anger of stoic anger, and at any time when the scenario tries to create its romantic sparks between itself and Windsor, you just have to laugh. This crabed face is not a good affection. <br /> <br /> The scenario is not desperate, although it does make some wonderful choices. At the start of the first act, the scenario takes some moments where the heroes decide to bring the obligatory smart young boy and the monkey mascot, but then ignore them until *** SPOILER ***, the monkey somehow holds the living hand grenade during the mammoth scene and involuntarily breaks off Windsor. That's how Cameron can prove his bravery by diving into it and saving his life at his own cost. *** END SPOILER. It is possible that the Indian version of this film (which I understood better than 2 1/2 hours) could have given the child and the monkey more. Another thing that makes a movie to show this age ** SPOILER ** is a question about a woolen mammoth (a device on the plot that sets the safari to move first). When they finally appear, how the scene is filmed, obviously, "mammoths" (apparently elephants that are shaded in carpeting) aren't really "anyone" attacking or even moving all quickly, and Cameron is trying to immediately wipe them with a hand grenade . These days it would be inconceivable to destroy the specimens of the last known extinct species, especially when everything they seem to be rolling in the jungle after a walk. *** END OF SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> Both IMO, four stars, which are pretty good at producing Robert Lippert (usually Lippert hack jobs are rated by two or three stars at best). It's not a movie train wreck or something; plus, it seems to be fine, because the daughter of Rathh claims to be the most repressive aspect of "traditional ways" and in 1952 a rather progressive "racial" romance. And there are some nice landscapes and exotic spectacles. See if anyone offers it to you for free, but don't expect much, except for an interesting historical chapter in the early fantasy cinema.
