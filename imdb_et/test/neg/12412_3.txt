Ah, another movie with motorcycles, hell angels and Steve A-Lame-o as a cool driver. This film is not about the story, but about drinking, smoking and many moral acts. Transferring Steve's dead cat during the Serenians "I love what I know" I had a vomiting feeling. Bike Chick Linda (rrrr) does it all! Fats did the best, because it just sounds and sounds. I also dare try to do what Banjo says. "You're eating a private stock." This is writing a scenario. <br /> <br /> I liked the end. What is a better place to peak than a lighthouse! You have to see it to track it. <br /> <br /> DIE Jeter, DIE !!!
