The production company of this film calls itself Nott Entertainment and is a surprisingly suitable name. It's a lot of fun from start to finish fun, which is a disgrace because the zombie-movie and western combination would have been interesting. Every time a low-budget zombie movie is released, it tends to be "fans" for fans. I really consider myself a fan of zombie movies, but I like it too much and I appreciate my opinion again! The film seems to be the burst of the "Undead" of the Aussie zombie flick, waiting instead to just steer in a cowboy hat; everything is wearing; but it doesn't make much sense because the film is probably modern. The credit sequences at the beginning of the film are stupid for us to believe that we are in the atmosphere for the film, but when the film starts right; soon we will see what we really are. Of course, the fair amount is gore, and it's actually pretty well done, although the good things I have to say about the movie are pretty much over. There's a semi-complicated twist that could have been interesting if the rest of the movie was. In general, it's just another zombie film in the world with too many zombie films. I don't recommend it.
