This film would be a great piece of history if it were actually a Kennedy murder real movie. That's too many mistakes in this movie that I emphasize. This is the movie of Kennedy's murder, but many important facts have changed. There are no scenes, and many scenes, after the president's limousine passes, are not suitable. Both Kennedys move considerably slower than the other four in front of them. The next time you watch this movie, look for things that don't add, like Texas Gov and her, before the SS men, but you see that the limo doesn't stop or slow down, in fact, it's accelerating. This film is clearly an attempt to cover.
