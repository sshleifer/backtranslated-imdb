The authors do not know anything about Russian prisons, the film is absolutely cockamamie, there is nothing in common with reality. Nor do they have a special prison in Russia for foreign prisoners, so that foreigners never live with Russian criminals. The uniforms of this movie see if they were stolen somewhere in Latin America. Also, prisoners in Russia do not work outside prison. Every killing in a Russian prison is an object of investigation, so that prisoners only kill each other if there are some very important reasons. Playing football is also forbidden in prisons, contacts between prisoners are very limited, there is no chance of bloody fighting, etc. etc. So this movie is not common to reality.
