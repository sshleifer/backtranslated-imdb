This film is complete with "Gli fumavano le Colt ... lo chiamavano Camposanto" and both films leave much to be desired for their DVD prints. First, both films are very blind - from time to time it is difficult to see exactly what is happening. Secondly, no film has subtitles and you are forced to watch a dubbed movie - although "Il Prezzo del Potere" seems to be better dubbed. Personally, I always prefer subtitles, but for non-purists it is not a problem. But these DVD problems are not the fault of the original filmmakers - the indifferent package is being marketed four decades later. <br /> <br /> As far as the film is concerned, it concerns the murder of President Garfield. This is a big problem because Van Johnson looks like Garfield like Judy Garland. In no way does he look like Garfield. She's missing a beard, has the wrong hair color and style and isn't just even close (trust me, I'm an American history teacher and we get paid for these things!). Actual Life Garfield was a civil war and looked like Smith Brothers' cough drop boxes. In addition, using another actor to duplicate Johnson is just a surreal voice. Van Johnson has never sounded before or since then! He was a good actor ... but certainly not a convincing general or macho president. <br /> <br /> In addition to stupid casting, President Garfield's death was in no way such a film. It is obvious that filmmakers are actually dealing with crazy speculation about the death of JFK, not Garfield. Garfield was imprisoned in Washington (not in Dallas) by a single gunman with severe mental problems - not a group of rifles. But most experts say Garfield's (more than two months later) incompetent doctors - who accused and accused and tried to download a bullet (without results) and never bothered to clean the hands or tools in the process. In other words, as George Washington (who was repeatedly bleeded in the case of pneumonia), he died of misconduct. They didn't get anything right in the movie ... after that, President Garfield was shot. <br /> <br /> Because the film has almost no similarity to real history, it's like a history lesson taught from another planet or having severe brain damage. Why not include ninjas, combat robots and Greek gods when you're at it?!?! In addition to some good action and productivity, because the script is a cow's crap, I don't recommend anyone watching it. It's just a complete and complete confusion.
