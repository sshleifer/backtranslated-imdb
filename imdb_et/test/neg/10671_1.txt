I have to hold my hand and say that I was one of the first (and probably last !!!) to see this movie. Where I start, it's a complete mess. Of course, the main attraction was sound. What goes without saying - that's what Himesh does best. But, as they say, do not give up your day - HR should definitely not. <br /> <br /> The action of the High Representative is simple and simply terrible. Even if the film had a plot, the thing that most disturbs you is why this guy is on the screen and what the hell is doing there. Two advisory words for HR - stop acting and secondly use a seal. <br /> <br /> HR doesn't have a screen presence, no skill, and a female driver looks a little too young. As for Malika Sherawat - just the same old Bollywood vamp crap. <br /> <br /> You can pack the product as much as you like, but if there is no substance that it doesn't hold. Don't waste your money ...
