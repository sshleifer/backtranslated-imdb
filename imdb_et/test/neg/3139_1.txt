This movie must be one of the most eternal films ever. The only thing I liked is the Argento-esquire lighting in most scenes. The music is terrible and the pace is so slow that you can watch it at 2x and even then it would be slow. There is no story. She doesn't even have shocking scenes. <br /> <br /> It's classified (at least on this site) as a horror, but it's not. This is a kind of feature film that explores the dark side of human nature. If you are into this thing and you can slow down, look at it, but I would recommend you something Japanese (eg Ichi killer). I think the only reason why this film was never in theaters is the fear of an audience who commits a collective suicide caused by the huge boredom of this film. It would be better to spend these 80-minute-longs when looking at the paint dry. <br /> <br /> I gave it 1/10 just because there is no 0 drop-down menu
