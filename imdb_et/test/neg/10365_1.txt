This movie is a slow cheap movie that is trying to be a stoner movie because the characters are looking for a pot, but none of them are smokers just a bunch of garbage Thomas Hayden Church should no longer drive a particular movie that is a waste of movies. The people who liked this movie gave good comments, but from all of the people here they have only slowed down and don't watch the movies so they think any bad movie is good when the actors suck and the film sucks. <br /> <br /> I think many people are starting to get upset because this movie is trying to look like a weed movie if it is the worst movie I've ever seen, I hope people stop directing the director's fucking control even weed can't make this movie fun or fun.
