Jack Brooks' quizzes are somewhat charming in the beginning and deliberately lend a sense of fire to the beginning of this movie. <br /> <br /> I found myself more threatening and nervous when I was disappointed to see it finally hoping that profitability would be super-annoying to wait. <br /> <br /> The climax cannot compensate for the entire setup time. <br /> <br /> Usually one can wait for the low characters of this genre. But the fact that the waiting time-before-action index is so large should mean that in the meantime it would be dedicated to some interesting character development. <br /> <br /> Not so. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is not without original charms, it ultimately despises and disappears. <br /> <br /> I wish I could get back all this setup time to invest in something that will pay off.
