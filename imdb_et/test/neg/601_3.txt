When the killer calls have become the biggest shelter that has so far been released by Asylum. It's about a sexy babysitter who gets terrible speeches with a horrible voice that asks her repeatedly: "Have you checked the girl?" Of course, he has the challenges of the police (after some realistically unnecessary tasks - hang up when he calls, waits for ten seconds and chooses * 57). Sound familiar? Yes, that's why I also rented. Well, that should. And I hate to say it, but it could have been more interesting than the big screen crapfest that appeared at the same time, if not one deadly mistake - instead of the B-movie ripoff glory, he tried to do something original. He was trying to bring sympathy rather than staple, to have fun with him. Remember that this could have worked with talented actors. But he wasn't. Of course, he looked good and he yelled and yelled, but. . . Oh, whatever. <br /> <br /> Then there was a terrible ending. Not terrible, because it was terrible, terrible, because it was a fight. Reaching this point (about an hour) was campy, clichéd and fun. Then he moves in the second direction and away from the other crazy fun movie with a sexy "teenager" thrown to Hostel-esquire gore / borefest. <br /> <br /> I think it belongs to "Well, no category. The main actor flubbed the line? Well, whatever, I don't know it again. We forgot to give the killer motivation? Oh, whatever, I don't know Speed ​​changes completely halfway? Well, whatever, I don't feel like shaking for 15 minutes. Consistency bugs? Oh, whatever. <br /> <br /> If you like such a movie (stupid, cheesy, predictable, combious) a movie with a sexy cast), you get up to the end. The end is stupid, it's not fun, it's not scary, it's not campy or cheesy, nor fast paced. but is related (and it is not a spoiler because it is on the back of the DVD) and looking at things in the room, then screaming and ... whatever.
