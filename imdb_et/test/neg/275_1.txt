What a ridiculous waste of time and money !! This film was the biggest loser of the year. The whole leap was a warning. I am disappointed by Julia Roberts that she is the most talented cast member. I think his ability to really make a movie. Friend's friend boys club was a bit too fake and add insult to injury, why bother the majority of Catherine Zeta Jones? He only has a chance to film. He has no ability to see chemistry on anyone's screen, not to mention his lack of ability to act. He has no other chemical features: "America's Sweetheart's". He made the Terminal Terminal. This movie doesn't move anywhere, what a shame, please don't tell me that "13" is on the way!
