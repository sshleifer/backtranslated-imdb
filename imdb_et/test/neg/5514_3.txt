Since several posters have "hinted", this is "Star Wars" ripoff. Now that you intend to cut Star Wars, do it at least correctly; "Battlestar Galactica" did, and there were still some room operas that didn't do the bad job, but it is definitely not one of them. The juvenile leader, David Mendenhall, is not really too bad, although he always goes so often on the "cute" factor. Vince Edwards has not much improved as an actor on his Ben Casey days; if anything, it is still wooden than ten. There are no other performances to write home. Even worse are special effects; The best thing you can say about them is that they are bad. It is obvious that "foreigners" are simply carriers of rubber masks with little foam or latex, and "battle" scenes between Edwardian migrants and aliens are poorly staged and poorly photographed. Roger Corman's very weak effort. Skip it.
