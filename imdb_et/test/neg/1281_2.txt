Why did they change the cute Rugrats TV show that we all know and love the flat attempt to direct teenagers? They don't have to do it. All ages regularly watch Rugrati. When I heard about it, I thought, "Hey. They made a series about the movie. Except they have really grown up as a teenager! It's better." When I saw it, it was as if I had looked like TÃ¼nn Ginger, except when they did. Great work. Never. Basically, all the episodes of this series test are related to Tommy's management. I do not like this. I'd rather look at the plot that changes every episode. Not the same and again. Also, when in the old series, every character has its own side of the story? Never. This series did it. I didn't like everyone divorcing. I don't want to see Angelica's story. I hate him. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this example if you like Told By Ginger and Rugrats.
