Every boy learns a lesson that just because a girl looks good doesn't mean she is good. Well, lemme tells you, at the age of 19, a lesson. It is hard to say what is worse: Kathy's ability to act in Ireland or his huge voice; what sounds like a helium mouse that scratches your small small claws on the board. With an unimaginable plot placed in a space dwarf, wanting Kathy Ireland's broom for some hidden reason, this movie is just wrong with so many levels. If there had ever been a candidate for the revival of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, that would be the case.
