The stunning blonde Natasha Henstridge is a young, not so sad widow in the capital of the mountain who speaks her story to a television reporter in Virginia Monroeville. It is suspected that the community will be involved in killing his or her parent's spouse. This is James Brolin, who trusts babysitters. A reverse teledram in Canada based on an article published in the Vanity Fair magazine. It must be true! Whatever it is, it's much more romance than a mystery and a very familiar story. Leggy species star Henstridge as a gold digging hospice nurse? This may happen, I think. And it's good to see Brolini's remarkable role after turning to Antwone Fisher, even if he doesn't finish this picture. End of image? He doesn't even do it at the beginning of the picture. Therefore, of course, the setbacks were invented.
