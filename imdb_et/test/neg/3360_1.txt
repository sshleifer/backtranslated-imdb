Jack Frost returns with an army of polystyrene streaks, which can only be kicked off when they have fired a super-collar filled with margarine. How is it for the plot? The film depends on such a ridiculous premise that it hardly creates an eyebrow when the characters are killed with BBQ tongs and are affected by carrots. It can even be said that the whole film is skated on ba-boom-tish. <br /> Adequate fair times are difficult, but it does not release the actors' willingness to participate in such boredom. <br /> <br /> For fans who want to see Jack Frost, be prepared to accept him as just a phallic carrot that descends on the beach.
