I have not read the book on which the film is based or the letters between Vita and Viol. If I came to this film with any expectations, perhaps the Bloomsbury group (including Virginia Woolf and Nicolson) would be depicted. It wasn't what wasn't a problem for me. I am thinking of how the people behind this film, in my opinion, were able to do so very uninteresting and repetitive and most of the characters, despite the great material and the very good actors. The script isn't just good enough. I agree with the criticism of my Finnish neighbor - too many pointless sexual scenes (but only between women, although there is nothing explicit about Harold's numerous love affairs), too many pointless scenes in general, too little information about the background of the characters. It seems strange considering the quality of production - on the surface it looks like an ambitious job, but of course the script has the greatest weight and this is where this film fails. <br /> <br /> Vita's relationship with Harold struck me unconvincing, though both work very well, especially for her. The way they held their unconditional love for each other in a pretty cute way, I thought I just didn't convince. It makes more sense that it should have happened to the letters, because tmmvds indicates that I would have liked to know where the nicknames came from - both Russians * and Mar - why ever has someone named Vita, who has been given the nickname Mar? It may be a small thing, but it is important to help you get a bigger picture. <br /> <br /> * I watched the movie with English subtitles and, if she had probably told Mity, she told Medea instead. This may explain my disappointment with the nicknames somewhat - I didn't understand why Vita should be Greek while Violet was Russian!
