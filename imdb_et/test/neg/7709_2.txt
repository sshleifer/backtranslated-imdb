OK this movie was much worse than the first and the first one was sucked! Zombie formed very fake! Operation is very bad! And it doesn't really follow the first! Looking at it, I thought the first is a masterpiece compared to it. I'd say I'll get it on the TV, don't spend that money! It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's the list. I started watching it last night and falling asleep to watch it today and almost sleep again! The plot was pointless, I mean, I get that little army group sent to the mission to get the lead zombie blood and bring it back so they can use it to save lives and stop the zombies, but they did it where you wanted it to let everyone die. They did a lot of bad guys who really were just annoying. When you asked me, it was interrupting descent evil and not a good tear. The plot could have done it if the actor was good and they really felt scared to see what the angle was. With these zombies my grandmother could have gone to this building and survive! 1 to 10 I'll give him 2.
