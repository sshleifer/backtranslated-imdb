Film Noire is a genre that requires some tact, intelligence, intelligence, and images. There is no such thing in this film, even though they really tried the images very well. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that your cousin Marky is a truck driver who always talks about how he makes it big. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is wood and inanimate. Visual, though obviously costly, is the work of a director who has tried to be wise and failed because of the lack of ability of the brain. The action varied from sub-par to just bad. The story can be saved by a true writer and director, but I suspect that such people would not have been touched by the ship. <br /> <br /> About 1/4 passage, I noticed striking similarities with the Sim0ne scene, where Viktor desperately releases his actor, making the world's worst movie. I thought I'd check IMDb to see if this film had a similar effect and I had a surprise. I would almost be tempted to give 10 to 2 just because it is open to exposed groups, but I don't want to. It's so bad.
