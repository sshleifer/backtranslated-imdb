After half an hour of examinations outside the gay bar in Tupelo, Mississippi, SMALL TOWN GAY BAR is focusing on Scotty Weaver's assassination at Bay Minette to show the risks of interview objects. But here's the problem. Bay Minette is not near Tupelo as the movie shows. It is not even in the same state. It's actually about three miles from the Alabama coast. <br /> <br /> Director Malcom Ingram does not specify this, nor does he bother to mention that although Bay Minette itself is little more than a wide-ranging road, it is actually about two deep breaths away from the mobile subway, Alabama, which there is a noticeable gay community, quite a few gay bars and even a Metropolitan Community Church congregation. If Ingram is uncomfortable at these points, you should ask if he is with others. <br /> <br /> Speaking of a Mississippi born, raised, and still living person, I have to say that I find most of the small streets with big hooey. Neither Meridian nor Tupelo, the communities that Ingram focuses on, are rural, small or isolated, as he would have imagined, and geibars are indeed more common in the country than film. Indeed, Ingram really ignores the fact that the lack of a gay bar does not mean the lack of a gay community, and shows that it shows a rather deep ignorance of southern culture, which tends to keep those frequent bars - be they homosexual or straight - underrated. <br /> <br /> A small lane, in my opinion, is a case where the filmmaker came to his subject with a personal agenda and then went on to the movie agenda. Are gays and lesbians living in the Mississippi rural areas facing major, sometimes frightening challenges? You take that they do - but this is not an excuse for the reality of such ditching. The DVD includes a comment line and a number of deleted scenes, but I found that the feature film itself is so ridiculous that I didn't waste time. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
