It's so bad that it's my contribution to the next bad movie party I'm going to. From the outset, it is clear that Steve Gutenburg took this role seriously .... other principles went through these lines. I think they got a joke about how much it beat up early and they went through the suggestions of their pay certificates. Sean Bean "acted" as usual, but was saved by sharing space on the screen with any principle up to the final scene where it was like an actor who walked to a high school stage that is precisely defined. Some actors don't look good. Some participants should not disassemble parts. These two statements apply to "Police Academy" Steve. His tiring appearance means he is bad and insecure, and his compression makes him look like potato carbonate, not fine. Combine this with one of the worst scripts in Hollywood history and have a BAD movie. I can only guess that all the principles really need money for remodeling or something or their agents have signed them before the script was written by the monkeys, who have to write it out. I would like to know that there is a story behind this disaster.
