"Tart" is a pathetic attempt to make a movie that travels around and is one of the Manhattan teenagers, exploring all the usual teenage glasses ... sex, drugs, and classical music almost completely without story, focus or purpose. Griffith is in the movie for about 2 minutes, while Swain is conscientious in his long dog flick list. Nothing in this movie works and Wayne should consider getting real work. Not recommended for anyone. PU! Ugh! (D)
