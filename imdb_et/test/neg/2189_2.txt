It starts very well, an accident and a decision not to return to LA. But everything gets too fast. Finally, there is a good plot, but so many scenes that don't make sense. Randy (played by Brian Austin Green) comes home and is ready to confront people and take the time to set up a club when they park their car in front of their house somewhere in the middle? I don't want to spoil it for anyone who decides to see it, but the last 45 minutes are ridiculous. Even an actor who was not bad at an early age will end up in the end. Don't bother if you don't want to see how bad it is.
