I don't know how this DVD came to my collection - my husband suggested that it was one of those "3 £ 20" deals taking place on the street. It's not worth 66p, let alone £ 6.66! Having invested a lot in this, I felt conscientious to look at it to make sure it was so bad all the way - and that was. The dialogue was terrible, the story line was impenetrable (I still don't understand what the hell happened, despite reading the synopsis), the camera's work was scattered and hopeless, wood was exemplary (dialogue didn't help). <br /> <br In fact, there were no redemption features - no, not even the lovely Sandra Bullock, whose shining subsequent career is likely to have sold a bunch. He should get his agent to buy all his rights and then bury it with ASAP. <br /> <br /> As a final amusing example of the director's injustice, it was an event where young leaders talked to their father while driving a former army. It was the clearest dialogue in the movie - no engine noise! Waiting for engine damping technology, which will eventually make the pond British cars!
