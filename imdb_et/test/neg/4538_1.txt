It was a terrible short film that was trying to be funny in the dark but wasn't funny at all. Say at the Chicago Film Festival. It's really what the title says and I just didn't have it at all. Bad storytelling was what it did. Once you rewrite it and reuse it, it can "work". This test fell into the "hole". Terrible movie.
