I've already commented on this movie (called TheLegendaryWD). But I see there are others who have commented on it. All I can say is: WHAT F ** K!? "I can't believe the entire 16 people have commented on this movie or even seen this movie. Add a couple of great comments to it (probably filmmakers who went to one of these places in a strip center that offers an internet service and wrote a good review - Seeing how there's no way to pay for your internet service provider or just pay ... see their movie While I still admit that I have a soft spot for this movie, I thought some other people who wrote about it might confuse it with another ... as long as I read the comments ... especially about the person who identified the label line on the front of the box: "upper front lobotomy" (what f ** k means it would anyway?) "front" lobotomy?) ... i forgot it completely until i read this people, we are some chosen ... i say we meet once a year to watch this movie ... wait for anyone else to have it? I'm left drunk.
