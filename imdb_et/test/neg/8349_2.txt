As a geology student, this film depicts Hollywood ignorance. In a scene in which a dog engages in the interior of a burnt house, it is less than a foot from a lava that has an average temperature of 1750 degrees Fahrenheit. This stupidity is once again witnessing "Stan" going to the subway 4 for recording. His shoes melt on the subway floor, while the rest of the team is standing just a foot away from the flowing lava. To stop this movie from being monsterized, they have to find the most illogical solution, stopping the lava flow with cement K rails. Earlier in the film, the voice of reporters can be heard, saying that nothing can stop the flow of firefighters who have tried cars and CEMENT. Common sense says that this film is an uneven and severe underestimation of human knowledge.
