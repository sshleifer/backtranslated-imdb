This movie strives for its toughest to capture the classic bad Canadian movie feeling: <br /> <br /> "peculiar" and unpleasant characters (some); "quirky" town with "quirky" folk; café-café or restaurant (there is a café); lots of photos of Canadian things for postcards (ocean things here); much to mention "must get out of this city"; Direct view. <br /> <br /> And it succeeds at all readings. <br /> <br /> But note something. I couldn't figure out if this movie was just trying to be a North-post comedy or something surreal like drug-induced or psychotic hallucination. Editing this movie jumped from one unwanted thing to another with meaningless zero-pace or motivation. Not to mention that half of the time we didn't even know where we jumped. Take, for example, very openable shots of teenagers in the car. Who are they and what did they do? And this sub-uh - plot (use this word plot loosely), bringing together the kids who look like generations. I don't think they really do, but the editing looks like they're going through a setback, maybe, to the present. Ah? What do I miss? <br /> <br /> Avoid. When you laugh. Or you might want to try and fail in editing.
