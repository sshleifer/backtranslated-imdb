Having enjoyed Neil Gaiman's writing (especially his collaboration with Yoshitaka Amanda "The Dream Hunters") in the past, I thought that Mirrormask was a sure thing and was very disappointed. The movie's start-up, live-action part was interesting enough. Relationships between symbols were plausible and easy to understand, and I loved sets, costumes, and Helena's art. However, the following computer-generated scenes were intimidating. The dialogue was inconvenient and pretentious, between the living actors and the terrible interaction of the CGI. For the fastest reasons, events occurred and most of the events seemed superfluous for any plot of land. I only looked at the first twenty or thirty minutes of the movie, so I am not exactly an authority, but I strongly suggest that you do not look at it at all and stay at Gaiman's strong written work.
