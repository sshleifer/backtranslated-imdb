This strange movie from Texas is about Fallon, who is a rich rich boy at the end of the 19th century (although he looks like a 60's C&W singer with fatty hair and shrubs) whose ship wrecks on the island of DeSade (pronounced de-sayd ) with your master. The Count fears pirates and tortures a young girl who was once a pirate hostage and also tortures the captain. Meanwhile, the hidden ex-sister tells Cassandra Fallon the secrets of the castle. The Count has leprosy and went crazy! Fallon is trapped, but deliveries. The captain is killed by a slave with a racist caricature. Fallon is thrown into the cave with a covenant who always thinks it's his wedding day. The rubbish bride is horny, Cassandra kills her. Fallon and Cassandra flee from the castle, but the Count and his slave are pursuing them with dogs. DeSade kills slave and Fallon kills DeSade. Fallon and Cassandra love the next year, but when the delivery-ship arrives, the team refuses from our lovers because they are now both lovers. They live in the castle for years ... Fallon's hair turns gray and Cassandra's going to splash. Fallon puts him in the dungeon. Our story of love and leprosy ends. <br /> <br /> So weird it is traceable and you can get a smell of car driving popcorn.
