This film is worse than "sky gate" or "space plan 9". Don't know why he even got an Oscar, it should have got millions of raspberries, just like the viewers who either went out or didn't show up. The hospital had a first-rate financial failure, but I am sure that the elite classes of the left-wing, gutter intellectuals felt that the American public was too plein to understand the bite of social commentary when they saw it, and and on. George C Scott, one of the oldest and most embarrassing roles, with the symbol of an aging sex, Diana Rigg spends most of the film trying to ridicule when pushing a foolish plot. The bad old George is impotent and simply crushed by the event, but after a lot of dirty language between him and Rigg, he rapes many times in the dirty and crumbling NYC hospital, which seems so disgusting that I wouldn't want a pet rat treated there. There are also some consecrated spam dialogs that are here and in the yonis that are covered with many cussing. It ends up depicting the erroneous perception that unusual stress without physical effort always leads to cardiac arrest. Never again want to see this terrifying movie.
