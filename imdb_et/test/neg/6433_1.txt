"War is in your blood" Rambo says at the beginning of the movie, "don't fight it". Say what? Does the scriptwriter take Micky Sly out? It is impossible for everyone with primary schooling to have fun here. However, Stallone says it without irony. <br /> <br /> The same lack of humor also applies to the film. Rambo IV is an intrusive, idiotic creator who would have been funny without intent on being violent. Basest-like fantasy, where the villains are so bad, is not enough to kill them? you have to crush them. Stallone stops with a blue collar to make her point. It is not enough for the main crowd to feed the pigs, throw the sadist of the babies. He is also a pedophile homosexual. <br /> <br /> What happens to IMDb? Has it taken over the Reef Society? How can this redundant excuse for gross consumption be high? I like a good action movie as the next man, but is it not entertainment? it is a pornography of violence that trivializes and ultimately disrupts the true tragedy of Myanmar. The only good thing about the film is that Sly doesn't take her shirt off. For that I give him one star ...
