If you enjoy sitting in the dark both literally and figuratively, then 90 minutes then it's a movie for you. <br /> <br /> Waste of time, resources, and audience. Finally wastes space. Don't continue the temptation. There is nothing else about it. The film lacks all the basic types you can expect from the genre; plot, character, development, denouement. It may be that the heart of knowing is that in this case their efforts are completely forgotten and that their careers may heal within the given time. <br /> <br /> Absolutely fear.
