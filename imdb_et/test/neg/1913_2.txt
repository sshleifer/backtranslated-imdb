I rented this movie the other day b / c love romance, but it must be the worst I've seen in my life. I find it hard to believe that Sam will fall in love with Kelley after they have barely spoken to each other for more than two words if he has a very long-time boy who has dedicated him completely. I thought Kelley was a big jerk during the movie and she didn't change at all. The only good thing about the movie was Josh Hartnett. I thought she was doing a great job and I'm gonna look more at her movies.
