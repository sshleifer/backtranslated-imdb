I had to watch this movie in the film class, and I suffered all the time. I'm not Asian, but this movie is still very offended. The film is based on racism, general minorities (Rex Harrison is not even Asia!). Prohibiting film in Thailand illustrates the inaccuracy and subjective portrayal of Asians. In addition, Anna's critical attention has been given to Anna's life. Many critics claim that Anna added a lot of fictitious events to her design. Some film and biography critics have even said that Anna formed the whole story. A terrible film, but good to discuss BioPics as a form of meta-narrative fiction, not a fiction.
