Jerry Lee, the partner of Dooley and his dogs, is again in this second order (? !!?). I had no sincere idea that they did one sequel, not to mention two. And for a movie that was just a little better than "Turner & Hooch"? This time after Dooley retires, he must pair with his dog (with other dogs, people) and wait for Jerry Lee's pose. Real stylish stuff. I mean come now. The original was at least a few good laughs. It's one. Jim Belushi just looks old and worn out. Both Belush brothers were great in the 1980s. If John hadn't died, would he be as bad today as his brother? This idea makes me sad for some reason. <br /> <br /> My class: D- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: The US Network
