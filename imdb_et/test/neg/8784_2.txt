Would it be surprising that my ears and eyes were almost bleeding for watching and listening to this terrible movie? My eyes were almost terrible to the terrifying animation and imperfect, empty chatter. My ears almost threw away the songs that sounded like the cream of the tempting monkeys. Then my brain almost melted because of the lack of complete intelligence. It is a formal step of every journey. Speaking of animals is one thing, but a penguin who can only fly to "dream" is a schtick? Show more faith in children's intelligence. Next to Rock-A-Doodle, this one is the worst of Blutd.
