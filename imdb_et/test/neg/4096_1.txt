Well, I didn't expect anything good for torturing this movie. I think Steve Carell is annoying and Bruce Almighty was pretty good, but there's no reason to continue. Somehow, this film was even lower than I expected, even though I didn't have it. <br /> <br /> Does anyone remember the Disney movie Noah Tony Danza? Well, let's just say that Evan Almighty pulled it too far to make the film justifiable. In fact, Evan Almighty's EXACT had the same plot as Noah, except for some technical features, it was nothing more than a carbon copy of the very movie that was actually FUNNY. Another thing, did anyone get hurt by Wanda Sykes' foolish, uncomfortable, superfluous single lining that was literally in every scene? It was completely ridiculous and just dragged the movie more and more. Despite the fact that I have seen the film ten years earlier (Noah), Evan Almighty must be the most predictable film I've ever seen. I thought the whole movie from start to finish in the first five minutes and finally realized that it was hanging left and right on Noah. Finally, if you are a little insecure about whether you want to see Evan Almighty and you are already sick of Jonah Hill, who plays the same role in every single movie, Bruce was all-powerful and didn't want to see a predictable, dry, unforgettable movie with Steve Carell act like Jim Carrey, please don't look at this garbage.
