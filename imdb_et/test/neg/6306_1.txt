Fire Balls of Fire is a movie you show to someone you really hate. It is the absolute highest torture of the highest rank and is likely to be used by foreign hosts to get information about caught intelligence agents. I've enjoyed some of Dennis Quaid's productions in the past, but he's going to the top of this movie. He doesn't move as much as he crosses, he puts it over, then jumps over again and again. He pulls and mugs like an incredibly bad acid journey. This is one of those rare performances where you would like to be able to enter the film and win a person one inch of your life to do something so terrible. Was he desperately winning a golden raspberry or some other prize? This is the only conclusion I can come up with. Thank you Dennis for giving us a bad result at the age. Where was the reign of this man's ruler? <br /> <br /> The extreme opponent is Winona Ryder, she is a plastic and plastic maker. I found an overview of her exemplary style that compared her to a wax mannequin. It was, of course, an insult to the wax mannequins all over the country, all of whom would have had more humanity in the role of Jerry's minor cousin / wife. This highlights the mixed message of the film that it's 100% okay to marry your cousin and have a baby by the child. I don't see what this "is", but it seems that Hollywood thinks a minor incest is a hunky dory. Talk about "family values." <br /> <br /> Another problem is formatting. Is it a lewd idea of ​​Lewis life or is it musical? I'm not talking about music, I'm talking about really strange scenes where Jerry goes to school, starts tuning and everyone starts dancing like Broadway music when Tony searches. Fantasy and reality are thrown into a mixture that doesn't work. But who really cares? I do not. And you shouldn't. You will not get back the life you are wasting with this movie. So don't waste your time, it's too valuable for something that's wrong and bad.
