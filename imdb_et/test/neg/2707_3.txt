Laughter is a little and far from this boring movie, and I can't help but know how this mess first came first. The only good thing about this film is Griffin Dunne's talent, but his best efforts easily overshadowed Madonna's unpleasant performance. I was able to sit through it without getting bored, but this is probably the most pleasant thing I can say about this time series.
