Hellboy revolves around the story of the classic comic book / action / superhero genre. In essence, Hellboy is a kind of demon who has found his way on earth. He has grown up by a child in the priesthood and government society, and he has decided to protect the peoples of the earth supernaturally, not as a threat (a normal career for the demon). <br /> <br /> The structure of the story involves the creative use of history, combining Nazi experiments with the occult. It's unpleasant, but it's also the whole idea that the demon roaming on the streets. I find the explanations of the characters who they are and how they were handled very well. The sequences are to the point and very fun. In fact, opening the movie is the best part where there is a problem ??? <br /> <br /> In essence, Del Toro, who writes and manages this piece, bottles it. The film lacks any tension or big conflict. Hellboy is basically created as invincible during the first act, and the rest of the film consists of scenes where the conflict is automatically a crass, because we inevitably know Hellboy is OK and a bad man dies. I hear you shout that it is for every action / hero movie. Well yes, that is, but when we pull on a well-made movie, we can't help but feel the hero can die. Die Hard works because John Mclane seems to be dying in all parts. He escapes from death with the thinnest margins. The stakes have been raised because his wife is also in danger, etc. Terminator and Terminator are two jobs because in both cases the villain is much better than the hero. Danger and tensions are constant. Some of the other major drawbacks are: Del Toro is also responsible for the recruitment of deus mach machina. The characters disappear and appear again when their skills are needed inside the story. The scam has been shown in three scenes. He has no motives. Turns unexpectedly and inexplicably. In one scene, Hellboy sees a real threat (groups of monsters). The character triggers its own abilities - the screen goes white and the monsters are dead inexplicably, but everyone else is alive. The tiny character created by an irritating and undeveloped love story can be the key to making a movie. His character is so thin, the relationship is so advanced. It is clear that he is nothing more, but wants to pull the plot and make it all reasonable. I do not want to destroy the end of the film, but in essence, the dead character is admirably and incredibly back in life. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from poor dialogue and one liner that is simply not smart or funny. After a while, everything starts to work. <br /> <br /> Even more, Del Toro blows action scenes with some uncontrolled visual images. And anyone who made a creative decision to make a hellboy primary weapon in his arms store should be fired. In principle, the use of a weapon weakens the concept of a film by lowering the fighting not only for unilateral shooting. Some are positive: Cinematography is very good. There is always a mood in dark light and a darker color palette. In addition to using interesting locations. Maybe it is a bit the same. <br /> <br /> Using cgi and Fx is well done. We will never overload. When effects are used, they are used well and realistic feelings are being used. Rather, it resembles how Nolan used FX batman. I often prefer this method, which we often see. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a pretty bad movie. The real shame is that, despite reading comics, I found the film had a lot of potential. Hellboy, as a character, has many outstanding prominent dimensions that are completely unexplored. The film has the ability to watch in the sense that if it is on television and nothing else, it may be worth watching. But in any other situation I don't worry about it.
