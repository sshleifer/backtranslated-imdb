The title is in the Bible book (Deut. 28:28). Let's just say it's taken terribly out of context - but nevertheless the title of this agonizing movie comes from. Other reviewers cover the plot details so I don't practice again. But the psychiatric spouse gives a lecture on "Inferior Function", where he discusses how a person can meet another person and who can experience a "cataclysmic crisis" in their lives, where they are no longer independent and capable of a fair judgment. She tells it on the podium at the exact moment she sees Leonora Vail at the audience - the woman who gets her lover. Not very subtle to show that this is really a poor man. <br /> <br /> I think the whole movie's premise is incredible and just doesn't work. Here is a mountain-top psychiatrist and we have to believe that this young, beautiful woman falls on her and comes between the luck she and her husband share. It is even more unlikely how a betrayed woman will react when she learns of infidelity. Not only does he not understand, but he includes starting his wife with a tramp with several months of vacation - "so we can all slightly relieve this intolerable stress". LEAVE ME ALONE!! I wanted to reach the screen and the accelerator not only for adultery, but for a dark woman. <br /> <br /> The fact that the whole movie is a setback after opening the movie from the beginning (the fact that the spouse had a terrible accident) - it leaves no doubt about the outcome of the variety case. I think it was a bad decision, because it doesn't leave any plump of the plot waiting, because the whole movie is completely predictable. You already know the woman's resignation at the beginning of the film when she calls her lover into the bed of a dead person and does not hurt her. <br /> <br /> Not only is the script faulty, but Noel Argp will be terribly uneven (although it is his manuscript). He and Leonora have no chemistry on the screen. Interestingly, Michael Redgrave was originally in this role but was replaced during filming. I don't know what it was? Finally, neither the spouse nor the spouse creates compassion on either side. I think Margaret Leighton played the part of the strumpet quite well. But he couldn't overcome all the negative movies. Also, as with many of the British productions of this era, it is difficult to understand the dialogue because of the crowded, quick speech of the participants. I saw it on television and couldn't even fix it on closed captions to fill empty ones for me. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on it.
