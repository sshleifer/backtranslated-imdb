I remember this movie on one Showtime channel. What appeared to me is that this film is entirely in Arizona, Phoenix. I'm from there so I can see the place easily. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the ninja is killing the scientist because they wear yellow jerseys and golf that the police are continuing. It takes about half of the police forces to take him down and when they finally kill him, there are no bullets. But his spirit lives when a woman finds her and touches her catania. <br /> <br /> Since that time, he regularly receives and kills police officers who killed the original ninja. Then another ninja comes from Japan to kill the evil ninja. It may be a primer for the previous two films or perhaps a plot hole. I only know that this movie is very combative, bad and fun. This is something to look at popcorn and many friends and give it MST3K treatment.
