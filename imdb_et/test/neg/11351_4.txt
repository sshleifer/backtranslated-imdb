Road Road and its Drop is Don Coscarell's entry into Mick Garrise's horrors of horrors. Coscarelli is famous because he is behind the gemstones, such as the Phantasm series and irresistibly strange Bubba Ho-Tep; but he does not produce any feature that would make these movies great for this TV episode. The plot is a grinder run, followed by a routine idea that the innocent is driving crazy. This time, this young woman rides on a mountain road. After the end of the accident he finds that the white face is manic. The entire tracking sequence is really ridiculous, with the young lady stopping so often to set up traps every time; just for the maniac to appear a second later, and it is cut with the scenes shown with his wife - who just happens to have a lot of information on how to escape the crazy killer; such as "we expect unexpected". The only real highlight for me was Phantasmi Tall Man, Angus Scrimm. Coscarelli is trying his best to put as many horror images as possible; with things like the body of a dead child, but because it's all so stupid, it's hard to take this piece seriously. This is the first episode of the series and the first I've seen; Hope they heal.
