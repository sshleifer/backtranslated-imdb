Younger Mr Greystoke, like a young child, was given up by a young man, Michael Dudikoff, like a young Mr Greystoke. But instead of raising the monkeys, he fell into the hands of a Japanese soldier who still lived there because he did not hear the war. And like the young Luke Skywalker it turns out that he fell into the hands of Ninja. <br /> <br /> Good because they were separated and the young boy came with amnesia, but they were fighting skills not gone. The orphaned child, now called Joe Armstrong, is in the army and gets himself into the Philippines. At the same time, he saved himself out of John Fujioka's Obi Wan Kenobe and is working as a gardener on the planet and terrorist legacy of Don Stewart, using a cheese accent that appears to be different in French and Spanish. <br /> When these things happen, everyone and Dudikoff will both meet their past mystery and save the commander's daughter from the bad guys in the production of Golan-Globus. Charles Bronson got some time on his teeth and Golan-Globus needed a new star for his activities. Michael Dudikoff performed the bill quite nicely and made a lot of films, including several American Ninja queues. <br /> <br /> This movie is all action and Dudikoff sends bad guys at a record pace. What she does not do, Steve James does his best Rambo imitation and shows his remarkable martial arts skills. <br /> <br /> The film has enough space to drive one military vehicle through you. story. But what the ticket buys does not care. Apparently, Dudikoff looks great to dress up with his fighting clothes. No wonder so much has been done.
