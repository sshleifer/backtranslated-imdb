It is sad that some people find it worth watching this movie. I'm Russian and I'm nasty. There is nothing to praise in this film except cinematography. But I am not one of those who find beauty in death or perversion. I think this film is badly designed and directed. Nothing is irritating and even angry than shameless speculation in art (if you can call it a trash). Balabanov wanted to shock viewers with widespread evil, and he managed to create a hopelessly dark film. But the biggest shock is Balabanov's primitive production. I would never like to see my friends on it. Huge disappointment!
