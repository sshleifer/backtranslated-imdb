Maybe I'm here alone, but it's a mess show. I'm sorry, but I was lured when I found out about Lil 'Bill O'Reilly (which I didn't have a few months after this example, and I honestly complained about it), but I gave the show fairly. Spike tries to make it hard for what he is not, ie he is trying to be a human being. Fox didn't even want to hide the string when they took it out of the box. His sketches are trying hard, he's not funny, and writers are trying to write materials for a young talent. There are too many good TVs to waste your time with this show, and Fox ..... Fox had some good times, but you have to make your f $% * ing together and submit something instead of trying to be just one " Me-too 'network.
