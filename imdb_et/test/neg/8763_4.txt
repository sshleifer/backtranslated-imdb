An animated role by John Carradine, an actor of a low budget horror game, as an indirect Nazi scholar who makes people zombies to serve the Reich. Mindless scuffling brain dead, only able to obey the simplest orders .... a bit like the employees of McDonalds. <br /> <br /> Hitler does not mention the name because there was no war in America during the war, but it's quite obvious who the bad guys are working! <br /> <br /> There are two types of zombies in the movie, a traditional voodoo type that is popular in 1930s old black and white films. and 40's. Blank eyes and just following the commands of another person when they stumble. And then there is the type we know about later films like "The Night of the Living Dead" and "the dead of the dead". He still travels, but only with the intention of killing and eating the meat and brain of his victims. Both have different films over the years. <br /> <br /> 'Revenge' includes the former zombie type, although they are especially funny and they would see older eyesight more at home than geeks when they reject chickens. One black zombie called Lazarus with its natural hair looks like a young Don King. <br /> <br /> As far as the plot is concerned, the evil doctor decides on his wife's zombie with others and there he makes his mistake. Even if she lets her keep her happy heels in a nice feminine when she makes her one dead, she's not happy about it. <br /> <br /> It all goes horribly wrong and ends in tears, and the story of morality must be, never, ever, change your husband's zombie, it just needs trouble ... <br /> <br /> The movie is interesting enough and quickly rolls to the end, but it never rises above the beginning of this line of poverty. Not a real zombie classics patch, but fun the same.
