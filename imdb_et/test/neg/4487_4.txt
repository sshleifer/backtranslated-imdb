I was looking forward to seeing two bright young actors who appeared in "Dear John", but it was a very slow movement; and I felt that both the scenario and the direction hindered the flexibility of the principals. Normally, I enjoy the movie adaptations of these novels. Ironically, I thought the film did a great job of depicting realistic military action. <br /> <br /> Cinematic art was very good with mixing love sheets, just focusing on each keyword or phrase. I felt that Channing Tatum was an attack that became very regrettable as an expression group.
