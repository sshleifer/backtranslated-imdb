All in all, skip the End of Days and see Roman Polanski's "Ninth Gate" instead. This movie is the perfect stereotypical American film vs Ninth Gate, the perfect stereotypical European film. <br /> <br /> Ninth Gate: Noir-ish, intelligent, nicely scanned, atmospheric, great actor (Johnny Depp, esp), beautiful landscapes, good cinematography, funny linings, intellectual, minimal unpleasant language, thoughtful. The only mistake is that some people did not understand the open end and said the film was "dirty" and a couple of questionable scenes. <br /> <br /> End of Days: Excessive violent, liberal language use, NO musical score, except a bad test of commercial sound that was only heard when Gabriel Byrne complained about NYC as Satan (but everything you could pick out) was Korn's Jonathan Davis screaming), sex that there was nothing to do with the plot, violence, incredibly predictable, violence, and did I mention much more violence? I think some special effects were good, but there is something. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe I'm wrong, but I thought the ninth gate was much more interesting, original, original and smart. But maybe Americans don't need it. * Dripping with cynicism * Although I'm an American, I sometimes think.
