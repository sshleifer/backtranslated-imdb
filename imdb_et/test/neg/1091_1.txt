Well, I notice that IMDB has not offered any plot information ... because it can't be done without hesitation and disgust ... because that's the movie ... VILE AND DISGUSTING !! I looked at it because I am Chris Noth's human fan, whom I personally met and he is a great boy ... but when I meet him again, I don't ask him to ask him to do it to celebrate him with such a horror . She is a former childhood child, who is now a brilliant doctor who spends her free time with small children in her car with the aim of tasting and exhausting it ... it's not a "spoiler" because it's all done from a very clear start. enough sick? Oh, it gets better ... he is manipulated to do it, his blood clot, who threatens him against sexual advancement when their last victim does not die ... even Clive Barker couldn't write anything so ugly. Please, if you want to see Chris Noth worth your talent, rent "Teddy Roosevelt and roughriders"
