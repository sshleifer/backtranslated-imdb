I've seen cheesy kung fu fighting films. Living in Taiwan takes place instead of sitcoms in America. I've seen jokes about myself, but this movie belongs to the sad category of the fighting film, which strives to take seriously the horrible actors, terrible props and terrible music. I really felt sorry for the music that made this movie. If it is sad to be a composer who has to beat the crap like what I thought it should have been called "Generic Ninja Fight Scene, Op. 1" or "Variations with a girl's head with a weapon" angled "or a bold" helicopter flight ". The struggle scenes were over and the credits rolled in. They were tears in me. If the "special effects" were not enough proof that it was a low budget, the fact that only two or three crew members were probably local, who needed a good Phillipino economy. They've never done anything good for money, they've just made money to save money. They've never done that in the movie series. They rented the equipment, despite the aftermath of the movie. It was pretty funny too. hope that GI Joe will open an animated Sargeant Slaughter), but end ... I think it would be a spoiler if the plot was really broken, but when the American ninja falls on the girl Jackson's hand and then takes off the mask, I wanted to see that he jumps out of the roof and Jackson falls off the girl. <br /> <br /> I think it would have been perfect for a movie joke.
