As I noted in other comments, I got since I saw him "American Ninja 3". The guy is great in making martial arts, owns some charisma and is cool looking guy on screen. Unfortunately, after his debut in the DTV department, he has been the king of TV films until 2001, where he probably stopped making films. Now, one thing is to look at Cyborg Cop or Hard Justice, which is crappy clichéd movies, but a real fun watch (coz they're fun bad when it has some meaning), but another thing is looking at a tasteless piece of boredom like Total Reality. This and the Crisis are the two biggest pieces of horse meat that this man ever did. I wouldn't recommend it to even larger Bradly hardcore fans. If I knew it and the crisis was so f *****, I wouldn't have spent 3 or 4 euros. Actual reality is just as boring as the crisis, although it is wise to start. A group of prisoners of war in the future will have the opportunity to interrupt a catastrophe (I am sorry, I didn't pay much attention to this savage) and they only have 24 hours to get back or get something back like this. If they don't, they will stay forever. The poor driver who watched it, "tries" some humorous (?) Clichés, like arriving at the land, but doesn't know what a truck (wow, hilarious ...) is like. The film is followed by David Bradley, who has agreed with a girl in the Earth. It missed me so much that I had to force myself to look at 3 or 4 installments to use at least 4 or 5 euros to pay for me. It's coz every time I tried, I slept. And if you get a movie with David Bradley in just one 10-second fight scene, this is the last touch that will help you throw that hundred-foot rock so you can never see it again. I wish I could meet the street poo director and I swear to God that I would ask him 5 euros. I would also love to meet David Bradley to ask him why he decided that in the name of God this poor apology was for the film. Don't even bother with this movie, I mean it from my heart, not borrowing it, and especially not buying it.
