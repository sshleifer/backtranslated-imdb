I'm sorry, but I can't even partially agree with some comments on this terrible piece ... <br /> <br /> English is not my native language because I am a German citizen, so please don't blame me for an inappropriate grammatical structure or something * gg I don't understand why this movie got such a high rating? 6.3 ??? Are you kidding? This movie doesn't make any sense, not even good action ... <br /> <br /> When I looked at Da Vinci code comments that have - I think - almost the same rating, I had my head on the table because I was watching 00 Schneider, right after the god of Sakril and oh, there are worlds between them. evaluating this movie with crimes 6.3 and calling Helge a genius. Of course he knows how to make money, but I think the main aspect of your opinions is that German is not your mother tongue and you just ignore - or rather don't notice what is said. OK, I have to admit that some scenes are funny, but all in all, 6.3 is too much for my countryman;)
