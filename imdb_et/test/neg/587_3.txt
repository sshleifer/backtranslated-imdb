Well, well, do you know the shock things they use in hospitals to pump your heart over again? I needed to watch this movie for my brain. It literally took almost 4 hours to watch because I had to pause and run my brain halfway for normal functioning. I mean, this movie is so amazing to say that the script had about 10 pages of dialogue that would be generous. They're just not talking! And not to mention everything, and I admit that there were some scenes where only music was needed, and the music was great, it was probably the best part, but then listen to the symphony or something and forget about the film. So many people give this awesome comment, and by that time I would say that the special effects and filmography are pretty good, but if it were both effective and lacking, it just needed a little something, no shootem ups or sex, and so on. ., the weakness is not even required, but with a little more emotion, these guys were like rocks, sitting there with long faces. All in all, if you need something to soothe yourself, just play the movie, don't even start from the beginning, if you have seen it before, just start anywhere, let it down and relax, it will put you to sleep.
