The film begins relatively well and seems to be somewhere when an African-American traveler complains about the airline's negligence. There is one scene where his pet dog is sucked into the engine and it's really a sad thing. But how is it depicted, is it hard to see if it was an attempt to produce humor or really a tragedy to think about the extent of negligence? After that, these ideas ended clearly. If you're long enough, one of the worst movies will soon be treated. Basically it is a very racist smoking belt, toilet humor, style of every aircraft segment to reflect the African-American pop culture and nothing else. You think only three white passengers would have some fun effects, but nothing happens. They were basically just added to show how badly they were initially treated and subsequently received when they behaved. Avoid.
