I'm furious! It has been some time since the last zombie film I watched, so I was really looking forward to watching a good-looking zombie movie. HoTD2 was a big disappointment. Reasonable story but terrible action, filming, dialogue and nausea clich√©s and punches. I didn't even see the first, which is said to be worse than that ... now I'm curious how bad this one is! The film is full of bugs and hits. Who on earth is analyzing DNA with a blood sample ?? Why are these "special forces" winning "hell and back" like broken 6-year-old girls? We see wild zombies taking the bite at every opportunity, then getting hundreds of those who waves their weapons on our two "heroes", take them down, let them go even without scratch. I can go on and talk about it, but life is too short and I have been wasting for a couple of hours looking at this pathetic film that is offensive to the film industry.
