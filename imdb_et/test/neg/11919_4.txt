No idea what the film was, but on the basis that John Leguizamo was on this film, we decided to watch it. Well, it didn't turn out to be the smartest decision. In fact, this forum's second comment seems to be that we felt embarrassed for the participants in this film. <br /> <br /> Although the film is not terrible, it doesn't make any sense. William Baldwin's ranking also doesn't help. John Leguizamo is a versatile actor who deserved better. The main problem that seems to be a film was a project that started with a good intent on making a small comedy and the people in charge passed the idea. The result is an uneven film.
