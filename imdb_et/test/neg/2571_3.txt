Steven Seagal has made a really boring, bad and boring film. Steven Seagal plays doctor !!!!!! ???! This movie has some action scenes, but they are poorly targeted and have nothing to do with the rest of the movie. One American Nazi group spread a deadly virus that can destroy the state of Montana. Wesley (Seagale's character) desperately tries to find a cure and this is the story of The Patriot. Patriot is a very boring film because nothing happens. It is full of boring dialogue and illogical gaps between events and fools. Steven Seagal has completely rebuilt this movie and I do not recommend this scam to my worst enemy. 3/10
