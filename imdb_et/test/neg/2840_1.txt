Lisa Grant (Adrienne Barbeau) is a real estate agent who is in danger of being killed by a deadly maniac who kills her profession, who feels that house prices are too high. As motives go, it's pretty exhausted. Add a boyfriend happens to be a talking host whom the killer holds in the air. First of all, I was positive that it was supposed to be some kind of comedy or satire, but when the endless drone of the minute is on and on, I realized it wasn't and the film was totally incompetent in shape and form. I'm just surprised that something that fear wasn't led by Jeff Lieberman (yes, email me some hate mail again, Jeff you hack) Anyway, back to the movie, poor, bad Barbeau, you can see exactly where his film career came under the flame and everything started here. <br /> <br /> My degree: F <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: movie channel
