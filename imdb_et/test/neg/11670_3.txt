Intelligent summary, isn't it? <br /> <br /> When Mad Max was something simple, straight forward, nothing special, but nothing was wrong, they made the Road Warrior completely. So theoretically, it would have been a trilogy with the third big movie ... now, it's not! <br /> <br /> This great disappointment after Thunderdome was! Its main prerequisite is pretty cool, "underworld" (I think it's mixed between Metropolis and The Time Machine), but it doesn't take too much conviction. Add unpleasant Tina Turner and not well-planed people waiting for the plane, and that's just one big stinker. <br /> <br /> Maybe they can lighten up with Part 4 again (though it's probably just one big budget explosive thing) because it's just not right. <br /> <br /> 3/10
