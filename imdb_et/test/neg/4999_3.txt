OK - I gave him "3" just because they obviously didn't have the money to make this movie, but I think it deserves the "2.3" rating he had here. I've actually helped raise its rating despite being bored for the last hour and a half. I save "1" and "2 nd" to higher budget chunks. At least "Undead Rise" makers didn't waste so much money. They managed to waste 90 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> The film is too claustrophobic for me. The whole film takes place in the same building, in dark spaces and in corridors. Such a setting should have had more action or character, but there is only a lot of pointless talking. I didn't know any characters. There's a schoolgirl and a Goth chick, but we never find them any more. No characters seem really pleasant. <br /> <br /> The terrible movie has been made from a zero budget. There are no frightening special effects. No intercourse. Actually, there's nothing interesting here, people. I testify that I downloaded it. It was free, but I throw it away. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the filmmakers. The next time you are lucky. It's a soap opera rather than a zombie movie.
