First I am in the US. <br /> <br /> When I first saw it, I thought it was obvious - and reluctant - from "Office" (UK). So I would have given him a zero star, but look and see, it came out a long time before the Ricky Gervais series. <br /> <br /> However, it is difficult to see an exhibition with this or similar dynamics (including the American "Office") without comparisons. It's not even the same thing. <br /> <br /> I give him some credit for being original and ahead of time. I also say that this - and the US "Office" and "Larry Sanders" - are real satires. The UK's "bureau" has something bigger and more transcendental than being populated with real people at events that really felt like it happened. But unlike this or the crushing Christopher Guest, it's not really satire, while "The Newsroom" is definitely. <br /> <br /> So, as it is, "Newsroom" is still very funny. It is aside and self-conscious, but cast and with the team is not smart enough or talented to hug the goods. This is a compelling comedy on weak shoulders. Praised, but ultimately not recommended. <br /> <br /> --- And what about an anamorphic DVD? I know it was shot with an anamorphic widescreen because I saw a pilot episode in one of our HD channels. CBC, get the program. ; )
