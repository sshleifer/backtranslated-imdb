First of all, I have to admit that I have never been a big fan of the Dutch film genre. Unfortunately, De Dominee hasn't changed me when I look at it. It shares some common mistakes, such as that the impression is too predictable and linear. But the worse is that it has its own dialogues as if they were directors. Unfortunately, it is common in many Dutch films, and at least it is impossible for me to feel involved in the main characters. <br /> <br /> An actor who plays Adrian (I am sorry I forgot my name at the moment) is at least a decent performance and this is one of the reasons why I don't judge this movie even worse. Another reason is that at least it seems to have had a budget and production seems professional. Ironically, the fact that it is often too articulated may not be such a big problem if you don't speak Dutch, although I have warned you that the plot is not so spectacular, but at least it can make it an acceptable film.
