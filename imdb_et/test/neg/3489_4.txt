The "plot" of this movie contains some holes that you could drive on a massive truck, but I think it's not always a priority. Two older siblings in England are keeping their brother in the basement for over 30 years. Now he escaped and began to kill a smile, focusing on nearby military personnel. "We only thought it was the best for him," they continue repeating and? weird? all army officers love these women and do not doubt their sincerity, though 5 of their men died. I don't know if to find a revelation at the end of the discovery? or annoying! In a sense, this film reminded me of arsenic and old lace. In this black comedy classic, the mother also has two semi-mad siblings who make their silly younger brother, but they kill there. Old ladies in the basement "Beast in the Cellar" are no less crazy. The "horror" of this film in the early 1970s is very amateurish and inexpensive, but tiny attempts to build up tension. Too many "old ladies" talks about the good Olympic Games are, and rarely, what you're looking for in a horror movie with such an attractive title. Flora Robson, who can be recognized by the classic film companies, plays with one sister. He gave a picture to the Queen of England - legendary Errol Flynn's dwarf movie, Sea Hawk.
