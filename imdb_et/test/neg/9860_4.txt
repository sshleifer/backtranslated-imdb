I was disappointed with this documentary. I thought it would be about the second chess game between Grandmaster Garry Kasporov and Deep Blue, which a computer developed by IBM computer experts won any human chess. The film takes us back to 1997, where Kasporov agreed that after he had been defeated one year earlier, he was in a "deep blue" shift. But instead of playing, it focuses more on what happens before and after. The game, but not so many movies that are located in Kasporov's paranoid obsession that the game was related to some conspiracy theory and that it lost the game unfairly. the film also includes interviews with people who are not interested in talking even to the head of the building where the meeting took place. Who cares? I found it too dry and slow. All this film was dissatisfied. It's just my opinion, of course. this movie may be of interest to you. People who do not belong to chess or conspiracy theories are unlikely to have any value in this film. I'm a chess fan, and I just kept it because of it. machine "4/10
