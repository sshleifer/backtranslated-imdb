This movie, like so many others (remember Titans, Miracle), follows the basic formula of a sports movie: It's a man, he's a jerk. Jerk is bad. Jerk must play with someone else's rules. No one else's rules become Jerk, Jerk gets good. Add a tragedy (death, drugs, unrest, etc.). Tragedy Effects Jerk makes it completely unchanged. Jerk must now play in the championship. Lots of close-ups of sweating players and balls. Jerk wins. Quote from a coach or news or something that explains the title. Authors. Didn't you touch? These films can now be used to solve the morals of society. Anyone who pays to see it in theaters must hit.
