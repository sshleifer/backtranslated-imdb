I'm terrible to see that so many people have made positive comments about this movie. This film has no redemption factors. Music is not good, behavior is pathetic, I find it difficult to understand how someone could enjoy this movie, not to mention "praise". The idea is terrible, certain scene-related scenes (like the continuing love story, although the male romantic interest is SHRUNKEN HEAD) is so bad that I wanted to physically damage myself while watching them. The fact that there is a scene where the head trapped under the girls' shirt flies so that she can "feel" her and she likes it is a good reason that all the people involved in this movie are killed. The link to the West Side Story can only be a mockery, because making such an excellent movie in such a terrible is the destruction of all the copies of this movie. The long story for making it short is a terrible film. And if I had my way, everyone who likes it should go straight to hell.
