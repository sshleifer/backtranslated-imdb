iCarly is about a teenage girl named Carly Shay (Miranda Cosgrove) who lives with her artist brother Spencer in the attic in Seattle. Carly has a web exhibition that gets millions of views and makes tons of money a year, so much money she "doesn't even know the actual number". His best friend is Sam (Janette McCrudy) who is as predictable as they come! He says "normal" things and wins Carly's neighbor Freddie, who is responsible for all the technical things on his web show. Carly cries every word and looks like she has no emotions. Sam runs around Freddie and Freddie screams. In one episode, Carly and her friends shoot Lewbert (the doorman) in the elevator and live. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend it at all if you don't like teenagers who are screaming, hurting, and amusing.
