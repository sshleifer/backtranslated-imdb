Early talented John Hughes, who will soon make "Look Who's Talking" when his stars get younger, dazzling dumb guff. He gives up the Alone Alone formula again to produce the idiotic comedy where the child turns around in Chicago, while the incest kidnappers Joe Mantegna, Joe Pantoliano and Brian Haley are trying to catch him, so it takes a lot of tiring strikes. If Mantegna and Pantoliano are unable to laugh somewhere in their film, you are in trouble, but the laziness of the film is the most striking in scenes where the crowds do not notice that the baby is crawling around the sidewalk. Make it pointless.
