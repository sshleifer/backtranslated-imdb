In general, I would call it a disappointing result. He's trying to use the old "Horror Anthology" approach, but he can't do it unhappy. Action was bad and so were stories. The skin shown in the film was obviously random to attract R-rating. Typical, but I think, but bad. Take your $ 5 and rent a REAL movie!
