I wrote this as a two-part review. The second part is the spoilers. <br /> <br /> No, this is not the case with sex-related sex. This is one of racism in L.A. You know, where everyone is racist and the race is in everyone's mind all the time. Race. <br /> <br /> Like a movie, turrets have a syndrome where race is a constant topic. Race. Racist. Racism. Race relationships. Race competition. <br /> <br /> Paul Haggis made a film that captured Magnolia's structure used to unlock tangentially connected people and then twisted it 1'53 "mental vomiting in Racism in a 24-hour period, we have 7 parallel tracks connected and race, in the first hour, talking about ridiculous things and doing absurd things to be real about racism in America, for example, the story of Ludicrous and Larenz Tate offers a comic book. , where instead of cooling and talking about foot massages and religion, the characters talk about race and racism. ATTENTION: Another good thing about this is the Mexican story when a Mexican boy talks to his daughter. Decent writing, but that's just because the writers have have had daughters and they know what they say. The rest of the stories are extremely ridiculous. Hindi does not act in the similarity of reality. The scene in which he tries to lock the lock and Mexico tells him that he needs a new door is shortened and stupid. Why should anyone do this? Is it realistic? NOOO. This reminds me of The Doom Generation's convenience store secretary. "Six dollars sixty-six cents." When I look at the other side of the movie, I hope his head is kicked off and his physical head starts to cough up. <br /> <br /> I have not mentioned a section above the race. RACE. RACISM. DAY OF DAYS. Better. Then there is a black boy who wants to be white, Matt Dillon, who has a chip on a black tape, Ryan Phillippe, who looks beautiful and does nothing else, and bad bad dialogues with bad actors. When Matt Dillon puts a black woman's wife on it, could I help if I beat it? If Philippe thinks about writing his partner for his racism, can I help but I have to say that? The film is as funny as it is racist. Racist. RACIST I'll tell you. <br /> <br /> Now, remembering that this movie was nominated for the best picture, best director, best scenario, and best editing, after the rebellion of Matt Dillon, who was actually trying to get a decent job. Whoever was paid for it, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> This is not seen if you do not feel that you are talking about racism in society with a bad and unrealistic script consisting of two white men over fifty who have no form or shape to interact with reality or the actual society. <br /> <br /> D-<br /> <br /> Part 2: <br /> <br /> The other half of Crashi's first half will take all and all the story ... and spews them back for some sort of redeeming, In the end, the world is a big coincidence. And this is actually one of the worst ways to do that. <br /> <br /> Get the 1999 Magnolia. People were not instantly involved again and again. They were simply connected in a strange way that happens more often than you think. You know someone who knows someone who did something you knew someone else was involved with. Crash takes this envelope as serious. <br /> <br /> Stories are lined up so that everyone meets again. Is LAPD only 5? Don't these people work in strange exchanges? Dillon and Philippe were a late shift, then the next day? And why does Tate have to be a murdered traveler? Hadn't there been more emotional tension and realism than it would have been someone we hadn't been watching all day? Like Phillippe, he just takes a random attacker and then a freaks. Everyone would like to be amazing. <br /> <br /> Finally, the invisible hidden scene on the other side is used to get a Hindi to shoot. It marked me out and made me feel dirty. Not that Hindi let her daughter, but that they created beautiful scenes and then they were the direct reason why people tear. It really pulled me out. Writers, not a scene. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is fake and has not been fully requested. The coincidences are too much and they require the suspension of extreme belief. Unlike Magnolia, which was lightly connected, it was in the case of connections that were just up. The only good part of the second half was when Sandra Bullock fell down the stairs. He doesn't die. He should have. I was glad when he fell. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the movie is that it pulls Magnolia. Not only in the structure, but it is an assembly over the song In the Deep, where you can see that everything is depressed. Magnolia accepted it and had a postmodern comment that had all the characters on Aimee Manni's Wise Up. Unfortunately, Magnolia came out in 1999, while Crash was released in 2005. It's hard to comment on a movie that won't be done for another 6 years, but it happened. Anyway. <br /> <br /> Leave your time wasted. <br /> <br /> First Party: D-; Second half: lowest score; In general: F ---
