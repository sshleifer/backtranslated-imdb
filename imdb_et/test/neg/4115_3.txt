In the future, where a busy travel agency uses time travel technology to send wealthy customers back into time to explore the age of dinosaurs, the future will change inexplicably if one of their customers violates the cardinal rule to avoid the road. In an attempt to eliminate the damage caused, the teams of the experienced era (Edward Burns) with the technology inventor (Catherine McCormack). <br /> <br /> The assumption is pretty good and interesting. It may have some bugs, but it can still make an interesting movie. Unfortunately, the sound cannot hear the audience. It suffers from a number of problems and takes it too seriously, so it's really hard to have fun while watching a movie. Personally, I thought the script was the biggest problem with the movie. There were more holes in the plot than was hoped and the film was lazy in explaining things. I was hoping to explore the "butterfly effect" more thoroughly, but the movie was more fun than anything else. It's good for me because 90 minutes of useless fun is still a nice way to spend the evening. But the fun that this movie offered was involuntary and flat. There were a couple of scenes that kept me entertained, but I was pretty bored. <br /> <br /> Operation is not much better because most of them seem to be more interested in wages than anything else. The only person who gave a good result was Ben Kingsley. He kept the movie first and enjoyed the most fun. Edwards Burns was pretty pale and empty. I don't think he needs a leading person. But he could do a decent supportive actor. Catherine McCormack was just very annoying and not very plausible. I have not really seen him anything but he may have the potential. The rest of the participants also give bad performances, although most of them are relatively unknown, so it should not affect too much of their career. <br /> <br /> While watching bulletin boards, most people complain about special effects. They cannot be communicated and they are terrible. All dinosaurs seem really bad. Gibbon lizards (part of a monkey, part of a dino), though a creative idea, will become hidden for some time and are likely to encourage laughter rather than fear. The green screen works just terribly and unprofessionally. I really thought about what Peter Hyams was doing here. She can't offer a break, action and excitement and makes it a long sitting movie. Most of the film is pretty harmless and far from the worst film of 2005. Hopefully they will get this movie in the future. There is potential in this project, but now it is the best. Finally, if curiosity does not come out of you, there is no reason to see the sound of sound. Rating 4/10
