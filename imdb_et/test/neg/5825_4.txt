I don't understand many good comments here. I found that photography and landscapes are beautiful and the two leading actors are tempting, but there's no movie here. Most annoying are fake southern accents and poorly written dialogs. They don't seem like real people to me. While it is refreshing to show men who are studying different sexualities without the usual labeling and stereotypical qualities, most of the story is without motivation or logic. The only thing that makes sense is the responsibility that Griffith feels to his aunt for mental illness, Karen Black's utmost. Lee is an interesting character who would have been more convincing when the dialogue he spoke was more natural and his motivation was clearer. Yes, I understand he is a drifter, but his actions as a film draw a quick conclusion at all. This movie is worth a look, mainly because it has a nice atmosphere, but it's slow and deeply flawed. Serious rewriting and better editing could have saved it because the assumption and story are promising.
