This film smells great. The only reason I gave it was that the graphics were half charming. This is a total disregard for the plots and even the lack of development of an imperfect landmark seemed like nice beautiful drawings. It's a far worse anime that came out of Japan. I can't believe they actually have their names in that garbage. What hanging sells this thing for $ 20. If you haven't seen it, don't worry. If you have, I'll regret you.
