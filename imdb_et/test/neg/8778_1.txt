There are so many things about this movie that it is difficult for some to choose. Let's start with foolish and annoying songs. Like the "Ride Little Cowboy", which just tended to emphasize the urban slip of Klinton Spilsbury. The foolish cowboy songs in the background during the film undermine any credibility or momentum that the story had made for it. <br /> <br /> I saw a media hype before this movie was released and I saw Klinton Spilsbury interviewing various TV shows and had a very soft, sweet, fluttering voice. His body language was not exactly what people remembered as fans of Clayton Moore and Lone Ranger TV series. Spilsbury didn't help things work like a god and talked about the trash bin at Clayton Moore after the manufacturers were banned from Moore to appear in conventions and other events like the original Lone Ranger. Clayton Moore wasn't even allowed to "Clayton Moore, Lone Ranger." He could only sign "Masked Man". The incredible amount of the negative disclosure that this move gave to the film was only added to Spilsbury's ludicrous attitude, who was very quick to tell journalists that Clayton Moore would be forgotten soon after the film appeared! Unfortunately, even after the full flop of the movie, the company that belonged to Lone Ranger refused to quash its action against Clayton Moore and had never been allowed to sign anything except: "and he could not make his black mask public. Spilsbury's divine personality and negative publicity worse still, a few weeks before the last release of the movie, the news that James Keech had overwritten Spilsbury's voice in the film was leaked because the producers thought Spilsbury was not very convincing in the form of a cowboy. brought out the talks and the comedy of this era shows the last coffin of the nail. <br /> <br /> But then Merle Haggard was telling her way through the film. Spilsburo's credibility as Lone Ranger. Merle Haggard's narration was just another annoyance that the viewers had to deal with. ib Haggard's story and it sounds like a weird kiddie movie. Combine the rhyming story with "Ride Little Cowboy" songs and all the credibility that Spilsbury could have gathered was destroyed by Haggard and the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Tonto played Michael Horse and, as others have pointed out, Horses had much more personality than Spilsbury. In fact, due to Spilsbury's allegedly struggling attitude towards filming, Horse was given much more dialogue and screen time if someone had been waiting for Tonto. Tonto takes over Lone Ranger and is often the leader. I had waited (or hoped) that Billy Jack would make Tonto a brother (it would have made the film much better). The horse is not only more interesting than Spilsbury, but it says more and has better scenes. Perhaps it was the horse that stole the Spilsbury exhibition. But because the film was so sad, Horse didn't get much recognition. Unlike Spilsbury, the horse industry has had a very productive career in the film industry. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the last negative thing about this movie is The Lone Ranger's blue outfit. The material chosen for Spilsbury was more blue than Clayton Moore, who usually appeared. This color choice for the equipment just made Spilsbury more feminine in its role. The comic book had shown that Lone Ranger was also wearing a red shirt and black trousers and that alternative clothing would have helped Spilsbury be more convincing than Lone Ranger. <br /> <br /> The supportive majority was posted in your presentation. They all look like they were working on television and someone seemed very convincing. Even a villain, Cavendish lost his edge because of the people around him. In general, I feel sorry for Spilsburo. Not only did he do a terrible job, but it was obvious that production and disclosure were terrible and sabotaged by all kinds of poor people. Even if he were a great substitute for Clayton Moore, I doubt that the film would have worked well because of other factors. As it is, this movie is funny.
