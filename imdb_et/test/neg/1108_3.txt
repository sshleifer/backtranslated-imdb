As someone has already said, living dead dolls were lovely and when they came up with a new series of Wicked little things I would buy one or two. Basically, this movie was in the dark, not in a frightening sense, but in that I didn't see a definite way. And it was boring. The three women in the wife, the youngest, said they would not be in the forest at all (well, not drowned) and would have been better if their advice was accompanied by their death. And no one is doing any cleaning or whitewashing or anything, you think a lot of cough would happen. A sexy young mother, where you are wasting your time to catch your age (with my calculations 34 or 36.) And it seemed that it was longer than 20 years because someone had lived there, so what were the young adult photos of fathers in a much older album? I'm so tired of clichés that are just lazy writing, and here they come thick and fast. Teenagers get stoned and drunk in the car and know well where it leads .... death and visible deafness, because Tim feels scared of his friends. I mean, I've pushed a lot of cars where the instructor did not shout and I heard them. Cliché weird man in the woods whom no one believes. A plumber who has lived there for many years, and this is his first experience with these children, so driving around him avoids keeping the body dead at night ... run him over the idiot! Cliché ... travels in the woods with no idea where you go, armed with the knowledge that children (and again) are an ax. A pointless scene in the brutality of pigs ... why do so many directors see the problem of animal distortion and killing? I would have seen many children running up and down the road. Zombies do not seem to have so much energy in other films. His great part was in the shop .. tramp and demand first to deliver. Whatever the eventful man he was. Why not kill him before the family got there and avoid making the film or doing it again. I'll give my signs to the house, the forest and the little Gothi dolly I want!
