this film is about people living in a caravan. Later in the film it turns out that these people are comedians, mostly old men. well, more or less they sit around the movie and speak f *** ing. but there is nothing but the people who speak. At first I thought it was a somewhat perverted reddish color, but after a while it got bored. I mean, how many versions do you think f *** ing, d ** k & c ** t say? it may be funny - maybe half an hour, not 80 minutes. but it was funny to see those people who are trying to act. I'm pretty sure they often read their text on some pages when playing them. but it doesn't interfere with the movie, it's so cool. because these people seem so poor, f *** ed-up, crestfallen *** oles that style perfectly fits. their wood, helpless reading of the texts, is a good atmosphere, I fell in love with some characters. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER AHEAD *** later in the movie f *** they make some comedy shows (rhymes from f *** ing) that are just like the audience and imaginative applause. then you get one of the eviction tips and so they decide to protect the trailer park and enter its roofs - armed with weapons. then they shot. fin. sounds like action, but it's not. just some trashy home camera takes. *** SPOILER END *** <br /> <br /> But the film is entirely due to its style and I'm pretty sure it's what the filmmaker wanted. it is a portrait of those f ** k-ups that are groggy in the home-camera style and have characters that can't act, but they seem to be interesting personalities so they're nice to watch. but the texts - what you know - all the time boring after a while. <br /> <br /> A real young director who also seems to be an interesting person because he played some teenager in popular movies / TV series but now I got more horror movies that are more of his cup of tea I think. and now divides his first direction-ping troma now. does not know anything about the release, I got it from the beginning of this year as a "waitress" that says it is "just for launch".
