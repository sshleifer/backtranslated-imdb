Obviously Raw Feed Video is wiser than all of us who wasted our money on renting this flick! They make millions of video opportunities, and their low budget investments cost a large amount to finance "Rest Stop II". I think they spent a couple of hundred thousand dollars on the Americans to hire the actors, spent the rest of the stop and burned the truck and drove the motorcycle a little plus plus paying for the technical things. That's it. We should all be as smart as these guys, I won't knock them out to be a genius to promote a stinker to get a good financial return. The film's premise was good, and it could have been a really horrible movie, but it didn't work if it didn't give a clear story. I'm always looking for a gem from top movie companies, but I couldn't find it here or you. I'm just sorry that I lost $ 3.99 plus tax.
