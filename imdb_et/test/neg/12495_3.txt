CyberTracker is sometimes located in Los Angeles in the near future, with bodyguard Eric Phillips (co-producer Don 'The Dragon' Wilson) rescuing Senator Robert Dilly (John Aprea) from the attempted murder of the Alliance of Human Rights and Human Rights. The rights of angry Dilly to lead a computer-based court system that has sent CyberTracker-named robots to determine the guilty justice. Anyway, Eric Dilly, who is very impressive and decides to see if he can trust in his shady activities Eric, like a betrayal of a cold bloody murder, being a slim man who is Eric, hasn't impressed when Dilly kills a woman and is asked to keep silent . Eric flees and leads to bring Dilly down, but Dilly has many powerful friends and uses his influence to send Eric and his CyberTracker to him. <br /> <br /> director Richard Pepin I think movies like CyberTracker give a bad name to movies, I didn't like it at all. The Jacobsen Charter script is quite predictable, it doesn't irritate, it steals most of the ideas and themes between other better sci-fi movies and martial arts activities and sci-fi confusion. There are a few battles, some car races and a couple of shooting fields, but it's all pretty boring and forgotten. The film has no imagination, given that the film is set in the future, and it deals with robots, technology and the way society works, and especially this judicial system. Speaking of the fantastic Robocop (1987) blending its violent action and smart social comment perfectly, but CyberTracker did not even try to make any relevant social statement or attempt to portray any meaningful moral message about law enforcement, the script basically uses robots and shooting fields, which Robocop did well, but also managed to add a good story. There's very little in CyberTrack that I can say it's entertaining and that's what movies are right for? <br /> <br /> Director Pepin does it well, but nothing seems to be quite forgotten and not very exciting. Sci-fi elements are nothing more than the robot side of things, and the whole film does not look so futuristic. Action scenes are fine, there are some exploding cars and some shoot out but nothing remarkable. <br /> <br /> Technically, CyberTracker is average because the movie that is supposed to be set in the future seems to be dated and special effects are bad. Action was bad, I don't know if Don 'The Dragon' Wilson notes this name by checking? <br /> <br /> CyberTracker was a waste of my time, here's nothing original or exciting, and the action is immediately forgotten. Poor & it's all to be said, not recommended.
