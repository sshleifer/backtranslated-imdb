Mario Racocevic from Europe is the only user who has commented on the main points of the film so far. Another hard movie to buy in the UK. I had to go through Midnight Video with a Swedish branch. I went to the post office and bought the mail and ordered this similar title only with the title of SKR30. <br /> <br /> This movie goes under "aka", depending on when and where it is marketed. I had previously purchased "Bloodsucker Leads Dance" (what you can find when you search for Imdb "people" and input "Krista Nell"). An actor who plays the count on his private island on the last film, his words were dubbed from Italian to English, whose actor is unmistakably mourning and quite tired with a voice. I smiled when I heard the same voice dubbing on the English soundtrack as a police inspector investigating the murder of a prostitute killed in him. My choice was, of course, to see another outing. D There are quite a few somewhat unreasonable subpages containing blackmail / blackmail, things disobedient to girlfriends, chasing a motorcycle, resulting in a gangland blow, gangrape "client" motorcycle friends, buggy photography, transvestites, and so on. which gives this film a smell that is summed up with the word - SLEAZE (but artistic sleaze) .The first contributor liked this film, but the low rating gave other Imdb fans albeit not explaining their "wheres and whyfores." Personally I thought it was too lots of sub-blocks and not enough of the main event and the relationship between their subordinate characters in the development of the central plot and their screen marks. the editor was very necessary because some scenes seemed to last too long, having made their point so that the film seemed to be dragging in places; e.g. dance transvestite scene. Krista Nell appears with a customer on a single fruit image, but it is just a vignette, and I missed her, the director and the scenario. <br /> <br /> I love the political injustice shown in older movies (that is 30 years of making it), such as smoking in offices and the way some characters react to each other in the office, suggesting a 4/10 rating more realistic attributed.
