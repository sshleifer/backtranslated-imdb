It was the flick that was killed as a result of this concept. The idea was flat - take a small character of the average PG-13 movie and make a complete non-sequel by changing it to a PG-rated family. I was not the least interested. Then a trailer came. Not only did it confirm that the film was uncomfortable and general, but also succeeded in giving away the ENTIRE movie; and I am not exaggerated - every moment, every point on the plot, is told about the trailer of each joke. It's like a 3-minute version of Cliff Notes. So obviously I didn't pay to see it, but when it hit the DVD, I was sure I was looking at it for free. Maybe Steve Carell can save it. <br /> <br /> Not. <br /> <br /> I am still confused about why he accepted it. He must be indebted to someone. The jokes were all so flat and obvious, and the director obviously asked him a very comedy style like the original Bruce Almighty Jim Carrey. But it's not just funny. The studio obviously tried to achieve the success of the 40-year-old Virgin, with several Carelli's past, with reference to theater, and another musical closure process. But even talented Carrell won't save it. His co-stars are not much better than people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill and Ed Helms. Wanda Sykes doesn't waste, she's just the waste she's doing, and her terrible one-liners and reactions make you want people to stop working. <br /> <br /> The story itself is just predictable and lazy. It throws you over the head, obviously cautiously, like ignoring Evan's environment (driving the gas-fired Humvee, deciding to use a tree of endangered trees for his house, hating animals ...) and finally it's over - top preaching on both faith and the environment. <br /> <br /> Why did you make a movie at all, is puzzling enough, but I really don't understand how it was most expensive comedy. The only real effect is the existence of all animals, and the integration of these scenes is the worst and most obvious blue / green screen I've ever seen. Maybe letting live animals is lucky. Who knows. But whatever it was, it cost them so much, it didn't become a quality, that's for sure. But hey, it wasn't the worst movie of the year. Norbit and Death Proof are still much worse.
