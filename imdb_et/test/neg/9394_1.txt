This is just one of them, "America finds romance against an exotic European countryman." This genre has gone bankrupt since the 1950s, but they continue to fall out. I let my girlfriend talk to see it - a bad idea, we both hated it. If you want to see Tuscany, look at Liv Tyler's "Stealing Beauty", which is a slightly better film. <br /> <br /> Movies of this genre are very much a Hallmark greeting card.
