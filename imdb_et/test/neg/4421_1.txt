This movie is a hodge-podge of various idiotic clich√©s. For example, a boy will meet a spoiled-rich-girl and will be able to fall in love with him by harassing him in college (overused background in recent Indian commercials). The chauvinistic glorification of the men of sexual conquest. The climax is predictable (used in many other films). Like many other recent commercial Hindi films, the film also has inconsistent insertion of songs, which probably helped the film's success more than anything else.
