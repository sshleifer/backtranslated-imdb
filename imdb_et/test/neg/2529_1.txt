I can't believe it! Were they crazy about filming a movie about Connecticut in southern California? There's a Palm Tree everywhere for God. In an opening scene, the man says "Welcome to Connecticut" and throws the newspaper down, the newspaper says something like "Greenwich Herald". Greenwich Connecticut has no "Herald" with "Times" like "Stamford Advocate and GREENWICH TIMES". (Referring to Stamford, Connecticut newspaper). Perhaps the filmmakers should have done little research, think about my god, at least get a newspaper name or movie in places that look at least as far as Connecticut.
