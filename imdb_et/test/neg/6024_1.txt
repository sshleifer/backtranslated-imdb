I remember hey Hi Fuss and I saw Jackson Jive, it was a pretty straight forward-comedy face, but I saw it & it's free and it's clear? Am I missing something? If the black community were to complain about any racist comments on the TV show, it should be it and if you've read my previous comments, I'm not an easily offensive man. The main plot is that Africa / America moves alongside this white woman and these make racist comments such as the value of the house just because of its black neighbors and white boy. Don't Read More Nig-Nog Jungle Boy Sambo. (I'm sorry, but it really happens in this show that I'm really a good man from the black community.) swear in one episode I saw in someone's eye, focusing on a situation that is not related to the situation. All In All Awful Comedy.
