BLACK EYE (2 outta 5 stars) The film of the 70's sleeping in a dream-like way looks like it was made for television ... only the occasional cuss-word and sub-block of lesbianism tell you that the movie is actually shown in theaters. Fred Williamson plays a tough guy who becomes a tough private client. He stumbles upon a murders and murders involving a mysterious rose. There are some fistfights, the Bullit-inspired car chase, the pretty original elevator scene, and even the time for Williamson's girlfriend (Teresa Graves) for a rich lesbian lover. There is also a scene where Williamson tempts poor old men by breaking some of the priceless old autographs in his memorial shop. Yeah, how to go, tough guy ... maybe you can find a little bit to beat later? Obviously, the money had to come from the success of "Shaft" (this and about six thousand other films), this film does not have enough impression or enough originality to impress.
