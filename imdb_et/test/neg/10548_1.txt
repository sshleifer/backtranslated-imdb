The poisonous avenger ... <br /> <br /> The idea behind this film is that the person who the general population would call this person loosely and after being thrown into the barrage of toxic waste, the superhero mutated in 1985 is completely upset. This movie is listed as a horror ... I've even read the culture of this series .... <br /> <br /> Now this movie has even been made so bad that I couldn't watch it because the actor is terrible even for an independent movie that I thought was the horror of this movie ... <br /> <br /> drug trafficking, sumo, Godzilla entrance .... I'm all the movies that promote drugs ... the fuck i even like Godzilla and well sumo ... I am not in this, but I still think that sumo heights would love to give this movie 1000 movies and ground salt in the eyes of the filmmakers ... <br /> <br /> Personally, I am almost ready to write it to the filmmaker who did it, and asked them the 87 minutes or less from my life. <br /> <br /> For me, one in 10 is too high to be too bad to have 0 (zero) or even negative integers. <br /> <br /> In other words, this movie is JUNK ...... would rather look at the color dry and deal with explosive diarrhea, then watch this movie again ... I would be the first person to use not only packaging this movie as firing but i would like a good movie and script to burn.
