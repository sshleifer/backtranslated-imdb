It seems that some viewers assume that the only thing that makes the viewer do not like such a movie is graphic violence. In fact, violence, both disruptive and comic, is the last of "deep" shortcomings of "Oldboy". The characters are the same size, underdeveloped, primitive. "Intensity", obsession and purpose in itself with this director are delivered by the cheapest means. Let us not confuse the adrenaline shooting of art with an artistic value. At the end of the film, it seems that all the cards were exhausted, so that the script becomes almost unintentionally funny to find new "horror" levels, to continue "shocking" the audience that has already strayed. empty soap opera "revelations" were already in large clusters. It would be hard to imagine that even a vague acquaintance is the masterpieces of Asian cinema in the last fifty years, which is fascinated by this pompo trash. Imagine Homer Simpson in front of a cinema theater: "Should I go in or buy five money with the same money?" Be smart, Homer, go to the ice cream.
