I've recently watched a lot of Asian horror movies, but this must be the worst. It started interestingly, but disappears after the first 15 minutes of the movie. Added "drama" scenes, kickback sequences and serious plot holes left me hanging. What really happened in the tunnel? Just "something terrible" ??? Who started all the killings if it wasn't a ghost? What did he want to return to? No answers! In general, it is not very scary and filmmakers have to come up with a much better idea ... <br /> <br /> One positive actor was a cute actress, but that's something. <br /> Not recommended.
