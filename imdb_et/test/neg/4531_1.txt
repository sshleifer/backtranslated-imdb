After the nonsense and vitality of Road 61 and Roadkill, I was expecting the film to shine, but it was as swollen and self-expression as the hard stone stars show. This tempo pulled, not too long the hallucination sequence, the characters were flat and unememable, and Art Bergmann is not Jello Biafra. I had to wake up.
