They've made a story expensive for people living in the heart of Edinburgh, a real story and making it the way Hollywood has done before the story of many. The end result is a film that is well made for those who don't know the story completely differently and inaccurately. The original film of this story, watched by Walt Disney himself, used the right breed of dog, which is extremely important for this story and did not make John Gray special, he was poor Shepard who died in stranger poverty. If you like the story, check out the Disney original for a better heart warming story. It is a shame and the potential was there for the classic story of terrible reproduction. Read the book to tell the story. And if you like it, you can visit Edinburgh's actual Kirkyard.
