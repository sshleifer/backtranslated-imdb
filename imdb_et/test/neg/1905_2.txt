If it weren't for Colin Firth, the film would be ready for the dust bin! So predictable, so stupid and so badly acted! Only Colin Firth, as always, shines through this mess as the end of a single tunnel of light! <br /> <br /> The worst was certainly Jennifer Rubin's action! Maybe it was because of this script (do they really have it written or was it just "on the way" ???). <br /> <br /> A short short story: <br /> <br /> This is only for Colin Firth Fanatics (like me) because he is an incredibly sexy and good actor (struggling hard against this "spiritual challenge" against the script). The minutes of Colin-Screen-Time make this movie a lot. <br /> <br /> Don't spend too much money on it. Try to see or get it as cheap as possible (auction or something) and then stick to the Colin Firth scenes. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie may be harmful to mental health.
