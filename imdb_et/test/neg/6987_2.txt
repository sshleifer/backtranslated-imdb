This movie must be the inferior movie I've ever seen. I only looked at half an hour and I just closed it. The cars in this movie look like two front ends of the geo-metro that are mixed up. This movie is not even good to laugh. The only time I laughed, Dante was funny with a voice saying, "Nobody gets Dante, Muhwa hwa." I told the holy god and closed it. Bad, bad movie. 2/10
