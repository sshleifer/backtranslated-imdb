I watched this movie tonight and I have to say it's terrible! I was expecting this to be great because you know, usually we don't have many movies about Asian Asian vampires mixed with Asian culture; but from the beginning it started badly: the introduction of the movie seemed to be over! The plot is so weak and if you take off the battles and the soundtrack, there's nothing useful at all! The director of this film does not have any important understanding of how much time it takes for example in the introduction and setbacks (not to mention some other) <br /> <br /> Like me, people who want a big vampire to watch a movie, I suggest that I look at '' missing guys '' or '' Vampire Interview ''.
