This movie is too stupid for words. Even if you think it's a movie parody, if you think it's completely in camp, even if you're wasting your time watching it - because you've seen it a hundred times before. But maybe you're a fan of big big girls, you still love Barbie and Ken and you can get this typical 80's electric guitar background noise ... Well, if you have a chance.
