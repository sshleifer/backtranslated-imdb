I'm sorry to find words to express how bad this movie was. The initial injunction was promising, but later it was terrible. Let's go through the main points. The plot - a good original idea, but a really terrible development. There were many points when I thought "no, no one is doing anything like this stupid". The end was amazingly anticlimactic. Characteristics - All characters were either delicate or grotesque cartoons. I always try to think about what was not - maybe mother, but that's it. Music - intrusive, inappropriate and generally horrible. Direction - completely amateur. Cinematography - Do you doubt they have heard about it. Camera angles / stability / zoom levels are often very bad. I'm totally confused about how this movie was so high. This is the worst film I've been in the cinema for years, if ever.
