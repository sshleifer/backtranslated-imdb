Honestly terrible movie, bad editing, terrible lighting, terrible dialogue and dirty scenario. <br /> <br /> Lighting is so bad that there are moments that can't even be seen what's going on, I even tried to play with contrast and brightness so I could see something, but it didn't help. <br /> <br /> They have to find the script in the trash, the character is just as terrible, and if you expect much from Jean-Claude, Van Damme's film can catch up all the time. You can't even laugh at the cheese. <br /> <br /> Leadership and editing are terrible, the whole movie follows a very tired routine and fails every step of the way, when it swells through a plot that is so weak, it's just unrealistic. <br /> <br /> There's nothing more to say than it's really bad and something like the previous work of Jean-Claude Van Damme you might enjoy. <br /> <br /> Avoid plaque, frankly, I can't condemn this "movie".
