I struggle to see this movie point. It should be comedy, but I never laughed. The style is what might have been interesting in the movie, but because it is made by comics, the result is incredible (comedies should be). The series of comics was a great hit, even with episodes, and fair to say that all the things involved have done great things. One to avoid. I also found that comments should be 10 lines. The idea behind these comments is to signal whether watching a movie is worth it: don't write an essay about it or subtract it from it. If you want: Seinfeld, Larry Sanders, Young, Alan Partridge, Arrested Development, Curb, Red Dwarf, then you could pass it on. On the other hand, if you like flat jokes that can be found with friends and Dodgeball, look at it!
