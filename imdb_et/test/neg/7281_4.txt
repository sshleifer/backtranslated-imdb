I really don't see anyone enjoying this movie. I don't think I've ever seen a movie as boring as this self-conscious piece of junk. It would probably have been better for the director not to have spent most of his film presenting his works of art, which is actually not so spectacular. Another thing I really disliked is when the face was kicked, then soon the gallon of blood starts to flow. I don't know how people bleed there in Japan, but I hope they have a lot of blood donors.
