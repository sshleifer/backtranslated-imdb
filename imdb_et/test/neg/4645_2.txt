After reading both _River_God_ and _The_Seventh_Scroll_, I can't start expressing how disappointed I was with this movie. Although I agree with some poetic license, this film is constantly different from books, making unbelievable injustice to Wilbur Smith's fascinating, plausible and marvelous stories. I can only believe that film writers, directors and producers have never heard of Mr. Smith, not to mention reading his work. Smith's viable testimonials are converted from wood, all historical things are ignored or discounted, and the realism of books is changed to include comic book fitters. And why is the Egyptian henchman Spanish? Geesh, it's no wonder the movie is made in the TV mini series! Did Wilbur Smith have any input in making this film? I can't believe he did it. A terrible and terrible movie. If you've read either or both books, don't waste your time or money watching this money. You are very disappointed, I assure you. <br /> <br /> Only one moment of supreme generosity persuaded me to give this film a "2" ranking and only because of its beautiful, sometimes remarkable photography.
