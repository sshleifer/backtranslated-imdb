The scientist (George Zucco) wants to create wolves for fighting American Nazis, but it is called crazy. He uses a simple gardener (Glenn Strange) to experiment with mixing his blood with the blood of a wolf. Strange, Constant Dialogue Continuously Lon Chaney Jr. with "Of Mice and Men", does not know what is happening, but that he walks. Victims begin to pile up (including a little girl who can be disturbed by modern viewers and two Zucco competitors). There is a good dialogue about how one should not be confused with nature (still common) and play God. Zucco's motives can be honorable, but his methods are the most questionable. And then her daughter, Anne Nagel, is strange to Strang, but she has no idea of ​​her father's actions. Johnny Downs is a reporter who gets to the bad side of Zucco, questioning him, but wins the heart of Nagel, creating a regular and always boring romantic sub-block in classic horror movies. After 77 minutes it is about 15 minutes longer than usual in the early 1940s (especially one from China who issued it), so a romantic story could have cut costs and speed things up. . Fortunately, Zucco is never hammy; He left that Bela Lugos (who always delighted in the theatrical sense of what he proclaimed to the audience) and England Todd Slaughter. But try not to think of the "Monster Bride" lab while looking at Zucco's work, or some of Lugos' dialogue in this classic cult film. "Mad Monster" is no longer following the cult because it is not a gratifying bad, just a bored pace more than a couple. For Chinese and Monogram lovers I would recommend higher than "The Corpse Vanishes" or "Fog Island"
