I wanted to like such a movie and there is definitely room for a psychological-oriented film that doesn't go into cheap excitement. But to enjoy the movie, you need an incredible plot, some tempo and editing, and a sense of engagement. In Clearing, which begins as an intriguing secret, with robbery and unknown motives, sluggish draggy becomes a meaningless exercise. Nothing really happens, and the so-called nature-driven corners (as expressed by the director in his commentary) really do not add much. <br /> <br /> Here are some fine actors. Robert Redford does his best to involve Willem Dafoe. Dafoe brings some nuances to his character, as he seems somewhat sympathetic to him. It's unfortunate that Dafoe is type-approved as a villain, he's gone to Christopher Walken's Hall of Fame. <br /> <br /> Wendy Crewson is usually good, but her character's entry into the film was short and lively, and I was wondering why they even introduced their character. Absolutely the biggest waste of talent was Helen Mirren. In the director's commentary, I heard everything about the fabulous talent. I agree that he is a great actor. Then why didn't he use it right? Only in the direction of the climax of this film can he show himself, but by that time the viewer has given up care. <br /> <br /> Too bad, I liked some of this movie, but because another reviewer wrote when you know the movie doesn't get much better.
