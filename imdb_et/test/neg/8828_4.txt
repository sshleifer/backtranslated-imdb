It is very possible that I just didn't give the movie enough opportunity because it was just as unpleasant for me (something like the Belleville Triplet), but I really took it when the film and my roommate, a student from Japan, immediately started to film laugh, saying it sounds stupid. Now, I do not agree that it is stupid, animation is very simple, but clearly very skilled. It's like a classic animation with added layers that add to the reality element, while remaining strictly a surreal country. <br /> <br /> But the theme is completely unpleasant for me. It has an interesting message of passion and greed, but it is packed in such unpleasant packages that have hardly been learned, especially since you already knew it. Sound effects, when a person is loudly passionate about cherry and cherry, are indeed repelling. <br /> <br /> There was a clever animation image when we dive endlessly into the hole the man finds in his head when he pulls the plant out of his scalp, but it continues so long as it hides everything else. There are so many stocks in this one order that it is almost the same as the whole movie. <br /> <br /> As I told Belleville's triplets, it would have been a great thing for a late night TV. like an adult swimming or Japanese colleague, but an Academy Award nominee? This gives me the impression that the academy does not usually have a list of long animated short films.
