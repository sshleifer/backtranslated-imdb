Watch this movie ..... just to really appreciate how good the original is. I'm not really hard, but it was one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It was deeply hurt for me because I like Chevy Chase, Jackie Mason and Dyan Cannon. Writing was just terrible! I thought Chevy would have at least better things than he did. There was hardly any laugh in this movie. I went there who wanted to enjoy it. I wanted to laugh, but I almost shouted. <br /> <br /> At first, it looks at Chevy Chase's special look. It worried me from the beginning. Chevy is actually more than I thought he would. This is more than a "special look". Too bad looks were not special. The character of Mason would have been of a good secondary nature but became old. I'd rather have seen more (much more) of Dyan Cannon. At least his character was fun, if not well written. I also missed a teen sex scene. Mr. Gopher went to the cute and innocent rodent who deserved it. Jonathan Silverman is the only one who was interested in me and we didn't see him enough. <br /> <br /> I'll take it back. Try ... watch this movie, then ... remember Alamo, Maine and CaddyShack I.
