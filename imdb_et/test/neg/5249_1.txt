This movie is painful. This is probably the best way to describe it. It's 93 minutes of your life that you can never come back. Well, in fact it is more than 86 minutes, because no one wants to sit through this credit in this stinky dog ​​stool. Immediately you can tell the movie "Mortal Kombat" from the producer because it is a striking and annoying techno soundtrack. It empties some of the ridiculously enjoyable moments that this movie gives you. The remainder is emptied by a totally uninteresting and tedious character - "Freddie Prinze, Jr. acting school", which works on the capabilities of all parties (including Christopher Lambert in trouble) and non-existent leadership. Did I leave something out? Of course I did. Let's not forget the suicide script, which is a (??) funny dialog. Oh, yes, and we're also talking about how they shamed the original poetry with this sad and useless futuristic / medieval translation. Costumes and guns (were the giant pizza cutters I saw?!) Are just stupid, this is the best way to describe them. And the last culprit at night is always a terrible CGI. When do filmmakers learn that CGI sucks? When do we see the wonderful effects of the 80s? Probably never, but such films and "Star Wars, Episode 1: Phantom Menace" want them to return them. Finally, beware of this movie like the newest Freddie Prinze, Jr. film. Then, if you like Freddie Prinze, Jr. movies, you deserve to sit through this terrible apology for film making.
