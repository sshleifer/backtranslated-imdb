A funny thing happened to me with "Mosquito": on the one hand, the hero is deafening and the director is unable to fully understand why he does what he does (distortion of the dummies ... er, sorry for the corpses) through his pictures. On the other hand, at least the English version is duplicated. So I found that I would have liked more dialogue at the same time! This movie is stupid (funny, how does this man have access to every cemetery and cemetery in his city) and delicate (where would we be in the 70s exploiters without our free lesbian scene?). Not to mention the "romantic" aspect (oh, how cute!) ... It's not. (*)
