Hellraiser: Bloodline is a place where the consistency of the Hellraiser series is well and truly set. The imagination and invention of the first two films have gone by. Gone are the ethics of Pinhead and his minions. Gone are the sick people you want. In fact, all that made Hellraiser so original is the filth of this picture. <br /> <br /> All that is left is the basic principle of Christian mythology that hell is evil demons. What happened to the evil that men do? This weakened excuse for the Hellraiser movie is padded with endless Psycho Babble, so Pinhead becomes a nonsense spraying philosopher and not a condemnant, as he must be. <br /> <br /> The film uses the most basic film formulas, the symbols of which separate and kill individually. Pinhead is not an alien. The connection between the box and the "demons" or "hell" has never been created, but becomes a victim and sits on the sideboard. <br /> <br /> Leading female Character is called "Rimmer" and manufacturers probably think it's really funny because everyone says their name. Indeed, the film should have been reused to give it a sign. <br /> <br /> You will be ashamed of Kevin Yagher and Alan Smithee.
