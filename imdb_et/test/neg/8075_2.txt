Stephen King's TV movies can go to 5 or 6 and no one complains, right? Why give Stooges only 96 minutes? I'm not asking for a PBS mini-series, but would the two partners have killed anyone? The film was evaporated over the events that should have been mentioned and the events that could have been omitted. I want to pay tribute to star performances ... they had a hard job because they didn't look like Stooges, but the spirit was there. After watching the movie, I pulled out a tape from American Movie Classics that had the real thing and smiled foolishly. The film was emotionally tough, especially after Curly had a stroke and Moe had to go on business. When Curley started crying, I lost it ... As I said, this movie was good, but it could and should have been a lot, much better. Maybe it fits though ... Stooges got rid of when they were alive and now, 25 years later, it happens again.
