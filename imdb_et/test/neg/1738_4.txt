This film started as a fairly decent film, but it never came out, but became predictable and even a bit stupid. Some scenes were pretty well done, photography and cuts used with sounds and such are a bit more interesting to look at, but since this story was rather slow, it couldn't keep the interest alive. And more importantly, it's not scary at all! It should be a horror movie, but there were no scenes that were close to frightening or even exciting .. <br /> <br /> Frankly, participants were not so big, colorful characters you remember all the rest of the day. <br /> <br /> Generally, it is a traceable movie, but it doesn't add anything and if you stop watching it will take a long time to forget it. <br / / <br /> Because I looked at it because I had read some of the reviews, giving him the best results, but I disagree and I would rate it out of 4 out of 10. If you still want a Japanese horror, I would recommend you look at Ju-On instead! <br /> <br />
