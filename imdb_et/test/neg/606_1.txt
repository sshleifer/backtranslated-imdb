This sitcom has no characters with redeemable features. All of them are self-centered, uncomfortable or two-dimensional. My husband looks at it, claiming that there is nothing else, but I don't see anything. <br /> <br /> The only sitcom that I think was worse was yes, dear. At least that didn't get 9 seasons. Leah Remin may have a talent, but if that is the case, he will go to a wasteful woman. Jerry Stiller is a convincing old man. Maybe that's why. <br /> <br /> This is a great example of why sitcom is open.
