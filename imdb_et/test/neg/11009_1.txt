Let me first say that I really wanted to like this movie. Mostly, the actors and actors saw their parts and did their roles quite well, but the film had no real plot. It seems to be "strange" that no interesting story went through. Camera work was also often sloppy, trying to do camera work and failed. In most of the times, the cool pictures were confusing. Maybe something was lost during the translation, but some characters were just ... stupid. Crazy beautiful boy who sniffs people like a dog? Uhhhhhh. OKAY. In general, the fat is smelly 1/10. Not worth your time.
