Sometimes a movie cannot be categorized. Such a movie is "Tank Girl", part of the comic, part of comedy and partial action. I'm sure somewhere in the "Tank Girl" audience, but it's extremely small, maybe a punk comic book reader. Most viewers are looking for early exit or live with a speed dial button. humor breaks "would find me a pair of microscope and pair of tweezers," but these little moments of comic strips outweigh the sophomorphic sequences of action, there is no form of character that is not surprising because the source is a comic book. Take advantage and avoid, avoid. - MERK
