"The Comedy of Biblical Proportion!" These hyperbole masters, movie tag writers, again; The 2003 Bruce Almighty sequel, barely rising. The only thing that raises my interest in the ultimate indifference to this film is his dogmatic Christian foundation. Sorry, make it a record. <br /> <br /> Steve Carrel, ignoring Jim Carrey's idea of ​​playing back, must play Evan Baxter, who is the curious anchor of Bruce Almighty, who has just chosen Congress. Under the pressure of relocating a new life in Virginia and an acropolis, the pressure of all the changes is borne by his family. His wife (Lauren Graham), apparently inspired by Stepford and three sons (Jimmy Bennett, Graham Phillips, and Johnny Simmons) who work on the piano for the piano, pray that the family would get closer and almost out of guilt, including Evan. <br /> <br /> Whatever must be the biggest shock all the time, God (Morgan Freeman) actually appears, but is all the irritating "mysterious way of working" all over, saying to Evan that he is building a Noa-esquire ship to Prepare a great flood instead of giving it a billiard table or X-box or something. And in a real naughty deity style, he also forces Evan to grow beard, long hair and worn out worn clothes. Now, that day, I'm sure it was hard to get the shave, so the beard was a bit inevitable for Noah, but I'm almost sure he has nothing to do with spirituality. With the same clothes; such impractical clothing is certainly made even more complicated by massive construction work. Didn't God create a pair of steel toe boots and a hard hat for a poor guy? Probably not ... When paraphrasing oxygen, I find that the idea that God is somewhat confused to us, and so does Evan, who struggles with him every step of the way. And who is not? God becomes her mainly dismissed, drives her loved ones, makes her laugh, and at one point threatens her. Of course, God is right and a rational, hard-working family member who punishes himself is forced to eat large pieces of bitter funny pies. It's almost like God was alone, Evan had to endure him and humor. What message is that? <br /> <br /> Evan Almighty has a very commendable environmental protection, which is based on the fact that the federal government is blind to the damage to the world around us. It is also the first film ever to compensate for its carbon dioxide emissions, and it should definitely be considered an important achievement of the Hollywood studio. If it hadn't been a despicable banner of American Christianity that had flown high up in America, Evan Almighty could have been an unpleasant family film with a commendable environmental record. But with its confused religious dogmas and relentless "dark faith" message, it is the most controversial film of all time.
