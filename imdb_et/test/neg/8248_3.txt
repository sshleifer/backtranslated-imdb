When Hollywood tries to understand what an "intelligent person" is, they cannot find it so unhappy that it is difficult to put words into the mouth of the alleged "genius". <br /> <br /> True, every genius is going to try to rub their superiority anyway. Of course, are they hanging in bars and fighting? it is not like they (generalize wildly) autistic nerds who never have tanning. <br /> <br /> In addition, if you are a genius, you will know everything about mathematics and history and politics, and of course you will have a constant date and thorough analysis. Coz these things, like everything, go with n stuff, y'know? <br /> <br /> Plus, you walk around all the time. You are just the son of your knowledge, that is, it is. <br /> <br /> And, of course, you smoke, like someone who did not smoke before, but you smoke, like cool stuff, you know. And you're different. It is understandable. <br /> <br /> And of course you can fight? you're a bully. A bully who finds time to study 10,000 books if he doesn't. And if he does not smoke or drink beer because he follows a strict health plan. Minnie driver. Well, I don't even comment on Matt Damon. Team America has hit the nail on its head already. <br /> <br /> This film is a dream of a pupil of the Beavis & Butthead type (in other words, 95% of them): "Yes, that's what I would like if I were a genius." But stupid people and foolish authors are unable to imagine the life of geniuses.
