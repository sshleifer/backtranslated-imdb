This movie is one of the worst B-films I've ever seen. There are no plots. Although the actor is decent, the story is terrible. The film also has a lot of mistakes and it was a cumbersome look. Everyone who loves horror movies, movies or even B-movies doesn't recommend it to anyone at all. Most of the film focuses on meaningless killing in a way that is not even worth it. This movie can be very well compared to Jeepers Creepers' dirty transformations, which was also not such a big movie. For anyone who wants to spend the day at home watching badly made movies, it takes a cake.
