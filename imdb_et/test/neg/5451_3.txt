I wish it was "The Last Stupid Thriller". But thrillers are such. They are like children: numerous, illogical and often annoying. They want so desperately to take it seriously, but what's there to seriously take a child's behavior or thriller plot? Having seen this particular child - I think ... thriller - I understand why reviewers refer to it as a "hockcock thriller"; they could also call it "idiotic" because that is what "hitchcockian" means in the movie dictionary (see if you don't believe me). Even the soundtrack is the old school of Hollywood, which is a mistake: it doesn't fit into the film of the late 70s and makes it dark. Besides, how brave do they steal the idea of ​​De Palma to steal Hitchcock? The story is absurd. Scheider's wife is killed and her killers are never a problem. Instead, her former employers follow her again and later decided to kill her. Why do they decide to kill him? There is no explanation. Perhaps because the FBI is a dark, dark organization ("X-Files") that is very happy about knocking it on for former employees' pension insurance reasons. Or perhaps because it's fashionable if you want to kill Scheider in this movie; everything seems to be after him. And while the poor unsuspecting viewer tries to conceive a mystery logically, assuming there is a great conspiracy, there is actually a killer ... Janet Margolin! Yes, a woman living in Scheider's dwellings; that briefly suggests he was "depraved". Why does she go after Scheider at the time her wife was killed and she knows paranoid - followed by her former employers - and not a few years earlier or a few years after the murder of a woman? Pure hitchcockian (look for it again in the dictionary if you forget what it means) is a coincidence. And how about this great motif ...! Her grandmother was forced to prostitute when she was a 15-year-old 15-year-old virgin off-the-boat in New York, and then a bunch of horny Jewish men, one of them - Tah-dah! - Is Scheider's grandfather. As a result, Margolin has been playing a whore (among other things) to kill all the descendants of those men who were so brutally slamming their indifferent grandmother. How is hitchcockian (look it up)? Finale then ruthlessly kidnaps Mount Rushmore's "North By Northwest" scene, except that love-interest is a killer and he doesn't save. <br /> <br /> The film also offers some doubts / excitement dialogs and some non-so big actions. Get to know the fool and the obvious Napier follows Scheider in the cemetery. Let us not forget the Napier moral plot device, which reaches his jacket and holds his hand very suspiciously - but it was not a gun! How brilliant! Napier Tower: Now there is another illogical behavioral pattern. J. Demme was, and always is, a director without style, and without a man who drove "Philadelphia". Give her another Oscar!
