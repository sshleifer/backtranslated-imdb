Unbelievable. Great cast, fair operation, interesting plot. <br /> <br /> But this movie has graphic cruelty that is neither tense nor thrilling, but pure distraction and jealousy. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> Everyone can see that the freak returns to their habits. And that Robert Englund acted (was he?) Like an idiot; forbidding your daughter to sleep with a football player but he is trying to kill the idiot and I like kiddypr0n? <br /> <br /> Police who was kidnapped by a daughter - anyone felt she was a cop and not an actor? Not me. This movie pulls on and ends with what we see in other horror films: if the returns were decent, part 2 could be done. Bad, really bad stuff. Can give some inspiration ...
