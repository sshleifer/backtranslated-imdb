Like Final Fantasy, if you look at the strokes - it doesn't seem so bad. But when people move, it's terrible. Uneven nervous movements, scary emotion and lack of a sense of life on the face make me slip. The characters don't even look ALIVE / organic. <br /> <br /> I saw a preview of my daughter who was really tall! He wasn't busy at all. For advertising, I thought that both Pixar-esque films and many "bad" 2D films like Sinbad are easy to use. <br /> <br /> Lighting is painful, giving the kids a look by warning the flashlight at the edge of the fireplace. Lips synchronization is bad - worse than Final Fantasy. <br /> <br /> I have been seriously asking if Hanks is playing five characters .... this was the big attention of the whole movie. The role of the conductor is terrible - although I just can't understand exactly. This reminds me of the voice of my father's fake phone in welcoming customers. <br /> <br /> I think this is the reason why many roles are disturbing - you are aware that the voice is the same but clearly different. It gives ACTED hours to each character, not real human characters. The illusion of reality is interrupted by Hank's multiple role play. I've seen technique work - la Eddie Murphy, but Hanks can't be pulled out with the voice alone, considering the scary animation. <br /> <br /> I don't waste my money on it - wait for the rental.
