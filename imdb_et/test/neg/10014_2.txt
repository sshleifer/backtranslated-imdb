At the bottom of the Apocalypse movie, this piece is a little bit called "The Final Executioner." At least from where I come. The former policeman has been trained to seek revenge for those who killed his wife and friends in the cold blood ... and that's it. There are many fake explosions and recurring fires. There is one of the strangest costumes I've seen in the film for a while, and a massive fort, apparently run by just 7 people. Very good job duplication too boys (!) The best moment: if our hero loses a sword fight and starts to neck, he just gets his gun and BANG! Why not do it before? It's a mystery. Therefore, someone would first like to sit through it. I'm still amazing in that sense. 2/10
