Other reviews have told us how honest this film is, especially at the forefront of men. Well, those who have seen Grande Ecole with their often naked actors and expect something similar is a big disappointment. In a dressing room for a few seconds in a judo team, the two sides run for 15 seconds next to the shower. The female stove has relatively short front moments. Many of the marketing of this film is aimed at the gay men's audience, but those who are even waiting for a homoerotic hint between the two male leaders (the best friends who have a three-way girlfriend with one party) are most disappointed. There is not even a clue as to whether anybody is interested in another or even a little aware that the other is part of the threat of a trois. Douches Froides is not interested in the film; The viewer understands very little about who these three young people are, how they feel why they behave like they do. About one hour from the original paragraph was deleted; Perhaps it seems that the finished film seems depressed. Put on Grande Ecole, a French film that delivers more than your promises.
