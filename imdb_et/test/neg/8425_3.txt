After reading so many glowing reports to serve them all my days, I went out and bought it for Christmas. Waste of money, I'm afraid. I was expecting something in the same league as "Brideshead Revisited" and a few other big British television productions, but that's not necessarily the case. <br /> <br /> The characters are too good to be true, they are intended for a very predictable plot and the most tricky and outstanding script I've heard for years. Yes, it has its moments, but they are very thin on the spot. The main actor is interesting, mainly because he is very dark, similar to Anthony Andrews (Sebastian 'Brideshead'). But his undeniable talents are wasted on a character who is unlikely to be confident and priggish. His affection is due to his experience during Somme during WW1. He makes early episodes focusing on his nervous system, better than he later plays a ridiculous clean socialist. <br /> <br /> Women are absolutely incredible, like un-realis. Her first wife is a tedious hacker and a passionate girlfriend, a perfect complicated bitch and the last lady who is a political bosh. The most interesting characters are Howarth (Alan MacNaughton) and one of the other masters, called Hobarth, I forget the name of the actor. <br /> <br /> The high-level preaching of the script is typical of Andrew Davies, a screenwriter, in the early years and becomes tiring of the first two episodes (this mini-series is 11 episodes long!). By episode 4, I just wanted to break the broken thing. <br /> <br /> Music is equally annoying, mainly limited to one mawkish piano music and the boys sung by the boys during the credit. Location settings do not save costs that would otherwise provide an amazing viewing experience for some visual relief. <br /> <br /> As a rule, I like such stories and I am very disappointed by the maudlin nature of this series. If you want to look at WW1 for ripping and its aftermath, there are many other better vehicles for renting or buying. One that comes to mind is the 'Unknown Soldier' ​​since 1998. The characters in the Masterpiece Theater presentation are real and exciting and moving, unlike the 2-dimensional dolls, "Serving All My Days". With regard to boys' school movies, leave "Goodbye to Mr. Chips" or "Tom Brown School Days". <br /> <br /> I know this contradicts the overall favorable position of this mini-series, but I suggest you think twice before doubling $ 80.00 for Acorn Media for these four DVD sets, of which 2 on my device were insurmountable problems with freezing and skipping.
