This film worked with some of the most visible stories and lower characters. The writer probably bought a playbook "How to write a space disaster movie" and followed it while playing. In particular, the stereotypical use of astronauts with their loved ones from space to space has been repeatedly made - a bold exhibition of disaster. <br /> <br /> Max Q seems to have been written in the hope that manufacturers will throw $ 50 million into the project. But on the last side of the movie, which contained several special effects of flat-screening, the producers decided only $ 50 thousand. To find out that the film has been nominated for "special visual effects", Emmy is completely gob-smacked to me. <br /> <br /> I think that a handful of high school students who went through media studies could have had more credible effects! <br /> <br /> And the plot holes are too much to mention. But I choose one as an example. Now, I'm not a NASA expert, but it is very unlikely that an employee with a shuttle simulator will hold the position of power in the control room unexpectedly when things start to taste with the program. Certainly, the mission control will have more experience that the program director would call at the age of twenty-nine who were not in the control room before. <br /> <br /> The only sustainable arm for this movie is Bill Campbell's work. He can do a good test of the wreck of the train, which is the script. <br /> <br /> I give this movie in 2 out of 10, while Bill Campbell's job is above average to record it from the bottom mark.
