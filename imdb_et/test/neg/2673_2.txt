This movie is very bad. In fact, the only reason I have given it, not 1, because it made me laugh. Without giving anything away, the man's head will explode in this film. It was so pathetic, I laughed. I don't think the scene was supposed to be funny, but it's pointless. Complete nonsense. The original Halloween is such a good movie, it is a shame that they had to go and make such a stink.
