The legendary Arizal action film, Abysmal, in Indonesia, is played by the future Cinemax Priest, such as the Chinese O'Brien and the Do or Die, along with Erik Estrada, at the same time burying the bad-hitting star Pat O'Brien's hackneyed backyard and three cans. The hairy gel with its impressive 1984. This man's physical ability resembles Mark Mark Gregory and his next credit would be another violin for Chris Mitchum as "Tom Selick". Powerful. At least this activity is pointless and non-stop when some bold Asian stuntmen threaten their lives for the fact that the concept of reality created by teenagers and / or meth addicts is essentially poorly constructed. One poor extra can be broken by an electric hedge trimmer and many others are killed when odd items like a motorcycle wheel or cardboard box hit. Classical rape scenes are a tasteless and invaluable dialogue, such as: "I rather trust rattlesnake!" the third and third parts of the polisiotesch are delivered by such greatness and passion. Random Highlighting: Some crazy guys are eating lizards. The film also has a record of most cars that have passed through walls. 2/10
