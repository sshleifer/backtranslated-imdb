There are films that are so bad they are good. Then there are films like Rest Stop, which should never be done because they are just terrible. <br /> <br /> Bad behavior, unlikely characters, a predictable plot, and supposedly supernatural twist that doesn't give anything, are all failures. Some of the decent special effects are the only thing worth noting. <br /> <br /> I can't even write myself as a chart sketch because everything I really want to do here will warn you that you won't waste your time and money on this film. Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this movie at all. It's 1.5 hours of your life that you never get back. <br /> <br /> 1/10
