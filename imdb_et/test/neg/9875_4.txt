When HULK hit the theater in 2003, it wasn't long before the old Incredible Hulk TV show DVD was trying to get into the fraud. We saw a similar event one year ago when the DVD featured Spider-Man cartoons that coincided with the hero's big-screen debut. Businesses are jumping into the opportunity to drive in hot brand finance. <br /> <br /> So the fact that this picture has never been on Wal-Mart's shelves as highlighted heroes, donated a 2005 box to say a lot. I think all those involved just forget. To be fair, FANTASTIC FOUR is not as bad as everyone says. Let me reformulate it. It is not as unhealthy as all of its negative assessments may suggest. <br /> <br /> Veteran television actress Alex Hyde-White (no, you don't remember any of his roles) leads the way like Reed Richards, a brilliant scientist who, together with his team, achieves odd abilities after a space break. She has been left with the ability to stretch and stiffen her body with outrageous length. His future wife, Sue Storm (Rebecca Staab), may suddenly become invisible, while her brother Johnny (Jay Underwood) may now deliberately ignite. Then Ben Grimm (Michael Bailey Smith), a lovable leg, whose body breaks the thick orange stone mass, is bad. <br /> <br /> Just as their friends are used to it, they are invited to save the world from some chaos. It seems that Reed's old colleague Victor von Doom (Joseph Culp) lives by his name and this whimsical jeweler (Ian Trigger) does not help the old women to cross the street. Will our heroes save the day? Of course they will; Like any superhero movie, it's just a matter of how and when. <br /> <br /> FANTASTIC FOUR is amazing when the amateur is in almost every aspect. The dialogue is so flat and tired that it seems to have been written by younger high drama classes. It is so polished that it makes the tertiary opera of the tertiary afternoon into Shakespeare. The special effects are surprisingly good considering the small budget, but there are still some moments of embarrassment. When the Human Torch is fully lit by his body, the whole film becomes a comic short. I hear this production pack. "Oh, nobody notices. They're too interesting!" I really mean comics? Give me at least a fire dummy pulled by a string! Before that, the scene where quadruples come to earth after their cosmic crashes is a clean teenage backyard price. The crew just found out and burned a vague object like a spacecraft. Is this the only residue of such a major accident? <br /> <br /> Of course, the script did not do much work. Here's a fairly common story, but it's all that simple. When Reed and Ben decide to go into space, they simply fall to the storm house and ask if they care about joining them. Is it really that easy? Don't you need these things, oh, I don't know how many years of training and knowledge? Not in the world of those writers who seemed to be inspired by the underestimated genius of the FULL HOUSE. However, as bad as it may be, nothing can be compared if Dr Doom is painfully clique. He was pulled straight from these terrible superhero cartoons from the 1960s until the evil laugh and slamming on his tight fist table to refine his remarks. No comic book, at least all Fantastic Four, has never been so uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, FANTASTIC FOUR is rescued as a complete turkey because it's just so fucking innocent. You can talk to the people involved about as little talent or experience as they were, really trying. They didn't know that the end result would be so embarrassing. They had the impression that it was their big break that people flocked to theaters. It repeats that they had virtually no money to work with (and I'm sure half of this is a nice Thing costume). All the things they did were fine, and for many of its shortcomings, the end product is a fair fun for comic book fans.
