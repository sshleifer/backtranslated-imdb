I checked it in the library for free and I still feel. Yes, Sandra Bullock is actually in this, but only in five scenes that barely reach 5 minutes, and even they are quite painful to watch. The rest of the movie is so bad that you spend most of the time hoping it will end soon, but only if you are one of those people who have to start the movie when they start. All others just turn it off. Don't worry, you won't miss anything. Bullock's lines (assuming you have seen it because its name is pricked) are basically just parroting other characters, like this dialog: <br /> <br /> Lisa (Bullock) - "Danny, please tell me what's going on . "<br /> <br /> Danny -" I don't know. "<br /> <br /> Lisa -" Whaddaya means you don't know? " <br /> <br /> Danny - "I don't know - it's something to do with my dad." <br /> <br /> Lisa - "Whaddaya means your father?" <br /> <br /> Danny - "I don't know he's **** or something else." <br /> <br /> Lisa - "Why am I here?" <br /> <br /> Danny - "I'm sorry Lisa. I don't know." <br /> <br /> (moments later) Danny - "My father's military mates." <br /> <br /> Lisa - "Whaddaya means army friends?" <br /> <br /> See what I mean? <br /> <br /> The bottom line - just say no.
