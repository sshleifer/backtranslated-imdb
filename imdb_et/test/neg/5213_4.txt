This is a marvelous attempt for the first time by filmmaker Ham Tran, offering a low-glance perspective of Vietnamese war victims fighting for liberation, but with special respect. With an enormous, self-conscious informative dialogue and sub-parameter, even a relatively impressive budget does not tend to pay attention to details, though historically worth the melodrama. Bearing in mind that participants often interfere with the reality of on-screen situations, and you should leave informative education somewhat personal in post-war post-Vietnam history.
