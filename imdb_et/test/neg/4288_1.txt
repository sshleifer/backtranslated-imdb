A terrible psychological thriller that is almost painful to sit on, all aspects are terrible. <br /> <br /> The combined talents of Top-Actors Kevin Bacon and Gary Oldman are completely wasted and, although they perform well, they don't know why they bother. Mark Kasden's script is a complete confusion, and Martin Campbell has a pop-up story all over the place, but if you can't follow it, bless it. There are too many pointless, crazy scenes that just aren't sensible. Jerry Goldsmith's music is not a lot of help either. <br /> <br /> Even though the plot had potential, director Campbell's approach has completely destroyed it. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Monday, February 26, 1996 - Video
