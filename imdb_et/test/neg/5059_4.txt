Mr. Moto Gamble has a fairly straightforward graph - when a mysterious poison ring is murdered by a boxer, it is even more mysterious for Mr Moto to solve. <br /> <br /> shocked by a number of positive comments on Mr Moto Gamble on IMDb. Because for me ... I found this very disappointing. I like Mr. Moto and I like Charlie Chan, but I can't say I cared for the two mish-mashes. For those who don't know the story of Moto Gamble, it was originally meant for Charlie Chan's movie. But when Warner Holland brought it back, some scenes and activities were rewritten for Peter Lorre and Mr. Moto. As I noted, the end result was bad for me. Mr. Moto is not Chan. He's more mysterious, he's more sporty and more exotic. So when trying to put Moto Chani into the movie, it's like trying to fit a square pin into a round hole - it doesn't work. Listening to Lorre / Moto is trying to offer one of Chani's brand euphemism, which just ends with stupidity. In addition, almost 10 minutes of short 72-minute running times, boxing scenes (something I never know) and finally you get a movie that I couldn't but disliked. When I have to say something positive, I refer to Keye Luke's performance. But even if he is not close enough to save Mr. Moto Gamble in my eyes. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but 4/10 is about the best I can give.
