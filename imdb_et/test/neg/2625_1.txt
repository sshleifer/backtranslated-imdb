I was forced to look at "Changi" last year in Australian history. Looking at the classroom, both classes were almost asleep at 40, all 40 heads at the table whispered to the person next to them. I refuse to believe that since I am only 16 years old, I do not think that I had learned the World War I not only felt embarrassed and ashamed of watching this Australian trash TV. I was in a terrible effort, in my opinion, the mini series that was used in the use of film elements. The operation was bad, the scenario was very inaccurate and the score was terrible. Please, don't look at this movie, it's biased and very racist (Japanese).
