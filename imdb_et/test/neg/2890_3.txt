I've been in a bad race on movies. It is a clinker about the firing plot and the psychopath. Tom Skerrit, whom I really enjoy, was pretty young here. He is a passionate builder, but he has a partner whose profit motive is over-insurance and burning. An agent who is drowned, his daughter and his nut-boy-boy will be in the mix. James Mason plays an insurance researcher. Any idiot, with little warning, would know that the Australian people have rebelled. But they worship their way. The most interesting thing was that the big hotel that was built never went beyond the clusters. A small budget, I think. The plot could have been interesting. Maybe they should have hired a movie editor (did they?). Half of the time you don't know where the characters are, but I guarantee that the five million dollar profitability would probably have made the structure watchful. It does not work. Although there is a lot of clean fire.
