"Child 2" was a complete waste of my time. The original film was not very good but classic compared to this film. The first film went beyond his scenes by a devil who destroyed the great devastation in the lives of all people. Here it goes even higher. And one scene in this movie proves this theory. This carnival ride was too much for me in the stomach. It's terrible. This movie shouldn't have been done. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (of four)
