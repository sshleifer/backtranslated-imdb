I'm sure I saw FUTURE KILL for the same reason as most people: HR Gigeri's awesome poster. And like everyone else, I was disappointed to find that the film couldn't respond to the poster (Giger said that director Moore asked him to do so). When I first saw it, I thought it was the worst film at the age of 14. I still think that if I haven't seen certain movies in MST3K. <br /> <br /> The plot has a number of annoying college boys traveling to a "mutant city" to rob a gang leader of their fraternity. Then they meet Splatter (Ed Neal), a mutant / cyber / psycho who kills the gang leader and blames it on the frats as an excuse to hunt and seize power. The remainder of the film consists of traces. Hand-filled frats are trying to fight their way out of a mutant city (which I think should be LA, although it was made from Texas). There are some pseudo-political things that tell us that frat-boys' society is nuclear and that mutant society is anti-nuke. They talk about how Splatter got the freak caused by radiation. Most people cause cancer, but splashes just nail and kill girls. Yes, it makes a lot of sense. At one point, our heroes save a mutant girl from two pro-nuke police, and she shows them "how the other half lives." The other half, it turns out, is all punk kids dancing with the bad 80's pop band. So our little epic is so stupid and dated. It's really all that it has. Frat boys running around confused buildings, while men who look like cyclists try to kill them ... Oh, and that's the future. <br /> <br /> I don't think you have any doubts about why Ron W. Moore never made another movie. This thing is a real shaker. If you like Giger, buy his books (they have a poster without a movie horror) or just look at ALIEN again. FUTURE KILL is a waste of time that no one needs. <br /> <br /> If this description makes the picture sound, there is another dirty movie that does the same, just bigger and better. It's a mess, but it beats off the screen.
