This line is a good summary of this movie. After reading it and watching the film for 20 minutes, you know exactly how the rest of the movie works. Some researchers named Surgei (pronounced SirGay) are looking for the underworld of hell in Moscow. However, he seems to have disappeared and his friend Oven follows the team to look for him. Would they have found a more boring plot? Some bad actors who take care of the old man under the ground. Action is very bad, romance is really pointless and wrong, often there is no reason why characters are acting, nothing is scary and most important: nothing interesting, no movie at all. They just walk around, ask some gang leaders and other boys out of the way, walk more, complain, find an old man and then run and eventually find their way out. <br /> <br /> The only thing that gives me the lowest rating for giving this movie is the atmosphere. If you just want to see this movie, it can be a good choice. It's dark and it's mysterious and dim. But the rest of the movie is really boring. You just sit there all the time, waiting for the movie to start or something happen. It actually happens in some things, but they are not very well done. For example, I didn't notice when one of the characters disappeared and I swear I didn't sleep or anything. And I do not understand what is dangerous with these children ... They just run underground, scratching it with walled sticks (I think it is scary in some way). <br /> <br /> Just watch this movie if you have a direct need for some twilight environments.
