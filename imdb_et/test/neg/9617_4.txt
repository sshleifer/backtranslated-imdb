I don't waste your time describing this plot, the other reviewer did it quite well. However, I will give you an opinion on this film. This movie is basically a Japanese propogand. Japanese are depicted as incredibly evil b ** cards that do not respect anything, they also have very bad martial arts skills (Japanese men's groups get into single-womens by single women). Fighters lose almost every (if not every) fight in a movie that removes arrest. The plot is actually quite strong and suitable for kung fu film. The problem is that there is not much fighting. If there are struggles, some struggles are good, but the other scenes are poorly choreographed. One scene of angela stomach takes six Japanese to church and captures all of their asses. The problem is that they show him they are fighting one by one when they all have to attack at the same time. I collect this movie incredibly cheaply, considering how cheap some sets are. They use the same village when they are in Korea and when they are in China without changing it at all. Some scenes are shot in real places and they look good. In general, the only real problem in film is slow motion and an uninteresting plot. Since there are few scenes in the fight, we have to rely on the plot for entertainment, and well, I was not entertained. <br /> <br /> Fourteen stars out of four
