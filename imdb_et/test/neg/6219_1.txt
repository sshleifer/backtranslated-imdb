This movie is pathetic not because it is poorly directed, acted, sung, danced, filmed, etc. .... Because it is really difficult to destroy the movie with the ABBA soundtrack - unfortunately this is the only thing the film can do. The musical performance in SouthPark was much better than Mama Mias. Mama Mia's director is proof that you don't need talented directors - all you need is ABBA songs. <br /> <br /> Just to give a terrible sample: Aging Meryl Streep is photographed in close-up sunlight and just destroying the song in all the confusing wrinkles on her face. Why do one of the most talented actors out there?
