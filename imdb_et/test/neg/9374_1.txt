After some fairly OK Dutch activities like Lek and Van God Los, Gerrard Verhage wants to make a movie about Dutch mobster life. Well, mobster is a big word for Glass Bruinsma. He's not a real international big man like George Jung (Blow) or Pablo Escobar. He's just Amsterdam's weak life who made money selling soft drugs. Things are often blown in the Netherlands and this is just another example. But even then, the movie can be very nice if the story is well said. There are big jumps now: one day, the KLASAS is just a normal drug, the next picture seems to be a big player in the drug scene. No one knows how this is possible (except for those who read the book). Action is really bad, non-Dutch film viewers see one of the worst actors in the Netherlands: Chantal Janzen. If you think he's finally naked, you look at the model. So: bad operation + bad assembly + nonsense story = De Dominee. <br /> <br /> Please don't look at it even if others say it's good because it's not. I've warned you.
