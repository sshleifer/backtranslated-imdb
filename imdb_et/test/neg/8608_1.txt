So why would I see I see "Men living with potatoes"? Answer: Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook. I've seen Vegas lively and thoroughly enjoyed. I think he is an intelligent and unique intellectual comic who manages to maintain extreme oafishness. Crook I only know about the biggest comedy of the last ten years with "Alan Partridge", "Office". Like Gareth, he was just fun and I was interested in how he will be the second character on the big screen. <br /> <br /> OK. So I and the boy went to a multiplex last night, and the movie was very funny just because the talent of Vegas and Crook gave us a surprise and enthusiasm for the mediocre dialogue and cheat on Ferris and Dave. They are for better things (they have already done better) and I even believe that Vegas is a good straight actor. The tiny scenes where he says he can't get his wife out were almost intact, though ** SPOILER **, which created the scene at the end of his wife's return, had to be extended, it was simply unreliable. And throughout the film, Vegas seems to miss her wife's 2 or 3 times. <br /> <br /> The film became grotesque unforgettable and ordinary, well, grotesque, as mentioned in sex. Do not add when it was displayed on the screen. Tolly's unreasonable explanation of what was on his sandwiches and why it wasn't a little funny, and just made me a little bad. It was also completely inaccurate to wear the character of Jeremiah's nose before showing his boge with his finger. It was his choice of nose that would have raised the smile, he was a pathetic character and he would have made it as low as possible, but closing the snouts was simply not necessary and ranked. <br /> <br /> One scene I thought was sexy sexy, which was in Vegas in three. His dirty conversation with another brother just stressed that the trio is always endless ecstasy. Not that I know ..... <br /> <br /> That's all I can really say. I finish with this and it is actually the main criticism of my film. It should revive the British film industry. This is definitely not "Trainspotting", which is certain .... it's not even "love really" (you have to be the heart of the stone not to throw it away) and the 3 million pounds really could be in a better project. "Mike Basset England Manager" was a wonderful, little-known British comedy made in much less than 3 million. I only hope that BFC will study "The Sexual Life of Potato Men" and will not be so free in the future. Although the terrible reviews that this film collects, they only improve post office techniques. :-)
