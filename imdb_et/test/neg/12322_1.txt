Well previews seemed funny and I usually don't go to the movies opening night especially for my kids because ...... well you never know. Here's a movie that won't let children or adults, because the jokes are too perverted for the kids and for adults for the fun of entertainment. I was really embarrassed at my 9-year-old and 6-year-olds and had to explain to my 6-year-old S H * T weather. Essentially, what's going on here is Dr. It adds an evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry her mother for the money. If it were a sub-block, maybe it would have been good, but it reaches the big plot around the film, and the "cat" plays more as a subplay when it comes to exposing a neighbor to her mother, who she really is. Take advice and read the book and share the movie.
