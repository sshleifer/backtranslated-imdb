Like flying and war movies, it's under my list. It is historically completely inaccurate and casting sounds and deeds as they just stepped out of high school. Functioning, scripts, directions, production standards and casting are all garbage. The only sustainable grace is some flying sequences. If the people they represent were fictional, then I can rate it 2, but if there is one thing that disturbs me more than anything in the movies, then it is pretended to be history and that the big people they try to be are actually did it! It is almost as if they were trying to write as many prominent WW1 personalities as possible. There are lots of good WW1 movies and this is not one of them.
