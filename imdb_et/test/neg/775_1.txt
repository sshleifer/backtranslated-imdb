This is undoubtedly the worst film I've ever seen. It is so bad that I intend to rent it as soon as I find it. This movie makes 'Plan 9 From Space Space' like an Oscar competitor. Just LOOKING at the actors makes me want to laugh out loud. I can't say anything bad about this movie. It is a terrible thing that repels perfection. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on a terrorist attack with a nuclear weapon in San Francisco. It's as far as me ... I laugh too hard. I know it shouldn't be funny, but ..... * LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL <br /> <br /> MOVE OVER ED WOOD !!! <br /> <br />
