I don't understand how this garbage got to the shelf of a movie store, not even a real movie! It was incredible, I and a group of friends decided to watch it one night, and it was just the stupid thing one of us ever saw, I couldn't believe it! We looked amazingly in the first 15 minutes that someone actually thought about it and then the movie. Are they cracked? I think yes, in high doses. I doubt very much that someone could like this trash. Should it be a science fiction or comedy? I don't know the idiots who even take care of it, but decided to make a movie about something and see how many suckers they could watch. Well, we put something on the film so we take it to the store and see if they put it on the shelf - no, no, no. It's not making a movie. Action is like moving the dolls of disability and reading from the book, it's so bad. I feel like I go to the movie shop and complain and get my money back, no one should stick to this mess. So I'm here to warn you - DON'T CASA THIS GAME, this is the most stupid thing you've never seen!
