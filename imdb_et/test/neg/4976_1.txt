Unforgiven is Clint Eastwood's last tribute once to the great west. But even though I thought it was going to be good and would come to the future western countries, I was unfortunately wrong. Unforgiven, though a simple plot it falls on flat characters and emotions and I certainly say that Unforgiven is Eastwoods worst film so far. Eastwoods itself seems to be too old to play the role of operation and control, which also adds to the overall appearance of the film. <br /> <br /> All the characters look and cut around the edges, especially the character of Eastwoods. The actor does not seem to flow and contribute to what the characters know. The direction is mistakenly confused. So the general Unforgiven is not the best in Eastwood and one of the worst in the West.
