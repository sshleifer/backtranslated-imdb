Most critics have devastated this Michalkov movie, but I wanted to see it myself. And unfortunately they are right. The film was the biggest budget ever in Russian film history, two international stars, colorful mass scenes, probably coming close to the Kremlin, but eventually it seems nice, sweet. You would not believe that this director has previously made masterpieces such as Urga and Burnt Sun. Style characters are not convincing, neither Jane nor McCracken nor Andrei. Only General Radlov is worth mentioning. It remains on the surface all the time. Politically, I have respect for the army, and especially for Russia, with values ​​such as honor and justice. And having lived in Siberia for at least half a year: My Russia is much more than what is depicted in Michalkov's film. For the same director's "Burned Sun", a one-time-10-point film that is one of the best I've ever seen in my life, I was completely disappointed. Sorry. Nevertheless, Michalkov's unique talent is still present in amazingly beautiful images.
