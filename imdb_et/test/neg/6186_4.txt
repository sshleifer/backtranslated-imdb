Coltrane and Idle are members of the bank's predatory gang who doubling their leader during the robbery. They hide the nursery school and hide themselves appropriately to avoid mob and police detection. Lots of Catholic humor and strokes, but the script is thin enough as laughs .. There is a good shower scene, though ... on a scale of 1-10.
