I think vampire movies (usually) are bad. Even if the film itself is not so good, I still like the existence of this vampire. But it smells. This really gives the vampire a bad name for the movie. <br /> <br /> Getting started is really a bargain. I'm not usually about barely low budget movies - one of my favorite musicians is El Mariachi, who only costs $ 7,000 - but I hate it. Activities will also cram you with a "stylish" wobbling camera that will give you headaches. I bought it for 1.50 pounds because it was an ex-rent and I feel like I was cheating on my money, even for that low price.
