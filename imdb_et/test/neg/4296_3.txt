I took the opportunity to see if a really good WWI movie had slipped my message - that's not the case. John Phillip Law and Don Stroud are both rigid and insecure in their duties. Dialogue is stupid or non-existent; flying sequences are okay but quite repetitive. Compared to the dreadful "Blue Max", this movie would never be needed. Check out George Peppard, James Mason, and Usulat Andress in BM and you will understand why this movie is one of the best war films ever made and it is not. Recently released DVD Richtofen and Brown have presented some great "lost classic" since the 70's, I resell my day after I bought it. Don't waste your time or $.
