Frankly, the people who gave this film ten would give 100 cellulose to fiction. This is the level we deal with here. <br /> <br /> The film is not bad, but it's not like "OMG, the best movie after Pulp Fiction!". Some people have incredibly low expectations for films, even indie varieties. Personally, I found my interest in a movie that dropped after a half hour mark. There is logic and faith in the plot. You must hear some of the reasons why a woman did what she did to save her husband. Yeah, of course. I guarantee that you would know about the theater, "hmm, now that doesn't make sense." This is one movie where you really have to stop all the logic and beliefs. <br /> <br /> Those who said the music score was good, probably listened to their MP3 players. It killed the movie in some cases completely. <br /> <br /> All in all, watch the movie only if you don't have any particular importance. I'll give it to three because the motel is a decent person.
