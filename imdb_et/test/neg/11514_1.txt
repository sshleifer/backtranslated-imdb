This movie is about three stories that are put together around about three separate people. One of the worst movies available and even better than it is not available. <br /> <br /> Good: 2 beautiful lesbian actress 1 real and touching story about Theresa Chan <br /> <br /> Bad: The main story that revolves around the dark and dear woman, Theresa Chan doesn't have to be in film format and document talk about it. The three stories are not related. Minimal DIALOG in a movie replaced with SMS and CHAT programs on a PC. The film lacks cultural understanding and makes you forget even before the cinema goes out.
