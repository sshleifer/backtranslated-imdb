This film is much like the Cannibal Holocaust. If this were not the killing of the animals needed for the "shock" ("Oh, look at us, we're hardcore, we've added a real death to our movies"), these films will shake my dust on the classic - I'm a big fan of cannibal films and zombies. But as it is, this is another example of a shock horror that struggled on the pile of the last shoulder in a desperate struggle to make a bad film more leap. In conclusion, the harsh gore flick is limited to a complaint. A 70's gore fan should try it, but anyone with a modern ethics and taste should write something a little better for their popcorn festivals.
