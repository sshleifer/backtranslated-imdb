I was with this terrible pretext for a TV movie. I only looked at it because I have no cable and my only other choice was Golf, college basketball or local news. The plot is very common and has no substance what I saw, not to mention that I had a big mistake in my eyes. The main character, Dr. Sorensen, is a washed astronomer who believes that the asteroid called "Nemesis" strikes Earth, causing life. He relies on his convictions that he has discovered cobalt paintings by Aboriginal people (I'm sure I wrote this one wrong). Paintings have an obvious timeline that shows important events throughout history, such as building a Great Wall of China. All events are shown in a perfect chronological order and the last picture on the timeline is the destruction of the Earth. Now that the painting showed things that really happened, why should a big doctor believe he could somehow change what's going on? All of this left off, moving the film with extreme precision. There was nothing in the film that surprised me at all. The actors were not very good and sometimes I felt that they didn't even take the film seriously to try to convince me that the characters were caring. The whole movie was a clich√© and a waste of time and money. I would recommend Armageddon over this day's mess. At least Armageddon has some good deeds (as opposed to this), not to mention an eye film that is Liv Tyler. Now that I mean, Golf is not so bad .......
