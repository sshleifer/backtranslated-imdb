Just as the title suggests, it's not a very good movie I was hoping for. I thought it would be great if Mr. completely Monty man himself, but not tragically. From the very beginning, I literally lost as soon as 2 women were just doing their way, and then suddenly pointing out that there is accidental water under the door, then put across the house, where it's hard to believe they didn't. t notice the rising water level outside or at least hear it. Sorry it sounds like a bead, but it really grinds my move and has affected me. The poorest people were most active and the story tried to copy almost every clich√© to every catastrophe, but just failed in that sense. CGI was poor that I got a better job with MS painting, directing the poor, and finally I didn't care about 1 character !!! Don't waste your time people don't know that it appeared directly on DVD.
