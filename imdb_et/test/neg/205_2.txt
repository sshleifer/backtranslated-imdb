With a bad movie, the premise was there, the actors were all there. And yet the incredible plot, good dialogue, the characters that were involved were somewhat missing. <br /> <br /> A typical of them went from a false premise to the background where the system is eternal. The tye tag and his little brother have not been happy and their house goes back, together with the crusader Matt Dillon (who doesn't feel much older than Tye, so it is not sure how it happened) to steal money for the armored bath to rescue they work as guards. Tyel has a short conscience, but decides to go with it. And so a really terrible hole starts with a 30-minute incredible trash. I don't list all the ways this film was unrealistic, but let me point out to the larger ones: <br /> <br /> As Tye decided to be a good man because a homeless boy became a collateral, all his close friends, including his godfather. His godfather, who is said to be a family, and a man who brought him to the caper for the last minute to help him because of his death due to Tye. Tye destroys her friends and the godfather destroys all the money. The money came from the same bank who took the house back. But he chose this for Matt Dillon's supposed family. <br /> <br /> There's a lot more to say, this movie was a staircase and I hope no one else can see it.
