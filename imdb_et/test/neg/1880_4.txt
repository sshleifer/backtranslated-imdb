In addition to DA (James Eckhouse) and short women who are convincingly sympathetic to the situation of Ellen Gulden (Renee Zellweger), Ellen is the only persuasive character and the pleasant character of the film. He is one, not his deadly mother who should be and is - one real thing. it is not only in the role, the behavior of Zellweger, but also in the plot itselfâ€¦. . The daughter perceives what the viewer perceives, but such intelligent imaginations have to give way to her husband's low sentiment, which has been lifted by both his wife and daughter in reality. <br /> <br /> In order to recover, one of the most powerful scenes of this movie, when Ellen stands in front of her father's cruelty, is at the wrong end. Ellen is just another young strong woman who has to answer the girl. A very bad movie - so bad that it's called a cage and not worth the time.
