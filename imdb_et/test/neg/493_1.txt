This is a film based somewhat on Rob Halford's dropping out of the British Metal Gods' Judas Priest and how the band replaced him with Ripper Owens, who used the Priest's Prize Draw. Originally titled "Metal God", this movie could have been great. Instead, someone who somewhere in the office who doesn't know anything about metamorphosis decided to spend it. Changing the title of the metal to a "safe" way toward the "Rock Star" that this flat sound track of this movie plays badly. Having spent most of my life in a professional metal band, I was really expecting it, I had a lot of points on the film. The soundtrack is not metal for one and the end of the film is also flat. The film has some bright spots when it comes to writing and acting, but it does not succeed as a whole ... 1) The film based on the metal band must have a metal strip. 2) There is no metal around Marky Mark or Jennifer Anistan. If Bon Jovi, Warrant, Def Leppard and Poison are your idea of ​​"heavy metal", watch this movie. When Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Dio & Black Sabbath is your idea of ​​metal, look at this movie to laugh.
