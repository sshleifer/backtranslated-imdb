"The Shining" is a visual, visual and iconic representation of Jackic Nicholson. But "Ausentes" has none of these things; although it borrows from its classic predecessor; a clergyman, a man who gets hacked through the door and a woman who runs around when he entices a huge kitchen knife. Unlike Stanley Kubrick's great psychological horror film, "Ausentes" is a work that resonates with genius singing. It's great, comic terrible; it changes the Spice Girls movie as a vital artwork. "Ausentes" is a story about a family that moves to the gateway to a suburb. Everything must be well with the world. They live in peace and peace; they are peacefully moving away from their business on the old city streets. But not. The character of Ariadna Gill, Julia, is going to get those things that demand that empty supermarkets and doors close at night will collide; and her husband, Samuel, played by Jordi Molla, switches back from the master, who is wildly instantly uninterrupted nutter, injecting Julia with the drug to keep him from his sudden kosh. The mole that is honored as an actor is absolutely terrible in this respect. Comic, not threatening, he can't just draw a threatening expression. She has just come across as a barroom slime ball with one to drink too much. Is this movie something to redeem? The script is dirty, the plot is non-existent and cast without merit. At no-tension and frightening moments, "Ausentes" is an exercise not to do a psychological thriller. It's ridiculous and overcrowded, but one of the most unintentionally fun movies of recent years is worth looking at.
