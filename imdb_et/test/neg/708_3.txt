This movie was hard for me to watch. Stan seemed very old and bad when I remembered it, and Ollie was harder than I ever remembered in another movie. But the most difficult was the script / production gaps where I found myself wondering: "How did they get there?" Before I could duplicate non-American actors, it took almost half of the movie - it was also annoying. <br /> <br /> While I miss the big players like Laurel and Hardy, are there big actors like the old studio era? - This film helps me to understand why participants sometimes worship in their core.
