Friend and I went to watch this movie in 1980. He played in a huge theater and we were the only two people in this place. It lasted two days in the theater before they show it. It was so bad that we laughed all over. Since then, we have been evaluating films based on Kill or Be Killed as the worst ever. Like other reviewers, it's so bad that it's funny. It's not sure it's the second look. I just can't give myself more than 1 because I don't think the filmmakers are so bad and I can't give credit for the accident. Sorry.
