I hope it was done before Half Past Dead and Exit Wounds, because it was a garbage, Seagal was not guilty because it was just a fucking control when some action took place. The plot was also confusing and basically just hurried, maybe it was put on the shelf and released for Seagals newer movies ?? <br /> <br /> 3/10 <br /> <br /> He is not over yet, bring down Siege 3 and lose some weight!
