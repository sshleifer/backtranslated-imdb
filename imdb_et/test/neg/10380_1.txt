Although this film had some frightening moments (great use of music and film factors to build a break), it is not obvious that director Ethan Wiley and screenwriter Ellary Eddy will not waste time exploring their content; which also casts doubt on the claims that the scenes of exorcism were followed by a true Catholic bishop. <br /> <br /> Among several contradictions: <br /> <br /> Jacob The Roman Catholic priest, when we meet him outside the church for the first time, carries academic clothing rather than a typical album, butterfly or surplus. Academic clothes are usually carried by Protestant ministers in liturgical currency, not by Roman Catholic priests. <br /> <br /> Jacob's priest quotes some unclear and disturbing scriptures about picking up the weapons of angels. He attributes it to St. Paul. This verse is neither in the writings of St. Paul nor in the Bible. I can't even find it in the Gnostic scriptures. <br /> <br /> Jacob tells his bishop that he does not believe in demons and refuses to demand exorbism, but does a total of 180 (later on the same day?) with Isabella in possession of a few minutes after speaking. Of course, this is possible; but a little unreal. See Father Damien as the original THE EXORCIST priest / psychologist to portray a bit more realistic skeptical-revolutionary image of a believer. <br /> <br /> Former priest Miguel, who was a peasant, is the first to try Isabelle's exorcism. He cites the scriptures and quotes it. He says, "I see you Psalm 65" - he fixes it "it's Psalm 67" - they're both wrong. <br /> <br /> The former priest Miguel, who just did exorcism, making a cross sign, calling the name of Christ, applying sacred water, etc. - says Jacob he doesn't believe in the church and he doesn't believe in God. (Maybe he's just in conflict?) Jacob supports him to put on his own clothes and on his other hand. <br /> <br /> Former ROMAN COLLECTION The priest Miguel goes back (or in the Eastern Orthodox style). As a Spaniard Roman Catholic who used a priest, he should have overcome the forehead of his chest, to the left side of the right side of the chest. <br /> <br /> I had to read a little next to the stories to get the concept of Satan with the whole family, not just with Isabella; but even finally it was hard to say for sure whether someone was really guilty of the images in their heads, or if it was all a demonic trick (except for the sheriff - it is quite clear that he was guilty). <br /> <br On the positive side: Isabelle was CREEPY - I thought she was the best part of the film and I liked the twist of the plot with Claire. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if the movie was listening to running reviews with Cameron Daddo and Ethan Wiley, I tend to believe it was a joke.
