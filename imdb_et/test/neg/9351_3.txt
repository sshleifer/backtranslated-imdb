Long ago, from a distant, distant galaxy, water has become the most valuable commodity (it has become familiar) and a small minority controls its distribution (which is a surprise, just a heart attack, and die of this surprise). A group of ice pirates (renegades of water bodies? Wet bandits? ... oh wait for the latter to be used) try to find a route for a finite unlimited water supply with a cute but spoiled (Druish?) Princess. and a group of idiots that despise despicable rogues. <br /> <br /> This movie can be a really great comedy parody ("Star Wars," David Lynch's "Dune"), but was just not handled correctly. This is true, I believe the term is "low-eyed" humor. It's not really successful to be all that funny, which is disgraceful, because it is Angelica Houston, Ron Perlman and Robert Urich (hence three stars) who are not the perpetrators of the executive department. <br /> <br Certainly you are renting and definitely drinking.
