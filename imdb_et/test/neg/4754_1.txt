The main page review recognizes that the film is terrible, but that you should forgive it because it is nicely violent. No, you shouldn't. At the end of this review, there are spoilers, but how do I get the "spoiled" movie of this rat that I have no idea. Even if you're a hero of a hero Alien / Pred, as I am waiting for a DVD. It's not worth 3.99 rentals, but you have a much less tendency to really hate this movie if you pay more than $ 12 or better people plus concession purchases in the theater. <br /> <br /> Theater, which I watched at AVPr, so smiled as two when I was sitting next to me. Besides that there was complete silence. No ooohe or "it was a bad ass!" Imagine you are on the patient's desk and are given an anesthetic. Now you know what you know in theater after opening AVPr. <br /> <br /> What was the budget for this movie? Like World War II, MI 3 and other f / x movies, the director seems to be much more involved with what CGI people can bring out, except for the development of characters or plot. Spielberg has repeatedly tried it and failed, usually with Tom Cruise. Of course, movies make money, but should they? The World War and Minority Reports had a budget to pay for a decent script, Tom Cruise and others and the SS itself, but they were still awful. I am sure AVP will waste 90% of its budget on CG and had no choice but to hire any actor who would say yes, even though the election agent would have done better by going to the supermarket and randomly selecting participants. <br /> There is no tension in every scene, so we're never surprised. Who cares who is killed? We didn't know any of them, we all know what happens when lil aliens make their physical exits, we all know that blood is acid. Foreigners, aliens, 3, resurrection, and even AVP directors are able to hide and put the trap in the ability of foreigners to think. This director decided that Ridley Scott, James Cameron and others were idiots to develop the characters you really want to see either live or kill. In this contribution, you never care about who lives or dies, not a child, a parent, a pregnant woman. The characters in this movie only serve one purpose, die. Opening scenes confirm that the film is a predictable joke. Scripting scenes interfere with clich√©s, bad humor, and a bad actor, and look at the viewer so much that we don't really care if they die as long as they die before. But they are not. The director tried to do something about an alien's franchise before he was before, but he managed to throw away the first films, human factors and steal the rest of the latest sci-fi movies first. Alien or Pred characters were not originally used. Indeed, Pred has few problems with killing aliens by a dozen, although the latter film made us believe that Pred honored aliens as a deadly enemy that they used to kill one as a death Rite. AlienPred has never developed into a terrifying creature. Its ability to inject parasites into the host is hung from a variety of films, most recently Hellboy, where Samiel's broken tongue injected eggs into Hellboy or Doom, where mutated creatures left their tongues after sacrificing their throat. <br /> <br /> In simple terms, we have no reason to care for this movie. There is violence, but it is neither shocking nor surprising nor something that has not been observed in any one hundred butterflies. CG is OK and both aliens are trying to watch and move as they have in the past. But since the characters have never developed and the action is so bad, we hope they all die. A little girl was probably the best actor in the bunch, but unfortunately we don't care whether children, women, or anyone else lives or dies. We just want to end the movie. Finally, it won't do until Resident Evil 2 has another line of stolen plot that has a nucleus target for Gunnison's way to "infect". And not before another stupid scene, which should open the door for further succession, but is it? In a movie with bad scenes, the worst may be the last recorded. <br /> <br /> Sorry for repetition, but everyone is repeating: bad script, lack of plot, irregular scenes, undiscovered direction, debilitating behavior, decent f / x that was wasted due to many errors. <br /> <br /> I don't mind going to the indie movie and being disappointed. Actors and leaders, as well as the team, are likely to pursue their career and work on a slope budget. For a movie and a leap with such a budget, I felt frustrated by fraud. This movie is a painfully boring waste of time from the scene to the closing credit. Unfortunately, the Hellboy 2 preview was the best part of AVP and HB2 didn't even look good.
