Don't worry if you watch a DVD, Sandra Bullock will only appear in this cult class for only 5 minutes. The value of entertainment here is very high. <br /> <br /> To name just a few of the many highlights that you should pay attention to: <br /> <br /> - Double Evil Voices of Major Bad Boys - Special Arms Camera - Weird Impulse Masks and Equipment - Invisible Ways to Bullet landing - abundance of bottom-up shooting - Spatial scene where Bullock falls on the street unconscious - Italian piano worker Moe (LaMotta) - Cheap synthesizer background music - Pleasant fetishism of overdosed weapons <br /> <br /> And last but not least: extremely fisted fights scenes. I wish there would have been more of them ... <br /> <br /> The extra point for a successful attempt to make me laugh out loud.
