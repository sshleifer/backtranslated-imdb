Reba sucks. It sucks hard. This is the terrible singer of the country trying to try comedy. They can also name this "Generic" exhibition because that's it. It's stupid and general. Reba, you're not funny, and I'm glad your slow-down exhibition was canceled because you wonder, and so does Brock, Barbra Jean, the redhead teenager, the jockey boy and the 12-year-old who's knocked. You are all miracles and no one is funny. Oh, and I heard you hear that Reba is actually a gay devil-worshiper who idols Hitler and tortures animals. And he subconsciously sends his show and his "music" in the hope that the children will kill their parents and kill themselves! But it was just a rumor. Anyway, this is the worst show, Reba is gay, I don't like it, I think the agency is better than this show and this show sucks.
