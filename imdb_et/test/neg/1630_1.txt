I saw it late, late, late, at a late show when MST3K was just in the eyes of Joel Hodgson. I had the privilege of seeing it without knowing exactly how bad it would be. I did not know that a woman with an arrow on her chest can drive to the "top of the ground" in about an hour and a half (thanks to God that her father gave such specific instructions) and takes the time to go back with the help of the castle. I didn't know that a barbarian-type sword could get into the forest and create a hanger and flash bombs for less than 30 seconds. I had no idea how to separate the movie. <br /> <br /> It's a bad thing, very bad. If you enjoy bad movies, go to it.
