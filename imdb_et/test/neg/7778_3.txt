As usual, another masterpiece in the Vice Academy series (HaHaHa). I don't know why they even bothered it in the trash. Just another series of policemen who operate slutty. The decisive part was when Ginger Lynn Allen's character (Holly Wells) and Elizabeth Kaitani's character (Candy) tried to attract a scientist by wearing not only bra and underwear on their blades. Just a wonderful scene (Ha). The person I did not like was the Commissioner. He was very annoying and ignorant. They should have arrested him. Mrs Devonshire was also very annoying. They should have finished this movie.
