My brain yelled "why are you looking! Turn it off and go to bed!" But the potatoness of the couch won and I looked until the predicted end. I think if this is Bruce Campbell, I have to give him a chance. <br /> <br /> It is difficult for me to file a small budget movie for low budget only. Movies that prove that a good story, good writing and good acting are enough to make a good movie. Ted and Bruce just started making such a movie, but it seemed they didn't learn from Sam that it would take a little more to make a movie than toss a movie. <br /> <br /> It is also sad because Bruce has always been a favorite. After the 70s and 80s, I just can't believe that such films are still bad. Bruce, I'm really disappointed.
