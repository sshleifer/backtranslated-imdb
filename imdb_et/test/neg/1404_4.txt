It was a character's film. The plot was not as hot as it was there, but the characters were interesting and very good. The story focuses on the Travis family after the oldest son suicide. I say it loosely, because the story has mostly survived about the son and mother, because if the father had to focus on the story, they made the film quite bad. Working on all parts was very good, especially for Emile Hirsch as a surviving, confused son. The characters were all very interesting, and I don't mind watching them until the film's delay, when it just seemed to be dragging. <br /> <br /> My big complaint was a story. The son who killed himself was supposed to be the center of the plot. But it wasn't really. It was something that happened at the beginning of the story, but then everything went in every way. Then they mentioned that the son had killed himself to remind you that it was a central issue. The other thing was that the twists of large plots, many of which were, were never explained or built up, but were thrown out of it at random and often far from the left. In the honesty, the end was very, very cool. But it was also clear from where the story was inspired: about half of it (half that was not padded) came from a lot of Pearl Jami's song Alive. It reminds me ... <br /> <br /> There was a "poem" written by someone allegedly killing himself. I couldn't be the only one who admitted that this poem had been raised, literally, from the same song. I know it was a movie that had hope, and they really fell off the ball.
