During the career of every big-name actor, the time comes when they get sloppy and accept projects they wouldn't have touched on the golden days of 1000 feet. Remember "taxi driver"? It was a good movie. I can't believe "Showtime" by De Niro is the same actor. <br /> <br /> I'd rather look at "Time Chasers" twice than seeing this movie again. If anyone wants to show you "Showtime" or give you a free pass or whatever, run as fast as you can.
