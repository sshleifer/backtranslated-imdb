This horrible moovie is fun on many levels - a plain, fake bird doll that floats around cheap kits without ever slipping the wings (like the string, maybe?), Attacking model trains and toys cars. "Science" is asinine - a masonic atomic weapon? And what's the amount of Brylcream in everyone's hair? I think the 50s were the Slimeball Decade! Well, this birdie is probably from "some universe anti-matter universe" and it is here to build a nest and lay egg in New York. Seriously. That they can kill the doll is almost a shame. I'll give her 4 horses - it's silly and silly, but fun to be like Armageddon. : = 8)
