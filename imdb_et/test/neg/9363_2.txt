<br /> <br /> I understand that people have different advantages from low budget movies. I also know that John Sayles has some glow, a reputation, intellectual anti-Hollywood weather, La Tim Robbins, Coen's brothers and Atom Egoyan, which makes him expensive with critics. br /> <br /> But this is not a good movie. Sorry, it's just not. <br /> <br /> It sounds. It has too many signs. Its tone is uneven, its perspective is confusing, the actor is on the board, from the naturalistic to the top. It stays in small letters at long moments that we don't care about and stay away from tight scenes when things are good. <br /> <br /> This is unchecked. <br /> <br /> The worst movie flaw is that the two closest things to the protagonist, Edie Falcole Marly and Angela Bassetti Desiree, are straightforward with no stars. Marly is an apathetic drunk that is inert in her life. Desiree is a woman who is caught under her repressed pain. If the worldview of your two main characters can be summed up with the phrase "I don't care" and "I want to leave it", why should the audience give the rat a sin? <br /> <br /> I Sayles writes a funny dialog. She's very adept at the scene. The problem is that these scenes don't go anywhere. There is no backbone for the film. No cars. The film does not create a rooted interest in any character. In my opinion, he is too obedient to the big bad business worlds that goblins up with a little guy. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a quality "little" movie, check out David Lynch's "Straight Story". Get it up.
