At first I thought that Nasan could be one of those progressive new Filipino films. As someone noted earlier, the film doesn't look bad. it is clear that the directors used more expensive cameras for shooting, better angles, better sound equipment, beautiful actors and more beautiful places. <br /> <br /> However, all fixes are purely superficial. if not all polish and expensive filters, nasan seems to me just like your typical secondary local movie - - hyperactive drama, predictable plot turn, "yes yes!" moments, crying, screaming and characters you could care less, all pushed your throat. <br /> <br /> A couple of things bothered me about this movie. first, when is sexual adopted with the family? that non-blood related argument does not make the difference ounce. Secondly, does the woman really tell someone 40 years that she was raped, just because her father said she was being kept secret? and where the hell were the lights of this movie? I know the director tried to look at things very dramatically, but I was just forced to show my TV's brightness function.
