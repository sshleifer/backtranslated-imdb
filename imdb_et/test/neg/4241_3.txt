Women's hot numbers at this show are breathtaking. They may also speak as it is not tomorrow. Otherwise, this show will quickly go to the toilet. How much money they make for all the people who enter text, with the hope that it will be won, $ 100.o or whatever. Boy, now it's a scam !!! Can I buy such money makers? Let's face it, with the help of modern technology, thousands of people can call every minute. And ten thousand channels and nothing that is worth nothing, thousands of people look at this example. "Oh, I know this answer!" Is probably a very common feature among listeners. With those super hotties that constantly say "lounge" needs callers, I think it's a bunch of B.S. Often someone who goes through is amazed that they actually talk to the host. Many of them sound depressed and weary, apparently waiting so long and trying so many times to pocket and make some changes. Wow, manufacturers need to be just raking it in. No wonder there are so few ads. Ads are just for giving more time (mainly for losers) to enter and wait for text, and hope and dream and fantasy --- what? --- Winning enough money for a gas tank and dinner at Mc..something? I look at it now and then on my brother's TV because he likes to watch it on the computer. I sit there for 15 to 20 minutes and watch Mel (one of the most delightful looking women on television) and laugh at the scam before me. Then I have to leave; even if I don't! People who have an active life can only show it in very modest ways. Mel, get yourself into movies or TVs or something. Many of us are in love with you! Even in super countries, I'm surprised that this show is still there!
