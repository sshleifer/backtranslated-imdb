Uma and Travolta were very good together, but unfortunately - when they left the screen - it was nothing more than a very boring and literal secondary sign that was packed in some very bad writing. From time to time, glance at the size of a dance image like Uma and Travolta, which quickly changed to Harvey Keitel and similar uninteresting rogues. And the white guy who tried to black out became VERY, very tiring after too much exposure in the picture. He weighed Rock's relatively good performance, the only secondary sign you couldn't wait to leave the screen. Bad, stupid plot. Writers could not clearly understand whether they were writing for the X generation or for the 12-15-year-old rap crowds, and the combination became a film that kept me watchable!
