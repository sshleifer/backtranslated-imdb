The story of a former navy seal, who is now a physician in charge of a modern Russian sub-nurse. Its purpose is to respond to the call of the original crew member's dead member. The lower has passed the terrorists who are scattered. So we see that the duo is trying to get back. And this happens to the fear of the United States Navy that it will release all that it has got into a terrorist area to avoid launching this arsenal. Be careful with the early explicit sexual scene in the first quarter of the movie. A couple of unexplained scenes to the end. See if you have time. Don't miss anything even if you let the display run when you go to get a cup of coffee: slow motion.
