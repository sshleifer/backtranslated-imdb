First, the current description of the IMDb plot seems to be misleading; the film is about a group of girls who accept a mysterious migrant who is going to kill them all. They stay in a small motel where they keep them hostage but develop an intensive attraction for one of the girls. Violence arises. <br /> <br /> I chose it wrong, thinking it was the second in 2007. "The Hitcher". Not that Hitcher is better, and I was still looking for a movie, but it was almost unbearable at times. I think I could have vomited the paper and come up with a better plot than that. <br /> <br /> I can't even read how many movies I've seen using almost the same story, so it was painfully predictable from time to time, but what really made it terrible was some scenes ... well let me show you. At one point the door is covered (which is very obvious) with blood and two police officers, who are due to the 911 speech, look at it 30 meters away, look at the man, also covered with blood, walk from the door, agree that it seems suspicious, but decides not investigate. <br /> <br /> But while it may be ridiculous, the film was never boring, well produced, targeted and acted with good special effects, free nudity and violence. I probably wouldn't recommend actually spending 90 minutes sitting down to watch this movie, but it turned out to be perfect when I had time to clean my cellar. It is also recommended for fans of twilight movies and would be a good movie with friends if you intend to talk more than watching.
