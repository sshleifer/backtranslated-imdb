This is undoubtedly the worst film I've ever seen. I say it without hyperbole and believe me, I've seen many bad movies. It is embarrassing and annoying that millions of dollars came into this movie and that hundreds (thousands?) Of craftsmen spent so much time working on what writers and manufacturers need to know, a huge mistake. <br /> <br /> When a 90-minute movie feels it for a long time, pulled out, boring and incomprehensible, you know that something went wrong. Also, Jamie Kennedy (whose work I have enjoyed elsewhere) is simply terrible in this role; he was obviously not given the screen test because no manufacturer thought it was in some way entertaining, especially on the mask. Just terrible. <br /> <br /> Personally, I can't wait to see the comments of big movie critics because I know they're doing a better job than I do to break this train. <Br /> <br /> Producers of this movie should be embarrassing, and more importantly, NEVER allow theater productions to be reprinted.
