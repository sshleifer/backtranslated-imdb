My part that would like to give this film a high rating. Given that it was done in 1953, it is a very bold movie about transvestites that deals with this issue relatively seriously and sympathetically (and provides the viewer with a lot of information on this subject) and strives hard not to stereotype. The film clearly states that transvestites are not homosexual, and that, in addition to women's clothing, they carry a relatively normal life. It is about the pain that is not acceptable in society - a policeman (Lyle Talbot) revolves around the plot, trying to understand this problem somewhat because of the recent suicide of a transvestite. So, you must give all those involved in this movie a controversial (in the context of 1953). <br /> <br /> Having said all this, I'm sorry to say that this movie is absolutely terrible. In an attempt to portray the pain of Glen / Glenda (Edward D. Wood), this film falls into foolish (and sometimes surprisingly - era-sensual) fantasies that make this story very difficult. At best, the actor is wood. No dialogue is real; Actors see and sound like people reading speeches written by others. And worst of all - in this sense, there was no point in Bela Lugos on this film. This was another embarrassing role that this poor person took in the last stages of his career. "Pull the strings, pull the strings," the bad character of Lugos (called in the Spirit of credit, but indeed overcoming more mad as a scientist) cried. And something he didn't really know is much more about the film. <br /> <br /> For artistic value, the movie doesn't really have much more than 1/10. But for this courage that is only related to this display, I give it 3/10.
