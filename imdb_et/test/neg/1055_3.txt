*** Possable spoiler, but probably not *** <br /> <br /> The game is called donkey but the donkey is not even there. <br /> <br /> No more! Diddy has gone so well! <br /> <br /> The first Donkey Kong country was one of my two best favorites in the <br /> <br /> Super Nintendo games. (Another is Super Mario World) <br /> <br /> 2. Donkey Kong had at least a big and good level, although it seemed like a pirate-based game. <br /> <br /> But this is the worst of the lot! It doesn't recognize the original or the 2nd, the enemy's appearance is stupid and the levels are even worse. It is no longer realistic! I didn't enjoy my game unlike the last two, the first was very good <br /> <br /> and the other was not bad, but the music in this <br /> <br /> game is terrible! /> <br /> These days, it happens that movies, shows and sometimes <br /> <br /> video games that start fantastically are destroyed with <br /> <br /> stupid sequel! I'm sad to say that the donkey Kong as a saga is not as good as it has Donkey Kong 3! <br /> <br /> They should have been at the beginning or MAY 2 ..
