Something disappointing. Lee J. Cobb is Roxton's leader in clothing in New York. His partner in this business is killed when the elevator is released and moves eighty-seven floors to the bottom of the shaft, in the most dramatic scene of the film. <br /> <br /> Cobb doesn't know it or don't let him understand it, but behind the killing is Richard Boone, who protects the company from trade union organizers. <br /> <br /> Then Cobb's son Kerwin Mathews returns from Europe who decided to study business and join his father's clean shop. He's shocked - shocked! To find out that Boone has been harassed by trade unionists and killed some who have become irreversibly irritating. <br /> <br /> Robert Loggia is one of the organizers who died from a couple of Boone gons, led by Wesley Addy. Loggia leaves the widow, Gia Scala, with whom Mathews takes reasonably and beautifully. <br /> <br /> Finally, Cobb pays for his deception, Addy and Boone get their just desserts and Mathews with the succulent Scala, called the Opera House. <br /> <br /> There are no sparks in any dialogue line. A few lines have been stolen literally on the "On the Waterfront" - "pistoleros", "you're talking to the grave immediately." The plot is schematic and has no surprises. The direction of Vincent Sherman is a pedestrian. Photography is flat and intrusive, although there are a few nice shots on the streets of New York. <br /> <br /> Lee J. Cobb can act. In this case, it must be easy for him, because he repeats Johnny Friendly's "On the Waterfront", only this time with a soft heart. Richard Boone can also act. A small part of Joseph Wiseman is doing a good job. Gia Scala hits her signs, says what the script requires, and does what the director tells her. Stunning woman, her life got sour early. The director and photographer do a good job with Wesley Addy. He has white hair, a bleached face, eyes on the ice-lake color and sometimes he hits a wide-angle lens when his surprisingly fleshy lips make some parasitic fish. I don't see him as a low-level muscle man. He and Boone should have changed roles. Harold J. Stone is his trustworthy in itself, although he is forced to be "Italy", as Tony has naturally come to him. Someone else who resembles a larger part is more than mediocre, and some performers don't even lose that bar. Kerwin Mathews can be a nice boy in real life, but he is coolly sterile and belongs to domestic dramas in the afternoon on television. <br /> <br /> A big title that refers to intrigue and shadows. Some good people cast. Potentially explosive business activity that nobody knows but deals with megabucks. <br /> <br /> And it all comes out like this.
