The Disney Studio's own 1965 classic remake wisely touches the cat that drives F.B.I. agent kidnapped woman. Christina Ricci gives a perfect, let-me-outta-performance as a cat owner and is played by Doug E. Doug, who is embarrassingly like a human being. Rich neurotics (Dyan Cannon and original "Cat" cast member Dean Jones) is funny and there is still a small juice in the formula area, but handling here is so hard and terrible and the cat is so inanimate, it's strictly DOA <br /> > * from ****
