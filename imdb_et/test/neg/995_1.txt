I think Downey was inspired by the new French wave. <br /> <br /> Who didn't do it? wave. <br /> <br /> Synapse is probably a terrible thing to lose and Downey seems to have lost a lot. Just say no. More than one. Including watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I couldn't take it for a while and started to move it quickly. It would have been wiser if you missed it completely.
