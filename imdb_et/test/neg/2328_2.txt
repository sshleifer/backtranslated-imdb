I was for the hope that I loved David Lynch, who I really like, a movie, but a very poor one, everyone acting, but Naomi Watts was the first thought that it was a wasted effort. Some of the Twin Peaks characters are reused in this movie, but it wasn't terrible, it wasn't interesting (except topless Watts scenes) and the quirks were badly done. <br /> <br /> I will probably give another chance to Lynch, but the leap of this movie doesn't look like, especially for our fans who saw Eraserhead when he first came out.
