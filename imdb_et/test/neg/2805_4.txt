I've been waiting for comedy about NVA, but it's a parody. It shows the East German state army in lighting that is not relevant and certainly not true. <br /> <br /> Comedy can do anything if the underlying facts do not change. Even the comedy about German KZ is possible, as shown by Roberto Benigni with "LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL". <br /> <br /> Film NVA would be "OK" comedy because the jokes it contains are common. Something special - not fun, but enough to live with it. <br /> <br /> What matters is that the film makes a farce and parody of NVA. The death mechanism that was ready to attack WESTERN EUROPE with this friend's RED ARMY. An institution that used everything to get as much of its soldiers as possible. Military, who marched to CSPR in 1968 and was ready to go to Poland to destroy SOLIDARNOSC. Can't make a movie without the slightest evil, or make a parody of KZ, Guantanamo or 9/11? Showing Osama bin Laden as a funny screwed man? 90 minutes about funny Osama in the Afghan Taliban camp, where he makes jokes and educates his soldiers, would be comparable to what this film is about NVA!
