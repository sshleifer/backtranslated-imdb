It's a movie that really makes me angry. In 1951, MGM and Looney Toons made their best cartoons - with amazing animation, exceptional backgrounds and great stories. Then, at the end of the 40s, a new animation style began to appear (for example, "Crusader Rabbit" on TV) - animation with very simple artwork to save money. Unfortunately, Columbia Picture worked cynical ploy! Instead of hating the tones (as they should have), many of them accepted and the Oscar people (AMPAS) awarded this film for the best animated short prize, giving legitimacy to a worse product. Unfortunately, in Hollywood dollars and in the mindset, it soon began to fall on the products of legitimate studio centers - resulting in quite funny cartoons. Later it became even worse because, in addition to bad animation and background, the stories became almost invisible to adults. The classic cartoon smartness and style was gone. And for this tragedy, I partly blame GERALD MCBOING-BOING, one of the grandfathers of cheap cartoons. The story is not so bad, but the animation is a horror and listening to a child who says "boat ride" ceaselessly is a pain.
