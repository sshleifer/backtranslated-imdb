This is the worst film I've ever seen, and believe me I'm a lot of bad movies. I love the cheeesy horror, but it was just terrible. There was no scene in this movie where I felt scared. All participants must be the people they found at the bus stop 20 minutes before taking the picture. I want Blockbutser to have given me 99 cents back. Action was terrible. Writing was incredibly bad. Someone had to screen this movie before it was released and know it was terrible. I was embarrassed that my name would be related to this monster. Don't try this movie. If you do, don't return it, so no other poor soul will ever make a mistake.
