I understand the director's goal of telling stories that are not stories, but the way he tried to show passing time (a couple of joggers who are first jogging, walking with a stroller) than alone ...) and associate characters with "adventures" (last scene) where the maid climbs the hill, looking at the big black boy on the second rock, and then see the boat with his former employer and said, "Oh, boat!") were terrible. At the same time, I liked how he depicted the middle class, even too much. I think it's a tough film. If you want to see it, do it as a film student, trying to see the technical aspects and issues. It helps a lot.
