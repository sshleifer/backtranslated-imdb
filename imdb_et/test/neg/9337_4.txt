At this point I watch this movie on television in Tokyo. Beautiful scenery, beautiful Bible proportions, beautiful costumes, beautiful color, beautiful Gina. A great climatic scene when God destroys Sheban's idol and much more with de Millea thunder at the time Yul and Gina finish their love. Yul does a half-decent job to implement his lines, although he sounds a lot like Yul, who gives his lines like Ramses or Taras Bulba. George Sanders sounds like George Sanders, who plays George Sanders. Given the limited scope for action, Ginal is asked to show in this role, but Gina is doing a good job, although by the end of the film she is completely transformed into a harmless regrettable girl and seems to be playing her mother's biography of Teresa. I think thunderstorms will do it for you, but it's almost breathtaking how fast he believes in his new faith. Supporting players are usually terrible, lacking in reliable emotions and timing. The usual big scenes of the battle that went to the devastating dances in 1959, and the orchestra that burst a lot of trumpets, calls a lot of "Ah's" behind the big choir song, but none of them are top quality Hollywood. The final sword fight between Brynner and Sanders is a ridiculously low level in junior high school games. Film is one big eye candy, but not much more.
