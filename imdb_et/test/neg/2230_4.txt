My Take: Usually routine and lazy straight from Disney videos. <br /> <br /> Disney must be in love with the family tradition of being a family dog. Many movies have dedicated stories that focus only on the best friend of the person. Disney himself has done a handful. They also made a handful of those who are literally dogs. Add it to this bunch. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen the original for a very long time, so obviously I'm not the right person to decide if this direct-video post price is better. Anyone over seven years old is not the right person to watch it. Perhaps only the young youngsters want to see the advice of LADY AND TRAMP II: SCAMP, and even they would grow up and say it is not the best family life they've ever seen. I think to be fair, I can say that it requires renting, but it's not much to say. <br /> <br /> This sequel pulls out a lot of parts that were left behind after the original so-called classic. Lady and Trampil are now cute Crocker Spaniel sons ... and one naughty mongrel called Scamp who is a chip out of the old block. Instead of home boundaries, Scamp wants other town homes that are not aware of their father's past on the streets that are one of the street mongues. In order to capture the charms of the original, it throws the love story of the same poor dog / rich dog, on the contrary. Scamp falls into one of the English-speaking dog breeds (and who wouldn't want a name and voice that sounds like Alyssa Milano?). Repeating the famous spaghetti scene Other than the "cute" factor, there is no audience in this direct-video effort. Attach the original. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** 5 out of 5
