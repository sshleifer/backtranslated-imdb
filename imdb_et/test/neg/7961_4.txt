If there is one thing I want to distinguish from other great appraisers here, I am finding royal movies at Thrift and Dollar Stores. That means you can't imagine how happy I was when I found it. <br /> <br /> I even remember that Saturday morning when * every * station simulcast it, so you were stuck when you wanted to see something else (then again, I think it was an idea). As a child, I did not know if I liked how all the different characters came together (there are some crossovers that just don't work *). But I think that its intended effect was special. Don't do drugs because you have nightmares about muppet. <br /> <br /> If you look at it as an adult, you will also receive this strange * anti-drug "Reefer Madness" on this side. I think I'll leave it there before I get into it.
