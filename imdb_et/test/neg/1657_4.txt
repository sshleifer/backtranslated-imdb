Very slow, boring, puzzling movie. Perhaps such a movie would have been made by Jean-Luc Godard if he had been Italy. Certainly, this annoying, repetitive, cheerful and empty person can pass, but I don't usually go to the cinema to find out! The plot (as it is) doesn't convince. Why a gorgeous hotel receiver (the exception to the mood of the movie) would be the least interesting of desperate, quit smoking, quiet lonelier who speaks of "deep" aphorisms. It is very difficult to feel sympathy against the protagonist. She seems to be shaking by the throat and telling her it will come out! His brother is much more human. The end is unclear and puzzling. Everybody in the cinema (when I saw the movie) went out of the way they almost slept. Of course, it shouldn't be Hollywood Bruce Willis' shhot-em-up and crash-bang fiesta, but a little bit of energy and action would make it much more exciting. One of the best Italian movies ever? Pleease ... Art house, curiosity best.
