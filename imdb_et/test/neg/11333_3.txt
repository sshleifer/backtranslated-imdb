I do not understand why someone would allow the director of the sub-parameters to put on such cellulose. This movie has already been made at least twice, which was better than that ("Here comes Mr. Jordan" - 1941 and "Heaven Can Wait" - 1978). The only factor that could save drawing fans could have been some beautiful skating by a professional skateboarder, but that just won't happen. The closest thing the audience sees to good skating is when Tara Lipinski's character stays in for a moment. Others like Nancy Kerrigan and Elvis Stojko are hidden in the background and don't do any drawing at all. There is not much real emotion, and there is no reason to tune it clearly to a movie made for television. My advice: renting the original.
