As other posters have commented on it, it was a very bad film (it was child friendly). FX was a low class, they should spend $ 1 coke. As these D-films are typical, most victims die and leave a mystery, except for one happy soul and of course the leader. I hope the money was worth it for Boxleitner, really a big step away from Babylon. 5. Nice to see what happened to Buck Rogers, but the fucking one was even low for him. â€œIt was so bad, and in the case of older actors, they thought it was bad. Don't look. <br /> <br /> ***** Warning Spoiler Below **** <br /> <br /> This thing pushed everyone who was after, and yet Boxlietner went away ... was a pure BS. And the end? How were kids in hell with her? It was just too stupid.
