I have no idea how anyone can mark this movie high. I didn't rent it, I thought it was the next big nightmare, the next big horror fight or the next big budget for horror. Obviously, it is not meant to scare, but one deadly mistake in production has broken the joy of watching. Audio editing was terrible. I had to work under the control of the entire movie volume. You can imagine how difficult it is to get into something - even with low budget fraud - when you are either turning the volume up or down or trying to predict the next time. Regular dialogue is very small and all screams, noise, etc. are very white. We're not talking about changing the volume control between 5 and 7, finding a happy medium 6. We're talking about switching between 2 and 9 when the volume is almost impossible. Again, this movie can be a decent example of what it should be, but you spend so much time adjusting your volume control so you never have the opportunity to enjoy it.
