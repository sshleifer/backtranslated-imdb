At the university, our professor of philosophy played Mr.R. "Roger & Me" as a whole. It was at a time when obese malformation was still quite unknown; charlatan-in-the-making, a soon-to-be-house-name who was still busy with his fact-bending skills and still learn how to manipulate easily impressed, pathologically paranoid, mentally ill, sexually frustrated, illiterate, semi-literate, helpless and ridiculously athletic among you. <br /> <br /> When we finished viewing it, I thought, "Yes, it was a little fun - totally stupid Bugs in Bunny's way - but what is the exceptionally biased, capitalist propaganda-turkey that has no objectivity, its only purpose is to take cheap pictures of people and ideas that the creator of the film has for the pets. documentary with any imagination. "But our beloved Marxist professor was absolutely excited about R & M and we could not only criticize any aspects of it, but Mr. R actually spent the rest of the class, recognizing its "qualities". So we understand each other, the words "propaganda", "viewer manipulation", "left-wing extremist" or "selective presentation of facts" never left their permanently smiling mouth ... and just remember: it was supposed to be a class of philosophy, not an indoctrineer YOUR STUDENTS FOR YOUR POLITICAL BS course. <br /> <br /> Anyway, now I'm a really interesting aspect: this professor Mr.R is now a very successful screenwriter in Hollywood. He has written several left-hand scripts with Class A characters. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story: these are the people to whom all the doors are open in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Michael Moore is a talentless filmmaker (which he proved beyond doubt with "Canadian Bacon"), but when Marxist is liberal, doors open to almost everyone. Tinseltown is full of Rabid pro-Chavez extremists, which is why political brainwashing has been part of the Hollywood experience for decades through a simplified depiction of reality. <br /> <br /> Collect this demagogue and you will betray your brain forever.
