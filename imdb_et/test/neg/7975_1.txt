Please give it one by one. <br /> <br /> Kristy Swanson and the others cast terribly. The show is flat, flat, flat. <br /> <br /> I don't know how Michael Madison would have allowed it on his disc. He almost seemed to know that it wasn't going to work out and his performance was rather weak, so all that Madison fans give is giving it away.
