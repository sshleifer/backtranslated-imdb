The only redeeming feature of this movie is Steve Carell. Like John Wayne, I've never seen Steve Carell stretch too far as an actor, but that doesn't matter. He always plays one of his tasks. <br /> <br /> As Marty Feldman said, comedy must have internal consistency. You can have 4 men sitting on the stage in the trash bin, and that's fine, but if you take the fifth man on the stage who is not in the trash, then you need to explain to the audience why he's not in the trash. <br /> <br /> Why doesn't Evan accept his role as God's messenger? Why, if he accepts it, is he so deeply embarrassed? Why no one is more impressed with how animals surround Evan (suspicious of them thinking they are "trained animals" probably from the circus). There is a terrible flood at the end, and most of us we see are on the ship and have been rescued, but thousands of people would have been killed as a result of the flood; there is no emotional atmosphere after the disaster. Instead, most congresses have finally seen the light and are going to prosecute the "accusation" of a bad congressionally irresponsibly. <br /> <br /> I have to admit: I liked the fish in the aquarium that reacted to Evan.
