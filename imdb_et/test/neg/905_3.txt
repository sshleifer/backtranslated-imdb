Sigh. I'm confused when I see such a short to get attention and tasks and what is not. I saw it at the film festival before the filmmaker got attention and forgot it right after that. It was a bit annoying to see it sweep Grinch, who stole a Christmas heartbeat with a story, a design depicted several times before, the whole weakness of Tim Burton's ish, and the story that goes somewhere. And we got "joking" about shooting the crowds with 45 for the first time, but I think it's really unacceptable that it even wipes out its basic concept of a comic book called 1999 LENORE, COMPETITION By Rome Dirge! As with any quick internet search shows. I mean, what's that? Is this based on the Hollywood contract and opening doors to filmmakers in Canada? "Give your head a shake," as Don Cherry can say.
