For years I was hesitant to watch this movie. Now I know why. It was even worse than I thought. Ashton Kutcher makes his career in the worst movie because of "Dude, where's my car?" Tara Reid celebrates Ashton's dream girl who is asking her to have her father's (and her boss's) pet suckler on the weekend. Rules: 1. There are no shoes in the house. 2. There are no people in the house. 3. Boss's son is out of the house. 4. Do not touch the furniture. <br /> <br /> Well, you can pretty much guess at the end of the first 20 minutes of how the rest of the movie changes. <br /> <br /> You know there are movies like "Meet the Parents" where bad things happen to someone, but it's fun to watch, and it's presented in a way that you can't wait to see what follows. It's not one of those movies. You know from the very beginning that bad things are happening, and they are mostly stupid things that never happen. This is an extremely depressing movie to watch, and about three times when I almost turned it off because it was so bad. But I paid the rent and thought I had to watch it right away. <br /> <br /> Tara Reid was good and I would like to see her in more movies. Although I am not surprised if this hand damages his career. <br /> <br /> The end result is a happy ending, but of course there is nothing you expect. despite this. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it. You sincerely regret it!
