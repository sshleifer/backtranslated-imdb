There is a reason why the chairman of the board got 2 (which is too high) that this movie is one of the worst films ever and I saw my part of rotten movies. The chairman of the board today celebrates two of the most annoying actors, Carrot Topi and Courtney Thorne Smith. Carrot Top is no longer funny and was not in this trash. Courtney Thorne Smith is no better, just look at "According to Jim" and you see an excellent example of what I'm talking about. The chairman of the board got me one because it is small because it is so bad. I'm a little shocked that this piece of junk isn't in the bottom 100 of IMdb, I'd put that list in the top 5, but it's slow to work there.
