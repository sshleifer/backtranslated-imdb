this film could have been good if there was a plot behind it. the title didn't fit even in the first ten minutes. the wind wasn't much related to the rest of the movie. it was a sub-par and writing reminded me of something you read in the children's book of frightening stories. <br /> <br /> As horror films go, it shouldn't even be categorized. it was a shame for the horror and thriller fans everywhere. I hate to be so tough, but I felt like I had time to spend watching this movie back. hopefully it will not be followed up. this film should be locked and not open to the public.
