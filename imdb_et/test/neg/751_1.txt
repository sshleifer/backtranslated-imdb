Is it possible to give 0 to 10 ratings? Because it deserves it. Although I'm not a big fan of Jane Austen's books, I sat down with two women who are. Well, at least we had a big laugh at how bad this film was. Robert Hardy was the only actor who had any kind of charisma, although he surpassed it as he usually does (almost as bad as William Shatner). But that wasn't enough to save that stinking full of breastfeeding. It is often difficult to distinguish a girl's dreams from what has really happened, and the story has so many holes that you can hardly understand what is going on. Too many open ends and ends seem to "tune again next week". The leading actor is too heroic and weird to be a heroine, the leading person is too funny and feminine to be a convincing hero and the music sounds like some cheap newborn project by the director of the hippie director (I mean, saxophone mixed with some kind of space operative female brother?). In conclusion, I suggest you capture the budget and order the DVD as soon as possible. Especially if you want frustration.
