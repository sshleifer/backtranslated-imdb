Bad, bad, bad, bad, but I've seen worse, so I gave it to 1 instead of 2. I just stopped watching this movie and I thought it was about as rotten as Dr. Chopper. The worst line of the movie was to be: "I like to introduce someone ... to meet my inner b * tch", which consisted of a single, five-man survivor of a fantastic group who dropped dr. stage. The second worst line: "I'm a car park that will f * ck make you" What's this freak not even a policeman ????? Has anyone else noticed how everyone dies instantly from the magical intestine (no one dies that quickly from the intestine, I know I often see them in the operating room), except for the super park ranger. Dude had a bad blood bucket out of the wound, broke somewhat on the floor, and then entered the finals between Dr Chopper when the inner b * tch was on the floor. And if it doesn't beat, he doesn't even die, like everyone else. The inner b * tch helps him slip out and he tells him he won't die when he needs help because he's like his only friend who's alive now alive. Since these two became friends? I do not believe that the frantic meeting in the forest, where he tells you to drive the city, is to learn about your time, but whatever. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie only if there is nothing else and there is nothing else in your time.
