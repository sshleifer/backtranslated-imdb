This movie is really awful OPEN ALL COSTS !! I want my hour and 20 minutes ago! <br /> <br /> Not all funny when you watch this movie without smiling or even smiling. Swears that the speakers will flow like a waterfall, each of which will be more annoying than the last, and will not contribute to comedy OR plot (general comedy - not this film in general!). <br /> <br /> All in all, it's flat-a $ 5, watered -typed- "Out Cold" ish movie - but tremendously terrible. The film focuses on the two groups of the city, Poories and Richies (if this is probably the case?), Where two opposites have snowboard battles with each other. (the story is much like the 4-year-old story without all the swears and fools) <br /> <br /> MOVIE - 1/10 - because you can't give less results
