My wife called my son and I watch it on cable television on a lazy Saturday night, thinking it might show Juliette Lewis an unusual role. At least this film gives this promise: its character is ineffective, following the clichés of almost every type of horror film. Like a movie. The cataloging of the detention they studied would be a reminder of something that I hope will soon be forgotten, so I will not. Basically, this red herring, which is difficult, everyone seems guilty, not just two suspects from the beginning. The bad horror movie rule "eliminates logical and obvious and what is left" works well. The only surprise that had any effect on me was the final clash of the final cliché: does Jane hold on to the savior catcher who tells her the (conspicuous) publicity of the second conspiracy that pushes her into the second hysterical victim's playing round. Grace, I never know.
