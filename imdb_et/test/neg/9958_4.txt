Fortunately, you don't need a lot of "book to learn" to understand where this thing is going ... Obviously, in the poverty line, cash entry to Universal's big hit WOLF MAN (which was only done a year earlier), always finds the visible George Zucco's second his patented "mad doctor" role as brilliant, revenge-minded scientist Lorenzo Cameron. Cameron, who has set up a shop in the deep summer, which I assume is Louisiana Bay, is a revenge against four of his former contemporaries who both humiliated him and forced him to resign from his previous job. You see, they frightened her allegations that they were able to interfere with the man's beast to create an army of unstoppable wolf creatures that would be available during the war. Fortunately, Cameron has found the ideal test for injecting his wolf - a bunch of half-childed petro (Glenn Strange). Petro is pretty helpless about what's going on, doesn't ask too many questions and lets the doctor hold him on the table and shoot him whatever happens in his syringe. This results in a slow change when a person becomes a werewolf. Cameron lets him out of the mansion with a secret passage so you get a basically big boy (Strange was 6'5 "), dressed in combination with a bush beard, hair paws and an all-size plastic tooth set that ran around After the seer sees beast and little girl killing, local people grab their rifles and arrange their things to wow, Dr. comfortable antidote, which results in kickback, pulls Petro into the big city to try to follow professors who had made their original theories and destroyed him reputation in the process, as well as the house around Cameron's daughter Lenora (Anne Nagel), as well as Lenora's curious reporter Tom (Johnny Downs), whose first tendency is to deal with a walking prehistoric creature (!) in many ways, unimpressive sets, cinematography and m ake-ups, as well as quite boring supportive majority, it remains traceable thanks to Mr. George Zucco hi I have no idea why Downs got the most billing; he appears for half an hour and he doesn't really have much to do, nor is he all impressive. This is Zucco's show all the time and he's great ranting and raving, talking to himself, fantasizing that he's talking to his peers ("I don't care about your glimpse of mouth!") And temporarily slips into peace of mind. It seems that Strange showed his performance as a amusingly na√Øve and slowly speaking semi-slowed state throughout Lon Chaney Jr. during the lecture, from Lenny OF MICE AND MEN, performed by WOLF MAN mentioned above. In any case, Strange and Zucco are doing a pretty good job. My favorite thing is when Zucco calls him his "guinea pig" in front of his colleague while Petro is just sitting there with a smile and staring. Some of the misty swamp scenes are also quite atmospheric.
