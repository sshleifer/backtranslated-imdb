Comparison of the 1995 version is inevitable. Unfortunately, this version will be much shorter. <br /> <br /> Casting is unbuilt and works on wood. The impression is that the director did not read the book, so he didn't understand the characters. <br /> <br /> Sir Walter Elliot is depicted as a pomp, but his inadvertent stupidity, which Redgrave excelled (in the 1995 version), is nowhere. Musgrove's sisters are so unlikely to understand why Wentworth or anyone else gave them a second glance. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Wentworth and Anne is not familiar. It's hard to see that Anne has been worried for years when someone hasn't read a book. In the scene where Wentworth eats breakfast with Anne and Mary, the viewer, as Mary thinks, seems a little familiar. <br /> <br /> In the 1995 version, when Wentworth walks (for the first time he sees him for years), the tension is thick. Wentworth has been left behind in the waves while Anne is almost overrun. <br /> <br /> In this version, when Wentworth meets Lousia, it is as if he really invested, there are no downflows. In the 1995 version, the viewer sees Wentworth's anger at Anne. He flaunting his judgment in front of Anne, as if to say, "See what you gave up, I don't need and want you". <br /> <br /> However, he still cares when he suffers, like a scene where he asks Anne to bring her back home from her wicked and admiral. In the 1995 version, Anne's shock feels she cares if she is tired, we also feel the discomfort of Wentworth that she cares. In this version, he just walks with Lousia as if nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The main scene where Anne speaks to Harville, who loves taller men or women, is completely botched. Participants simply speak lines without emotional investment. <br /> <br /> When she reads a letter from Wentworth, she reads a list of food items. <br /> <br /> Contrast this with the 1995 version, where the viewer knows Anne's joy in her alternative. We're with her when she reads the letters. The director had both actors who read the letter and heard both voices. Wentworth is full of disappointment, passion and hope, while Anne is incredibly incredible at first. <br /> <br /> This production has more scenes since its release, probably because it was necessary to explain to the viewer what just happened. The 1995 version did not have to explain, we knew and felt happy. The only thing about this production is that Mrs Smith's sub-region remained intact, while the 1995 version was not. <br /> <br 1995, however, included some of Austen's original end. The scene where Admiral ordered Wentworth to find out if Anne and Mr. Elliot want to return home after their marriage (which he and Mrs Croft are renting). <br /> <br /> This is a production that must be avoided at all costs.
