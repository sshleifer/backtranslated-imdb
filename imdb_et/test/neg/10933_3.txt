My husband wanted to watch this movie because the press review said it was better than Fatal Attraction. Well, I don't like Michael Douglas or Glenn Close, so I should agree. But not for usual reasons. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that must be viewed late at night if you don't want to look at something that really needs thinking, but don't want to sleep Yancy Butler is a really enjoyable bad guy. She's not the best of the actors, she's not really good, but she's perfect for that role in this role. All the others in it vary from pine to oak, including a little disturbing boy who gets into a twisted Pinocchio. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: The end goes a step or two too far, with a clich√© that is not quite dead, with a roar, I'll get you for a moment and then there's a Pinocchio shot with his frozen wooden smile that makes you wonder if they intend to cool or just forgot that the make-up was botox. Regardless, it's fun for eighty minutes and, despite being a bad movie, you should miss the sense of humor to enjoy it somewhat. Don't pay for it, but if you're in such an apathetic order, it's right.
