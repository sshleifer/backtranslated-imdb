Frankly speaking, this is a very funny movie if you are looking for bad behavior (Heather Graham will never be able to live it ... he has three titles to defend the offense!), A badly bad dialogue ("Do you like ... ... ribs?" ) and only a mother-approved plot, it's your Friday night entertainment! My roommate rented it under the title "Terrified" because he liked Heather Graham, but it was frightened what we felt after the final credit. Not because the film is scary, but because someone paid the money to roll it out. <br /> <br /> A horrible movie. There are some no-name actors who offer some unintentional comedy, but nothing is worth watching. Heather Graham's dramatic climax was also one of the most pathetic and disturbing things I've ever seen. I will honor this film for some point and God has mercy on my soul.
