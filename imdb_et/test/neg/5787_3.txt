The modern chapter of the submarine demolition workers of the US Navy has been called to ... what they want, probably. <br /> <br /> Charlie Sheen became an officer. This story is incredible. Michael Biehn is his immediate C.O. but he keeps Charlie in a pretty long strap and one of the boys pays for it early because he kills Charlie's patented stupidity. The rest of the team spends their free time for court-war crimes. In most cases, accidental fire and paper-thin ethics exercise, these specific seals may be better suited for accident testing as dummies.
