I have to say that before watching the movie, I had little expectations of the film. All people said it was great, but I knew what they liked. They like the Aerosmith song, which is really great, they like the amazing special effects that were on the coast, the movie comedy, and of course many girls who love Affleck, who I think is really a bad actor who didn't try to be one, failed and now he's something. And all these things plus the reviews and evaluations I read on the Internet gave me the idea that the film would be a huge disappointment because I am a big fan of catwalk. Well, I am right, but at least I was ready. <br /> <br /> Film is really commercial. This has been said, but I say it again. We have more than 100 million budgets, we have romance between Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler of Hollywood, and many other famous actors who are popular in that they seldom agree to become part of a commercial film if their names are not written in capital letters on the screen. Like Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi, who are very acclaimed actors, I also really like. They can play many characters in many different films. They could improvise, they could smell funny. All in all, they could make small movies a really interesting, funny or dramatic movie, people love and always love. Such as Fargo Buscem or a simple plan - Thornton. Frankly, I am very disappointed that they participated in Armageddon. If I remember correctly, Thornton plays with people who are smart and refined. Buscemi is one of the deep core drilling team members being sent to save the world by destroying the world's asteroid. <br /> <br /> What I didn't like - well, I think I've already understood. I referred to bad factors. The story is boring, artless and silly. It is so obvious that the film depends on the effects and the dramatic end that is ridiculous. At least such films as Deep Impact and Godzilla have something special that could be considered art. At least it is not so clear that the film is made for financial purposes. In addition, all the big stars are bad. Jokes are not funny, lines are absurd and sometimes they don't make sense. Actually, I recently read that in the production Ben asked about Affleck Bay to make it easier for them to teach astronauts to drill than drillers who would become astronauts, and Bay's response was just "shut!" which is a really funny story that shows the desperation of the creators perfectly. <br /> <br /> And as you add, I'll explain why I'll give it to movie 4. Well, I like "Don't want to miss something" and I was impressed by the special effects that are probably the only good movie. The first scene is memorable. These are the only 2 good things I liked about the movie. Michael Bay is an average director, but Rock and both Bad Boys were hundreds of times better than Armageddon, which was, is and always is a big bad movie.
