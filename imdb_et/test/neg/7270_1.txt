I have been officially vomiting because of this film through my mouth. It's just terrible. Absolutely terrible. Terrible as the Nazis spread black plague. Let me explain: Ewoks speaks English. It's terrible. The villain girl looks like she's coming from future Power Rangers collections. I really want him to get up from the ground and say, "Finally! After ten thousand years I am free! It's time to conquer the Earth!" Lace ... I, I mean big bad, whatever the fuck they are ... they break a lot. Many of them look like Cryptkeeper's unified planar version. Cryptkeeper was pretty cool, but these guys were not. The only value of this movie was Paul Gleason. This film might have been better when he went to the bad guys and said, "If I have to come here again, I'll break the skull. It would have been better if one of Ewoks was played by Judd Nelson, who put his words in his mouth." As he said it. Word to it. <br /> <br /> There is no word for the film. I want to give this film two. I want it so badly. I've remembered one paragraph: The journey of this movie is a fear of inequality on all sides There is nothing happening because this film is blowing.
