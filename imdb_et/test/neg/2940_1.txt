Stop hell away from it ... No, really I'm serious - I know you think it's a fun, fun, appealing Hong Kong style B movie. I did, but trust me, it's not. In fact, the only thing that would be accurate about this description is Hong Kong, and they are only used strictly in geographical terms. <br /> <br /> Yes, Donnie Yen has driven it. Jackie Chan has a coat. Ekin Cheng, a man from Storm Riders, plays a leading role. It got vampires. It should be good - or at least fun, charming and action packed. Once again - this is not the case. <br /> <br /> I could see why this film sucks - I can cut it off, hack into tiny, trembling pieces. But where to start? There's so much hatred ... <br /> <br /> To make it easier and give this hate party some credibility, let me tell you that I am usually a big fan of the Hog Kong cinema. Harder drama things, but also lighter activities and / or comedy. In fact good movies and really cheesy. I can sit for hours with bad subtitles, joking enough to make the first graders roll their eyes. I can regard the cohesiveness of lovers as nuns as lovers and celibates, so that the average cinematographer would have a boost in his metaphoric toes. Also Hong Kong or some other origin - I love it when the film just goes from bad to bad to be good. <br /> <br /> But this - Arrgh! It's just scary, stupid, unnoticeable garbage. As far away as funny or charming it is actually painful. The activity so derived is a Bergman film that looks like a massacre of a Texas chainsaw. <br /> <br /> Why?! Why are you wasting such an opportunity? It could have been so much fun!
