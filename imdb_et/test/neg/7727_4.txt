Ad, HOTD 2 is better than Uwe Boll, which was the first, but the fact that drowning is better than cutting in life. OK OK, I'm a little tough about it, just because the Zombie movie video game customizations leave me badly. Resident Evil was fine, but its order is pure rubbish. The first HOTD was more fun than anything else; Uwe Boll saw it. And HOTD 2 was ... better? The value of entertainment was there, hot chicks were there, gore was there, but ... is that? The script, even if it was a subpar, was better than the first. But in the script, there are terribly written characters, stupid sequences of action, clichés and an end that pulls up and reaches a level of ridicule that would make Bollmeister very, very proud. But could it have been worse? <br /> <br /> HOTD 2 Star Sig Haig (Yes, Sid Haig) as a crazy doctor looking for death. As you might think, it's all sh * t. A nearby college university seems to be at the heart of the epidemic of Zombie (or Hypersapien?), And as you might expect, Commandos and two zombie scientists are trying to save the world and neutralize the problem. Their main purpose? No, it doesn't blow up. Instead, they have to get a sample of zombie blood to treat a deadly virus. Between what creates good character interactions, inadequate clichés (but hey, at least a black boy is not the first to kill), and decent looking zombies. <br /> <br /> Operation is satisfactory. Who would have thought Sticky Fingaz was a satisfying actor? Not me. Emmanuelle Vaugier and Ed Quinn are somewhat leaders. And the support cast was also satisfactory. It was all satisfactory. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> > <br /> <br /> <br /> Gore was fine. Cheap fears and even less expensive tension in this movie are almost non-existent, which is good. The sequences were foolish than f * ck, but at least there were no swords that won the zombies or the ridiculous slowing line effect. In general, this film only likes Zombie enthusiasts, arcade game fans and anyone who wants to rent a cheap horror movie over the weekend. Obviously, the third is, in the end, a hint, but I don't read it. If Uwe decides to do so. A 4.
