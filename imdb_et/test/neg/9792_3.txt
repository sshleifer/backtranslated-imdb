Based on such a book, it is impossible to make F.M. "Brothers Karamzov". Dostoevsky. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks is a great director, but this film is on a very low level. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the movie was the end. Well, let's think of the book. Finally, we are guilty of Dimitrij Karamazov. They then sent them to Siberia. Finally, Dostoevsky's famous epilogues, friends and family who are planning to save him. But this is so ... and now the film takes two more steps and shows us the illusion that ends with the escape of Dimitry and Gruschenka (I think). from a moral point of view, I am sure Dostoevsky will end the book with an open end, because on the one hand he is not guilty (Smerdjakov is a real murderer) and so he must be a free man. But on the other hand, he goes to his father to kill him so he has decided to commit a crime ... this is a moral dilemma and so the next point is an open tip ... well, real, it's not just open. <br /> <br /> William Shatner as Aljoscha Karamazov ... Sorry! -> NO !!! <br /> <br /> Other characters are good because we have to wait for this from such larger actors ... Of course, Yul Breynner as Dimitrij's excellent performance. I don't think there are many players who can play this part in a better way. <br /> <br /> But as I said at the beginning: This book is not customizable. It should never be a movie within two hours, which is impossible. I think there are some longer movies, so maybe they could do the right things ... But I just don't think this book can be customized. <br /> <br /> So - 3 Points: <br /> <br /> Great Director Richard Brooks Point <br /> <br /> Yul Brynner's Great Performance Point <br /> <br /> Finally: Point to one of the greatest writers of all time: Dostoevsky
