AVP2 is a terrible movie. The dialogue was pointless, the behavior was pathetic, it had almost no story, and you can't really say what the hell is going on in the semester because of the flaws of continuity and the hole in the plot. <br /> <br />! You still love it. Because it pushes the boundaries of gore, violence, death, destruction and chaos. They are killing a child, newborns, and unborn children in this movie. You sit there to think "Oh my God, it's nasty" And they'll surprise you when you kill a "sexy chick who's alive alive" when a predator and aliens fight in a hospital. <br /> <br /> It's like the film industry has said, "We know what we did on the first foreign Predator movie was bad, so we're doing it again, but this time we get help from psychopaths who have a living imagination." pointless and down right meaningless .... but you mean it for a while after that.
