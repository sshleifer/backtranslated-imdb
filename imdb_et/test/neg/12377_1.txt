I wish I could have voted this movie ten, so funny. If they had found it funny, I would have given ten. I have to give it to 1, but it's the funniest sweetheart you ever want to watch. View a giant blurry flash over the screen! Where does it come from? What is this? It flies, it scares, it's electric, it's on strings! This is where real personality comes from. I was about ten when I first saw it, and when Big Bird appeared on Sesame Street, I was sure they were the same!
