This is one of the most meaningful ideas in the film. Make a classic film that has been filmed. I hope nobody tries to try this technique again. In 1998, Good Will Hunting was directed by Gus Van Sant, the director of Hitchcock in 1960. What did Van Sant think of on earth? This remake isn't even close to adding the original. The few changes made here were not helpful. If you want to see "Psycho", the choice is clear. See the original. <br /> <br /> * (Four)
