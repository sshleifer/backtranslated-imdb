I went into the cinema a little scary, I came out with the angry garbage (going to the movie) I had seen. Participants, especially Travolta, should be ashamed of their participation. It is clear that the only thing in their sense was wage control, never to remember their talents and us. Travolta has to go back to making another movie, "Look, Who's Talking", when he has returned to his pre-Tarantino work. This is something when the L W Talking order is better than that. Travolta is no longer a king of hunting, but a king of corn. Michael Caine himself admitted bad films to make a payment check, Trvolta should follow suit if he has some self-respect!
