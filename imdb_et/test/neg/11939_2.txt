I really do not intend to thoroughly analyze my time, I just say that I am extremely disappointed that Catherine Zeta-Jones made a mistake to be in this absurd, pointless, full of clichés that long to die, a thoughtless pathetic trying to make a movie! There is no point in trying to find the positive aspects of this movie, as it is poor in every single way as a whole, and the saddest thing is that Zeta-Jones is so uncompromisingly drawn into clichés that it has no chance of showing even 1% of his talents! <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie even when you stay at home by the wall!
