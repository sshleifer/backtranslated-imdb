I was very excited about this movie! my expectations were under control because I read the book for the first time from the expected differences. What I did not expect were great differences. Starting with the physical presence of characters ... like the lack of tattoos by Channing Tantums n Amanda Seyfried is not a brunette lol, but I promised to go ... character development was not at all ... you had no time to love amanda seyfried character and you didn't get feel him or john when they first left ... I thought two weeks were rushing and I hated that he left first then ... he took emotional separation ... and why they changed Tim from the book ... why did they change did it to his father's brother and why they made him look so old and the film lacked this intense moment when they found out what was going on at the end i want it lol, but for those who watched it, know what i mean) and whhhyyyy ooooo wwhyyyy nad changed the end of the book ... it was heartbreaking and emotional and emphasized in Channing Tatum's decision whether they twisted it ... it just looked like a rushed end ... it was terrible ... it was so what was it most disappointed me ... the end of the book should have been exactly the same (
