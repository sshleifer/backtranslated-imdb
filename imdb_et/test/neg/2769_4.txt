The young man, beautiful Joan Woodbury (like Rita Adams) was orphaned after his "stool dove" death. As a young woman, Mrs Woodbury finds herself in a job as her murdered father's former convicted status makes Woodbury a bad business risk. Woodbury rooms with meaningful singer Linda Ware (like Donna Andrews) who advises Woodbury to get in touch with friends of old children's homes with John Archer (like Bob Elliott) and Jack La Rue (like Mickey Roman). But none of his friends can help if Woodbury is a victim of fraud, who will put him in prison. When released, Woodbury decides to give men mobile phones for their money? <br /> <br /> Named "Gangs, Inc." this is obviously a weak, cheap mobstri melodrama. However, looking at Woodbury's joy of working with lower material. He plays innocently growing sophisticated "Rita" quite convincingly; and he throws a lot of blonde whore. Woodbury must be added to the list of hidden Hollywood actors of the past. "Paper Bullets" also includes early Alan Ladd (like Jimmy Kelly or Bill Dugan). Ware, who sang "Teacher Apple" with Bing Crosby, sings a couple of comfortable 40s. But it is mainly Woodbury's exhibition. <br /> <br /> **** Paper Balls (1941) Phil Rosen ~ Joan Woodbury, Linda Ware, Alan Ladd
