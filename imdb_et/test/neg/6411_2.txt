Carrey is a good actor and he proved it "Man of the Moon" and "Uneven mind under the eternal sun". But hey, what can an actor do without a good story and proper control. He can do number 23. <br /> <br /> Bad <br /> <br /> Joel Schumacher is a poor, overrated director and he proved it in almost every movie. What he did to Batman is just a disaster, but probably Batman's movies should look good. Well, they weren't. We got Disneyland instead of Gothic and macabre. Of course "Falling Down" was great, but can you destroy the movie with Robert Duvall and Michael Douglas AND with a great script? No. You can't. <br /> <br /> And such a good actor and poor leader finally met and "Number 23" ... <br /> <br /> Ugly (23) <br /> <br /> I know it's stupid to start, but ... Fingerling's sub-block (almost half of this movie) looks exactly like an intro to another Max Payne2 chapter. VoiceOvers, your own detective story, quality of characters, even colors, mood and music, editing and mixing of sound! Maybe it works for the game, but it is definitely not a cinema. <br /> <br /> Mise en scene is so bad that it becomes funny. It's not even annoying. Carrey is walking down the stairs in the park? Why? Is it natural? No, but it looks good. Why did Suicide Blond cover the walls of her apartment with white paper? If he just wanted to kill himself? There is no logic in this, but it looks good. Guess what it is, it doesn't look good. Rather, it seems unnatural. <br /> <br /> All female characters are Flat. Why is it like that? Who cares, let's go on. <br /> <br /> Who is this fingerprint? Is there a personal eye for suicide? Hardly plausible. <br /> <br /> The scenes where Walter Sparrow claims to be with his wife on the air theater are really his best film. Instead, we get the Moulder / Scully routine. Disappointment. <br /> <br /> Interiors have no sign of people living in them except important objects (shoes, photos, etc.). Good luck. <br /> <br /> Dialogs are not so bad. But how did V.O.? Well, that's another story. "There is no such thing as destiny. There are only different choices." The captain is obvious to rescue! "The number came after Fingerling. And now it came after me." Clich√©. And so on. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the average housewife would penetrate the middle of a public building at night. Successfully and undisturbed. <br /> <br /> A dog block that pulls the main character to the cemetery. It is such an old trick and so convenient for the writer that it should have been banned. I mean it! <br /> <br /> Returns and editing similar to "what happened in the last episode of X files" is not the best way to present the most interesting part of a movie. I would like to say that this story deserves a better fate, but it is not. It's not logical. It is weak and incredible in chronological order. All the time we have developed characters who are trapped in a chain of situations that are nothing but poorly written fiction. It may be fun, but because the whole movie is dead, it is not. For many coincidences, every story is just bad. And the "mystery"? It's predictable and easy to guess. <br /> <br /> Touching reality is a great theme for a good movie, but I didn't see it in Hollywood productions. If you are interested in the subject, just look at Polanski's "Repulsion" or something from David Cronenberg, "Spider" or "A History of Violence", both of which deal with similar problems that "Number 23" wanted to show. Desired but failed.
