It's not the right story. It is a darker possible fiction due to events. It supports suicide, obsession with death, totally free thought in organized religion in general (and especially in the Anglican Church) and generally offers a nihilistic, pointless worldview that I think filmmakers intend to walk, richer in their poverty and hopelessness in their hopelessness. <br /> <br /> Bring to the trash, although it can be carried out attractively by the capable cast. The fact that someone wants to be a real renderer is a very wrong advertisement. You want a real story? Rent 'Fairy Tale'. This is a real story. See if you find any correspondence between the facts in both cases. I only found one: the girls who made the original photos were before pubescent.
