Unthinkable has happened. Having seen it a few years ago, I have had a movie that has been my horror and was called "McCinsey Island". Family adventure movie with Hulk Hogan and Grace Jones (I don't do it), it went into the new depths of film making and is still the only movie I've seen that made me think what the film's budget might have been spent. Like new schools or cancer treatments. At the same time, for each film's thin and unobtrusive level, you should lower your standards even lower if they want to fight for the "Guest House Paradiso", distinguishing it from being one of the worst movies I've ever had to watch. <br /> <br /> This film introduces us to the two biggest losers who are loosely surrounding the "Bottom" TV show. Richard (Rik Mayall) is a hotel manager, as friendly as anyone you can imagine and so complicated to almost mucus from every activity. His friend Eddie (directed by Adrian Edmondson) is an alcoholic waste of human life and together they try to lead Britain's worst hotel on a rock beside a nuclear power plant. Between them, they coincide at regular intervals with comic violence (sound effects), stealing something far from valuable or interesting fools who are there and stare at every woman at all. The plot, as it is, is accompanied by the arrival of the Italian screen goddess Gina Carbonara (Vincent Cassel), who flees from her wedding and tries to stay at the guesthouse Paradiso at low, Richie and Eddie's surprise. And ... that's it. <br /> <br /> I thought that Carry On's films are bad for the UK film industry and God knows we've spent so much time and money trying to get this god out of this terrible legacy. We've had films like "Trainspotting", "28 Days Later", "Four Weddings and Funeral" and the brilliant "Shaun Of The Dead" (also starring Simon Pegg), but ... ... drags those movies that scream and hit back to the top of James James and Barbara Windsor who flew with a bicycle whistle. "Paradiso" is so ambitious that it offends you the moment you watch it. I looked, I waited for the jokes to start, but they never came. Just an endless trap, which is explanations, unimaginable scenarios, little amusing violence with pans and fridge doors, and almost nothing that enhances the smile. Come the first advertising break (it was on television, you see) and I was ready to turn off, but my loyal responsibilities to you, my readers, kept me. "I look at it so they don't have to" become my mantra, so you better remember how much you owe me, because it was about as much fun as sand strikes my eye and forced to feed dog food <br /> < br /> Trust me, I loved "bottom" TV shows. The combination of Mayall and Edmondson with the OTT minor humor worked every week for half an hour. Certainly not one and a half hours like Edmondson and Mayall themselves in their small private jokes and suffering and pushing the rest of the audience. Frankly, this makes Mayall "Drop Dead Fred" seem like "Godfather" and if you were to meet one of these two people (who are quite alone responsible for the chaos that shows it is a movie), you are free to quickly deliver your testicles. They will probably enjoy it. Pegg and Bill Nighy (both as hotel guests) are pulled off by this drowning ship, but at least they survived. Mayall and Edmondson should not be so happy. Chernobyl film equivalent and should be avoided as such.
