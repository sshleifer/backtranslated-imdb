Everyone knows the so-called plot, so let me cut the chase. <br /> <br /> Forced. Failed performers work hard to make you fun. The stylish Meryl Streep gives her an excellent test. Pierce Brosnan is just embarrassing. Inexplicably on the Greek island. Many blasting women. Much. <br /> <br /> It was a stupid juke-box music scene, now it's a big, splashy, badly shot juke box. If you like ABBA, then. If not, attack against the senses and insult any intelligence you get out of the theater. I admit that I didn't really want to see this movie and with the friends who did it, but because of God's love. Why does my sex guilt pass on with joy? Have you ever sat at a table with women who have had too much to drink and who have absolutely decided to have a great evening in town? This is the feeling of the whole project. It just seemed as good as it stopped.
