On the light side it ended. This is the only thing this film has naturally been to. <br /> <br /> This is the worst film I've ever seen, and I've seen some bad things. This movie is actually so terrible, I went and changed my rating to the children of the living dead for 2 not to be a Raptor. <br /> <br /> Official one-layer rating: "Come with me for another movie if you want to live."
