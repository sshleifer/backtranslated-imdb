It seemed to me that the trailers were better than the movie. They did their job and made me interesting. Interest fell early. Simple assumption on the terrain. Five men wake up in a chemical store without knowing why they are there; not to mention how they arrived in hell. Confusion and paranoia lead to fear and distrust. Men learn that the kidnappers are on their way to killing his hostages. Now the size of men is trying to differentiate each other when everyone is a victim and who can actually be one of the robbers. Jim Caviezel, Greg Kinnear, Joe Pantoliano, Bridget Moynahan, Barry Peppper, David Selby and Adam Rodriguez are cast.
