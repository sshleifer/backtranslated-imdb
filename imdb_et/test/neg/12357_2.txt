I saw it this morning bored Sunday morning. Well I pulled out the fact that it's out of the movie .. I was hoping to find some nice landscapes, but that's the views where it's just limited. They just go back and forth on the same spot again. I hate it when they use this so-called high-tech product like the Motorola blue-toothed headset they use to eliminate the use of the radio call that was just as funny. They look like amateurs. And if they want to promote laptops that require poorly designed aliens that could connect people to the satellite. I couldn't say more about this TV movie. use of helicopters and the like. * / **********
