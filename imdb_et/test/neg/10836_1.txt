Killer Flood: The Day of Damn Broke: 1/10: Finally a movie titled Spoiler. Even because of the low standards of catastrophic films, excuse me for correcting myself, even if there are low standards for TV disaster films that are really terrible. Where do I start? <br /> <br /> The Damide modeler may have ever seen an oak photo, but I doubt it. Most of the dams, especially large dams, are oh. I don't know a nearby power plant, some gateway gates that flow through, even a high-voltage power cord or two. <br /> <br /> Oak is also a bit inadequate. Two, consider them, two employees employees across the dam, all three shifts. And the workers were apparently imported from the double film of the two clich√©s because they heroically and rather unnecessarily have long been eulogized to death scenes with photos of grandchild rennes. Heck that one of them manages to defeat themselves in a way that does not describe the description. <br /> <br /> Special effects consist of flowing water, which is located in the city's photographs method, which makes the 60's Godzilla film look like a Matrix. A three-year drawing with a blue crayon would have produced better results. Since the disaster money shots are worthless, how is the rest of the movie? Needless to say, the script and the operation follow special effects. It's not a rough diamond. It's tough. Is that guilty? Killer Flood is horrible enough to create some laughs and the film has this serious incompetence that makes a good classic of the cult, but bad catastrophic films have to age as good wine. (Avalanche, Swarm, Meteor) It is also doubtful that Michelle Green will ever hide a golden Henri Trash bin from a large Henry Fonda, who is looted by raisins, which should be killer bees. Check back with me in 2024.
