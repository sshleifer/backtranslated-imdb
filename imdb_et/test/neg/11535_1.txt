I absolutely hated this movie. Though the film wanted to convey some kind of social message, it was done in a clich√© and melodramatic sense like the Mexican soap opera. <br /> <br /> The actor was also terrible, especially Charityn and his son. This is one of the problems of dominant films, they use celebrities that can't even attract the mass. <br /> <br /> I am even more ashamed of the positive assessments that, unfortunately, mean that the Dominicans are just what is happening here, rather than giving honest and critical opinions that will help our film industry rely on quality.
