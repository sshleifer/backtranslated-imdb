I'm a big fan of the "Holiday" franchise and I love Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie, and at least a few back scenes were involved in this project (especially Matty Simmons, who produced or filled - all 4 theaters and "Animal House"). For these reasons I thought this TV spin off might be worth a look, even without Chevy Chase. <br /> <br /> Record, I didn't expect it to be very good; I thought it might be a little amusing deviation. That's why my high level of disappointment proves how bad this film's complete movie is really. It was pointless, jaw-dropping, heart-stopping, head-exploding. But somehow I couldn't see it. This is my disease; I don't seem to go to the movie or give up on TV shows before the movie ends. Nothing ever happened to me that I would like to get more than two hours of my life back than this movie.
