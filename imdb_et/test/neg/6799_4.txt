Bizarre. This film should be based on a famous photographer, but everything that happens in this movie is fiction. I think it is trying to explain why Diane Arbus had a strange and wonderful focus on her photography. In the movie, wolfman moves to the apartment from above. He seems to be obsessed with him and falls for him. She puts her children and her husband on a wolf and even tries to add her to her family events. Some wolfman freaks come from and visit the exhibition sites. The whole thing is very strange. <br /> <br /> FINAL: Nothing memorable. There is something strange about a woman who gets her hound from shaving her wolf. I think you'll find better movies.
