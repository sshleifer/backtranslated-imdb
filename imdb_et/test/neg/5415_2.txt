This movie tries to cut off Predator, but this movie is much better. This movie is really terrible special effects and a pointless plot. The crew that enters the forest to find the reason for the loss of the army and the scientist is combined with harsh and harsh men's delta commands and beautiful but harsh female riders. None of them are too bright. All the characters seem to be more than ready to go alone in the forest and first the spear or the sword and their death. Some pyrotechnics are very large and have to pay a bundle. But close-ups of the creature are ridiculous as most death scenes. Every piano used by the writers was used. If you are looking for a meaningless killing festival, it can fill the bill. At night, which I watched, it was very slow, so I sat through the whole thing. I have to admit that it has been a while since I looked at something like that. There's very little to redeem this movie. I'm surprised that this kind of spam is received.
