I'll give him 2, because it's a beautiful Mediterranean Greece, otherwise it would be 1. When Nicholas Cage came with his first lines, I thought he was just joking. Cage like italian ?? I'm sorry, but the very wrong actor acting is also BAD, not to mention his Italian accent. The story is very loose, it could have been good, but with other participants and probably other scenarios. The camera is great, including photography, but why do you hell Nicholas Cage and Penelope Cruz for that role? Please don't get me wrong, I have nothing against Cage, he has some very good movies, but he's probably not for every role. It is a pity that the cast was not better because the story is potential.
