Words can't describe how this movie is terrible. Well, maybe they will. I'll take it: 1 - Pitiful. Hollywood makes more talking animals in graphics. You probably no longer need a script and a storyline. <br /> <br /> 2 - Violent. Children's film, but one of these characters is being attacked and killed brutally. <br /> <br /> 3 - Dumbfounded. The film actually represents farm animals as human abilities. Nemos can talk about fish, but mostly they are still fish. We only hear English as a translation. In Barnyard, animals speak English so other people understand it. <br /> <br /> 4 - Unintelligent - No smart story line or even smart humor. (Ok, the 13-year-old dog on the crutches was funny). <br /> <br /> 5 - Culturally Sensitive - "Black" Cow is actually a black actor. Pink cow plays with white actress. The black cow played a stereotyped black person. <br /> <br /> 6 - Unknown - There is no such thing as a man cow I knew. I believe we call them bulls? If we are going to get our children, this can also be the truth of the simplest facts. My 4-year-old had left us in 45 minutes. She's almost asleep. <br /> <br /> I am sure this film will make millions, which is unfortunate because it proves to Hollywood manufacturers just that the American public is just full of mammals waiting to pay 8 bucks just to get peace and quiet from children for an hour or so. two. An unfortunate situation. Why producers should spend the real money if the return is the same.
