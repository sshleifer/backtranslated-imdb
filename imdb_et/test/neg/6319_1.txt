The light-minded NY lawyer (George Segal) is slowly crazy. He promised his father his death bed so he would never send his elder mother (Ruth Gordon) to a nursing home. Years later, he takes care of an ancient, dangerous psychopath. She meets a beautiful sister (Trish Van Devere) and falls in love. But her mother scares her away. Segal is ready to kill him .... <br /> <br /> Ummmm ... This is comedy? I have nothing against sick, black humor, but come ... there must be some limits! This movie goes out to throw every tasteless sick joke that he can think and rub. Too bad is not funny. Jokes include rape, nudity, public humiliation, aging of the elderly, swearing and racism. Basically, it's a movie that thinks it's wise to try to shock people and think they're laughing. I was disgusting and never laughing. The film is sick, annoying and (surprisingly) boring. Cast is the only thing that watched me. Segal and Gordon were both excellent in their roles - especially Gordon. And Van Devere is pretty good. But the script is against them. The only interesting thing (not funny) was a pointless courtroom scene with Rob Reiner Jr (and tried to see his wife Penny Marshall as a spectator). <br /> <br /> In fact, this movie could have been worse - at the end, Segal was in bed with her mother and pretended she was poppa! It was (fortunately) changed. <br /> <br /> True sad, sick movie. At the bottom of the barrel. I'll give her 1.
