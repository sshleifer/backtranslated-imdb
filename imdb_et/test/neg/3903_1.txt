The only reason I rented a movie was to see Jeri Ryan! OMG, the most boring, pointless movie I've ever seen! HOW LAME !!! I really mean, give me a break! After Voyager I hope he will be offered better roles !! <br /> <br /> When I was one of the last people on earth, I still do not live in a dessert traveling coach! It's just such a bad movie! The Indian tribe and how he compared it every 10 seconds is really old. Poor Jeri, better next time!
