I was glad that my favorite comic book hero is on television ... and I was very disappointed with the end result. <br /> <br /> The only "amazing" thing was to crawl the wall (despite being visible). cable). I didn't think Nick Hammond was Peter Parker ... and he was visibly from other buildings than the one who made the twilight in a spider suit. You can say that they were two different actors. <br /> <br /> Also in today's Spider-Man movies, when I watch Tobey Macguiret and when I watch CGI. But it has been trained in the eyes and experience with CGI. However, the 70s version would have been better despite the lack of a special FX. <br /> <br /> Webs were hockey and looked like ropes that seemed to be around things rather than sticking them. And what was it to give him a spider to ride with the mobile. Hi? He's a web slinger. <br /> <br /> Sorry ... did not want to work so well, but our beloved wall-crawler was worth better.
