I agree with what many others have said about the low and offensive nature of racism research. It is amazing to me that so many people seem to be disappointed with his pretentiousness. I want to comment on Matt Dillon's character, which is an example of what is most sharp about this movie. Here we have a man who - as opposed to the message underlying the film that "we are all LITTLE racist" - rapes a woman publicly, cruelly reduces her husband and deliberately deliberately moves it as she knows well, leading her to arrest or even death. He does all this after pulling the pair for no legal reason, but since we understand they are black and rich and he is a painful little boy who is now a police and can therefore do what he wants. This behavior is not LITTLE racist. This behavior is bad. I'm worried that this extreme of racism is aside from the behavior of another character - he talks about the paranoid stereotype of gang violence - to show everyone is LITTLE racist. Later, we eat a spoonful of Dillon's poor old father and how black people were driving in a poor house. Should it explain or, worse, apologize for this behavior? And was Dillon's character to be redeemed by devoting a completely unmotivated and unbelievable, ridiculously casual act that saved the woman he had sexually attacked before? Please. The fact that so many people feel some kind of self-blessing admiration for this film makes me saddle our understanding of racism and its obvious commitment to condemning and ending it.
