Yes, I know half a dozen other observers have called this movie "Copying Amadeus", but it can't be said enough. The scenes seemed to be lifted straight from Milos Forman's manuscript, which has only superficial changes. You can expect to see: <br /> <br /> - Maestro's lofty scene ("I'm God's voice. Everything else is useless!") <br /> <br /> Maestro's fun mediocre work (with raspberries) and simulated abdominal bloating, like Amadeus) <br /> <br /> Mediocre Composers Dialogue with God ("Why did you instill me in music but don't let me compose?") <br /> <br /> - Music dictation on a death bed scene ( "Common time. Start with the violin ... cough cough") <br /> <br /> - and the list goes on ... <br /> <br /> The problem is even worse. Not only were these scenes shamelessly copied, but even very well. Jeepers, if you want to cut the original, you should at least try to improve it in your creative way. <br /> <br /> Wait, nothing worse. This is the fact that the director tried to capture Mozart's story of Beethoven's story. People, Beethoven was not a crass, a vulgar slob, how this film depicts him. In addition, Beethoven's foolish idiot, who refers to his copy, was a 23-year-old music student. Unfortunately, such films are responsible for grinding history. And another thing, Beethoven (in real life) never called it "Moonlight Sonata," as he does in the movie. This name was given by a confusing critic who a few years after BEETHOVEN DIED, and unfortunately it was closed. But Beethoven's original title was "Quasi una Fantasia". <br /> <br /> AND OTHER SETTINGS when Beethoven (in the movie) shouts "B-flat! B-flat! B-flat!" and hitting the piano, he captures the white key! <br /> <br /> AND SECOND QUESTION !!! Beethoven (in real life) was completely deaf for several years before his 9th symphony. This movie shows him that he has barely little disability (saying "what?" On every other line, just enough to be annoying). <br /> <br /> AAAND !! NO !!! THINGGGG ... !! American Accents ...! Ah nothing. Just ... never. I've wasted enough time for that. Go to Amadeus again. If you want to see an interesting biology of Beethoven's life, see "Immortal Beloved," which takes poetic freedoms, but at least they are interesting ideas. Finally, if you want to see something on lighter sides, see "Impromptu", a movie about Chopin. But in addition to these three, I have never seen a classic composer with good respect.
