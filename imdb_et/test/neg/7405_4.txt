Since I am a fan of hospital and medical exhibitions, I have found one thrilling and sometimes humorous (especially Dr. Whitman's scene) that brings a little lighter relief. But I waited for the last episode because I was expecting the bad to be punished and the good ones restored. Instead, hospital management makes themselves incredibly stupid and gets worse and worse for the good. You can't help thinking about what the trade unions are doing or whether Rob, Donna and Maria do not know which trade unions exist? Besides, he has never seen the exterior, the trees, the grass, the somewhat oppressive sunlight. Someone realized what the last words were? that is, Rob Lake gave Mrs Strawberry a question to the children: "Why do you tell us all this?" It was very frustrating that he couldn't understand it.
