Possible Spoilers As Peter Jackson has so excellently shown in his "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, it is quite possible to make good films, even great, in the heroic fantasy genre. The genre has distinguished literary predecessors from medieval romances, especially Arthur's legends, to which Tolkien and other authors have drawn. The Lord of the Rings is separate from each other, but it is hard to think of some other sword and witchcraft that is good. I agree with the reviewer who said that the bad bunch was Ron Howard's "Willow" and even that it did not become anything but a mediocre film as a positive bad. "Red Sonja", however, cannot achieve a more modest distinction simply from a bad movie, not from an amazing one. <br /> <br /> Like "Willow", many "Red" primer elements. Sonja is derived from "Lord of the Rings". The evil ruler tries to overcome the supernatural artefact to achieve the ambition of world domination, but the choice is blocked by a group of heroes. The film, set in the era of Hybor, which is a barbaric era in the distant past, begins with a piece of offender, the evil Queen Gedren, making undesirable sexual advances to Heroine Son. If they are rejected, Gedren (not a woman who does not respond) will respond by killing Sonja's parents and brother. (In 1985, it was believed that not only was the main woman a woman, but also one of the main motives for her poor disappointed lesbian lust). <br /> <br /> Gedren's next move is to capture Talisman, a magical-powered fluorescent green soccer ball, killing the little dressed female priesthood, whose job it is to protect it as they destroy it, because they feel its authority has changed too much dangerous. Sonja's sister, her only surviving relative, is dead. However, Sonja himself has not been idle, but has enrolled in the martial arts academy, where he ends the amount of cum laude and tries to release himself. Along with Kalidor, he is a heroic magician who remembers Tolkin's Aragorn, Prince Tarn, the king's ruled child who has fallen to the Gedren authorities, and Falkon, the loyal servant of Tarni. The rest of the film is quite predictable, because Sonja and his allies are trying to overthrow Gedren and prevent the world from being destroyed by the uncontrollable Talisman. <br /> <br /> Just what makes a movie so bad? Well, actor, at first. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is Kalidor, gives a kind of typical wooden poker performance that became his trademark, at least at the beginning of his career, with heavy foreign power. Compared to heroine Brigitte Nielsen, she looks like Laurence Olivier. It seems that Miss Nielsen has had even more difficult language problems by giving each line a mechanical, unt toned voice that has just completed the lesson “Teach-Self-English-Correspondence”. One wonders whether he was hired to make Arnie look good in comparison. Other characters who are not engaged in their private struggle against English are simply cartoons, especially Prince Tarn, who must be one of the most unpleasant youngsters ever. <br /> <br /> Even worse than bad behavior is the almost complete lack of imagination in the movie. This is a particularly striking mistake in the fantasy film, as the films in this genre must rely on their imagination to persuade viewers to stop the natural feelings of belief that are provoked by a fantastic plot. When we look at Peter Jackson's masterpiece, we can convince at least the next three hours that we are in the Middle East, that there are elves, wizards and hobbies, and that the fate of the world really depends on the magic circle. When we look at "Red Sonja", we have convinced us, except that we look at a number of actors who have bad accents that are fighting against each other in a mountain green to manage green football. <br /> <br /> Imagination begins even with a movie title. British scientific writer Brian Aldiss, who had challenged his characters' exotic names, replied that there was no point in creating a fictional foreign culture with its own characteristic culture if you were going to call a hero Joe. . (True, Tolkien was able to <br /> <br /> get the name Sam to one of his main characters, but it was because Hobbits had to be calmly familiar, the Central Earth equivalent of two, the tube-men of English). Similarly, the story tells the hero of a long-term barbaric common name for girls like "Sonia" (that is, the name "Sonja" is pronounced) about as suitable as being called "Betty" or "Mary-Jane." br /> The film seems to have been made with a very small budget that makes me think about why they were struggling at all, fantasy must be made convincingly or not at all. like Talisman's temple or Gedren's palace are probably cheap kits. We find out that Gedren has destroyed Tarni's capital using Talisman's power, but we don't really see this event, everything we see is what might be a thunderstorm that first do not know how Sonja intends to destroy the whole kingdom with just a few allies, but when you see how small the army is at Gedren's disposal, it becomes more understandable. the thunderstorm threatens to destroy the palace, then you do not know if it is a workman or simply a crew member who involuntarily inclines. If we can't enjoy this movie, we can enjoy it at least with deliberate humor; a good example of a bad, funny film making school. Ed Wood would have been proud of it. If it were on California television night before the recall, Gray Davis would still be a governor. 2/10.
