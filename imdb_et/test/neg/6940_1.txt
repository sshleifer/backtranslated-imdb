I've never thought the film could regret me to order a HBO service. Now I know better! Jack is usually one of my favorite actors, but not even he could save that part. Not that he tried. Jack plays his usual Eastwick character. Unfortunately, it's not going over the southwest of America. He's just as credible as a cowboy desperado like Pee Wee Herman. There is no edge to the show, and for this reason the comedy fails. He's almost silly. The rest was worse. Scheduling the transmission of lines is probably something that the leading lady was not perfect in 1978, and others seemed just happy. My suggestion to those who want to see this movie is that you save your valuable time to see the color dry.
