I only saw it because my 10-year-old was bored. He and his friend hated it, but of course they liked the movies. This is the first time I have been disapproved of Ebert for many years. It is not recommended to recommend this movie. Willis is good, as always. But the story smells, is incredible, there is no real story, no action, no interesting cinematic sequences, no surprises, and the worst thing is that the child's star is a thoroughly suppressing hunger that ensures that every parent who is not dead is turned off fat slob the baby. First of all, stay away and save your child - if you don't want to punish him. There is no excuse for this terrible management or writing, and hopes that these filmmakers will suffer accordingly.
