What gives Anthony Minghell the right to destroy two extraordinary fiction books? He first destroyed an English patient that was bad enough, but now I find he is in the Cold Mountain - butchered meat industry !!! <br /> <br /> I had such a strange reaction to an English patient. My son and I went to see this first weekend when it appeared, and I was so disappointed, but I told my son that I felt I had to read the book. I went straight to Barnes and Noble, bought it, read and tried to find out what the critics in the world are saying when they said that Minghella had entrusted enough of the film's public intelligence to give them a great movie. He certainly didn't. <br /> <br /> I usually don't read much about fiction, but Cold Mountain was so highly recommended by friends that I felt compelled to read it. I didn't see Cold Mountain, the movie he was playing in theaters, and that was what Minghella had done to an English patient. But like a fool, I rented it today and I'm so upset that I have to frustrate and most of all saddle that someone could have taken this beautiful story and design something almost as beautiful. on the screen, and now they can never. <br /> <br /> READ THE BOOK AND READ THE FILM NOW. The Minghella project never takes me. I think he can be one of the worst directors working today and I'm tired of a Hollywood heap over his head. There must be no one in Hollywood anymore. This movie is not like the book, except for the names of the characters. The Minghella ego does not know the boundaries, and if he does not like the book, he did not write the original script and left the book alone. Even if I hadn't read the book, I consider this film to be one of the worst I've seen since 2003; and I've seen almost everything that has appeared in the US for viewing. <br /> <br /> Elaine, you don't want it either.
