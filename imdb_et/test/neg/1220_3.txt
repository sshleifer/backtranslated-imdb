Jaws rip off is the most difficult of all Italian "genres" and director Joe D'Amato is second only to the big Jess Franco trash production stakes. Put the two together and what do you get? Of course, this is a giant trash. Unfortunately, it is also not a good word trash, because Deep Blood offers more boredom than fun. For movie credit, it actually strives for something that borders the plot; but take that credit away from the movie - the plot is a garbage. It has something to do with a group of friends who take the oath (friendship) and then some Indian curses that manifest themselves in shark. Or at least I think it happened. Anyway, most of the movie is burned out of boring dialogue and "drama", and the shark itself - which doesn't let you forget - is the only thing we really want to see - it's just a messenger. Or not even that, because most sharks are actually merchandise footage! Despite being a garbage bin, there are actually many fun jaws; But with that, Joe D'Amato has made it clear that he couldn't even try and the result is what must be the slowest Italian shark movie. Avoid this.
