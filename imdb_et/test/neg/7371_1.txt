The film in a beautiful environment filmed in an interesting and sensitive time, where it was possible to present terribly trivial and clich√© output, extremely clumsy script, poor continuity, intrusive sushhy music, sugar pain and hot action. <br /> <br /> It was between the script and the actors, which was worse. The script probably won - the historical background, background and character descriptions were in painful detail in the dialogue. .. actually words can't describe quite how bad this film is. <br /> <br /> Before the preload, the mass exodus was about thirty minutes. laughs out loud. I should add that I am Francophile, Canada is fascinated and I love a historical film. It was really one.
