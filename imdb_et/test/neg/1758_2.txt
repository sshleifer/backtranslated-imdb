His enameled appearance was totally inappropriate for the role. His face was too white, too much hair, clothes and the like were too clean (and well suited, especially the dad's old hat and coat where Inman comes home) for any accuracy. It would be one thing if the production would have allowed all the other participants to stay clean and perfect, but he was the only one who didn't get confused. His powdered cheek never had any stain. Do we believe he was the only person in a civil war with a bath and mirror? He seemed the only one who used them. Tweezers; What are their eyebrows? He looked at absolute thinking! <br /> <br /> The story of love was incredible. He only went to the man because someone told him he said he thought he was cute. So, he's over to tease him, then flirt with him a couple of times, and maybe this love is parallel to Odysseus and Penelope? Please. <br /> <br /> I should have felt better if I expected something better from the man who brought us the "English patient". My reaction to this was the same as Elaine's Seinfeld: "It suckled."
