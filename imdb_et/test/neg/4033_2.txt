Watching this movie surprised me. I've never found that we would stop watching the movie as a whole, because 3 dollars for renting a movie is a good amount of money and I know I should at least look at the whole thing and get my money. I did this in about 30 minutes of this absolutely dirty movie when I thought I was a little worse after watching this movie. I can't believe that the director and participants of this movie actually had such low esteem to allow it to be released! There is nothing to say that other reviewers have not said this, but even the worst films usually have one or two decent performances ... not in this pathetic piece of garbage. I've seen the high school playing better. Everyone and I think every "actor" is incredibly bad and what is truly amazing is the unity of evil ... gosh, this must be the director. Where did they get these people? <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. Although it is amusing because of its ridiculous script and even because of weaker operations, and I use this term very loosely, it is unfortunate that this movie was not sent to B movie hell forever. What could have been a good idea has destroyed a very low budget, bad sound and effects and actors who apparently got their wings on television with children and poor children's television. <br /> <br /> Please leave this movie behind. Not even worth your time.
