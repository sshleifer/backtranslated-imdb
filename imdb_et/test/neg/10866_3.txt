Larry Bishop is 60 years old, dirty and not beautiful YET in this movie, as he is among the drugs in his twenties. <br /> <br /> Many films are said to be sexist, but if they are in the film it deserves this title. <br /> <br /> I can't even read how many breasts this movie showed, probably more than an hour when Larry Bishop spent writing a script. <br /> <br /> The script is ridiculous, the bishop and his gang claim, bicycle, party, sex, kill people, and the next day they claim cycling, party, sex, people kill and the third day. /> <br /> I like ERIC BALFOUR and, given what he was supposed to do, he did quite well, like Comanche. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie is the character of Larry Bishop's Pistolero, who is so one-dimensional. He's not even funny. <br /> <br /> He is also a terrible actor and apparently he never wanted to drive himself, but all he asked did not say what he was? When he realized that he was starting to lead himself, he probably wrote the script again so that he could touch more women. <br /> <br /> Although it is visually visual, at least biker scenes and Eric Balfour are not half bad this movie is just a big mess. I hope you never see Larry bishop again in front of the camera.
