The film quickly reaches a large tracing site with increasing destruction. The first really bad thing is that Steven Seagal's hijacking would be beaten during Seagle's ride, but probably the whole premise of the movie would have ended. <br /> <br /> They seem to have decided to make a change in the movie, so just plan to enjoy it and don't wait for a single plot. Turn off any logic that you may have, which will reduce your chances of getting a headache. <br /> <br /> I am hoping that Steven Seagal will try to move back to the type of characters he has shown in more popular films.
