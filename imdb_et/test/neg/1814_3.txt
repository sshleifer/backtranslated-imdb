Overall, "The Heart of Darkness" was sad when compared to the book. Anyone who has ever read the book and understood it enough would be able to see countless obvious mistakes. There is an immense difference between the two. It seems to me that the director was losing in battle. I could not imagine that someone would accept the re-establishment of the "Heart of Darkness". It would be impossible to interpret the tremendous detail and magic of the story justifiably. Conrad's story was so many layers and depths that it would be pointless to try visual interpretation. First, storing story details is unattainable. Colossal fine points created by Joseph Conrad cannot be rightly restored through the film. Marlow's feelings and emotions cannot be interpreted in the same way in the film. If you have accepted the tremendous task of solving Conrad's work, you know as well as I do that Conrad wrote only half of that story. An additional side is a series prepared by the reader. You, as a reader, must be able to derive and unite the ideas of Joseph Conrad. As a result, most important details are not present in the film. <br /> <br /> Although the film was long enough, the film seemed short. It seems that Conrad was able to pack much more on 75 pages if the film could be packed in an hour and a half. The speed of the movie kept the audience from learning the signs. Marlow was a lot more stranger. The book's perspective puts you in Marlow's shoes. But in the film you are looking at Marlow at a distance. I started thinking that the director was trying to use the same "reading between lines" method as Conrad did. However, the connections were weak. I know that if I hadn't read this book, I would not be able to understand the depth of the situation and the characters in any way. wrong. His role was short and details were not all involved. It was not possible to understand the actual Kurtz as long as it was shown. It was an important detail in the book that Kurtz had become a god of Africans. I didn't think important details would be defined. Also in the book, Kurtz represented a breathless being. He had been dead for a long time. I believe the director understood this detail. But instead of rebuilding it, he was just around the corner of the Kurtz moor and all. Besides, the referee seemed to think the Kurtz player was without a doubt. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me of teenage cramming to finish a research project. day. It looks like it's done easily and hardly at any time. The characters were alienated, important details were omitted and the central plot disappeared in general.
