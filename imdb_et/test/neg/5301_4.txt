I really liked Get Shorty, but this movie was completely another disappointment. First, Travolta is in no way like Chili Palmer's Get Shorty. He just completed the performance as he did in all his latest films. He is not completely smooth or has a mobile presence above him that puts you in the movie. It seems that Travolta pulled out of the bed and decided he had to act in this movie. The plot was simply not exciting or wise, there wasn't really much to come up with, the only thing that reminded me of entertainment was to look at Christina Millian and The Rock was funny. But still, a long story short, this movie was a trash and I had to force me to get through it.
