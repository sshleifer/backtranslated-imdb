Guys, what can I tell you? I'm Bulgarian. I don't remember how many times I talk to the Americans and not to mention that they have no idea where Bulgaria is, but they say things like, "There's a war, right?" or "I've never imagined people in a place like Bulgaria having access to the Internet". Go see Bruce Campbell's "Man with a Screaming Brain". I was curious about this movie because 1) I am a fan of Bruce Campbell - "Evil Dead" trilogy and "Brisco County Jr. 2) The film was completely captured in Bulgaria, the second after" Alien Apocalypse ", which is also almost unobtrusive. 3) I enjoy nice B movies <br /> <br /> Well ... The movie shows our country like an endless gypsy city where they rob your car, waves around illegal weapons, and you can kill every moment. "Bull $ h1t Bulgaria" is more than offensive. Ted Raimi and Stacy Ceach are doing an excellent team, Bruce is doing his special - winning himself and that's all. There's nothing to see here. <br /> <br /> Peoeple gives it movie 10 just because Bruce has the status of a cult, but it doesn't deserve more than 3. Movie waste.
