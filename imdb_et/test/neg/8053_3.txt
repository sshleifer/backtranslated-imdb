Director Todd Verow's unexpected appeal to a sentimental result results in a predictable outcome: there is nothing new to see. Attractive, but not convincing leaders - what should be in the high school? - I think it is not the best way to investigate anonymous promise, which was equally independent, but also honest, raw, and not all, which is disgusting to confuse the adolescent sexuality. I have no idea what to do about this drab and uninspirit from another movie when I hope Verow finds another career. Of course, this is modest, but so is Mike Huckabee. about this movie. When I saw it and heard it in the theater, I would have walked out. Fortunately, I can scratch and silence my laptop.
