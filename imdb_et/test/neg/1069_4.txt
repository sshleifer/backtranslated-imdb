I'm sure some people will enjoy it and find it powerful or have some personal connection with characters and story, but from an impartial point of view it's not very well done. The film revolves around atypical nervous youth, each playing a different stereotype that makes us believe it's like a teenager. We see a little bit of every teenage lifestyle, but the whole project was so pretentious on me whether it was a constant low-angle tree in the winds of trees, or black-and-white "interviews" with students, there was nothing new or original in this movie, and I didn't have to see anything. Yes, it deals with some strong substance and dramatic scenes are played and performed well, but the whole project seems to be unnecessary, especially if it seems to be an almost exact copy of Van Sant 'Elephant (one dealing with suicide, second schooling). As I said, some people will probably enjoy it and the director / writer was obviously inspired to make this movie on the basis of a close death, so it's nice that the film is made with some heart, but I feel it is incredibly ineffective and material that is so easy to do something original. I don't recommend this movie.
