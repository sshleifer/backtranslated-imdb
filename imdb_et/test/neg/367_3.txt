I'm so disappointed. After waiting for three years for repetitions / DVD for the original "Darkplace", I couldn't wait for this series. The first episode ended and I'm terrible. Everything that was great about Darkplace has been deleted here, pretty much. The worst introduction: canned laughter. it takes its starting point and makes it almost invisible. (one of the fun of Garth's sight who is fertilizing the audience was good ... the rest I hardly remember ...) it looks like it's a bad quality "Knowing me, knowing you." I hope it will improve if the series continues, otherwise I'm seriously disappointed. back "Darkplace ..." <br /> <br /> "You are the most compassionate man I've ever known. And I know God ..."
