Did we all see the same movie ??? I can't believe some other others will give this truly terrible bio that they believed or not, the Shirley Temple itself promised on its CHILD STAR book. Give me the feeling that some are terribly simple. <br /> <br /> First of all, ASHLEY ROSE ORR, regardless of its modest talents, does not in any way shape or shape even Shirley's temple, which would be sufficiently cast in the biography of the world's most famous child's star. He does not give any information as to why or how this child was respected, except because he was trying hardest to do Shirley's personalization, which at some point clicks. Not at all. <br /> <br /> And this is the main drawback of the whole piece. But as it is not bad enough, Shirley's story of climbing almost in the night-time drama is a completely white and subtle letter, characterized by occasional moments of singing and dancing, not even what Shirley did (like "The Codfish Ball"). with Buddy Ebsen, probably the highest point of Shirley's choreographic dance routines. <br /> <br /> Just put the polka into the spotlight in her Shirley temple. None of Shirley's own brand of charm, heat and appeal is far from recommended. Everything we see on the screen is a pale imitation of the original that proves once and for all that the Shirley Temple was just one. <br /> <br /> This confusion is worth nothing. None of the other non-living roles is more than normal. My advice to fans of Shirley is reading your book - or better yet - watching your movies. <br /> <br /> It's mines.
