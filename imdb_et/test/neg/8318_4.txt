I'm very disappointed because I was expecting a real ride, as promised in many reviews. The script is very bad with many holes and directions. The director could not fully develop every violent scene with excitement and difference. Following the Wannabe thriller is trying to be very difficult. That's why I had to look at how each bullet was spent without giving me any idea. I always asked which movie I was watching. Then I didn't like him smoking one cigarette one after another, but perhaps the film was partly supported by the tobacco industry. The end is also very disappointing. I don't understand how Jodie Foster could have called the Golden Globe the worst role in her life. Jodie, so I liked the great PANIC ROOM or FLIGHT PLAN. This is certainly one of the worst I've ever seen. 4/10.
