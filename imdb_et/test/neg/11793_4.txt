I understand why people hate this movie. And I hated the Blair witch project, so go? It's about the same stage as it gets and yes they offend your intelligence, trying to make it look real. I really liked the Madame Lalaurie story, though it's more than likely. But the main reason I like this movie is fake or not, when the ghosts start attacking and abducting them, I get stuck every time, and I have to look behind me, because it seems to me there is something. , but hey more than half of today's cinema and DVD frightening generation doesn't give me goosebumps, so it makes it horrible joy. Not for everyone, because skeptics hate it and not gorehounds like PG-13 are not gore. And women are very annoying! You want the ghosts to take them out and test them before it is all said and done. ** at the end *****.
