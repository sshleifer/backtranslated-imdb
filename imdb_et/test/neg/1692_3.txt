I was 12 years old when this movie was released and adored it. The song was inspirational and it made me feel good watching it in the cinema several times. I actually had an audio track album and I played the song over and over again. <br /> <br /> 26 years later ... I'm ashamed. Just sat down and watched it with my two daughters who enjoyed it a lot, but my cynical older grown eyes hated it. It is very poorly targeted in many places, and given that I was led by Lionel Jeffries, I really wanted to enjoy it. The character animation was so harsh, but the backgrounds were pretty good. I remember during the critics saying that it was a bad film and was scared, but now I agree. <br /> <br /> This is an old movie, yes, compared to what can now be achieved, maybe I thought it was good then. But it does not excuse it for poor performance, control and disgust. The main voice of the child's actor seems to be duplicated, which is also very disturbing. You can't see what they were trying to achieve when it was done, but what it was was a weak film.
