This film has some good results, as others have pointed out, but suffers (as others have pointed out, except for people who are probably friends of a filmmaker or otherwise explain why they consider it "10") self-conscious and self-absorbing film school upholstery and excessive plots. This is the type that Sex In The City can handle a half-hour episode, so there was no reason for it to be a 88-minute movie. The perfect example of wasted shots is the fast editing of the first third of the movie. Part of the back story is worthy, but, for example, too much time for Daria's character was for anal sex boy and Paulie, who was not realistic, even though the actor was doing a decent job he was given. <br /> <br /> The worst aspect of the film was the level of amateur parts: from printed material to bad jumps and edits, poor camera positions, angles, lighting problems, and the most ill-written script that has a badly developed concept. If the writer (including the director and the director) had collaborated with someone, he might not get a 100% rotten score in Rotten Tomato, which in turn confirms everyone's ability to truly believe people who gave him 10 people. rating system here.
