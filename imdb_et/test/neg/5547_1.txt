Give H.G. Lewis points: He was able to turn fleshy exotic dancers, gallons into his infamous counterfeit, and Henny Youngman all in one movie. "The Gore Gore Girls" was a Lewis horror movie swan song that ends with a car-pushed head. Oh ... Henny plays a pretty night club owner whose girls fall prey to the Lewis standard meat industry.
