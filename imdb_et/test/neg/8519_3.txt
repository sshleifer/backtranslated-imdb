This movie is strictly for fans of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher. <br /> <br /> I hate TCM to show this confusion more often than Bachelor Mother, the amazing original. I'm still bolder that some Hollywood boys thought Bachelor Mother would do a good job, filling it with some flat songs that just cut off the cute comedy stream. Instead, Hollywood could have spent time, money, energy and talent that wasted this terrible misfortune to give us something new and original - Wow, what a concept! <br /> <br /> Bachelor Mother with Ginger Rogers and David Niven is a spicy stew, sexy simmer. It is in the 1930s at the Hays office. Joy's package (remake) with Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher is strictly milk and cookies. This is a 1950 handshake with Eisenhower. <br /> <br /> What would you rather look at - Debbie Reynolds, Eddie Fisher and Adolphe Menjou or Ginger Rogers, David Niven and Charles Coburn? For me, the cast member of each original version is much better than his colleague in remake. <br /> <br /> At first it is beautiful, young Ginger Rogers at its top. David Niven offers a somewhat spoiled, complicated, and yet sophisticated direction for the rich trademark mandates. And I always love to see Charles Coburn in the movie. Bachelor Mother is invaluable as a desperate grandfather wannabe. <br /> <br /> Debbie Reynolds is a cheerful ultimate self. He is good in this role, although his performance (with Fisher) changes the tone of the story completely. As an actor, Eddie Fisher is hopeless. He is completely absent from the screen "presence". Here he is too healthy for this story. His behavior is completely gentle and helpless. Similarly, his singing is so strange and unnoticeable that the whole world has completely forgotten it. The only time he is not completely painful is in Butterfield 8 where he did not sing. Here, it is enough for Fisher's flat shot alone to destroy this movie. Adolphe Menjou, a favorite character designer, offers a competent performance, but not his best. He is rather darker than the command. He and Fisher are not convincing of their father and son. <br /> <br /> Do you see music that is just random? Or look at the music story, some (hopefully) good music for seasoning? If the first, you might want this flat remake. Otherwise, you will be much better off looking at Ginger Rogers' non-musical original, Bachelor's Mother.
