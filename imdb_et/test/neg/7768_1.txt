Terrible, low, materialistic mess. That's how women (and gay men?) Can enjoy this garbage, is over me. No self-respecting person would ever want to be one of those neurotic gold miners. What is more, so many reviewers say they are related to women in the show. If this is the future of women, the Lord will help us all. Showing your independence and keeping it equal to men should not be the spread of their feet every three seconds with another man. I think it discourages women and doesn't make them justice. But this review is not against women. The fans of this show say it's "fun" and "rivoting", but every time I looked at this example, I just tried to stay awake. In spite of the narrative of the reporter's wife, at this stage there is nothing closer to something that could be considered a rational thought. So, it's not fun, and it's not informative, so why would you bother it? One out of ten stars.
