This film speaks of a sad wife who lost her husband by suicide. He is tormented by his son, who did not speak after that. <br /> <br /> The child's grief is rarely explored in the film, so it's refreshing to see a movie like the Addison Wall. But because of the nature of the film, there is no tension or drama. In addition to some basic emotional moments, everything in the movie is very simple. A sudden termination, which does not solve any secrets, does not help to watch the movie anymore. The Addison Wall could have been much better, for example, exploring wall content, a more intensive maintenance program that would help Addison through his trauma. Instead, the film looks very unfinished and not interesting.
