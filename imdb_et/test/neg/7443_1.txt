RoboCop's violent pursuit was led by Irvin Kershner (never say ever, the empire strikes back) is never as good as the original, because it is almost humorous and is extremely important and should have been NC-17 because scenes related to toddlers who are involved in the fight against weapons, people are cruelly murdering very young infants with REAL automatic weapons and even 12-year-old scenes, using a lot of explicit embarrassment, giving drugs a lot of casual people, shooting and graphically photographing police officers and SWAT officers, opening police officers fire, when there are many small and small children, and a whole group of children who are using extreme embarrassment and beat the shop owner (who is a very old man) in the electronics store and steal and destroy many items there. This film gives a new meaning to the term "terrible meaning", but the effects and sequences of action are extraordinarily unbelievable. In general, OK is a movie.
