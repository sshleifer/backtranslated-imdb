The worst Korean film! The plot is ridiculously complicated, unbelievable and the film does not cause any shock. It gets caught up well enough, leaving you irritated by offering a shock or a leap. If you have a cooling moment, you have not disturbed it because you are still trying to work out who is and what's going on! It goes something like this: a modeling company recruits 4 people for a modeling career. but the owners are not what they look like, they have everyone's model dolls and the strange girl is seen around the walk and the owners don't know the girl. It turns out that everyone is there for a reason and as much as I understood. The end is the murder of murders and you do not know who the doll is, who is real and who is dead! I do not recommend it to fans of Korean / Asian films.
