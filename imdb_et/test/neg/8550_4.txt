You heard it was the final team of Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwycki as the team on the screen, and it was a movie for Fonda for Columbia Pictures. Fonda had signed an agreement with Fox of the 20th century to get Tom Joad's part of the grapes of anger. But after that, his loan was usually made out of films that were good when he was in Fox's mediocre affairs. <br /> <br /> But the rule was broken here. Although his character is similar to Charles Pike's Lady Eve, this movie is not funny anywhere. In fact, feminists would probably be against it. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck didn't like her at all. She liked to work with Henry Fonda enough, but thought the film was ridiculous. It should also be. <br /> <br /> Fonda is another millionaire playboy, whom we now call a trust fund child who doesn't really do much with his life. She is a kind lunkhead, who meets Stanwyck on a ski slope and is literally to try her. It turns out he's a doctor and they have a twist and get married. But it turns out that Fondal is jealous, especially when it comes with Roger Clark, the second millionaire of Stanwyc. And he doesn't understand his professional duties. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck, like Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn, was and is a feminist icon. When he tells Fonda that he should go out of the world of work and live in a salary and see if he can do it, the Fonda goes out and gets a dealership at the department store. He is so proud of him that he actually renounces his medical practice and lives with his salesman. <br /> <br /> Today is NOW movie selection. Stanwyck did not have too many convictions in his activities, probably because he didn't believe it. I certainly couldn't. <br /> <br /> I don't even think viewers believed it. But the two stars and the rest of the cast tried their best, but it was a special thanksgiving.
