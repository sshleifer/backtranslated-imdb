I was all about a movie that looked at the promo and went to see it. FDFS The movie was terrible to say the least <br /> <br /> The first scene is good and until they go to London, things are funny, but the slow pace is slowing down and it's not that funny <br /> <br /> Manoj Joshi's subfield is sometimes funny, but it is undesirable and adds boredom <br /> <br /> The drug section is funny, especially the monologue Govinda <br /> <br /> The film continues and purposefully as a little child has written it <br /> <br /> Interval brings the twist of the story, but then I lost hope <br /> <br /> The other side starts okay, but how things are handled takes a look. The entire Arbaa-Jackie angle is half-baked Also, how do people not recognize them? <br /> <br /> Funny, though stupid <br /> <br /> Priyadarshan is not at all in his elements, the movie he started making craps and his films was bad and bad Music is good, SIGNAL, WELCOME BIN stand out and the AFREEN league camera-work is good <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumaril is white on his storm and looks old, but he's doing well, though it's the role he's done many times, but thanks to his natural comedy , it seems tolerable Govinda looks like a shape, bad and her act, except the monologue is boring too surprising Govinda seems too much pressure on her comeback and Priyan does not use her Paresh is fine in parts, but generally just repeat the act of Manoj Joshi in funny places Sharat Saxena is funny okay Shakti Kapoor is great Jackie Shroff seems overweight and is acting during his sleep Arbaaz Khan is bad Lara Dutta is brilliant but doesn't act
