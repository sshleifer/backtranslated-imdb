1 hour and 40 minutes talking - boring talking and more talking and then some. It's hard for me to figure out how an actor, like Anne Parillaud, who excelled at Femme Fatale, would register such a piece! Unbelievable. If you need night watch, this movie can help, although I prefer nice classic music. unfortunately I just discovered that I have to write 10 lines on my comment - it's almost as incredible! it is therefore not enough to comment briefly and briefly on one or two sentences that express their core film. geez, people. I made my point and don't waste time with more unnecessary words - like this movie. Wolfgang
