"Frenzy" has recently made the most criticism when he first appeared in the UK TV series. I remember it in my original edition, and I thought that if Hitchcock inevitably wanted to know his rooted misogynism, he wouldn't have been able to do that to do it. <br /> <br /> But time will change the perspective and so what was badly bad in 1972 was a worthy evaluation of all those years later. <br /> <br /> Maybe. . . but not. "Frenzy" is a guy. The crown of an aging director who desperately wanted to take advantage of the freedom of making the 70s film without realizing that freedom puts a commitment on it, especially the need to ensure the credibility of its work. <br /> <br /> There is nothing here. And not much evidence of previous driver shine - indirectly, the switch is not explicitly shocking or superior to stylist indirectly: it is just banal (the long-term murder point is this: prolonged, without pace, without reason, without any use other than the cheapest) at the desire of the director to appear as a modern artist to say that it is also another prestigious precedent, Michael Winner). <br /> <br /> And it's going to be worse, a dialogue that violates any human origin (especially the ridiculous deviation from our expensive wooden inspector's home life and his wife's cooking). <br /> <br /> Perhaps the scene that best combines "Frenzy" (and runs like the most explicit accusation of Hitchcock's personality) is the immediate bar between two lawyers, where they discuss the serial number and then agree that at least women was the first time of rape. <br /> <br /> I remember my excitement this scene back in '72 and it's still unlimited because it wasn't Hitchcock, who was smart or sardonic and didn't try to make any universal point (big topics, big truths, not Hitchcock forte or personal preferences.) It was just Hitchcock, which allows the mirrored mirror of his life to be reflected through the texture of the film. <br /> <br /> "Frenzy" Hitchcock's last big masterpiece is disappointingly little to understand what Hitchcock really is in achieving movie, cinematic excitement and dazzling cinematic mastery. <br /> <br /> "Frenzy" is therefore always what it was always: cheap, nasty and ham-fisted film that did not serve any of the people involved or the filmmaker in the memory of the person who was actually, there ever was.
