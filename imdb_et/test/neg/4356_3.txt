It's very rare to see a 1955 movie that I don't love. Noir, JDs, Sci-fi, Drive-Ins; I dig it the most. Robert Aldrich is a director who has done a lot of great work and most of them have a good belt. So what went wrong? <br /> <br /> When I was working in the Independent Film World, we talked about what is called "actor films". Actresses are films that are invisible to everyone, but not to other participants. Actors like "actors' movies" because they can see ACTing - which means it's completely over-top-melodrama. Actresses love to be given the opportunity to completely let go of "giving her everything they've got" and they are very pleased with watching other participants. In many interviews, actors say "he was a great director, he never interfered with me." In fact, this is the opposite of good management, because the whole POINT, with the director's director, is to keep the actors self-stupid (which if possible). <br /> <br /> Obviously, Robert Aldrich forgot about this project. Or maybe he was sick. Or maybe he thought the script could not be saved first, so what the hell? In any case, here is an example of a less well-known film that is best forgotten. Characters gesture, seal, and generally grab it completely. One thing I can say is realistic: it is in Hollywood and everyone is acting like their small problems are the most important thing in the world. It won't let you look, but it's realistic. What is not realistic is that the manufacturer, who is so desperate to keep his letter under the treaty, goes out of his way to imagine him in almost every sense - including demanding that he engage in illegal activities. However, this and other plot contradictions are confined to the melodrama, increasing the ability to twist and punish hands. <br /> <br /> I was able to finish this movie, which is why it is not worse than 10 "3" in my book. But why try your endurance when there is so much else to rent?
