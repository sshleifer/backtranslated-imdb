I am usually the one who criticizes twenty something Neanderth, because he is not able to evaluate the film unless he has plastic t * ts, gunfights and cars. In this case, some of these additions can actually be corrected. At least I would not have been forever and changed channels. <br /> <br /> I don't mind the surreal, and I don't need to pay attention to finding a subtle or hidden meaning, but it should be some thing about the whole thing. I didn't get the feeling that even a writer or director really had a general vision of everything, but were just so absorbed in their own self-vision visions that they deliberately disintegrated. Or maybe they just got confused. Either way, I don't care. It bored me a little over an hour without sustainable grace. <br /> <br /> Although the rest of the viewer has filled this site with exciting rapes about alleged symbolism and masterful cinematography, I respectfully. Maybe I couldn't kill enough movie lessons to understand some of the inspired techniques that mortals don't see ... <br /> <br /> Or perhaps this movie was just nonsense. <br /> <br /> I'll give him "1" and I will put it next to "Ishtar".
