Whatever it is, it's a fairly decent comic for Road Runner, a little short (just under 6 minutes). The gags are at best adequate, the animation is competent and the new restored DVD master looks nice. But this is the end of the places. Let me give you a little upside down: In 1958, thanks to a labor dispute, WB received a number of conserved music that was used for 6 year cartoons. <br /> <br /> There is only one phrase to describe this short music and it's "it's 4Kids sound". I use this phrase to describe music that does not correspond to screen activity, and feels that it is recorded by an orchestra composed of Sonic Youth band members. In this short music, it seems hopelessly faced and incredibly unpleasant, especially considering this short scene (namely the piano trap) that would have worked best for little or no music. <br /> <br /> I think that awful music would be destroyed by the WB comic (even the scores of Lava are not unpleasant), but given that the cartoon is not so spectacular, the music becomes almost painful. It's like episodes of doctoral students in the late 80s that could still be bad, and still make them unobtrusive thanks to Keff McCulloc's incredibly horrific music (which seemed like it hit the demo button on all 5 of its Casio keyboards at the same time). <br /> <br /> I want people to call it crazy, but I'd like to look at one of Larriva's RR-cartoons. At least the preserved music was usually in sync with their activities.
