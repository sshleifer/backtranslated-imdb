Wow ... just ... wow. There are already many comments on this movie, but I wanted to add some of my comments. I agree with most of the reviewers who have said that this film has terrible action, writing and leadership - who the boy is doing. However, I think there are still some problems here. <br /> <br /> 1. Why is Christian faith and extraterrestrial support mutually exclusive? The film works the way you just can't be a Christian and also allow the opportunity? Why? They touch it in the movie so briefly (ie "The Bible does not say it is aliens". "The Bible does not say it is not, so how to deal with the issue rather than remove it is the chance that he did somewhere Elsewhere in life and have their own plans ... Nightly fears related to the experience of robbery? What if it is something else? Too bad that filmmakers have already built their thoughts. <br /> <br /> that anyone who has had a robbery experience is quite a big requirement to do without factual evidence, I am not required to claim that they are not doing this, but if you say something with asinine, you should back up the facts. > <br /> 4. Why is the second reporter (not the Greasy Haired Blonde Guy, second) always in his pockets? It's hard to take anyone seriously when they are playing a pocket. <br /> <br /> I wish it there would have been a study of Christian faith and UFO phenomena, but unfortunately fil Dangers too worried about their "Faith Message" Providing a lot to create a mind-catching film. Like a Christian myself, it's grieving me.
