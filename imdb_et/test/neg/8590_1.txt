I just got back from "AGS". After that, I see I'm convinced that no matter how much it is written, that he thoroughly studied the film, Stone has never seen a NFL in his life. Great cinema? Leave me alone. The game was almost invisible and 90% of the other films were close-ups. Was there anything in this movie that wasn't raised in the "North Dallas Forty"? <br /> <br /> An aging star player ... check. Young hot shot .... check. Analgesics .... check. Owner who can't get it "...". Crazy Off-Field Behavior .... Check <br /> <br /> This is also a race at the Dallas (i.e. December or Janis) outdoor stadium, but people sit there with tanks and shorts! And what about those lights? Did they play in Japan's Kabuki theater or sports stadium? <br /> <br /> The strategy shown in the game was ridiculous. This is the fourth and 1 "shark" inside. 30. Dallas leads 35-31. OBJECTIVE OF THE FIELD OF HEIGHT. Not only would it be reasonable in terms of football, but then you would have a better final ranking where they could and should have gone for a two-point conversion. Hell, pawn game w / extra point and Stone could have done it even 3 hours of overtime. <br /> <br /> Were the "old-time" footballers flat montages supposed to be a tribute to the game? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> And the script ... ugh. More clich√©, if you can shut down, is another one. <br /> <br /> "Slapshot" was better than this movie. Far away. <br /> <br /> 1/10. <br /> <br /> Leave it at all costs. <br /> <br />
