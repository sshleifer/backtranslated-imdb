I'm sure I'm in the minority (I know I'm among my friends), but I found this movie long, boring and free. The fact that the role of DENIS LEARY is the most pleasant character (the only time he liked it was "A Bug's Life!"), Speaks of volumes. Rene Russo symbolizes faith and Thomas Crowne himself was flat and stereotypical. Saying he was two-dimensional, he may be a bit generous. (No, the scenes with my psychiatrist did not make him real.) <br /> <br /> Except for the two wonderful scenes (involving the museum's whim and not Rene Russo), this film made me want to be watching TV at home.
