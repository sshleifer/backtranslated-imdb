When you sit down for the first time to watch this movie, remember that you see something you've probably seen before. Remember, this is a movie where they probably spent INSANE's money on explosions and not enough to act or anything else. The amazing thing I noticed is that every character is completely superfluous, and it seems (mostly) that the movie was accelerated! (Interestingly, did the Hong Kong version be duplicated?) I understand that the comic was it, but it doesn't work in real time. It just seems strange ... as the camera team decided to act because they couldn't afford the actual participants. <br /> <br /> The English version is dreadfully dubbed and the words in the tag are not suitable for the mouth. . I would have preferred subtitles, but because it's a children's film and because some kids can't read well, I'll let it go. But there is something very strange about this movie. This is supposedly a children's film, but there's a lot of material about SEX, RAPE, and STRIPPING that aren't exactly for the young western audience. (In Orient they have different film laws and sexuality are much more accepted). But parents must be warned! There's a scene where two characters are talking about rape, several scenes where people talk about "sex maniac" and a scene where this insanely young Japanese girl does sexy dance for one "sex game" and shows her breasts! Who was this movie still? <br /> <br /> Oh, and the special effects are ridiculous. You can say things like a spacecraft that are bombarded by a village bombardment (or an animation that I wasn't sure of) that even see convincing people. The makers of this movie continued to do a lot of cool things, just because they couldn't use the money they needed to make money. I didn't like how the names of all the characters were changed ... it made me wonder if this movie was made by the same people as Dragon Ball Z. <br /> <br /> movie to anyone. Kids, Adults or Dragon Ball Z fans. It is just a bad performance of comics and probably it can be said that this movie was rushed and not taken care of. I can't even enter the cameras ... wait for another 2 minutes on the final credit. Most of the shots are not framed correctly at AT ALL and the film seems to be the amateurs. Also sharp film quality. <br /> <br /> Just all terrible !!!! <br /> <br />
