Throughout the "End of Days", I got the feeling that filmmakers were trying to make it a unique Hollywood movie. They failed, of course, but you have to give them aspirations. Peter Hyams tried to steer this procedure instead of simply dragging one another. He tried to bring in the film, darkening the light and dark blood. This method can work if used correctly (see "Se7en"), but here it seems like a cheap trick to scare us. Hyams is a decent director of action and here offers nothing more than basic shooting prospects and fighting scenes, except weak, sub par f / x end "battle". As a photographer, Hyams demonstrates a true ability with some good framing and movement, but it is not a strong job. <br /> <br /> Scriptwriter Andrew Marlowe is the greatest enemy of the movie. In some cases, the script actually shows the effects of good religious thrillers, and sometimes it even shows some intellectual thinking (the scene of the temptation between Arnold and Gabriel Byrne), but these small pluses are displaced by the negative rivers. The general dialog / characters, primer lines and convenient points that just happen to direct all the characters in the right direction are just a few of Hollywood's black holes in the Marlowe manuscript. A good film shadow could have faded very quickly. <br /> <br /> The film has a surprisingly good light. Arnold, who still has a larger housing attitude, is trying to play depressed, with a runner over the average score. Be an invincible hero, Arnie, that's your good. Gabriel Byrne is a strong point in the ensemble that brings the air to Satan's role. Byrne keeps himself in exhausting factors that are ripe for superfluous behavior, and this adds a little more danger to the mark. Kevin Pollak, as usual, can bring at least a few smiles to the movie, but he's done it better. Also look for a small small role from Rod Steiger. <br /> <br /> Hyams seemed to be trying to separate it from the mass of Hollywood movies. He headed in the right direction but found no script or originality. <br /> <br /> 4/10
