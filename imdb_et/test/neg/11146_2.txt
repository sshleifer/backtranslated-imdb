this movie sucks big. so many holes in the plot. if the devil is invincible, why does he need the protection of bodyguards? I couldn't understand why Arnie didn't come to work for several days and then suddenly appears, takes all his armor and disappears again! Nice work if you can get it. It is sad that the last 1/2 hour result is a standard arnie 'uzi 9mm' final. Arnies is interpreted as a depressed policeman to worship his head and sniff. I thought he had a bad cold for most movies. Arnie is called terribly, 95% of the film is called "friend", "dude" and so on. Then we hear that he is called his real name Jericho Cane (where do they get these names?). The end result is so twee that you have a better bag ready. It is a shame that Gladiator pulled the same end 100% more with the class. <br /> <br />
