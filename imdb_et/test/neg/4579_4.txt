Making the movie I want would have enough talent and sincerity. Everyone is clearly doing their best to be an intriguing assumption, but it is too deep a vision, too involved in the attempt to remove mental fraud to survive the transition to the screen. This is an attempt to capture the dimensionality of cellulose gossamer patterns - the result is confusing and slow. I'll give him 10 effort, but 5.
