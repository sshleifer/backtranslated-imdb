Having seen the Dark Heart movie version, I feel like I'm wasting 100 minutes of my life. Although the book was not my favorite, I was very disappointed that Nicolas Roeg was a bad story. Despite the fact that he left out a lot of important data, the roles just didn't seem to be cast, and the whole movie seemed much more emotional. The book depicts a lively landscape and details that are completely ignored in the film. <br /> <br /> You think the director would be able to fit a 76-page book to a movie of at least one and a half hours. The differences completely changed my story. For example, if the character of Kurtz's fianc√©es does not correspond to the fact that Kurtz is dead, it will completely change the end of the book. Not to mention the kits and landscapes used in the movies, it was almost as beautiful as described. He sincerely knows that Roeg would have filmed another story that would include the Heart Of Darkness contained in it. <br /> <br /> If you look at the title of the movie without knowing it or expect it to be something like Joseph Conrad's story, it may be good. Although I thought the camera's work was bad and cast inappropriate, it is just as enchanting. However, if you are looking for a good movie version of the famous classic story, don't look for it in Roegi.
