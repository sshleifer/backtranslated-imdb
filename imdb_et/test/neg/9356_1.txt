I can't believe some comments here comment. Of course, the film is dated and the CGG age from our comfortable point of view now has a lot of special effects very convincing. But even allowing it, Troy Helen is so bad that it is almost ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Scripting is terrible, just terrible, not at all. The performances suffer as a result, seeing the scandals like Hardwick and Andrews, because they give fish ridges to the most ridiculous low tricks. Writers seem to feel the need to explain almost everything in a terrible didactic scenario that allows the viewer to decide anything at all. At the beginning of the film, the historical background is identified, as no one would ever have heard of Greece; I know they had to take into account the American audience, but the patronizing way that we are told twice is that we realize that it is really terrible. <br /> <br /> I can't honestly believe the above comments movie as a big epic movie. Even if the relatively primitive cinema and the relative complexity of today's audience are allowed, this film really smells.
