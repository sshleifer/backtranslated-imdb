It's hard to believe that the movie that's bad is not produced once, just four times! Most movies need a certain "halt to reality", but it takes it too far. The main scenario is the air force pilot who has been beaten across the Middle East. The US government is pulling its feet to recovery by driving a pilot son (Doug Masters) to try the rescue task. <br /> <br /> The problem I have is that it depicts the US air force as a colossal joke. In the film, you'll find that Doug and his airline friends can provide two F-16s, all for ammunition, fuel, the Intel mission and so on. Security on this basis seems to be a joke. No one seems to have the problem that a sixteen-year-old child is fully qualified to conduct a F-16 pilot project. <br /> <br /> If that is not enough, then you think manufacturers are trying to get the ammunition right at least because people want to see things "in the air". Not so! Repeatedly in the movie, Doug Fire AIM-9 missiles on the ground. AIM stands for Air Intercept Missile, which means a weapon used to capture the targets of AIR. He also burns 15-20 rockets, where the maximum F-16 can hold up to 6 AIM-9. The film also lacks consistency. You see an aircraft that is configured with one ammunition and the next scene has a completely different ammunition package. Also, 20MM doesn't destroy anything it touches! The F-16 keeps 500 circles at 20MM and is mostly used for self-defense. <br /> <br /> I could go on forever with the holes in the plot, the bugs and the film with the wrong information, but I won You didn't wear you. When you're in the mood to see a good air force movie, your choices are pretty thin. Most military films deal with either army, navy or navy. Until Hollywood can get out of the air force on Saving Private Ryan or A Little Good Men, we're forced to watch movies like the Iron Eagle series. <br /> <br />
