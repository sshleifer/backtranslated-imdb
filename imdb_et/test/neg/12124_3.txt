I have to say that it is better than most SyFy trips, but it doesn't speak much. <br /> <br /> The plot is that someone buys a game made of dead witches' bones and skin. The Spanish Inquisition (and no one expects the Spanish Inquisition!) He and his friends are playing the game, but must be cut off halfway when a friend who went to dinner is killed as the game predicted. <br /> <br /> Here are a series of killings that are typical of such a movie or any Final Destination movie. It's a fun and interesting sub-block with a policeman who wants the game back to his family ... but it's just a mess.
