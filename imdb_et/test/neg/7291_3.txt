What's wrong with Disney in recent years? Are the good ideas completely out? Where is magic? Where are the good animators, good songwriters, good leaders, good ... Okay, I know Walt himself and the famous "nine old man" can't come back. But is this the reason why you could pull out countless cheap results and slowly but surely destroy Walt Disney's ideals? I never rented or bought what kind of movie was the Disney sequel. Because I had read enough about the lack of quality. But "Atlantis: Milo's return" was on television in Germany today and I watch it. This confirmed my doubts about the after-effects. It was totally boring. Error animation, primitive color rotation, simple characters, some unsuccessful attempts to simulate the famous multi-camera CGI, mediocre music, and various simple stories. It looks like Disney doesn't like it! I don't like Disney! It seems to be one of the countless, cheap and simple animation series like "DragonballZ", "Beyblade", etc., which is played daily on television. <br /> <br /> My first reaction after this nonsense show was to load my DVD player "Bambi" to see Disney's immortal magic, depth, spirit and charm again to see Disney at its peak to see the handmade again the awesome art of animation. "Bambi" was the first (and still the only) movie I give out of 10 out of 10. But "Atlantis: Milo's Return"? No magic, no depth, no magic, no spirit ... It just deserves three out of 10!
