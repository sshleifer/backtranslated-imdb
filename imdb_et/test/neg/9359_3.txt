I had heard good things about "Grace States" and I came openly. I thought the "army of God" was fine and I thought maybe the Dutchman had improved and matured as a filmmaker. The film started with some shaky behavior, and I thought, "well, maybe it will improve." Unfortunately, it never did. The picture begins with the introduction of two older, Mormon missionaries, and it seems that the audience knows them and grows to care for them. Instead, the story becomes a very unlikely unfortunate event that highlights the blatant disobedience of missionaries (something that undoubtedly exists, but rarely the level that the Dutchman represents) and it becomes almost ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Only Dutch-speaking success in this film is the successful alienation of its target audience. In the unrealistic and inaccurate portrayal of the lives of the missionaries of Morrea, the Dutchman achieves more than just his predominantly Mormon audience. The film does not really reflect reality. The missions are not something the Dutch exhibitions show (having themselves approved the Mormon mission to prove it) and the gang's life in California certainly contains a much clearer language than the occasional light vulgarity. <br /> <br /> Conclusion that I suppose should touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to everyone was so unbelievable (c'mon, the whole mission is gathering to see this older home - and mother and girl standing next to each other!) and cheesy. Next time, Dutcher, try to make a movie that SONEONE can detect.
