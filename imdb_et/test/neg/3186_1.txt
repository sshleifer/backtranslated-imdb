It is one of those letters of full-fledged comedies that can a) be hysterical or b) want you to go to the dentist to pull all your teeth. Unfortunately, one night McCool's classic "b." <br /> <br /> Goldie Hawn recently commented on the city and the country that this is a big problem in Hollywood, that they will start recruiting actors and preparing a transaction before the script is completed. You have to realize that they not only reached this picture without adding a complete script, but also mangled it every day. Maybe we need to send the cards and letters to the whole studio managers who say, "This is a script, stupid." <br /> <br /> It is also one of those films where you feel mostly harmed by actors. They work out their donkey trying to make it all hysterical, but they know that most of it doesn't laugh at the belly, but at the sounds of the cricket inside the quiet theater. <br /> <br /> Is this an uninterrupted disaster? Not completely. Some smiles are on the way, mainly due to the efforts of the participants. I would probably have gone to think of the theater, "Eh. That was okay." Why an undeniably hostile tone in my review? End. If, as noted, the end of the rest of the movie is over, it will be remarkable. I really wish I could talk about it specifically, but I hate people who give too much (even in a warning). Suffice it to say that as soon as you see John Goodman in the back of Paul Reiser (nothing is given here. This is a trailer), get hell out of the theater and go thinking, "Eh. That was okay." The rest of the movie is fake and creatively bankrupt. And it's frightening that there are actually people who laugh at this mess. <br /> <br /> If you love "There's something about Mary" or "Meet the Parents" (both GREAT movies), don't bother to see this movie. Go to the teeth to take care of it instead.
