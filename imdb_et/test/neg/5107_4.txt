When I first heard that there is not enough world for Nintendo 64, I was so excited. When it finally came out, I was one of the first to rent it. I rented it for 7 days and got through the whole game !!! The game was simple and gave too many clues. Majour's bursting sequel to GoldenEye. Take my advice and DO NOT KASKA THIS GAME. <br /> <br /> The weapons and gadgets are definitely cool, but one gets bored with the clock laser, which looks like it's made directly from GoldenEye, except for the red color instead of blue, a bad excuse for a whistle gun, a terrible stun and a stupid grabbing hook , which can only be fixed with yellow and black items. <br /> <br /> I think RARE should be made for this game instead of EA, who should stay in the games where they are good, like sports games, and should be free of first-person shooters and let the captains work.
