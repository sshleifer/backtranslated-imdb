Review: Nunsploitation Movies. They have been forever. Some of the things to remember are the Mexican devil worshiping Alucarda, the Night of Demons 2, the monastery, and of course the desecration of Dante Tomasell. Don't blame anyone who tries to use a religious / sacred image and turn it around to make it scary. If that's right, it works. Here is the latest addition to the nunsploitation sub music just called Nun. <br /> <br /> The story is about a group of girls who live in a Catholic school. At this school there is Nun, who is particularly troublesome for one girl. Girls who act in self-defense against an abusive nun accidentally kill him and then decide to bury him and tell no one. Fast forward 18 years later and the nun is looking for revenge on those who killed him. <br /> <br /> This movie was composed by Brian Yuznas Fantastic Factory. You know, a company that makes horror films in Spain. Need to remind you what movies this company throws out? Well heres a small reminder: Arachnid, Darkness, Romasanta: Werewolf Hunt, rottweiler. You get the picture. The only really good movie that this company has produced (in my opinion) was Stuart Gordons Dagon. That's it. Oh no, wait, I believe they also made an excellent Christian Bale vehicle from The Mach. But that's it. So when I deliberately rented this movie, I knew I wasn't going to look at something that was good for my son. But I was disappointed with all this mental preparation. <br /> <br /> One of the only good things this film has done is its slippery look. The film has nice cinematography. It doesn't look like a cheap horror movie. Films with special effects were fine, Nun was able to ride through the water. Well, it was a picture that gave it to some cool moments that were sometimes scratched into a cheesy territory, but sometimes they were enough to watch. I dug this scene where Nun hurried himself with people like a bucket of water. It is not a particularly lethal movement, but it provided a cool visual. Here's some gore, but not much. One particular scene that covered the death of the elevator was cool, but unfortunately the film hit its top with this scene. And it was just halfway. After that, nothing really cool will happen and the film will be amazed by the incredible borefest. <br /> <br /> The movie is now changing to Nun every time and then to give us a scary fear, kill someone and then CUT! We return to the characters who talk about crap, through the rooms, open the doors, you get the drill. And I just hate it when the horror film changes. People open the doors and go to the rooms. Bored! And when the characters talk about their terrible dialogue. In a particularly stupid scene, the character decides from the blue that the nun becomes water and flesh when in the water, so they want to kill and kill him. And everyone just says OK! And they all worked out the plan to kill the nun in the water tank. Now, who gave this man this information and why did others take it for granted? Who the hell knows, but the scenes that make the film are stupid. <br /> <br /> And another thing that got to enjoy this movie was that they used Spanish actors with a very thick accent. When they try to speak English, it is very difficult to find out what the hell they want to say. Id prefer to duplicate them, then try to figure out what they say and are disappointed. The fact that this DVD does not have English subtitles does not contribute to the question. I think it just shows that you may have the biggest budget or the best special effects, but if your movie has a bad script with terrible characters and situations that your audience can't connect, you still have a bad movie. That was the case with NUN. <br /> <br /> If you want evil nuns to be really fun, rent all the films mentioned at the beginning of this review. Now, as do the filmmakers, they should say ten hail maries and enlighten fifty candles to their holiday to see if they are forgiven for making this sinful movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5.
