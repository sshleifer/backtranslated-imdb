Take a bad script, some bad behavior, and throw away the politically wrong story of morality and what can you do? Something that should go through high quality family viewing. <br /> <br /> Seven alone is the story of a 19th century family traveling on a wagon train across America, hoping for a new life in Oregon. The movie's title is seven children (three boys, three girls and a child whose sex I'm not quite sure). <br /> <br /> The story opens to a family who lives in a seemingly normal 19th century life in the middle of the farm. The eldest son, John, is a premature teenager, "lazy and good", as his father reminds him. We can see to the right that he has a tendency to practical jokes when he binds his sleeping hair and connects it to a nearby mule. When the other moves, the poor girls get out of bed. John is caught by his father and is immediately punished with a strap. <br /> <br /> On the same day, the train goes through. Pa is tempted to join because it promises in nature in the wild, in the west in the wild. So the family grabs their stuff and head off. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, the film looks weak and amateur. The action is lower than the class, as one of the films that the pioneers in the school show. But I can't blame the actors because the lines of this movie are stupid and just too bad and sweet and optimistic. Christian Television Station. I am not a religious mind, I watched in horror when Seven Alone offered moral statements that were not only outdated but offensive! If I were a good Christian, I hope I would have been happy to appeal to a television station to incite such a trash. But since I am cynical, not a believer with a sense of humor, I decided to sit and laugh myself foolishly. <br /> <br /> In one of the opening scenes, the role of the father is as the chief commander of the house is created when he presents the idea of ​​his wife's referral to Oregon. His answer is warm "Over dead body". It is assumed that we are laughing because the film cuts the next scene where Pa and I smile as he drives the wagon through the prairie. Oh, I think even the most serious feminist should admit that this "Father-knows-the-best" attitude was the norm these days, and it can be said that living conditions are difficult for such a dictatorial rule, but I got a feeling that this movie supported even today. The lovely message comes from the Christian television station. <br /> <br /> In any case, the deterioration of the family and the moral integrity of the films will be further reduced. India (or Indian) rob John when he sleeps in the field. Like a normal savage, India takes Johns clothes and stuff. Fortunately, Pa's passer-by Kit Carson can kill India, as well as a couple of his criminals. Kit Carson tells John that his father is a real hero. <br /> <br /> The family is accompanied by a wagon train resident doctor, Holland Holland (played by Aldo Ray). He shares Pa's feelings about John, saying he is a useless brat. Maybe so, but he's the best thing about this movie. Aldo Ray's doctor is a son who seems to be able to tie his shoes, not to mention a girl who's broken a leg. Luckily, the young child did not cry when the wagon ran over and hit his feet two because Dr Holland had no suitable bed. We know the drawbacks of the child's constant harassment. Here is a film that promotes this behavior. <br /> <br /> Later Pa develops food poisoning or something that I didn't turn and dies. The scene of his death bed is what has an excellent effect. Frankly, the man didn't even look sick. <br /> <br /> Soon after, Ma will die. Children are left to take care of themselves. And then a real adventure begins. These kids do it all, splitting them through the rapids, getting more Indians (they are nice) and snow on the terrain. And I got the idea: "What a bunch of rubbish!" <br /> <br /> Sorry, there was nothing to redeem for this movie. This small budget small house in Prairie is a shameful waste of time and insult to "families" everywhere. I'm surprised that in 1975, at the tip of the feminist movement and at a time when the focus was on native-American treatment, something like that could be done. <br /> <br />
