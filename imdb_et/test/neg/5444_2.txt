Poorly acted and poorly managed, Congo is trying to rebuild the feeling of "Jurassic Park" without success. But the truth is that this book was not so big. But the first problem with the movie is that Tim Curry's character was added; another problem is that the spoken hand was added; the main problem, however, is that cast members do not create realistic signs. I guarantee that this movie will not let you guess that there are gorillas somewhere on earth. Also Laura Linney (Happy Birthday, Laura!), Dylan Walsh, Ernie Hudson, Grant Heslov, Joe Don Baker, James Karen and Bruce Campbell; I think they don't want to emphasize this movie as they continue.
