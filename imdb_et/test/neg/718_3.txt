Some academics suggested this film. From my comments, I had pretty desperate expectations. But this movie was nothing but disappointment. The director's goal is obvious - to use the intertwining of speeches / poems as an opportunity to argue against the Bush doctrine. But the director is not unhappy about it. I also seriously question the Director's basic education. It is surprising that it has definitely not been heard. The rise of corporate power, what? Most importantly, this film gets its convincing power of failure; it is clearly meant for those who have already created their opinions. It is true that the aesthetics of the film are quite pleasant. But pretty much everything in the movie just sucks.
