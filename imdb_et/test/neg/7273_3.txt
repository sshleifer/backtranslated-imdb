I decided to watch this in a very low budget movie "Poverty Row" studio in China because it celebrated with exciting characters Lionel Atwill. Although Atwill often played these cheap movies, his great style always made the movies much better, because his screen personality was great (his real life is also quite interesting? The reason I use the term "poverty line" is that it was very cheap in the era Many of them were not even real studios, but manufacturing companies that rented space and set up larger studios at night! Yes, there is a good chance that it was filmed after normal business hours - a common thing for such studio centers. Lady, but she is afraid to talk to herself. This is because her work has died for Death Row? Doc asks her friend (Atwill) how to break it, but despite not having this man Later, you understand that his own parents were criminals, later killed by a man and a lady is tied? a sister was tied with a little nut) and the evidence against the woman was bad. But the jury was probably full of meaningless people and was convicted and sent to Death Row. It is even more pointless that his old boy was the man responsible for his execution. Don't you think anyone else could just handle this case ?! Until this fateful hour, his friend (Atwill) spends a large part of the film trying to prove his innocence, and proves that the fluffy sister knows much more about the incident than she admits. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is just a little interesting and a bit stupid. Although this is observable and Atwill is good (as usual), the rest of the film does not really rise above the secular, and some actors are quite rude. This is a sub-par and what to expect from such a low budget flick?
