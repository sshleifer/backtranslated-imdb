Do you live? OK I think I'm intelligent, educated, liberal and really into movies. I like and have a great sense of humor. I had the impression that it was a painful comedy. They paid for it, gasoline was used, electricity was burned, food was consumed, built ........ why? I blame the current situation in the world in this movie and all the people who are involved. We are all guilty and deserve any outcome. He's not funny, not much happens, everything seems to be boring or boring. No conversations are taking place, communication is minimal. I don't know if I know. I've actually just lost 89 points in my life. I'll never get that back in time. The only message I've come up with is maybe the life is too short to sit on the movies of people who don't do much ...... and then you die!
