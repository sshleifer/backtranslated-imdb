Reading the book, I once again knew Castle Castle (the things that are the last part of Rock trilogy), and the plot was a "demon coming from a small redneck village" story King likes to say. The characters were all described in the loving detail, and it made a great psychological as well as horrible horror. On the other hand, the film is terrible. Gone are character interactions and smart plots, and they are a substitute story that strives to be exciting, but the mile remains a mile away. If you haven't read the book, you might like to enjoy it, otherwise avoid it at all costs, like most King's books.
