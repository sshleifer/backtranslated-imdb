We saw this in the movie club as an example of how classical literature can become the most terrible films of all time. The fact that the back of the box proudly proclaimed a "techno-meaningless" plot of the future should have been enough. I think this word describes the film itself, because no matter how much technology they tried to use to record this movie, the effort was totally pointless. Not to mention that our club advisor told us that he allegedly didn't get a distributor for two years. Beowulf's character changes unchanged in a way that is by no means plausible, and when he is in action he constantly sees as a hyper gymnast. It is, as they say, a "symbolic black man" whose attempts to humor are totally inappropriate. And, of course, the Grendel head of the head of the daughter is terrorizing, which is a complete vixen. Vixen, whose breasts are open throughout the film. Vixen, who wants to fight the creature, but he never misses a armor. And his chosen weapon is a little carved knife. And despite her terrible situation, she still dresses for a dress with a thoughtful skirt that opens her short shorts. There are a couple of scenes that could go through soft core pornography and the second scene will also recycle video from the first. I thought Grendel's portrayal was bad enough, but then came the end of the film, which showed a decent CGI in the 80s, but is completely ridiculous in the late 90s. I could go ahead, but you should all watch this movie for a completely ridiculous effect. all the way through. I still have an extra weapon: permanently spinning the lace cutter.
