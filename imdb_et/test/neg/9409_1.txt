One more payday in LA for the assignment and the team that worked for this apology for the film. For every audience who hopes for a fair return for their income, a big waste of time and money. The saddest aspect of this ugly workout (me) is that we look at the very talented actor Pacot, who apparently sees his own parody. It remained a mystery to me. I fully understand that people in the film industry have to work and thus live. What I do not understand is the prostitution of Al Pacino's artist and embarrassing himself with this pointless junk. Hopefully, he will select better-value projects in the future ... and value, save time and hard-earned money. Skip it !! We're sending a message to Hollywood and Ali.
