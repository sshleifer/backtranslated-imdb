"Many of the movies I've done would probably have been working 50 years ago, precisely because I have many old-fashioned values." - Steven Spielberg <br /> <br /> Some points .. <br /> <br /> 1. Although this film is an open-ended remake of "A Guy Named Joe", it also borrowed a lot of "Life and Death" and " Wish wings ". <br /> <br /> 2. It was Spielberg's second attempt to be Frank Capra. <br /> <br /> 3. Spielberg has often said he wants to make "Frank Capra's movie" It's a wonderful life "and" Mrs. Smith goes to Washington ". Judging by his recent attempts to get Harvey's remake from the ground, Spielberg still seems to have the dream that the Director rightly does not satisfy with his last three efforts at Capracorn. <br /> <br /> 4. Critics at "Always", saying that complex sequences of action disturbed the romance of the film, but that is not really a problem at all. The problem is that "Always" needs a lot more special effects to disrupt us from Spielberg being able to film any line that does not end with an exclamation mark. <br /> <br /> 5. The film is full of comedy that just doesn't work. Spielberg's comedic flavors are not very complicated and seem to have been ripped with 1950s screws and Looney Tune cartoons. These exaggerated antics can work in the comic world, but in the movie it just seems like a strange marriage. <br /> <br /> 6. The film's lead pair meets brother and sister, not lovers. Spielberg's films are always terrifying about sexual and intimate, but this film goes to extreme lengths: he is a laborious tomboy and he is a steadfast old man. They are more irritating than lovers. <br /> <br /> 7. The film contains one good scene where John Goodman claims to be with Holly Hunter, but mostly the characters are too annoying. There is no fineness, every emotion is over, over every joke, every sequence is full of unnecessary generations. <br /> <br /> 8. "Always" and "Hook" taught Spielberg as viewers. After their failure (and "The The Purple" and "Sun of Empire of twin"), Spielberg "Color Purple" and "Sun of Empire" doubled the funny color of cinematography to support more desaturated "black and white" Schindler list, "Munich "Minority Reports" and "Private Ryan Saving" worlds. Here, "less light" and "dark cinematography" became "serious". <br /> <br /> Spielberg turns to financial success after every "dark movie" "Amistad" followed "Schindler list", "AI" and "Ryan" and "Lincoln" follow "Munich." These "color" films are always shifted to be too sticky, sentimental , horny and hockey, but the truth is that, when desaturate is removed, all these "serious" movies look the same. <br /> <br /> 10. Since the 1970s, Spielberg has been trying to differentiate other brat pack directors (Scorsese, De Palma, Coppola et al., Making it "optimistic" and "humanist." He noted this repeatedly during the interviews at the end of the 70s. However, the reality is that he is probably the greatest sadist of all these directors, the form of his films, which often undermines their content, their very office performances are always proportional to their blinding visions. <br /> <br /> 11. Spielberg's inability to connect with any "always" character and the joy he has shown for filming forest fires, falling aircraft, etc. People running from dinosaurs, sharks, nazis, statues, stones, etc. That's what Spielberg rejoices. At the moment his characters stop, they talk about everything. "Amistad" as the film did not succeed, in other words, because not enough black was dead and too many white were spoken. <br /> <br /> 12. The movie's scenes do not match the standard that has been "Top Gun" a few years ago. Of course, if your "enemy" is a forest fire, it's hard to make a cinema. <br /> <br /> 13. Deficiencies such as "1941", "Hook", "Always" etc. are often more enlightening to Spielberg's more successful films. They reveal the steel scheme under the technique. They show what the amusement park looks like when it doesn't work, revealing the vacuum under the broken machine. <br /> <br /> 5/10 ?? Here is one good sequence (two actors in the room, just improvisation), but this is mostly an irritating picture with a predictable script. <br /> <br /> One view is worth it.
