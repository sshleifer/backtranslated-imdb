Last fall (2001) I took the film class taught by the director of this film (Mark Hoeger). His extensive knowledge of filmmaking, his ability to split every film scene and his award at the Academy Award in some hidden categories seemed to him to be more credible than your average independent film director. When he mentioned at one of his classes that he had just finished driving the "Full Race" movie and was in the post-production stages, my interest was tortured. But that would be the last thing I'd ever hear about this film project. Until last week ... <br /> <br /> Last week, I saw in the TV list "Full Ride" on WB network. This immediately highlighted the red flag because I can't help but associate WB with teensploitation exhibitions such as Dawson's Creek, Charmed, etc. PLUS, the fact that Full Ride is released directly to TV, was not in itself too flattering. But since then, I gave up this time and sat down to see my former film teacher. <br /> <br /> After two hours and the final credits started to roll, I was thinking long and hard about what I had just seen. What I just saw was a typical WB-quality exhibition that stretches for two hours. In fact, it seemed that this film would only be made on the WB network. Criticizing this film is basically similar to criticizing a typical WB exhibition. <br /> <br /> Where to start? The characters are low, the story is meaningful in every sense, the scenes are fully structured and character development is forced and unbelievable. This film simply cries out "unoriginal". <br /> <br /> The main character, Matt Sabo, is some hot picture from the wrong side (literally) who plays a solid high school football revolution, but tends to live a life of crime. He is then offered a full-travel scholarship instead of a prison sentence. He obviously agrees to play football with all the stars of the football team without much choice, but he is not excluded from his peers because his poor team spirit and bad attitude are bad. <br /> <br /> Then love comes. Of course! Where would this predictable fan be for love? He is in the form of Amy Lear (playing beautiful Meredith Monroe). He is actually a pleasant character, as opposed to more and more abrasive Matt Sabo, so we almost praise him when he first rejects him. But of course it is inevitable. He falls against him, changes his attitude to everything and everything looks good and happy. But now is the time for conflict! <br /> <br /> Earlier in Amy, Matt makes it clear that he doesn't want to score with him because it would be a disgrace for him and his mother. It's a lot for Matt and his football buddies (yes, they'll end up warming up with him) who will bet on him that he won't get anything. But, of course, Matt will eventually accept these terms and decide he's not all about nookie. Where the exciting plot thickens. If you don't want me to destroy this surprise, leave it. <br /> <br /> [BEGIN SPOILER] <br /> <br /> Matt thinks that some local boys will always try to score every year with the All-Star team so he can try to use him to escape his the life of a small town, working in a cafe (which is first of all puzzled) and doing it in a big city. Maybe he realized that he had been used and that his love was disgraceful, Matt was tempted to return to the crime scene and leave the football camp before the "big game". Amy tries to convince her that she was really in love this time, but she's too hot to buy it. So what does Matt do? Will he take him back? Or is he going back to the abduction of gas stations and is a comprehensive jerk? I will not destroy the extremely surprising end for you. <br /> <br /> [END SPOILER] <br /> <br /> So when I was able to pump this movie, please understand it was my sarcasm and not the real enthusiasm. This movie is "Varsity Blues" or "Summer Catch." And it doesn't talk much. There is hardly any comedy to record it and the characters are too low. So what did you leave? Not much. <br /> <br /> What I disliked most about the film was how many images that Nebraska painted through this movie are Hoeger. He seems to have tried to catch the nature of Nebraska's rural areas and the lives of teenagers in small towns, but his approach is too stereotypical and low. The great hopes of the characters in the "big city" and the actions taken for it are largely exaggerated, and it only complements the Nebraska stereotype, which is a living hicks of farm societies. I'm not sure if Hoeger's intentions were the focus of his home country, but I think he was a very shameful product. If Hoeger wanted to portray Nebraska in a favorable light, he would have made a note or two from Alexander Payne. While Payne simply selects Nebraska as the backdrop for his films, Hoeger integrates it into a full-fledged plot and becomes so confused that he realizes where he has let him finish the superficial garbage that seems to come from outside. If Hoeger really lived here, you think he knows it better. <br /> <br /> I am completely disappointed with Hoeger's first big movie and hope that next time he will get his knowledge a bit original to create something different and thought-provoking.
