This movie goes to my "worst movies" file. I have a copy of the movie I watch when I want to laugh, and it's not even comedy. I'm disappointed that such big actors agreed to be in such a waste bin. This film is inaccurate (in hockey imagery), offensive (for Canadians) and I wasn't even all impressed. Even the story was a bit weak. If you've never seen this movie, you're happy. If you have, then I'm sorry.
