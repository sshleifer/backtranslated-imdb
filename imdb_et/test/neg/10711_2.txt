The creators are asking for a tremendous incredible stop, giving them the hope that they will be given little time to convince you that this is possible. Unfortunately, for TV movies, they seem to have specifically prepared cheap Cosmo questionnaires for movies. With a small budget and big claims, you should spend every penny on the details to convince the audience. Not here though. The movie gets a couple of points for the good result that the two leading ladies are in conflict with, but unfortunately it is not enough to save the day. Oh, and the less you talk about what ends, the better. Good movies for everyone!
