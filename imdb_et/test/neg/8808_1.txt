There are bad movies and then there are movies that are even worse. It's just that. <br /> <br /> The movie is just bad at all points. The plot, the actor, the camera work, the music and everything else are absolutely terrible and I can't understand how such a trash can put on the big screen. <br /> <br /> It's simple that the saw is full. with holes in the plot. The beginning is tempting and leaves much to be expected, but it does not last and the plot becomes completely ridiculous and absurd. The film is not creative and does not leave you with a single trust. People who claim that this movie is nice, violent, sadistic, and frightening, are sister girls who have nightmares after watching CSI because it's far from it. <br /> <br /> So I warn you that you do not try to look at it if you have some form of intellect because you are disappointed. A real cage and a mediocre movie that may be.
