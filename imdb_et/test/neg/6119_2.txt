I liked the fame of the entire Ceasar Palace, the Roman guards, and the Tangas. This event also marked a "torch pass" when the WWF voice goes. Gorilla Monsoon, who had been playing for each WWF PPV until then, opens and gives a typical introduction that looks like he's another PPV. But then Jim Ross introduces his WWF debut and JR continues to make WWF comments to this day. But outside of this, this event is pure garbage. The scientific wrestling of good oil has been thrown out of the window and the birth of gimmicks has been entered. It was an event for me that WWF started to go to the toilet and did not recover until the end of the 90s. Here is an overview of the event. <br /> <br /> The title of IC title: Tatanka (Challenger) vs Shawn Michaels (champion): Okay opener, but given what Shawn can do, it was very disappointing. I have no idea why WWF was a devil to put Tatanka over. They should understand that Shawn was the future and Tatanka was just one giant wrestler in Gimick, India. The end of the game itself was very flat. Shawn grabs the ref and pulls him out, then sends him out. Although it was fun to watch Sherri's follow-up, this game was simply forgotten. Shawn had to play this game and had difficulty. <br /> <br /> Stenier Brothers v. Headsrinkers: Steiners wins Franknsteiner. There were moments in this match, but the crowd just didn't seem to. There was no heat behind it, I think it was just a match to throw two tags into the team. <br /> <br /> Crown vs. Doink the Clown: TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! This game sucks completely. Two very flat tricks. Clown and Hawaii, dressed in odd colors. Completion hit everyone by surprise. In the coming months, Crush's heel and Doink's face turned, but no fan seemed to care. Unfortunately, this wasn't the worst match on the map. <br /> <br /> Razor Ramon vs Bob Backland: You have a brand new heel that is very much like a wrestler who was forgotten about ten years ago. Fans laugh and laugh when Backlund comes out. And like Hogan / Rock WM18 and HHH / Owen WM14, the heel of the wrestler carries a more prominent face. Fortunately, this game was short. The right man won, but I want them to have Razor completely beaten and loot Backlund instead of winning a small package wherever. <br /> <br /> Tag Team Champion Match: Ted Dibiase and IRS (Champs) Hulk Hogan & Brutus Beefcake w / Jimmy Hart I'd like to know what has happened to Hogan. Oh well. The crowd was really in the game, but it had no flow. Hogan and Beefcake clearly suffered from the roundabout, as both wrestlers had been on the shelf for at least a year. Dibiase, being a great technical wrestler, contributed to the complete waste of the game. The end was a surprise with Dibiase and IRS to win through DQ. But to enjoy the crowd, Hogan and Beefcake traditionally did a crowd as they won. <br /> <br /> Lex Luger vs. Mr. Perfect: The best part of this game was the four hot chicks that sent Lex Luger around. Moreover, it was completely forgotten. Mr. Perfect's trick was born for the heel-runner and he just lacked the face of heat. And Luger is just a waste of time, no matter what the trick it is. Luger wins upside down, despite the fact that Perfect's legs were ropes. Then Perfect spends the post game, getting his butt. The first Luger strikes him with a rolling elbow. When Perfect restores consciousness, he goes back to the locker room to find Luger just to beat Shawn Michaels out of it by setting up HBK / Perfect that could have been classic but WWF abused. /> <br /> Undertaker vs. Giant Gonzales: ABSOLUTE CRAP !! What was WWF's way of thinking that brought both the terrible wrestler and Giant Gonzales. Of course he was great but I would look at Brooklyn Brawler as his game. It's not even worth commenting on. <br /> <br /> WWF CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH: Bret Hart (champ) vs Yokozuna (Challenger) You have one of the biggest technical wrestlers who stand up to the only advantage of being a giant lard. Bret was able to play the game, but quite predictable, which ended with Mr. Fuj, who threw salt on Bret's face. <br /> <br /> POST MATCH: Yokozuna vs. Hulk Hogan Pure crap here. Hogan drops around for no apparent reason, and Mr. Fuji challenges him after Yoko just won the title. Even the dead Hulkancsid find it to be a complete BS.
