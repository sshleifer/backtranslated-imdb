I had seen Rik Mayall in Blackadder and New Stateman, so I thought I'd give it a try. <br /> <br /> About 16:00 I bought it, at around 20:00 I started to watch, about 15.15. Next, I continued to broadcast the remaining movie to see if the person with the brain was again observable, but there was no. At around 8:25 am I threw a DVD into a DVD. And that's the "movie". <br /> <br /> What happened to British humor? Humor so good and witty, intelligent and skillful that you will find Yes, Minister, Blackadder, Dibley Victor, Fawlty Towers or The Fast Show? Black humor Great Britain is so famous? I don't want to offend anyone, but I assume that even foolish children won't find it funny. They deserve more intelligent fun. And Rik Mayall, you can do better, so please!
