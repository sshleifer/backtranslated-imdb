I think it's two years ago because I've seen the movie and so far it's the worst movie I've ever seen. The only thing I thought after seeing this movie was that it was made for some taxation. So after all this time I lost my intestine;) And now IMDb says I have to fill 10 lines with comments: <br /> <br /> "Sorry, you have to include at least 10 lines in your comment (edit BACK , if it is not a new window). "<br /> <br /> Please do not say anything ... <br /> <br /> Sorry for some bad English.
