It is amazing that such a clich√©-left yuppie angst movie actually came first. The characters are so weak and so unbearable that it is impossible to take care of them - especially Brooke Shields. The temptation to move fast from slow parts is almost irresistible. If you like this genre, it would be better to rent "Singles" or "Bodies, Rest & Motion".
