The only way I feel in my life about passing on these precious minutes is everyday, saying someone how terrible it was. And even if I say it once a day, every day throughout my life, I don't get my point completely. Just stupid. <br /> <br /> In these films there are differences and movies like Elephant or Fat Guy Goes Nutzoid, two of my least favorite films. The last two were terrible, yes, but it was so. Evan Almighty takes a strong cast and tries to kill them all. Wanda Sykes, Jonah Hill, John Goodman and Steve Carrell ... Why God Why! All these people have much better talents, now every time I see them, I mean this terrible film. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this one instead of one was when I saw the movie, an elderly woman with a mental challenge, who thought it was a bird poop and a tool-injury while jokes were so funny that he didn't stop laughing all the time, almost a few times out.
