Lord David Cecil wrote an interesting book in the 1930s on EARLY VICTORIAN NOVELISTS, where he watched works by Dickens, Thackeray, Eliot, Trollope, Mrs Gaskelli, Charlotte Bronte and Emily Bronte. He chose these writers as a popular favorite in the first half of the Victorian period and explained their strengths and weaknesses (as he saw them) to the public. Some of his comments are quite relevant today, but as with any criticism, it also gives the critic a timeless life. <br /> <br /> Cecil was thinking of George Eliot (Mary Ann Cross), who wrote about seven or eight books (including sketches and poetry). But for the most advanced readers, they are usually familiar with their shortest book, SILAS MARNER, which is still in the curriculum of some high school. Other books, FELIX HOLT, RADICAL, DANIEL DERONDA, MIDDLEMARCH, MILL ON FLOSS, ADAM BEDE, ROMOLA, CLERICAL LIFE SCENES, are still printed (for example, most of them are printed on the penguin) but are mostly unread. Today's most interesting is his latest novel, DERONDA, where he discusses English society Jews and the original, Hessian type Zionism. ROMOLA is his only attempt in a historical novel (about the Savanarola experiment in a religiously pure republic in Florence in the 1490s). His most recent novel is the MIDDLEMARCH, which in 1832 deals with the English society of the province, the great reform of Lord Gray. I had to read the College MIDDLEMARCH for the literature course. This is definitely a thoughtful book (Virginia Woolf called it the most adult book in English). But it suffers (like all Elioti novels) from one defect - he can't write a living, exciting prose. Although Dickens is occasionally overwhelming and Thackeray may become pompous and prolific, and Trollope may change (as Lord Cecil says) very common in his discussion, and Charlotte Bronte is unable to explain certain relationships well, and Mrs Gaskell seems to be the best solution for all characters with female characters ( and Emily Bronte in her single novel) reader interest. Reading most of Eliot's novels is like trying to punish marble blocks with toothpicks! <br /> <br /> Currently I have read about fifty pages of MILL OF THE FLOSS. I note that one of the other reviewers did not finish the novel. But I have read a summary of what it is. The customs drivers (Maggie and his brother Tom) are central figures - they have a title mill. While Maggie falls in love at the beginning of the story, she falls in love with the neighbor's son, whose father has legal difficulties with Mr Tulliver's Sr. Tom treats this relationship as dull and the tragedy of the story is related to sharing between the siblings, which ended with their ending (Maggie goes back to the mill to save Tom during a severe flood and they die together). It must have been successful for Victorian readers, but for today's audience it is very grim and depressing. <br /> <br /> The film changed a little bit late - Maggie (Geraldine Fitzgerald) dies with her lover and Tom (James Mason) records her deaths in her recording book. The story is completely rewritten, except for the double death at the end of the flood. It doesn't really help things. Although Fitzgerald and Mason are doing their parts well, they can't really pull the movie alone. The end result is a fairly small film, which, fortunately, did not lead to a managerial career. The only other remark is that the boy played Frank Lawton, who two years earlier played David Copperfield as he grew up against W.C. Fields, Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan. But then Lawton never had a bigger film career - he just happened to be around the pictures, some good, some mediocre.
