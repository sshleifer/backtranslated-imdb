The graph of this movie is similar to the original. Someone can be kidnapped, the prince is incest with his rescue, Odet turns into Swan, turtle / frog / puffin first "bad" magician as well as possible and finally .... Anyway, not much new here. Except for the lack of known talent for votes. Sorry, neither Palance nor Cleese, and so Jean-Bob was disappointed.
