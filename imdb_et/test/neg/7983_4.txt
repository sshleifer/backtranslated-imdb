"Reckless" doesn't know much about what seems right, starting with a title (thanks to Craig Lucas, a scriptwriter who adapted his game, bringing the title with him) and continuing to pain (Mia Farrow played her wife) to Tony Goldwyn, who is young enough to be his son ). The couple lives in an idyllic world of winter, which seems to be the snowman's interior, but Farrow gets an amazing dose of reality when he admits he's hired a man to kill him. He escapes into the night, taking refuge with a very strange couple who wants to help him restore his life. The design and artistic direction of "Reckless" production is good, but these are services that are offered for a completely nasty, often alienating scenario. It should be a dark holiday comedy, although it is lost with this unique, occasional offensive material. * 1/2 from ****
