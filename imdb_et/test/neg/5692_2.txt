You see a movie titled "battlespace", what do you mean? Space battles cool like hell explosions and everyone is shooting each other. What do you get with this movie? Well, you get the goodness of the battle of your space, but most of the time it's just stupid people who almost travel around. NOT ONE WAY !!!! What is it nonsense? We get narrators and tons of British computers, but that's something. The main protagonist must be the worst I've ever seen because he doesn't even have any dialogue and dreams, though scenes (literally!). Some of the things that happen are just foolish as they use the rocket (like going into space) on the main transportation planet, why not just use one of these spacecraft? In any case, the music is an almost non-existent, boring, boring, lifeless specimen, but the main thing you notice is the Atari sound effects that ships use ... you have to joke me. I can also say that the budget was low because everything seems to be fake, which is not what you would expect from a movie, especially what should be a super cool space battle movie. I seriously think that the budget must be double, that is so bad, so you laugh more than you should, how normal it is. I'm starting to think they're paying the actors for how much dialogue they had, because there are very few of them (if you can't say that it's my main handle, as I probably said three times).
