I'm in the film class and I know I don't know everything about the movie, but it's really one of the worst, stupid, slower and wasteful times, movies I've ever seen and I saw NAPOLEAN DYNAMICS. they are both equally awful. Conrack is boring and nothing interesting happens in the movie, it's not really a warming heart story and Pat Conroy won't let anything! I'm not saying that you should fight and beat, but it would enliven it more than a wonderful movie. the kids they want to act in this movie can be real kids on yammacraux island that sounded stupid and couldn't do as much as i'm worried that it was a stupid book idea and even worse idEa from movie I don't know why this movie was even made, deviantly five of the worst movies of all time.
