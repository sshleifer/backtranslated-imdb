Fortunately, I haven't seen this movie on the big screen, but on a small screen video. I doubt I would have been able to sit in the cinema and watch all the violence in the film. After watching the first 30 minutes I became both frustrated and curious. <br /> <br /> Disappointed because it is difficult to follow the story, scarcely understandable screens, great aggression - I still don't know why I was shown that Daesu (the main character) pulls another person's teeth out, his wildness for women, he cut your language out. And also curious to see what the film says as a summary of the end of this brutality. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, although the movie was not boring, I didn't get the answer to all the cruelty I had to look at from beginning to end. In my opinion, if you want blood and want to laugh, then Kill Bill 1-2, if you want more blood meaningfully, you can take some recent warfare and if you want an Eastern movie, there are many better titles out there. Later, I will take the Cannes Film Festival ratings more cautiously, because when Oldboy got a lot of praise, he didn't have much to say to me, and I only had 4/10 on my scale. <br /> <br /> I am hungry to see some beautiful, harmonious, true feelings and clear messages.
