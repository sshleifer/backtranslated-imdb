A terrible terrible movie for television. Once again in life, we will be led by a predictable triangle; funny woman to get stupid, unknown woman who is another stupid guy who has no idea. <br /> <br /> I see these movies seeing. You may ask why do I look at them? I have no idea. Usually mistaken. And the movie is so bad that I can't get out of it. Waiting for the bitch to get her pence. And usually I'm not happy with how he gets his desserts. <br /> <br /> Now that you can believe in your vixen, does it steal embryos from clinics and how do you do that? Without blood tests, DNA, research and recommendations. He will continue to be a real estate agent, Gabrielle Rose, who is with him in the yard of a house for sale in daylight and no one can see him? She kills her mother, Susan Hogan, and you could predict this assumption when her mother says she mentions that she is allergic to peanuts and that the pills used to fight this allergy are her pocketbook. Guess? I will not continue this. <br /> <br /> Finally, you were left alone with your wife and wife. Well good triumph for evil, but too slow. Victoria Pratt as an evil girlfriend is enough in her role, looking a little too uncomfortable and probably. Tori Spelling is almost for the empty majority. He has these big big eyes of Bette Davis that look like they're out of their heads. I liked it better at TRICK. And the Smurf Puppy plays a man who is going around, securing his wife, that he and his former girlfriend are nothing, even though he has been very strange with him all over the city, standing half naked in his house when he sent her away. city ​​overnight. Yet he still denies romance. <br /> <br /> Life will never lose viewers with their false plots and stories about women and their foolish men. I'd like to give this chestnut a "0" rating.
