First of all, I don't see how the movie is on the "best" list or how it won the prizes. Compared to the La Pianists, which is also in the "best" list, La Pianiste is gold. This movie didn't have so many things on so many different levels, but I can't quite explain why I didn't like that much. The main actor was annoying, I felt I would never know what was going on, and I was BORED! Although it was going to be a useful life change that Pierre started, I wanted it to end as soon as possible. Why was it supposed to be his sister and cousin? Ugh. And why did Thibault understand? He was just two-sided. And was it for me or did I lose the whole purpose of this black man? Who were all the people who played the big warehouse music? Why do they have all these strange devices and weapons and all the extra spaces where people live? I mean it seriously, but is it a lot of French culture? European culture? I took five years to learn about culture, and I've never heard of it!
