Lowe returns to the nest after a second, unsuccessful relationship to find that he has been assigned to the jury. It is planned, somehow, to get out of it when he realizes that the defendant is a girl he has severely crushed since first class. <br /> <br /> Living in the past, telling other people his feelings about this girl (played by Camp), Lowe remembers these feelings and does his best to explain the murder attempt camp while staying away from the real bad guys and succeeding in creating successful film At the same time, I have heard that St Augustine is the oldest city in the United States and I also know that he has a relationship with Ponce de Leon, so the background is a good place to start. Unfortunately, this is the only thing in the movie. The local police are unfair, the judge is an idiot, and the defender makes every effort to make him look like Joanie Cunningham! I do not know whether to blame the director for a bad direction, or just to let the pain get so miserable. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie was so boring that I couldn't even go through it! 1 out of 10 stars!
