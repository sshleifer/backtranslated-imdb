Having just opened a cheap nail shop, I thought it was worth looking into whether all of them were cheap DVDs that looked good. And when the back of the lid made it like a Jeepers Creepers-type movie, it's actually an anthology movie! and I thought one or two stories would be very familiar. Plots: <br /> <br /> One story: classic. <br /> <br /> The young couple feels it's time to try to prove their financial life by grabbing a $ 1,500 car. But when a man goes to pick a car, the car starts talking to him. The car (called Banns) says that in order to get everything he ever wanted in life, he has to buy Baansi for $ 5,000. The relationship is getting worse, Baans does everything he can to show who is actually responsible. <br /> <br /> Story 2: Rock Culture. thanks to the dirty her apartment, she discovered that the tuna has been kept in the refrigerator for six months, now shaped and turned into a green, formal version. The big fall leads to the final battle to see if the real man or his fridge survives the clone. <br /> <br /> Third Story: Too Good to be True. <br /> <br /> Girl enrolls in dating agency and she can match wi her man who is perfect for her. But she's not sure boy is too perfect, and if she thinks she sees her "stuck" , he's gonna start. View of the movie: <br /> <br /> The first thing I have to mention is the movie rating in England, where he has been given eighteen ratings, even thought it had no nudity, no swear or blood. Everything. And the other strange thing about all the stories is that they all have a happy ending where good wins will win. And when the first story is too close to Stephen King's classic Christine, the second story is just a movie highlighting, the story of Tom Parkinson seems to be a low budget Muppets episode! <br /> <br /> Final movie view <br /> <br /> Although he has a little "remake"; the feeling that they are shy enough to be a good comedy of horror.
