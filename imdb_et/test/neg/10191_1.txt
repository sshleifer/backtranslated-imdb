I just happened to stumble on this movie and checked IMDb for more information: Score 6.7, well ... not so bad. Genre: Scifi ... good, I like scifi. So I got a movie and I was waiting for a relaxing Sunday night watching it. But ... NO. <br /> <br /> As a whole, it's not a movie at all. This is a religious advertisement that includes: telling the end of Jesus, the god, the devil, the world, and so on. The film begins with a story of epic robbery: driving at night, car stops, bright light and so on ... Well, actually it was a movie. The last one ... to be honest, I don't know what to call it ... was the end of the world and the last decision. The very same things that these TV preachers tell you, but they are "good." <br /> <br /> Frankly, if you don't see a sci-fi movie or anything with UFOs, please stay far from this "thing." It has nothing to do with them. If you want to hear some kind of head, what the Bible has to say and what you should do. Then go ahead and look at this "thing" but still prefer to go to church on Sunday. <br /> <br /> It's a complete bull. (and evangelical Christian propaganda, as other users said - Well ... before I got the movie, I should have commented on other red users. <br /> <br /> (27% of voters rated it as "10" please to do your propaganda.
