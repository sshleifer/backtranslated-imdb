It has been said that there are some people who actually see ADMIRE Monogram movies. Well - and why not? Monogram Studios lived on a cost-based basis; cost, plus enough to pay rent and buy pizza and bottles of strong muscat every time. Of course, they are cheap. But be honest: they are coarse, fast, Philistine, vulgar, but inspiring. They have no claims. They are meant to target the audience for two hours under two bills. What if John Wayne runs through the Wild West along a road covered with phone mails? It's not art, it's entertainment. <br /> <br /> Take this movie "Flight to Mars". At first, when we first meet the characters, the man can suddenly introduce his female companion, avoiding any annoying nuances: "Professor, this is my bride and assistant, who is a rocket scientist and a beautiful woman. packed, maybe you can steal her, marry her, give her kids and a mated garden she misses. She saw her dreams understand, and she likes a little harsh. "It saves a lot of writing and recording time, isn't it? People mean this when they say the narrative is "fast". (It was kicked for five days.) Why should we talk about these things? I mean, what the hell is this, cheap sci fi movie or Henry James? In fact, this is a particularly well-funded example of a monogram movie. It's a color, one thing. "Cinecolor" is accurate. (You can say that this is not another "color" you would feel.) And look cast. Women's lead is forbidden, as is the case with the Monogram, but the male leaders are definitely on the B list. Cameron Mitchell as a reporter, but he hit his step as a male leader who thought about it, never did it. And Arthur Franz as the head of the flue pipe, Perth Amboy, the pride of New Jersey. And - for the fans of scientific literature - how is this ace pair: both Morris Ankrum and John Litel! There's really no point in describing the plot in detail. The land of the crash of five crew members on Mars, where they find an underground civilization, with organisms whose evolution was isomorphic to us, up to their five numbers and the babies that are fascinated by short skirts. And they took English to listen to our programs. American broadcasts, ie based on their speech. They are led by an unhappy Kabbal who tries to hijack a spaceship, build many imitations and colonize the earth. They will not succeed. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not very special. Men are walking in a couple of free sets, wearing black suits with a stylized flash that is worn on their chest, and behind them are bright reds. Their names consist of English only - Alzar, Terris, Ikron. The lissome martin that falls on Arthur Franz is called Alita, a small addition to the Indo-European, and he already knows what kissing is. <br /> <br /> In general, I found it funny because it was intended but boring. The story is any of Buck Rogers' 1930s series. When the crops and the marques meet and it is established that they have a common language and that the Marques have a bad agenda, that is the case. After two hours, even the indifferent scriptwriter could change the story of the Nazi spies of the Second World War. The plot is made by numbers, dialogue is not shining, the actor is a pedestrian. <br /> <br /> The enthusiastic enthusiasts of monogram directors should enjoy it. After all, Jean-Luc Goddard, the French ovarian head, dedicated the monogram "A Bout de Souffl√©" so that they were not so bad.
