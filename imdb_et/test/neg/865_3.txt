I've just seen Caribe a couple of nights back at the annual Visto film festival that took place here in Dallas, and I have to express my dissatisfaction. The title of the opening attempts to tell us that the film represents the current invasion of North American oil companies in the countries of South America (Costa Rica, in this case) and the negative impact of this invasion on both the economy and the environment. The main characters are the married couple who live a simple and pleasant life while maintaining a banana farm. She arrives immediately and tells her she is a woman's half-sister. I do not intend to make any clarifications on this (and frankly, I do not feel that I am breaking this review), another important point is that the company to which they distribute their bananas falls on them in a bad economy. So, the main conflict that should be dealt with in the film is between the husband and the stone, trying to maintain their livelihood. On the one hand, the Reynolds oil company has basically offered it work and financial compensation (mainly bribe) to use its public influence to encourage the city to allow the company to start drilling in its own city (damaging its views with the community and community) itself). On the other hand, he is facing dead but on the side of his community, protesting drilling. Given the length of this movie, there would have been enough time to look into the problems just described, but it just won't happen and I'll tell you why. You will notice that this movie has so far won a couple of awards, one for the direction and the audience award. I don't want to choose Esteban's direction, it wasn't so bad or good that I would be all passionate about writing. The audience's award was at the film festival in Spain and, in order to get the audience's award, I have to imagine that the Spanish people are just digging on soap operas. In fact, Central and South American digging soap operas, I know a lot. I assume that Esteban wanted to take advantage of it or that he himself digs soap operas because it happens in this film, so much that it hits the entire oil company's plot almost half. as if they would see half of this film making it tiring, as it seems that at least three supportive characters have their own back story, and the development of the character has seriously damaged the space for more sexual and crying scenes. The only real villain in the movie is one of these three characters and you really can't find out who the fuck is. It is almost the same as interrupting their screen time to completely remove the movie. From time to time, they play oil against a community plot, but at best they are mines. What we see much more is passion, jealousy, betrayal, adultery, and so on. These topics saturate the story to such an extent that the oil company sub-block becomes unnecessary. It's almost like a stunt that a legitimate romantic drama (soap opera) is of little political importance. Nevertheless, the film gets so romantic that it ultimately does not know what to do with itself, which results in the ending that you have left to think about what you have been waiting for, or to have something to start with. Here are two things that I think could have saved this movie: either the half-sister cut out or cut off the oil company. It is obvious which of the two was more interested. Or, if Caribe had been for an hour, they would all have done it. Regardless of whether I had a good straight soap opera and I think that the issue of oil producers using foreign countries is indispensable for the film community. Caribe is both. These two corners could have worked together if they were balanced, but with a romantic plot around, and almost twice as much time as the oil platform needed to get started, both sides suffer. Best of all, the romance plot has never even been solved. I would like to say that I watch this movie again to see what I miss, but I have a strong feeling that I already know what it is. As for me, it wouldn't matter if I saw Caribe ten more times. I haven't got it because it's just not there.
