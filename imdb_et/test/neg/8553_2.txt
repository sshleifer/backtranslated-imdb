Dirty female clinging slides from the midnight movie barrel, combining the flesh gap and the tougher girls-in-the-shower clich√©s. Linda Blair plays innocent in prison (we learn that she was involved in running a car), being in a big house in a difficult time where some of the studs were on the side of Russ Meyer's picture. Blair is constantly viewed, punctured, raped, humiliated and harassed. Dialogue is a four-word word disgusting all the time, and the flick does not offer its violence and stupidity. However, some viewers see it as camp class, although this language is not enough cheek. * from ****
