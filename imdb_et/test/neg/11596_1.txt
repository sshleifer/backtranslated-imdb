So, Wynorski repeats the curse of Komodo the second time, this time replacing the original with interesting characters with a number of unpleasant environmentalists / anti-capitalists. And he adds Cobra. Most of the film is about listening to the righteous symbols that are evil around the capitalist pigs, while the cavalcade of this condenser has setbacks on what happened on the island before they got there. DNA experiments were carried out, critters began to grow, people talked to each other without morally better twitches and the like. Needless to say, it would have been a much better film if they had made the movie back and forgot the do-gooders for the holidays. I do not forget that there are a couple of short scenes where no matter what your boyfriend gets off one by one, but they are probably less than 2% of the movie. The main event that places our title characters against one another takes about one minute and is as exciting as watching the latest Dino-Crisis video games. <br /> <br /> Action is a general, even type of movie. Half of the actors seem to be more interested in pronouncing each last syllable of each word than to talk about their dialogue in any credible way. <br /> <br /> I made it to the end, but this is one of the movies I would like to record and watch later, because there are many parts that need to be transmitted quickly. In general, I give one effort to this effort, he has absolutely no element to watch the B-film. It is a sad day indeed, if you can honestly say that the filmmakers could have learned to watch Boa and Python.
