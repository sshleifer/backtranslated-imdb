this movie was incredibly stupid, which meant what was ever. I fell badly on all the actors and actors who destroyed their careers there. the whole film was based on how unreal they could do to make it a little, which made it even a stupider. even some names were unrealistic. the movie is fun to watch, so it had 2 stars out of 10. this is probably the third film ever made. I really got after I realized it was mostly adult participants who were still a child. the most disturbing was Danny Trejo's horror actor, who is always dirty. the other participants were very clean for me.
