waste 1h45 this nasty little movie is one to avoid, its like cheap badly drawn cross between saw and some other recent movies robbery, why the writer wrote this is obvious .. they have no soul and made it try and give me some money. The twists were obvious when those who were in danger could escape, they made it obvious and did not. The only good thing is that I discovered 1 new actress worth watching. there are too many funny movies, not what makes you unhappy and think less to the world. Spend your time watching smarter movies, doing some exercises, baking a nice meal ... all but wasting your time on the trash like this
