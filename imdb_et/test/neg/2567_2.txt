Dr Steven Segal will save the world from a deadly virus outbreak. This film strikes me as a foolish reality that has fallen into an unwelcome camp class (the best). The memorable lines include: "Knowledge is like deer. Share it and it runs away from you" and "Drink it. It makes you feel better." It is so badly bad - they couldn't have done it worse when they tried. <br /> <br /> Segal is trying to convince you that he is first sensitive - rescuing the pony; 2. good father - saccharin cooking scene for his daughter; 3rd science man - looking at a fake spectrum; 4. In line with nature - using homeopathic medicines; 5. Politically correct and multicultural - with Indian friends; 6. Iconoclast - opening a rural practice after a former life in a national laboratory; and Action 7 - Being really greasy but still fighting. ROTFL. <br /> <br /> It's good to see a late-night Saturday flick, with friends, preferably (but not necessarily!) Inebriated.
