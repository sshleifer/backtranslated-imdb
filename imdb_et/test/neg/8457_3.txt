"Terrorist in the corridors" may seem like a terrible fan, but it is actually very few. It looks like it is a decent and versatile (too versatile?) Range of Horror / Thriller fragments that are considered classic, but what's the point? The purpose of this documentary is mainly a horror-loving public, so we've all seen these clips, aren't they? The only thing really worthy of this project is editing. If you're behind screams, whistle murderers, and such things, "Terror in the Aisles" has some clean summaries of the most famous sequences. All these different scenes are hanging with a lame wraparound story starring Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen, who sit in the cinema. There is an address between the two sequences and the viewer explains why we love so much. These calls are, of course, complicated and quite obvious (we are afraid of our nature ... bla bla bla) and I don't understand why many people love this idea. It's worth a peek when you're a loyal horror blower, but it's definitely not an important watch. On the contrary: if you still have a classic genre title, be careful that its pieces don't violate your future viewing. The main reason I didn't like it at all was that it consistently ignores much less well-known but basic (external) headlines that focus infinitely on "Halloween." However, this will bring some funny jokes when Donald Pleasance screams the screen in his own way.
