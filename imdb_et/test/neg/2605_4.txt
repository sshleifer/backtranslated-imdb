It could have been great. Voice commands are exactly right and suitable for T.-. The appearance of characters, mostly supportive or alphabetically, exactly the same. The same boring face for every face with only minor changes such as hairline or weight. It seems strange to see a really great guest star voice that comes out of the inanimate form, like the signs here. If I'm not mistaken, Kathy Griffin made a voice over this show and seemed too funny to be funny. <br /> <br /> There are some other problems, one of which is the family plot. The Simpsons did it much better if you could actually buy most of the situations that the characters themselves had. Here we get too many annoying anomalies, like someone with a weird fantasy, and then we should find that funny, but for some reason the delivery is a bit out. As you probably say, it's hard for me to show exactly what's wrong with this exhibition because it's nothing more than a Simpson clone or even more about "Married with children". <br /> <br /> If I had to show my finger to what was totally wrong, it would probably be repetitive. Peter Griffin is not really a bright character, but neither of them is the other. Lois should have been called Lois Lame because she is kind of one-dimensional. Seth Green as a slowed son is the best show for this show and is the most stereotypical part of the show. <br /> <br /> What else to say. There is nothing wrong with this exhibition, but in the long run, you have to admit that it is a lot of work to do in Simpson's almost two decades.
