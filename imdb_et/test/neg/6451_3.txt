This film was low for both Jason Robard and Sam Peckin. The main plot points are taken directly from Sergio Leone's masterpiece "Once upon a Time in the West" (published two years earlier and in addition to Robards): The man finds a hole to be found in the desert, which is the only water many miles away from any direction, he plans to build "station" around the hole and ensure that there is love interest, he falls in love with a prostitute. Add an unreasonable preacher, bad music, foolish quick action shots, even quieter R&D shots - and you go there. There are few questions why this post office failed. The real question is "how did it get so far?".
