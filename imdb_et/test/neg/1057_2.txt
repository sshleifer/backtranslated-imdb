(Warning: some front spoilers.) <br /> <br /> What is an incredibly dirty film. This makes Iron Eagle 2 good. <br /> <br /> The story is: Rutger Hauer gets his friend Banning (Robert Patrick) off to prevent him from shooting an airplane filled with Iraq. innocent civilians. Six years later, Holiday returns to revenge. Among other things, he sat in the tank, Banning (now the Colonel) and his pregnant wife across the field. He manages to peel and refuel at the same time. After the tank has pumped the tank, it stays wonderfully and steals the fighter plane. By doing so, he will shoot down some Allied combatants before they attack NATO headquarters, trying to kill Banning's wife. <br /> <br /> The extra bonus is that the big Baxter (who is resting in his office) has placed the rank symbol on the right shoulder upside down. Elegant.
