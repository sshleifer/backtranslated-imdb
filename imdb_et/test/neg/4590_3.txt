Leave me alone. How can one say that this is a "good hockey movie"? I know the films tend to do pretty much *** - a bad job of portraying ice hockey to the public. And yes, it was back if the US did not take our sport to the extent it is today, but actually. I've been playing hockey all my life and watching more, and that's my friends honestly. The scenes of the ice were incredibly bizzare ... the specific case I refer to is the "sword fight", and I mean the "fight" at the end of the film ... during which everyone is just moving around and looking, not with the enchantment that it actually happens, but wonder who wins the duel between Youngblood and his genius Rakkie. Yes, the story is a little better, I emphasize LITTLE. <br /> <br /> I don't know, maybe there's no point in continuing ... I mean, we're seeing: the movie is right. Hockey is just one big battle on the ice ... oh yes, with a small vulcanized rubber that bounces from time to time around what is loosely called "the goal." Youngblood is terrible or hysterical, I don't understand what ... maybe someone else has more luck.
