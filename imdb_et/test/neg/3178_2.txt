Not in Esperanto in this movie <br /> <br /> I was watching this movie just because IMDb lists Esperanto as one of the languages ​​used. However, IMDb has been mistaken for the languages ​​used in this movie. No Esperanto at all. It's almost all English with the words of Navajo. Don't watch this movie when you're looking for Esperanto movies. Instead, "Idiot's Joy" (with Clark Gable), which has a bit of Esperanto, "Incubus" is all Esperanto (albeit completely misrepresented), and Charlie Chaplin's "The Great Dictator" is some of Esperanto's streets. "Gattacas" was also supposed to be Esperanto, but I never heard it. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the second reviewer is right. This movie is a complete mess. <br /> <br /> Spend some time elsewhere.
