In Madrid I got a copy of this movie. Wow! Gallo is amazing in this. The very unusual result he gives. In addition to the Gallo genius, however, the film is a boring film I've ever seen in my life and sometimes so badly that it limits the ridiculous. I am also a fan of Val Kilmer, so he was part of the reason I made a great effort to watch the movie. The problem is that Val is really just one scene. His name cast when the leader is insulting my intelligence and the rest cast. I've only seen directors from other movies. Both films are well below average, but both contain very interesting Vincent Gallo performances. If you're as much as a Gallo fan, I see this movie no matter how bad it is. If you don't like Gallo, then ZERO is in love.
