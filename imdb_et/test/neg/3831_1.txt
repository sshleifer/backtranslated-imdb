I went to the premiere last night. The film started with a bang (maybe thanks to a pre-race). The audience laughed for about 15 minutes, and most of us spent the rest of their time dreaming. This movie cannot be compared to _Spinal Tap_ or to the work of guests if you do not want to say that _Son of Provo_ has the desire that you are wrong. It just fell flat, he died, it was painful. The story went somewhere, jokes were blissful, even if you were Mormon and got all the internal jokes, it seemed like a waste of time. There were two properties of redemption: Kirby was on the ground! And the songs were very smart (LDS audience only). So, my suggestions ... Avoid the movie. And if you're Mormon, buy a music CD.
