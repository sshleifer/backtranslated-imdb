It will win me how someone can highly appreciate this movie. It is not undervalued to call it far drawn. How a man who, in such a short period of time, was able to build a wooden labyrinth of underground spaces is quite ridiculous or perhaps he was Jesus' greatest carpenter. The obese sheriff played by Hoyt Axton looked like a refugee from Jerry Springer's show and I found that blonde woman is Jennifer Jason Leigh. We have "sheep meat made from lamb in the US" that fits it perfectly. But it wasn't all bad, but I enjoyed it tremendously when the final credits rolled out and "Finally," this very amazing TV movie was released for the hot flash that would have been in movies and bargains at cinema for a while.
