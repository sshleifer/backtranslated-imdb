The action was terrible, chewy, fake, the green screen effects of CHEAP were ridiculous and the creatures were completely slow. The only good thing about this movie was the concept and the laughter I got from watching such a bad movie, so I was pretty angry because I realized I was wasting $ 4 on renting it. Why should such a movie be in theaters? I know this movie came out almost 5 years ago, but does anyone try to make movies anymore? I just write random things to fill the room because I need ten lines of text to publish this review. This next line should do just that.
