Aging Roger Moore has come back to Bond again, this time trying to find out why agent 009 was killed and why he had Faberge egg counterfeiting and from there. He arrives in New Delhi, India, then to East Germany after knowing that Russia's general is trying to explode a nuclear bomb in the circus, hoping that NATO would want total disarmament so that it could take over Western Europe, then the rest. Sounds like it's really more romance, I think between Bondi and Octopussy as an action movie and a long, but still somewhat fun. But there is too much humor in it; at times it seems to have been meant for comedy. Timothy Dalton would have been better off than Roger Moore in this respect, so there wouldn't have been so much age difference between Bond and Octopussy. <br /> <br /> Untold Trivia: The little plane Bond used in pre-credit order now hangs at Quaker Steak and Lube at Clearwater / Largo in Florida, USA. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 Off ****
