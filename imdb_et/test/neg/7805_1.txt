I saw this movie (unfortunately) because it was the only opportunity at that time and David Zucker was the director. I saw his previous "naked gun" (both parts), an airplane and a top secret! And I liked it, at least I had a good time and laughed. I'm not saying that the films were masterpieces but were OK. I can't remember any other stupid movie than that. It's incredible how the Hollywood industry is in complete decadence. If a studio spends money on getting this terrible picture, it's no surprise that such a story is more common these days. This clearly reflects the decadent civilization that produces sex symbols and stupid parcels for the entertainment of ordinary people. I have nothing to say about this movie. If you are planning to rent or buy it, do not waste your money or time, avoiding it. Even if you are a fan of one actor, it's not worth it. In fact, this can be a very good example of what a director should avoid. I don't see the Zucker movie again. (He plans to lead the fourth sequel to Scary, imagine it!). Pathetic. Awful.
