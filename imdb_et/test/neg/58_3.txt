It strikes ... <br /> <br /> This buggy ... <br /> <br /> Actions of Random Violence ... <br /> <br /> Non-Speech Voice ... <br /> < br /> Fetish wear ... <br /> <br /> It shakes the head ... <br /> <br /> It can only mean one thing ... <br /> <br /> GRACE JONES ON BACK! <br /> <br /> In fact, my sources have told me that Blade's role was not played in the 1980s, but by Wesley Snipes. <br /> <br /> All this is not an improvement. <br /> <br /> Blade is an adaptation of the comic character; somehow, from the simplified, two-dimensional world of the printed page, it has become even simpler and has lost a couple of dimensions. <br /> <br /> The piece is almost incredible and adds something to the vampire. The genre, in fact, like Nosferatu, seems to nourish the life of the audience. In a nutshell, the upwardly moving vampire wants to become more powerful, but is against Blade, half-human, half-vampire, all annoying. It all goes when Blade is put on vampire juice, some bad martial arts and the most regrettable CGI since 1968. , maybe there is a trend here?). Surely the audience should belong to the "hero"? And while a vampire can be tragic, it's not right for Blade, he is relentless cruel, scary, and not much better than bad guys. <br /> <br /> I expect Wesley Snipes to "pursue a career in a way that allows everyone to compare favorably. When he travels through his movie, you will find yourself looking for a bet - even a ball valve - something that would put Blade in the grave. <br /> <br /> Like the narcissus character, Blade is pretty much surprising - for some reason, we haven't been treated to fresh snips at the gym. Also, no other participant has any chance of giving a reasonable result; likes Steven Dorff * CAN * to act, but they have to play another violin with the tedious Snipes action. <br /> <br /> Kris Kristofferson appeared in good films, here he is a reduced culprit, which you just know you are not going to do on the final roll. And what happens when Blade discovers? Yeah, you thought he was rushing to the scene to cut his revenge on a huge underground table. <br /> <br /> Why can't world domination take place in a quiet country house? They always go down to underground cathedrals, which would have had to think of Albert Speer if they were little big. Many of these plans could stop immediately if local authorities pay more attention to the basement expansion plans. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is as dull and unimaginable as to add something new to the genre. Vampires have been made dead and maybe they should be rested for a while - at least until somebody can think about making them interesting again. <br /> <br /> There's a * Grace Jones Vampire movie to finish there, it's called a Vamp and it's about ten times better.
