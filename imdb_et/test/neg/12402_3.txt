I've read the other cage reviews of this movie, and although this is certainly not the best movie ever made in the sci-fi / horror genre, it's not bad if you agree with what it is - a low budget, a b-movie fare that (we say) "Lends heavily" like "Alien" (the nasty earthquake that its victims have) "Species" (gorgeous and confused "space girl") and "Incubus" (the angle of beastie-breeding girls). This is one really pleasant movie and the whole thing was obviously in the shoestring budget, although the alien is not too bad (I've seen a lot less convincing men-gum-suits). No actor is an Oscar, and the Isle of Man is not very convincing double for Boston Massachusetts. The plot is quite predictable and the premise that an alien ride would drive nearly a mile and a crash on the ground in the middle of college campuses in all the girls - so comfortably offering a wealth of perfect breeding victims - is completely ridiculous. But the film has its alternating moments, there are some films that support nudity and semi-nudity, and the film has one of the film shows of the beautiful and tragic models / actors Kadamba Simmons ("Space Girl"). just at the age of 24, his jealous boyfriend was murdered in London immediately after making this film.
