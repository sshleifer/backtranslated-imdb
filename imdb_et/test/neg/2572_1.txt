This film is undoubtedly the worst action I've ever seen. I'm sorry, but it's just pathetic. In fact, the best part of a movie (this movie should be serious) when the speed of the chicken crosses the road, about 100 miles per hour. This pathetic editing mistake makes the movie completely fun for about 2 seconds, it is back "non stop, on the edge of your seat when you try to find a comfortable position for sleeping,"
