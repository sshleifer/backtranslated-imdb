This movie was so bad that I don't know where to start, probably not filmmakers. It starts with a boy from the mid-thirties to watching the forties of forties. The news speaks of a maze of corn open for Halloween. He's a "vision" God knows what and rushes to rescue his children who walk in a maze of corn fields and are somehow related to this "vision" How do you ask? I don't know, and as I said before, the filmmakers don't. They just see people's feet. How did he get these "visions"? It has never been explained, we should go with it. She enters the maze to find her two daughters who have lost her, and twice the girl she is looking for next to the walk. What is he doing? Does he pursue them? No. He's standing there like an idiot who demands them when they just ran past. Do the girls stop? They run and ask "Was it a father?" Then someone jumps like a demon jumps "star" (father's character), he wins him in a miserable struggle to find out he is a haunted maze worker. The police are called, and after they have found the "star" (which is really a bad concept they use), they admonish him. They cuff their hands in front of him, so he can find something that lock to choose what he does. First of all, someone who has ever been arrested knows that the policemen confirm their hands behind and secondly, why does this "middle man" know how to choose a handcuff lock? Well, finally he gets away from the police who give up and leave after the "star" spouse puts the police car on the siren. By the way, now is the night, and all the labyrinth workers have appeared when the sun is falling. On leaving the man who attacked one of his employees and two missing children in the maze. Given that it was a slow evening, these are their only customers, why not. In addition, police officers are probably also better off. By the way, the "star" who goes by "Walker", we think it is his surname, the name in which his wife even calls him. Somehow he knows that there is something buried in the middle of this labyrinth of the eye and digs. I say "somehow" because I couldn't figure out why he started digging first. He finds a medallion, what does it mean? Nothing to follow, but there is a hint of crime. Someone killed their children in their "vision" and I think that's what he's doing, a real detective. By now he knows that in the maze of corn the murderer is open, the one he knew somehow was from the beginning of the film, so he is looking for his girls. Every time we see a murder or rather the killer's feet, we hear a weird robotic sound like a sci-fi rejection toy that makes a person's voice mechanical. Why do we hear this sound? Is it in any case connected ... anything? Again, who knows? Definitely not filmmakers. The top of all bad and bad dialogues was when "Walker" shouts "Hey, Mr. Bad Man ... I get you." Once more, his wife is being attacked by a "bad man" at the entrance to a corn maze, which, as I mentioned earlier, is strange for workers or police officers. "Bad Man" calls "Walker" on his cell phone to tell him he's going to kill his wife and kids and his. "Walker" can only answer "Hey. HEY!" before he dropped his phone and worked out. If no one speaks at the other end, the killer falls on his phone as well, he pulls the woman a few feet and leaves him alone with the rest of the film, losing the first chance to resist his loyalty. If this script was not written by the child, I would be surprised. Opps it wasn't. It was written, staged and produced by the same man. And not only did he make so many funny camera work, where we got random foot walks through the mud maze and meaningless footage from the ground, wasting 90% of the time. Finally, Walker uses a cuff for a "bad person" cuff, who also seems to know how to choose locks with the same metal object "Walker" had chosen. Obviously, there are many small metal objects that move this landscape area. But after the killer insists that he still kills the children, "Walker" kills the "bad person" and everything is right again in the world. In reality, this "Walker" makes a murderer, he killed a man who "supposedly" murdered his daughters and tried to kill him. He knows this not because of evidence, but because of his visions. He never found a body, no one else knows that this man was even a maze. And a medallion? He gives it back to the ghosts of two dead girls. There is no proof. So he kills a person for no apparent reason. I can't imagine what filmmakers think of it. This must have been the way to cover the misuse of money for a manufacturing company. I look at the Blair witch project five times rather than see it again. Participants should be ashamed. The director / producer / writer / operator should also be ashamed. In fact, the entire production plant should be ashamed. If anyone is involved with this movie, please answer. What were you thinking?
