John Candy was a very amazing comic actor. His death was a tragedy and we all left him a lot, but WAGONS EAST, where he plays a bumblebee wagonmaster who agrees to take the group's pioneers from the wild west, is even sader. I don't understand why it was even released. The story is meaningless and weak and jokes do not exist. It makes me even worse that Candy's latest film would be his worst film ever. So let's forget all about it and remember him in his better films like SUMMER RENTAL, PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES and UNCLE BUCK. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 5
