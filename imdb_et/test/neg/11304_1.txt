Don't look at "Mr. Magoo." This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Leslie Nielson was not funny at this. He's not funny about the weapons he's been funny. Well, it doesn't take long to figure out it's not a Naked Gun movie! The plot of the movie is ridiculously silly. Nothing in the movie was funny. The first few minutes of the movie were animated to see the old Magoo cartoons. I want the movie to remain so.
