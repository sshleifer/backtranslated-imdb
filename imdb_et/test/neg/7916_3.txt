I'm glad I didn't expect too much when I saw this queue on one of my favorite children's films. The story was boring and persuasive, as did the characters, and I was disappointed that some of the original characters were not at this stage. Nor did I think the characters themselves were similar to the previous film. Charlie had changed and now she has a girl. The first film had good music, but the music in this movie was unemorable. In short, this movie didn't do it for me. Looking at the feedback from other users, it seems that it didn't do much for you. It's not worth it.
