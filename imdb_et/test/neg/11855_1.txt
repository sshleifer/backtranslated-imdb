The only reason why there is a question mark in brackets is NOT because I haven't seen all the films released in 2001. This is because this film was only partially produced in 2001. The rest was stolen from Roger Corman's other dinosaur films Carnosaur 1-3. <br /> <br /> I have a confession. "Carnosaur 2" is perhaps one of my favorite B-movies. It lends so much to James Cameron's "aliens" that it's not even funny. But I love it. I can't explain exactly why. It just works for me. I liked the kits, I liked the cinema, I liked how they borrowed from "foreigners". It's a little ironic that Cameron was at one point Corman's mystery, movies like "Battle Beyond Stars" (1980). <br /> <br /> I attribute the trilogy of Carnosaur to DVD and most of all I can say that the first part is that it has moments. Thirdly, I can say most of all that it took me five years to monitor this. <br /> <br /> Now we have a "Raptor" that doesn't continue this series. Instead, it borrows ENTIRE scenes from the Carnosaur trilogy and builds a film around it. And somehow Roger Corman got Eric Roberts and Corbin Bernsen to do it. Now I'm not saying that Roberts or Bernsen is in any career. But they were both at one point, which could be called RESPECTABLE participants. Not here. Of course, the actors react to the effects they don't even see during filming. Here, however, they react to the imbalance and film material of five to eight-year-old films. There's even a sheriff whose costume is modeled just after the "Carnosaur 1." Obviously, it made too much sense to get back to the original boy. <br /> <br /> When "Raptor" was announced, I was a little excited. However, I was disappointed when Corman said they were using old Carnosaur models of dinosaur. Apparently Corman decided after that interview that he wouldn't even do it. And it's not that he didn't find the FX team. The script was clearly written, bearing in mind that the story had to be built around existing film material. <br /> <br /> Don't compare it to Ed Wood. Ed did it better. At least he used Bela's one-time film in one movie. There are ways to add footage to the movie, and "Raptor" takes this frowned-upon technique to a new low. Even if you liked "Carnosaur 3: Primary species", stay away from "Raptor".
