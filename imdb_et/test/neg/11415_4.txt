The main scene of Rodrigo Garcia's "Nine Life" comes when Sissy Spacek, in a hidden hotel room with Aiden Quinn, finds a natural document on television, where Quinn puts the power of such things. -Disparate Footage is delivered to one scene, predators and prey thrown together to capture the moment - all to force connections where they are not. Nine short films that make up this movie occasionally come into each other's stories, but none of them ever seems to be in touch. A woman who is preparing for a violent confrontation with her abusive father is later seen in a hospital where another woman is preparing for mastectomy. A man who goes to an old girlfriend in a supermarket and sees his life later with his current husband with an unfortunate couple on dinner. Garcia organizes some of his characters in front of each other, but none of the following stories ever relies on what was before. <br /> <br /> Garcia's first movie, Wonderful, Ignored He also had short-lived structure and overlapping characters, but they were less and had much more room to breathe and grow. The "nine life" unpleasant assumption that every nine readings have been spoken in one, uninterrupted real-time will never let the film have any real dramatic tension or momentum. It's also a pretty visually ugly movie. Internal shots are often dim and difficult to follow, while other scenes, especially those where the girl walks back and forth between her unattended parents, are annoying with the camera work. Given that it is Garcia's third film and that he has a respectable television directing history, the direction of this film is quite surprisingly amateurish. As well as filmmaker-great-writer Rebecca Miller, Garcia (son of Gabriel Garcia Marquez) often focuses on writing and character aspects of his films to the detriment of filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Individual scenes affect and even affect. I did like Jason Issacs kissing Robin Wright Penn's pregnant belly. And Joe Mantegna whispered lovingly to her wife when she slipped into pre-surgery sedation. And Sissy Spacek stole some happy moments with Aiden Quinn before returning her daughter by phone call. But the film (unlike what you are just talking about watching it) feels more than an exercise as a real drama. We just look at people to act.
