I can't believe anyone would want to talk about this green light. I can never get a 90-minute life back. <br /> <br /> It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. Some movies are so bad that they are good. It's gone so far that it's somehow so bad that it's terrible. I didn't expect quite a lot, it was a low budget, a band jump, a B-movie redesign, but it was still on my expectations. Even TV films have higher product values. <br /> <br /> There were (very) bad special effects, shocking dialogue, terrible action and a totally inexplicable plot. Who's cursed and why, why did 6-inch snakes change into 15-foot snakes, have anyone ever heard of very poisonous genders or pythons? 100 passengers? 3000 snake? So many promises, no edits. <br /> <br /> In your opinion, some comments are convinced that it is advisable to watch this movie in the last five minutes. It's not even worth renting. Stop and watch a small budget TV movie, enjoy it much more. <br /> <br /> Why was it done? Oh yes, shamelessly cash in on the internet phenomenon that is SOAP. Shame on you Mallachi Brothers, shame on you
