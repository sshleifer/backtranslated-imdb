I'm surprised that the comparison has not yet been made between the Mencia mindset and the television program The Awful Truth, which lasted a few years ago. In the controversial director Michael Moore, the exhibition begins with exactly the same mansion as the exhibition where Moore interacts with the audience and introduces segments, namely short documentaries and sketches that were put together in an attempt to provoke the thoughts of the current problems. Difference? Mencia rarely fails overly superficial and reactive. What he says and does is often potty and rude and offends his audience's ability to make decisions. The difference is "nervous", which I don't have, but Mencia is trying too hard to achieve it and arrives as arrogant and little supportive. He does, however, sometimes score points, but often in order to gain access to them, one has to sit through some pointless astonishment that tried to try humor in shock.
