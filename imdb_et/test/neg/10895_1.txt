This movie must be the biggest disappointment I've ever experienced with film. Action is terrible, the temporary structure is minimal and the general plot is ridiculous. I found myself rooting for the victim, just to rush and become a victim because he obviously had to get out of his misery. Anyone with rudimentary knowledge of how the world works must jump hopelessly immediately, and the so-called suspenseful buildup would be happy to be 3 years old to be slightly worried. I am sorry that the sequel is planned because it means they are asking us to swallow the line again. If this is an example of Raw Feed's work, I think I will avoid all these future movies.
