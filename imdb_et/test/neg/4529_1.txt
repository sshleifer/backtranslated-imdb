This movie was sucked. The problem was not pain. I think there was a lot of great, good talents, many great actors. But the script was TERRIBLE! It seems that this was usually just a frame in which Steve Carrell was able to make his correction. And that's what he does best, but it just didn't work here. The script was difficult to follow, the story was not sensitive and the scenes were random and missing. Much of the activity was also extremely complex and poorly thought out. It was a good effort, but as Max says, they were not saying it. I'm shocked to see how many glowing comments on IMDb are on this scavenger. Of course, filmmakers can write a lot of positive comments about their films and fill in IMDb records. If you read positive reviews and compare them with negative reviews, it is quite clear what the real reviews from ordinary users are. <br /> <br /> This movie was full of problems and jokes that just didn't work. I loved Steve Carrelli's Anchor Man and I like his comedy and style. But I'll tell you that I've never laughed at watching this woman. Yes, I had a few moments, a few smiles, but there was no real smile. Nothing hit me at all. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Alert! One of the ridiculous scenes was when Max had his hands tied to the plane and he went to the bathroom to try to escape. He uses his special Swiss army knife ... but instead of simply using the COUNCIL YARN, he tries to tie his miniature cross-section. And if the crosshair burns and takes him in and out with little arrows (almost throwing his eyes out), Max won't give up or try the blade ... no, he just shoots himself. What did he really do with this cross-section? Women seemed to have the ability to try to remove ties to work. It just didn't make any sense. <br /> <br /> This is a good example of typical situations in this movie. They were ridiculous, poorly thought out, poorly motivated, and pure nonsense. And it was really disturbing. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie was very big and I suggest you avoid it. Note to IMDb: You should do something about the fakes that people leave. This will impair the authenticity of the site.
