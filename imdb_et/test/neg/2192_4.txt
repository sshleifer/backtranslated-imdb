Many flames, thousands of additions to battle scenes, lots of beautiful sets. I do not think that the plot supported such high costs. The story could have been much more effective and would have been more valid, psychologically, if there were not so many macho bombs in production. Chinese films tend to be in my experience in this way. and I think it will harm the film.
