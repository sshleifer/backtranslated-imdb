I got it away from usenet, so I wasn't ready for a difficult (and I mean, hard) religious topic. Not that I'm one of Satan's disciples or something else, but it was very difficult. It may be because they had to get the little boys to play the bad little boys, but it didn't work. it is ready, but be prepared with the buttons for moving forward. <br /> <br /> There was some clutter when editing. Specifically, the black Mustang (probably Satan's representation) squares white against 240Z. Wheels spin, camera changes and know that white 240Z is transmyrified to white Civic. <br /> <br /> I gave up early so I can't insure its moral effect. But I would like to point out that such a film has proclaimed the choir. When the director / writer / producer tried to bring religion to the masses of the street without washing, they all went wrong. I think I look at the trade of an adult diaper rather than listening to a sharp-eyed bible that Jesus dies for us. Yawn. <br /> <br />
