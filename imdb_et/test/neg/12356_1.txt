SPOILER ALERT. <br /> <br /> This movie will break your afternoon or watch a small hour in the morning. <br /> <br /> I like Marc Singer. He has seen good signs in his roles he has seen. Until this movie. <br /> <br /> What starts as a promising movie will soon disappear with a catastrophic background and extreme proximity to a person who will die ... <br /> <br /> Then it gets worse. <br /> <br /> Much worse. This movie goes to the bottom of the hamster barrel and scrapes it away. <br /> <br /> In addition to Marc Singer's overwhelmingness, Mike Dopud stabs and strikes the landscape as he fears that he will fall on the rocks and his wide-eyed "man" bad guy will make him look like a moor. He's not at all threatening. <br /> <br /> George Stults looks like deer caught in headlamps. He claims the other two have threatened, but his character would have been threatened by a cashier who offers him paper or film. <br /> <br /> This is an independent woman of Nicole Eggert who, despite her return to life, is attracted by the wrong person ... She was remarkable. <br /> <br /> This is not a remake, but it is remarkably similar to the "Cliffhanger" - an experienced guide, loses someone in the fall, in conscience to help someone else, the treasure that is worth the money and gang n'er-do - the well that uses this guide. Except Cliffhanger was a great tool for Stallone and Lithgow. I have to admit that Lithgow stole the exhibition. <br /> <br /> Even the involuntary comedy was bad. There were times when I wasn't sure if they were using a rubber model for Singer because he tried to rush the weather station (not intended). Pressing her face on the door post and her clumsy way didn't help her character. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br /> No, seriously, avoid it. Save 96 minutes of your life and do something more constructive, such as drying paint or growing grass. Or just close your eyes and look at the back of your eyelids for 90 minutes ...
