utterly useless ... having been there, I have to say that in the subject I have to say that the club's atmosphere is absolutely not respectful. This could have been done if the characters were not just for an incredibly unsuccessful, unrealistic fire. So many worrying scenes that would shake the office (not the compliment of this movie). It could also help with story, thought, message, comment, something. Seriously, Kevin & Perry Go Large had more to say on this subject than in this movie (in which case the term was used very loosely). There should be a minus number for such movies. -10 (extra)
