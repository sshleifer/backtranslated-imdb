It took me a few years for this title, the main headquarters of my childhood. Almost every trip to the video store I chose Raiders and I watch it three times each time my mother rented it out for me. I think it's my Star Wars. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that it is such a stink. My memories were so blurred that it didn't offer nostalgia, so I had to take it at face value. A space pirates team accidentally kidnaps a rather annoying toddler and spends the rest of the movie trying to get him home. <br /> <br /> Dozens of minors target unwanted blow, very dirty costume and waste, recycled special effects, insecure kits, and poor performance. But even in the case of involuntary comedy, it's not fun to see it as an adult, where I can choose not only technical mistakes, but also wonder how the writer and director impressively managed to have fun / powerful moments that have seen millions of other sci-fi movies and everyone who have been remotely competent should have been successful. <br /> <br /> I imagine that as a child, I probably found myself quite capable - there are many "I can't do it, I'm just a kid" "Of course you can joke, you just have to try it!" The boy drinks beer, etc., but even the 1983 low-budget sci-fi standards are pretty terrible, with a real "finale" snoozer.
