I saw this movie when he came out. Let me look now - the man who had previously let down Fuji is able to collect funding and unpaid staff to document what sounds like a brave and daring act - to ski to the highest peak in the world. Well - AND THERE WILL BE A SPOILER - What Happens After A Big Team Of People Can Help Him Get To The Top - And Life Is Lost In A Favorable Part - She Gets Her Skis, Succeeds To Make It Very Very Short At The Time Of Her PARACHUTE OPENS .. and that's it. And instead of recording the footage to hide this amazingly anti-cyclical end to the embarrassing attack, the man goes on and releases it. SPOILER ENDS I admire the amazing courage and effort he has to reach the film crew to get some great shots. SECOND SPOILER - Oh yes, one of the sherpas is killed under the fall. The narrator, who cites the "bold skier", accidentally points out that, according to the Sherpa religion, the body of this man cannot be restored because his soul cries to the world forever and never knows a vacation. he responds - because it served to let this clown down "Everest". I never remember that I saw more meretricious piece of pulp.
