I watched it because of the description and cover design, and again it was deceived. I can kill all these new fools directly in DVD horror movies. If blue month 1 is OK. It started with a confusing scene and then jumped for 30 years and showed a couple of nights in the thunderstorm that was OK because I like storms and it's a nice mood. Then it turned into a cool journey where they got into strange people in the canteen. The rest was strange and then got confused. I looked at it, but was still confused when it ended so badly. I had higher hopes for this movie, but it was more like a science fiction, then a horror and something it should have done for the TV.
