It is unfortunate that so many people give this film an amazingly high rating. Some praise the use of such twisted thoughts (and transparent action plans that give simple love to anyone who is somehow critical of the US) that he approaches hysteria. <br /> <br /> Heaven's Gate is a bad film, it's basically terrible. Endless scenes that use sophisticated shots that are not expedient, muddy dialogue, funny narratives, no matter what's wrong ... <br /> <br /> The high rating of this disaster is the result of revolutionary history and temporary shifts. before you watch the gate of heaven, Lawrence of Arabia. You see, the purposeful and lost movie is really. The "problems" that it may have tried to solve are lost miasmas. <br /> <br /> I have no problem with critical movies with the US, but if a terrible movie gets this kind of praise cleanly because of this element ... it's a worthwhile challenge. <br /> <br /> The film is worth two reasons; curiosity and a warning story for young filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I saw it at home free of charge, imagining torture and sitting in theater ... in four curving hours!
