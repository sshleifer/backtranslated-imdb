My paraphrase above the slogan on the back of the DVD box adds up: this movie was much more terrible than terrible. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I've seen as long as I remember. My husband hired it inadvertently, thinking it was a version of Tom Cruise. The ridiculously unprepared special effects on the menu screen should have turned us off. The voluntary nudity already in the opening plan made us suspicious. <br /> <br /> But as the movie wore, it was clumsy to act - both over and under - continuity in leadership and editing, triting and special effects. We gave up after half an hour or less; after that, it didn't get a good start. <br /> <br /> Because I despise comments that make a product without specificity, here are some examples of particularly uncomfortable moments in the movie, even if they are spoilers: <br /> <br /> - The driver says goodbye to his young old son because the latter is driving away with her mother, the latter is prickly because it is their wedding day's sudden business. Son asks, quietly worried, "Can I see you again?" Maybe it should be a pretext, but instead this child has to behave in an uneven way. <br /> <br /> A huge alien spaceship has fallen on the ground and sits on a huge crater. There is a crowd nearby who looks at it lightly, but otherwise he looks at unaroused. Finally, one woman says "it's gi-normous!" <br /> <br /> - After this craft has wasted the village and its inhabitants, the leader and the bystander who are now alone near their home and are trying to get their cars to flee, change something, quietly puzzled: <br /> <br /> "What was that thing?" "I can't ..." <br /> <br /> - The army is blocking the bridge from evacuation because some of the bridge will be destroyed. When an alien ship fires an explosion, the crowd starts to flee, it seems that only the director told them and not because they are frightened or in some real danger, not to mention the unusual circumstances. <br /> <br /> And so on ... writing a movie is not enough to experience this real vision. But please, PLEASE, save yourself the trouble even if your sick curiosity is tortured! The film is so bad that it can't even be enjoyed as unwanted humor (compared to the wolf of King Vidor's "Solomon & Sheeba" starring Yul Brynner). Life is too short to watch such crap. There has to be something more productive and more enjoyable, like walking with a dog or cleaning a tick.
