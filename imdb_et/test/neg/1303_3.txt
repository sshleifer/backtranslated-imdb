I put it right on you, this movie is dead boring. It's about flooding. Blah blah a little family, blah blah blah politics, blah blah blah bored. <br /> <br /> Blame it on all the heavens, the bad soils. Deputy Prime Minister Campbell is a hard ass, waiting for everyone to be a psychic, the most irritating character. <br /> <br /> If you are from the UK or somewhere that it can flood, you might like this movie. It's sort of like earthquake movies being the highest than earthquakes. <br /> <br /> This is not really an action movie where the weather is an enemy and you have to conquer it or literally overcome it, it's a time bomb that must be banned. Looking at this movie, it is understandable why the UK thinks the world is overcrowded, it is not, but it is for them. <br /> <br /> Really, the movie is about as exciting as scattering and I can't recommend it. It's over 100 minutes, far too long. <br /> <br /> Movie problems; I can't go any further, because the film doesn't deserve such dissection. Tip for you London - buy more boats. If you bring a child into this movie, they will sleep or become uncontrollable boring screaming demons.
