Sometimes you get exactly what you expect. A film that has been produced and created for a rock band in the middle of the return should not be expected to have high artistic values ​​- and that is certainly not the case. In fact, as expected, the soundtrack is a much better investment than the film itself, which is similar to the 70's rock and roll lifestyle that it is trying to portray, redundant, drug and external antics, but unfortunately not nearly as fun. Using the Carl Dupre script, which is awful enough to create a companion to the screenwriter, and wastes Edward Furlong's talents, the pieces of rock and role that have gone wrong have revived the music, especially the 1978 KISS concert.
