not really, im not kidding around here people, and i don't think how many people here have given him really very positive comments! oo wait, this part of the IMDB comments, silly to me. it is interesting to note that there have not been enough votes on this date to give this film a rating of ten, but there are dozens of comments on the film. what does that mean I don't know? anyway, script IS is terrible. The character changes his personality and motivation and actions on every scene to keep the movie running in the same way as the pace. it wasn't even stupid behavior, it was there too, but the pure idiocy of the script surpassed any seemingness. for example: karl does not behave in command, because there are two corpses in the desert, and the "killer is here somewhere", so he forces everyone to ride 40kms to find the killer, not to command commands and p * all to leave. when a hero puts something unpleasant in the dark and warns the karl, the karl tells our hero that he will stop idiots and that there is nothing that they will all go home. next scene, he refuses to let it go and must hunt whatever it is. it's just a joke. Yes, the monster is very impressive, but what people say about this is simply trying to get rid of its interesting aspects and the hanging moments of predator and alien were very annoying. and the ending ... ends!?!?! Jesus .... The worst movie I saw, and I saw a buster!
