I'm not sure that this film could ever respond to the first film, even if it marked the original seven (despite four killing). It's not just spark and chemistry. All the actors seem tired and look like they just go through the movements to get their payroll. <br /> <br /> It is interesting how Yul Brynner is "excellent" in the original film, but rigid and convincing. But when he celebrates in the 1970s in Westworld and Futureworld, he creates the same secret of his character (with the same matching black trousers, shirt and hat) and the presence of the 1960 film Chris Adams. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this 1966 sliding to even look at the cable.
