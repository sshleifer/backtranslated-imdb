"SHUT FRONT DOOR" That's what I said when I was told that Blockbuster got a new movie called Snakes on the train. Okay, maybe that's not what I said, but you understand. I didn't have to know who was in the movie or anything else. All I knew was renting a movie. <br /> <br /> I should have asked what it was. In retrospect, I don't know if I really wanted to look at the curse of the Mayan cinema that causes the woman to give birth to the stomach and let them spit out of her mouth. Also, I wouldn't want to see a movie with a boy who looks strangely on Leif Garrett's pedophile version. <br /> <br /> Anyway, although the curse may be interesting at some level (maybe not), there was still a promise that these annoying signs would be eaten or at least killed by snakes. So I was ready to sit through the very first hour of a very small case, except for Texas Ranger, which forced the girl to have a nice little tits so she could keep her cocaine or a Spanish shaman who would occasionally want to stab people. But then, all hell broke open, and the girl began to spit more and more snake. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * So everything is well done and I'm ready to forget that some of these snakes suddenly turned 25 feet long. After all, people can eat, so it's all good. But then suddenly, and I won't tell you how it would destroy the best part, one snakes is about 300 feet long. Then it continues to squeeze and fire the train, the entire graphic art of Serpentaur from the old GI Joe cartoons. Unfortunately, I was unable to make a connection to this movie Nemesis Enforcer. Anyway, so you think the big snake who ate the train would be quite unstoppable. Well, if you know your Mayan voodoo stones and you have the ability to call up the tornado from heaven. Yeah, that's all I say about it. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is bad. Really bad to the point where you can watch it, or your brain can hurt. I didn't give it to one, because no matter how stupid it was, it wasn't as bad as the Date movie. So if you like camp or badly-built B horror movies, that's for you. If you think it's really cool like his bigger, notorious brothers, then just walk in the box when you see it. And I'll leave you with a quote from a movie that should, in principle, all put together. <br /> <br /> "Snakes can't get to the train!" Because it's just stupid. Not like they do stops or something.
