The friend gave me this movie because she liked it. I decided to look at it finally. It was so long. I was expecting the relationship to happen, but it wasn't done. I was expecting something to happen after the opening scenes, and it wasn't done. I stopped the movie and came back later. I forced myself to look again, hoping it would improve. It deteriorated. I asked myself who these people are? Do they have feelings? are they just robots? I'm glad I didn't pay to see it or rent it. The end would have been better if the Dutch died of wound wound. At least we would have received some emotions from the public. Or not.
