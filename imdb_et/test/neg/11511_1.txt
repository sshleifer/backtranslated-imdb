I can't find this example funny at all. I think it is much worse now than any other terrible Disney channel. Charlotte Arnold is an interesting choice to play Sadie because she can't act. The jokes in this exhibition are terribly uncomfortable, and it makes it even worse if the only cast member with a little (and I mean a bit) acting talent is Hal's Half Brother of Justin Bradley. Jasmine Richards and Michael D'Ascenzo represent Sadie's friends. There are both really stupid and just terrible actors. The two words that really describe this example are horribly horny. It's a funny humor that only little girls find it funny because their brain is not yet developed. Now I've explained my hatred for the actor and terrible humor, what's next? The whole premise of the exhibition is a stupid idea. He changed again (not so scientific Ben-loving) and suddenly no one knows him? It's moral. All in all, I hate this exhibition, but little girls who don't have a funny concept enjoy it, so I think that's what they want over quality. Although I can say as much as the first season is clearly better than the second. <br /> <br /> LOWER LINE: NOT REQUIRED. <br /> <br /> My rating: Awful show. TV G. 30 minutes.
