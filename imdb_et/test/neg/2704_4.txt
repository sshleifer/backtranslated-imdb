Although this film is general, there are some elements that may be true. He was definitely a wild character in his youth, having played practical jokes on his West Cadet cadres, who were almost excluded several times, finishing last in his class (34) and often neglecting during his civil war. br /> <br /> But history can be a shelter for Indian wars. Surely he did his share of cruel things, but how much was he under the commandments? There is also evidence that he confessed before the Congress (a major threat to his commission and order) that he claimed that the Indians' breach of the treaties was fair and that if he were in India he would fight instead of living on a reservation! As a character said in 1776, when asked about what the British are talking about losing the revolutionary war, the character characterizes "history does what it always does ... it lies." Who knows how bad Custer was. He was certainly not a sympathetic character depicted by Errol Flynn and later by Ronald Reagan. But I also doubt that he was completely evil as he was later depicted.
