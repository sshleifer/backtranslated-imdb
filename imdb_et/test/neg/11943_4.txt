Yes, I wrote this right. This movie is so predictable that the actual word needs additional letters to show predictability. Since the main characters and the situation have been brought in, this is where the plot leads us by color. The highlight was as thin as two tons of butterfly driver. You can take a lot of dialogue and see what role it plays at the end. <br /> <br /> Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhardt did decent jobs in unsatisfactory roles, and Abigail Breslin played an admirable role. It's just that the movie brought something completely new to romantic comedy. Romance was cold and laughs were weak and few. Of course, this is an OK movie if you have nothing to watch, but you won't miss anything because of it.
