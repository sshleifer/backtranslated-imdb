Its almost embarrassing to say that I even saw this movie. I mean, it doesn't take a lot of good zombie movies besides good special effects, lots of blood and gore, some frightening moments and a decent plot. Does the dead house 2 do these things right? No, not one. Of course, it's not as bad as his predecessor, Uwe Bowle, and it's the only thing about this movie that scares me. <br /> <br /> The dialogue in this movie is known as "What do you do for living?" in response to "I kill zombies" and "I was never a disk drive, I was a soldier." Special effects are embarrassing even for a TV movie, I mean seriously that all zombies look like they have bloody lips broken up. The military base of this film is a parking house with a desk and an open gate. This movie is such a low budget that they didn't even get co-financed changing rooms. In fact, it seems that this whole movie was filmed in high school. <br /> <br /> Also, why are all female soldiers in this movie models? And that's why everything in this movie is so insignificant what's going on, they just stand around, letting zombies kill them. Heck one man even tries to give food to a zombie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie makes even the worst Scifi Channel movies look fantastic.
