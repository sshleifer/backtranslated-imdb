This "horror" movie has no horror or even a slight break. Even gore is not good. The plot would have some promise if it was done by someone who took care of what they were writing / filming, but the people who did that movie probably didn't do it. In principle, the movie runs sequentially and begins as follows: <br /> <br /> The main character requires it not to be crazy. <br /> <br /> "Milo" talks about his yellow raincoat or wearing the main character requires that he is not crazy and talks about his passionate teacher. <br /> <br /> Somebody kills unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> The main character demands that he is not crazy and that a couple of fakes will accumulate. <br /> <br /> Do we see a pattern here? If you don't, you can enjoy this movie. Otherwise, look for something else. The budget is low, low, low, and it shows (to say the least, the NOW that makes you forget your mess budget), and acting is bad, bad, bad (except for the janitor). In general, the film is boring, boring, boring. I can't think of one scene that is actually well done. In fact, I didn't like the movie so much that I turned it off ten minutes before the end, which I rarely ... hell, I watched non-MSTied MANOS, clones and WILD WILD WEST. <br /> <br /> 3/10 Keep yourself and watch PHANTASM again.
