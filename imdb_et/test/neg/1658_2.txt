There are no teenagers on summer vacations in a small Ohio city to find some enjoyable ways to fulfill their time. Some think they are driving to Chicago; others are happy to drink and bully their peers. By the random behavior of alcohol-based arrogance, tempters tempt a homeless man and steal a strange book. The handwritten text contains archaic climates that are designed to call demonic forces. Later in the evening or twice, one of them reads a spell and is quickly in possession. He becomes a malicious killer and starts to quietly get his former peers. <br /> <br /> "Demon Summer" is an amateur production with a microscopic budget. Production values ​​are small, but the filmmakers were smart enough not to be ambitious. There's little need for special props or places to take pictures. Operation is particularly weak and the scenario is virtually original. On the positive side, according to the standards of low budget films, special makeup effects are surprisingly good. Nevertheless, the cage is minimal. The make-up effects are gone, there is little progress for this film, even for hard hard whores. Not recommended.
