OK, I watched this movie. Someone has to hit me. WHY Olsen's twins must insist that this world put this torture tortured? It was another film that looked at how the Olsen twins travel to an exotic location, meet some cute boys, look beautiful and have all those who have died over them. I don't know about the US, but in my country it is considered extremely foolish on a bicycle bicycle that met like 10 minutes ago. Although I am now convinced that these girls will never learn to act, I really hope that one day we will be able to watch the film with its original, even slightly plausible plot.
