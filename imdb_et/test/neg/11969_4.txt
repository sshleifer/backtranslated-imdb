"The scarecrow went wild: he's the death of the party!" Can I say more? The scarecrow went wild in four out of ten stars for one simple reason: aside from terrible acts, plot holes, cheap special effects and climatic whistling, this was the cinema gold! I think this movie could have been really good if the scarecrow turned out to be a baseball coach (always represented by such brilliant Ken Shamrock). But then they should have cut those special effects of AWESOME's "Jedi Return". <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, I was convinced that my friends and I were convinced that it was actually written by one of our friends, a stereotypical teenage boy. This movie is topless women, unlucky fake gore and a dialogue that couldn't talk their way out of a paper bag, or in this case, a corn surface. <br /> <br /> If I could ask the filmmaker, it would be; "How much did you have to pay for the teenager who wrote it to you?"
