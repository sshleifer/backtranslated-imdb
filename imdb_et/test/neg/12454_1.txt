This movie has recently been featured on Turner's classic film. It may have been considered terrible over time, and maybe the money has earned it, but even the hardest Jane Russell fan is hard to drive through. <br /> <br /> There are many movie musicians from the 1950s that can take the test of time, even if they are dated according to current standards, but can still be enjoyed due to good music or dance or amusing parcels. However, the "French line" is not capable of all these aspects. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter if Russell was a good singer when he was given an awesome vocal piece. The whole cast has a boring, tricked graph and dialog. <br /> <br /> It's not even worth saving and skipping just to a musical number - they're devastating.
