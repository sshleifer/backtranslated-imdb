It was only when I saw Sidney Pollack in the picture that I ever connected to this movie. This is his worst possible film. Absolute dreck. Dialogue is wood and incredible, the plot is incredible. <br /> <br /> Kristen Scott Thomas has been wasted in this movie. There is nothing in his character that makes you even believe this story. <br /> <br /> Harrison Ford is like Valium. There is no life in his eyes. <br /> <br /> I blame Sidney Pollack for the failure of this movie. The script is terrible and it's too smart to see it. So it smells of some kind of profitability, that is, a studio obligation or something, but it's just BLOODY ROTTEN!
