Hi, this is I Derrick Cannon and I welcome you to the first Cannonite Review. My weekly film was controversial, what kind of film, what kind of film, what a great four-star epic I chose, I guess what I decided to pull for eighty times and go on another route, I've decided to watch such a terrifying movie that it could have killed what could have been a unique concept. The film I am watching today is Jack Frost Two mutant killers snowier. The stars of this movie are Christopher Allport Sam Tillerina, Eileen Seeley as Anne Tiller, Marsha Clark as Marla David Allen Brooks as Agent Manners, Sean Patrick Murphy as Captain Fun, Ray Cooney Colonel and Scott MacDonald as killer snowman himself Jack Frost is hard to believe that this movie was in the same series that gave us an incredibly funny Jack Frost (loved the carrot scene), but it's even harder to believe it's just the same cast. The film was destroyed for me as soon as they arrived on the island and Captain Fun was introduced. What was his character and how did he fit with the horror movie? The only possible reason I saw it was that they wanted to give us a character that was a complete killer for the snows of snowmen. Sam Tiler seemed more paranoid, he made it in the original, his burning on anti-freezing was one of the most pathetic screens I saw in the movie. However, his wife was one of the few bright places. She played the role of her main woman. He was a sound voice in a pure idiotic film. The scene in which he thinks how to kill snowmen was one of the most anticipated parts of the film. Ray MacDonald did a great job again, like Jack Frost, no matter what he was given. If it weren't for such weak characters, he would have become dead like Chucky, Freddy and Jason. Laugh when you need to, but when it comes down, Jack Frost was dirty, he had humor, and most importantly, he had an undeniable sorrow. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been so much that it could have been a lot more than a big franchise, but instead all plans to make Jack Frost three are canceled. <br /> <br /> This movie gets two out of ten for me and it's lucky that he even gets one.
