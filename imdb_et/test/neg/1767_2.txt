First, I'm a big fan of Alien and Alien II - I think both films have created and defined the Si-Fi Horror genre, as we know it today. I noticed that Lifeforce has often been compared to the saga of aliens - after watching this movie, I would very much agree. Aliens with vampires have some special effects and the story can be acceptable. I just can't get a naked woman's room in a vampire all over the movie, it's totally absurd (although she looks good). Add a lot of bad British actors and it's pretty much. Most of the movie ends in London or somewhere in England, so after the first 20 minutes you lose the outdoor setting and hope for some real Si-Fi Horror action and skipping. <br /> <br />
