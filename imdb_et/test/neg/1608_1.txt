It's so bad, I can't tear myself off. I ask myself, "Why?" "Why?" There is no consistency in each scene. <br /> <br /> There is no consistency, but if you want to make a very publicly homosexual film with a fetishist attitude to all the big, big boats, Big Boys, Big Airplanes, you don't have to worry about things like a plot or character. I'm puzzled and very worried that CAG looks so much like Richard Pryor. It seems wrong for Pryor to look the same in a terrible movie. But I can't tear myself. This movie is the first movie I've ever reviewed. It's so phenomenally bad and weird. It prompted me to join this site. I've read 50 main characters. Maybe I would have stoned stoned, but as I am, I feel like an endless bad dream where it is always 1988 and we were the biggest reunion on earth.
