My brother and his wife brought the movie overnight to watch. It should have given me the first idea that it would be terrible. It was. From the first frame to the last film, this movie is terrible. It doesn't even register as a "B" movie. Maybe N or P. One of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. From the rubber raptor-on-a-stick car to the horrible closure line that is still breathing in the car, this movie has not been watched when you have received it for free. <br /> <br /> Leave it together - if you don't want to play with your friends at the Mystery Science Theater, it's good ammunition.
