I have no idea how precise the depiction of Flynn on this film, but even if it is fiction, it is one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is all over the place and you don't know how to get from one scene to another - you just don't get the minimal information you need to maintain consistency and understand your current situation, and it's hard to understand Flynn and the motives of other characters for their behavior. br /> <br /> Add to it a series of stupid and unreliable situations and you have a movie that is one of your dreams that seems to be meaningful during sleep, but when you wake up and try to remember it, it's just strange, inseparable and completely unreal. . <br /> <br /> The film has many long, boring music programs that are either a bad direction or a bad director who is trying and not artistic. <br /> <br /> No characters are even pleasing, and the Flynn character has come across as a self-serving liar, a thug, a thief, a robber, a murderer, a fist fighter, a gigolo, and an impostor who does something and continues to pass on their dreams and somehow Despite the great opportunities just to be miraculously, this movie is not entertaining or in any way satisfactory and all accounts are not even historically accurate, why not even look at it? To wipe the wound with salt, the DVD had one of the worst transmissions I've ever seen, it wasn't even on a widescreen or Dolby 5.1, it had a terrible telecine-sinking and many items about what looked like a roll of film somewhere in the dust and scratches.
