So my friend and my friend take care of our local movie rental store and look for something to take with Eternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind, so why not speed up the third installment of the Scarecrow series!?! Remember that this is not just three scarecrow; that is, Scarecrow: Gone Wild. Now we've both seen the first two peasants, so we felt we had to stop working. Let's start with the DVD cover first. First we see Ken Shamrock ("The Most Dangerous Person in the World") on the cover. Apparently, he was used to market the film as a "leading actor". By the way, it has the lowest screen time of a credited class member. Next, we see a very attractive and very little clad woman in the middle of the frame. I can assure you that he is not in the movie .... at all. At the time of renting, we assumed that it repeated the fact that the scarecrow was "wild". In the background, we saw a large carnival on the ocean island. I can also assure you that the carnival is not in the movie ... at all. Looking back at me and my friend should have known that something was up. I really mean who the devil puts the carnival on the island. Now for the real movie. Let's start when a young man is inexplicably thawed with peas in the middle of corn. Don't ask me how they were rendered, but think about when Brandon Lee wakes up from The Crow. It's just that stupid. But in defending the scarecrow, he has "gone into nature". Any scarecrow who is now living through a young man takes a trip to his local beach to scare those who had made him wrong. Because yes, in the world of peasants, the beaches are in the same public area as corn fields. To make a short summary of the story, the scarecrow kills all those who stand on their way without warning, except for the scam marks that mark the scarecrow. It is, however, impossible to believe, because the mouth of the peacock costume is clearly closed. Several tracking shots that make Kubrick's grave later, and we have one of the worst third installments. Well, except maybe the third Matrix. As Joel Siegel would say, "This scarecrow is wildly bad."
