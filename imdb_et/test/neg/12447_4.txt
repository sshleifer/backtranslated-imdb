Don't be fooled by "prizes" and comments below. It's just one bad movie. How George Katt played his character (soft gangster) is a very disturbing look. In the opening page of the discussion, this is a dramatic display of the story. The rest of the film seems to be the head of the character elsewhere. His emotions are not suited to the things going on with the film. The things he says about the voice do not add anything to the film. It just makes Zeus even clearer when it's in the clouds. <br /> <br /> The story and film were put together with a total lack of fantasy. All parts of the film were badly stolen from other modern leaders. We hope that Jon Rosten will use his own style and ideas for his future films.
