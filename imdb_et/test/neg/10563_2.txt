If you really want to experience Don Dohler's magic (?), Then look at "Alien Factor" or "Fiend", but not that. Alien Factor is actually quite imaginative, with a small budget and it's pretty crappy, but "Nightbeast", which is probably Alien Factor's upgrade, is just plain. The actors dream of their roles, especially the sheriff of Mr. Monotone, and the monster is something of a Halloween mask, not Alien Factor's wild imagination (but stupid). The spacecraft runs on earth and there is, of course, a critic who runs around the evaporation of people. And ripping weapons, etc. And he has a cool quick gun that he uses to evaporate people until he gets out of hand. And that's really about it. "Alien Factor" wins the hands of this mess, if you really want to see a good Don Dohler movie, check it out. And RIP Don Dohler, 12/26/06.
