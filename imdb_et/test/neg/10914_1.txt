Man, I just don't believe this movie. I looked at it completely (believe me, I've done it!) And the best part was beginners (and I hate trailers !!!!). <br /> <br /> There is no plot, no action, nothing. I watched the movie and thought, "If it starts"? It had never started. How can people spend money and time doing such a mess? <br /> <br /> "Plot": The dog can bite with a bat and get rabies - Okay, so far, there's no problem, nothing special, but OK. Now the rest of the movie - the dog is chasing people !!! this is something else! Now add some worse actions / actors I've ever felt, some totally unrealistic scenes (and some others really idiotic like the baby's breath and mom give him a great and strong hug to see if he's getting better), and very flat end, this is where you have CRAP ... ops! .... CUJO. <br /> <br /> Make yourself good and do something like hiting your head against the wall or playing chess with yourself. <br /> <br /> NULL 10. <br /> <br /> Gabriel.
