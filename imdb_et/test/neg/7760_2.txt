Yes, I couldn't stop awake or my partner. Incredibly boring - 90 minutes it seemed to reach at least 3 hours - and I'm not even an active film fan, but it just sleeps on your feet - if you're not a 70s polo-necked sweater! <br /> <br /> ** SOME SPOILERS NEXT ** If you were expecting something to happen, don't hold your breath - it's not! But seriously, it can't convince the guard completely or get involved. It's like a long, dull and quite divorced dream. Frederic swims, he can leave work if he wants, and with attractive secretaries who are constantly bringing the way and the messages. Obviously there is no real life! And an office with virtually no paper or files - just a gigantic calendar that tells you that it actually takes 6 months to watch a movie. <br /> <br /> Frederick never seems to touch any real emotion, nor does his wife and children behave like rag dolls - in contrast to every real life. Even Chloe, despite its strong views, never gives any appearance. Only 3 seconds of any real feelings will occur between the coffee-controlled pair and have nothing to do with the plot. <br /> <br /> Okay, so maybe there are moral considerations, but if it's entertainment, or even the good movie you're looking for, I think most other viewers will appreciate this movie incredibly.
