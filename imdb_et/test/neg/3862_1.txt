Imagine that Diane from Cheers, who is central to intellectual character, now imagine that he is trying to make movie music. That would be the case. If you watched some of the pictures without sound, what do you think Hmmm is ... it can be a good movie. <br /> <br /> Now that you turn on the sound and listen at any time, you quickly realize that the movie that made the movie does not know about the movies they read from the book. I was constantly thinking that it was a foreign film, it was so bad. film ... imagine this terrible movie without saving Mr. Bea. That's the movie. I'm not saying anything about what the film is not, but it's an attempt to make a dark moody film that tells a home who's going home ... at least that's all I got out of it.
