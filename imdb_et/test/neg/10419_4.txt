"Yesterday" when it is difficult to judge the film. Cinematography is great and deserves 9/10. The story is sharp and real, no compromise. But the story of translating the screen through the actors did not respond to the camera work. <br /> <br /> As a person born and raised in Central Africa, I appreciated the authenticity of the film's appearance and honesty by depicting Zulu's everyday life. However, this and the camera work are not enough to recommend that the average viewer watch this movie. It takes into account the true cinema and not only the love of the movie to see the purpose and strength of "Yesterday". Unlike the 1980 movie "Gods must be crazy", which was a comic look at an African culture that stands for modern technology, "Yesterday" is not going to turn to any crossover audience. The film just doesn't fit the common western mind - and I doubt it was meant for the western mind. Scenes are long and slow, no editing is done for 60 mph + for the immediate joyful world. Dialogue is not a flip or a witty, it is real. Movies about health crises do not make the best entertainment, and this film is not entertainment, it is education. <br /> <br /> This movie is best seen by those who know, appreciate, and love lifestyle and culture in Lower Sarah Africa. If you do not have a sufficiently broad world view to understand other cultures, especially African cultures, this film should skip. Don't waste time with it. Go see "Talladega Nights" or "Larry Cable Guy" instead of your intercultural viewing. <br /> <br /> I give this 4 to most people who want to see a movie, but who do not have an accurate understanding of African cultures. For observers who appreciate films that relate to human experience all over the world, I would give it 7.
