I found it on the shelf and rejoiced with joy! I danced to the counter, hit my money and ran home! You know what ?! I slept less than half way! Tried again the next day ... YAWN !! What the hell!? !! I couldn't watch it! I love all the other things he has done (I didn't see it yet with a monster). What gives? Is this me? Or him? So sad. Boo hoo. P.S, I liked the work of the camera.
