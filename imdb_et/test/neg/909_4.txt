The story begins at the little girl's home, having a birthday party and both her mother and father seemed quite quiet and reserved with each other. They continue their daughter's presence, both of which, and it was funny to me when the expressions of the two parents were confronted when they gave their child this gift, it was almost like "I hope she likes it"! The movie is killing and Catherine Mary Stewart, (Julia Kerbridge), "Reaper", 2000, is associated with a case of family ties. Julia is working hard to become a doctor and this particular murder interrupts her entire life. Rob Lowe, (Kevin Finney), "View From The Top", 03 is a neighbor in the same apartment where Julia lives and eventually goes to sleep with her and tries to help her in any other way. It's not a bad movie, but it's definitely not going to go crazy if you don't like the nice Catherine Mary Stewart from the Canadian film scene and Canada.
