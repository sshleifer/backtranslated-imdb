I've read almost every major book about the Manhattan project. Most people know what it was, but few people understand the depth and breadth of the project. Its scope was enormously massive - probably only the 1960s space program competed in US history. <br /> <br /> There were - literally - millions of people who participated in many places (most of all) in all walks of life. secret) all over the country, each involved in a specific and different aspect of the project that they could not talk to a person in their adjacent booth, much less to their family. Logistics is overwhelming, especially considering war, communication, security and transport considerations in the 1940s. <br /> <br /> For example - my colleague's father was a carpenter who worked for one company with a federal government agreement on a Manhattan project. His work was to supervise about 30 other carpentry teams who were responsible for making concrete production forms for Washington's massive research equipment. It's "everything" he did, six days a week for almost two years. These carpenters needed the same amount of food, housing, sanitary facilities, hospitals and materials as Oppenheimer and his crowd on the pyramid did. Just think about it! That said, it's just impossible to do a topic in a fair 2-hour movie. In defense of Joffe, however, I would say that they had an impossible task, especially as he chose a diverse scenario with multiple plots, multiple angles and multiple characters. What exactly did he think, and how could he be so arrogant to think that it would work? It's Hollywood, I think. <br /> <br /> FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY have so many mistakes to read all of the book. Dreadful casting. Dreadful (and politically motivated) writing. Poor science. Groves and Oppie images are particularly inaccurate and even bright. Despite the overly obvious scenario of the scenario, STILL is extremely unbelievable and sloppy. <br /> <br /> These errors are listed elsewhere in IMDb, but I was particularly struck by the fact that scientists had so much time in their hands - softball, riding, parties, semi-formal dinners, ballet etc, spoken of romance and of course political petitions . According to FM&LB, we could have won the battle before the D-Day if those big brains were seduced by Laura Dern and actually spent time in the lab. - FM&LB mentions that "Fat Man" and "Little Boy" were the codenames of two atomic bombs, but it does not mention that these names were half-hearted and Groves ("Fat Man", a heavy Oppenheimer ("Little Boy") with its small growth potential). Another reason Paul Newman shouldn't have this movie ...
