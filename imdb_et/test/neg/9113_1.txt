I love most movies and I'm a big fan of Sean Bean, so I thought I would at least want this movie. I am also a Canadian and mostly a Canadian film, so I was ready to relax it seriously. Nothing could prepare me for garbage, which is "air." Steve Guttenberg as an acting hero? Leave me alone. The whole movie was so bad that I was sleeping tonight. I only have two wishes in my life. <br /> <br /> 1. I hope you never have to sit this movie. 2. I wish I got them 6 hours ago. Wait, the movie is less than 2 hours - it just seemed like 6 hours ... <br /> <br /> Don't look at it. Seriously.
