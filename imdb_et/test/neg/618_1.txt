Lance Henriksen has the ability to be a B-film top name, even when he plays with Charles Napier, the Master Control Program, and Joe Don Baker. As always, he does a good job, being a bad man, but the plot is just bad (don't even start to finish me). And editing is so terrible that it can actually be a beauty thing. Is it just me or does it seem Joe Don Baker was connected to the last minute movie? Also, during the break of this film, editing is so phenomenal. Finally, after watching, I see David Warner dying for Throne 2.0 to finally get a green light. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, for Felony, this is the third movie I will give 1/10, I joined Iron Eagle IV and No Mercy.
