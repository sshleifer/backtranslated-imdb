This movie is totally pathetic. Bad behavior, terrible script (there was one?), Terrible editing, bad cinema, cheap humor. Just terrible. <br /> <br /> I saw the "wishing" movie a few weeks ago and I thought it was ringing for the worst movie of the year. Then I saw "Pest" and suddenly "The Wishmaster" didn't seem so bad at all. Bad Bad Bad. Excitingly bad.
