The movie's result is 3 because he dared to be so different. It has a cast actor when you hear their thoughts and wishes! This is really a strange movie and experience that I will not forget. The only problem is that the experiment, although in some ways interesting, is generally quite boring and open. In fact, it is amazing that Norma Shearer and the Clark Gable movie could be ON! The film is based on Eugene O'Neill's game and it really looks pretty static. In fact, it would have been best to keep it in the form of productions - it just didn't change on the big screen. And those who love Gable movies, they just have to see all their movies!
