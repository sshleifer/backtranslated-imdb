The famous Edward goes up in the world when his instructor tells him that he can fall into these dirty Swedish films and step on the staircase and gore department. Excitingly, with his great expectations of the new film type he will be editing soon, he will ask any questions about wages, workspace and southern brake. Well, not really. Edward is perhaps the opposite. Cheerful guy on it, got his glasses. As an exception, he is crazy. I think it created a lot of brilliant atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Evil Ed is a well-founded Swedish film, but there were some magical powers amongst the good actors and their beautiful Swedish accents became stereotypical American voices. I think it's part of what the actor needs these days. The actor is very wood, as they are rigid, not flexible (well what did you really expect?). In addition, the film has a disturbing techno-theme song that sounds like its E-type. In any case, it only makes the film worse. Since I'm quite tough about this movie so far, it's usually a breakpoint where I bring happiness. But there is not much to say. The drawings look good, but somehow Hanz wrote over the coffee and partially destroyed it. So I'm watching this movie. When the film ended where Edward was moved to the spiritual institute and they renovated the parts from where he was going crazy and killing people, the result would have been much better, but that is just my radical view. I would also like to see more material from the lost limb movies. <br /> <br /> There are also illogical things in this movie. Let's say the actors are really Americans living in America, why would they work with a Swedish film like Edward? And this delivery worker, why does he never use a doorbell next to him? Instead, he quietly goes to the door. Good old Edward got very good ears to hear everything when he was editing. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie was in your moments, it's just a shame that there wasn't so much. But that doesn't mean I don't want it. This is a fairly inexpensive film that goes on and on. It's almost like I see the price and the film pattern. On the other side; if you would like to watch dubbed movies. My decision would be rockstone 4.
