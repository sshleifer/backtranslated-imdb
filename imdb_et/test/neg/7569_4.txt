This is a family film, located in rural areas of America in the 1950s, about a boy whose uncle pushes his sheep for killing his dog Drum, starting not only with the family's legal mind but with the community's divergence because their city is going to be halfway. <br /> <br /> This is a formula film that tries to be very touching and sweet. Its biggest weakness is that the only people who really acted were Scott Bakula (Minister of Defense), Ron Perlman (father / owner of Drum) and dog. (John Shuck and Kathy Garver, "Sissy" from the original "Family Affair", like Uncle and his wife, were okay.) Children were not so good (basically they felt like they were acting) and this is a problem when the movie really turns around them (Aaron Fors, who is playing bullying at Donny, thinks of what actor Russell Crowe must have liked for a child, but talent but not much of a ham). <br /> <br /> Favorite line (which the prosecutor speaks after the speech of Scott Bakula's defense summary): "We are happy if they don't hit us." <br /> <br /> Favorite line by Ron Perlman (after breaking his son): "Now make your friend, it's a difficult part." <br /> <br /> Cute enough to rent / buy used.
