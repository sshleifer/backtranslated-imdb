I thought Sliver offered the most boring and trivial "trick" that ended with the film's history, but of course I was wrong. I was not disappointed that this movie would be good. Unfortunately, it was worse than I thought. The worst part is that the obvious end is so ridiculous and terrible that you can't believe it until it actually happens.
