A thin reflection attempt to push the Hulkamania movie to a non-wrestling fan. What could be worse in movies than Hogan? Harassers in the Wrestling Circle and this movie made both because Tiny Lester made his way to WWE in the summer with the mother of all the prominent mistakes. See the Oops dictionary. Like a card that carries the children of the world's fools, who are paid to see it in theaters and when I came out, I immediately checked H.A. - Hulkamaniacs Annoynimous. I am proud to say that I have been behind Hulk for 17 years and have never been craving. Since this was done to bring more fans to Hugans WWE, one day to think about whether there are more fans like me who turned to other past times that didn't poison the mind like celluloid he did, like gas or Russian roulette.
