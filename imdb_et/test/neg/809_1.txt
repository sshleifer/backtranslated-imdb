Don't look at this movie! It's ... repulsive! The start is really good, but in the middle everything falls and I regret the 80-kroon (about $ 11) ticket! Peter Dalle should consider this to be his last chance for the people. BETTER IMAGE! The only bright spot is the excellent work of Robert Gustavsson, Lena Nyman and GÃ¶sta Ekman. <br /> <br /> I hope you take my advice ... The picture is garbage.
