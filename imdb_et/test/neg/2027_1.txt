I found this DVD store and thought not to support some indy movies and watch cool horror. Please save your time and money and pass it on. Functional, script, virtually anything with this movie, is sub-par. There really isn't much story and no character development. I found that I didn't care about what happened to the film's people when something happened. Everyone should have a college age, but they all look like they are in the mid-thirties, except for a woman who plays a mother who looks like she is 40. In fact, the worst part of the movie is that each scene is shown in the caption. No editing, no cut or close. Do yourself a favor and skip it.
