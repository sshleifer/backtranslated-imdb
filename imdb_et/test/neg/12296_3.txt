Yep. Those of my generation who grew up to look at these old Sunbow cartoons were spoiled. The 80's Joe Tune was one of the best cartoons in television history. Well written stories, well-developed characters. It was allowed that it was nothing more than a merchandise of a respectable toy, but it certainly helped to carry it on the toy line. Fast forward almost twenty years later and enter Valor vs Venom. Animation was the most average. The movement of the characters seemed hungry and dolllike. The film seemed rather like a small series of soldiers as a story of a special military force. Then we have the formation or absence of character. Dusty likes to be all Dusty? Slice and Dice want to do things together? What? Were the writers writing a course on how to develop Jar Jar bink-like signs of depth? Like the story. I like a little Sci-Fi. But the notion that soldiers became a mutant army, Joe's death in the universe has ended. Mega Monsters or Toxo-zombies Anyone? But I give the creators the chance of trying to make the fans happy when every 10 minutes of martial arts action. I'm not a big fan of SE and SS, but I liked the fighting scenes between the two. If you can evaluate the VVV, what it is, you will enjoy it. I admit that I can't judge VVV as I should. Again, everything Joe compares to the paths made in the 80s and, frankly, never compares GI Joe's glory. If you can evaluate the VVV, what it is, you will enjoy it.
