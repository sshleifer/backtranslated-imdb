The premise of the film seems to be that the passing of the Second World War in America with an apple pillow and hypocritical morality was a terrible tragedy. These terrible hippies probably destroyed everything. <br /> <br /> What a movie is all about is great performances - especially Lemmon, which is truly remarkable. Otherwise, we will have boring life-drama (just over 24 hours of Jack's life) claims. <br /> <br /> I found it to be sitting.
