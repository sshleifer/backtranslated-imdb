People with screaming brains are a story of greed, betrayal, and revenge in a small Bulgarian town. William Cole, a wealthy industrial company, crushes some of his brain that has been replaced by the Russian cab driver, Yegor. These two cannot be different, but they share one thing - both were killed by the same woman. The low scientist William and Yegor return to life as an unlikely partnership to follow their common nemesis. <br /> <br /> Bruce Campbell returns to the B-horror genre, giving him a cult status, this time not just in front of the screen but behind the lens. Unfortunately, it hasn't been a laugh during this time, and Campbell has to use what he's trying to fill the gap. <br /> <br /> As a fan of Campbell, who has movies and action books, I hoped to add another hit to my collection. Although after seeing the movie before buying, I'm glad I didn't have this "joy" to add it. <br /> <br /> The film first goes wrong, which seems like harmless fun, but turns out to be boring pulled into drift. What a sad thing to say, because it was written by Mr Campbell himself. Comedy has never really hit, it only scratches our heads. It seems that Campbell ran out of funny things and gave the audience what we have already seen ... he fought for himself. <br /> <br /> Ted Raimi, Evil Dead Director Sam Raimi, is undoubtedly the highlight of the movie. She brings her freshness and entertaining time when the film really needs it. This will help if you are a fan and you have watched them from Evil Dead to Xena, so I felt like I was obliged to like that movie. <br /> <br /> Campbell's experience as a director, managing television episodes in the Hercules series is obvious. Campbell does the movie well enough, even with a small budget. After all, there are not so many things that would hope for it, but Campbell fans will be behind it, no matter what, unfortunately, for that fan ... I don't want to.
