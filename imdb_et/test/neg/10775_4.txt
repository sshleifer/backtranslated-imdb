As we know well, movies are not set for direct involvement in history, but it is a disgrace when a film is made with absolutely little correlation. I want the director and / or the screen writer to have done their research in this area. All of this film does not create a forum for hatred between people, while causing a gap that should not be there. This film depicted Sikhs and Muslims in a very negative mansion, making the third group (Hindus) as if they were not in the brutal killing of the people of both nations. The inaccuracies associated with Gian Singh's disregard for religion were the most disgraceful of the highest format. In a more positive way, the actors did a great job in performing their tasks. Both Kristen K and Neve C played their rolls exceptionally. I hope that those who watch this movie will not see or use it as a model for a real historical event.
