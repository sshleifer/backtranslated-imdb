Other reviewers seem to have kept this movie high. For an eighteen-year-old film student, something I would say would say, but that is not the case. If you want to watch a good movie about graffiti, go to the documentary. It is filmed with the same quality as digital home video. The two main characters are depressing actors and again it would be good if it were a student film. The plot follows a lonely artist who rolls around Portland, writing graffiti. He's joined another and they're skating together, creating art. Then there will be unnecessary gay love. Then there is a dispute between them that has never really been discussed, because this film has as much dialogue as Charlie Chaplin's picture. This movie shows that gravity street artists give their form well, and music is great, but generally I wouldn't call it a movie.
