I was hoping to watch "Stop" because the director "Shower" had impressed me so much. Despite some slowdowns, "Shower" is the highest on my all-time favorite movie list because it is a perceived understanding of family relationships and its generally excellent action and direction. And I've seen it at least three times. <br /> <br /> But, in my opinion, "Quitting" gradually fell. It seemed a pointless exercise, and I was so tired soon that the main character couldn't finish the movie. I testify that you will sleep six or seven times, but it was only a few seconds at a time, so I think this comment is still OK. <br /> <br /> I admire parents and sister. A device that uses all the real characters of a movie is nice, I've never seen before. <br /> <br /> Besides disappointment, I still try to see if all of the Yang Zhang films are just a beautiful "Shower".
