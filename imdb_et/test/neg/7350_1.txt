Free Willzyx (name of the Stupas / title ever) is the worst episode of any TV show containing X files, Alias, All 3 laws and orders, all CSIs, Family, Simpsons, Chappelle Show, Colbert Report and more . South Park was a very long comedy favorite because it is shockingly obscene and disturbing black comedy. Free Willzyk doesn't have any of the previously mentioned content. It was so disgraceful, so it could be an unpleasant episode of Sesame Street. Kyle goes to Sea World, where some of the workers are screaming at him, so he thinks the whale is talking to him. He confirms white, actually BEFRIENDS IT. Hi? It's South Park! the same exhibition that brought you "Canceled", "Chickenlover", "It Hits The Fan", "Death Camp Of Tolerance" and so much more! Not SpongeBob SquarePants! Ugh. I was actually looking at the whole episode that is 30 minutes of my life when I ever return. Anyway, I was very disgusting with this episode and I can't believe the shocking decline in Matt & Trey's work quality.
