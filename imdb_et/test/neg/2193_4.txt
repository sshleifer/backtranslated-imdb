Now I've seen two films directed by Chen Kaige, very good (Farewell my concubine) and it's bad, Assassin. Both films are important events in Chinese history, the 20th century FMC, and TA's first interconnection of the Chinese nation in the 3rd century BC. The FMC succeeds with memorable characters, gorgeous cinematography, compelling sets, a good example and an interesting story. Assassin fails on almost every level (okay, the kits are great, cinematography is good and some battle scenes are quite exciting). But ... dam. Call me a claw, but too much is too much. If you felt that private Ryan was too pathetic, remember that it makes you sick. Dialogue is inanimate, many lines seem political statements, exquisite or fun is this picture not. The film is amplified by its pompousness. I'm really surprised that Assassin gets such high votes here. 4/10
