GOOD: The operation was great, especially Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton. Terrence Howard should have applied for Best Supporter instead of Matt Dillon. <br /> <br /> MORE: I am a visible minority (not white) and have experienced some kind of racism in my life. IF, despite your life experience and the theme of the movie, I would definitely not say that this film is the best of the year, it is actually FAR. I have problems with this film from the viewpoint of the video player as well as from the perspective of the visible minority. Some of my problems with this movie are: <br /> <br /> (1) Poor character development (or not at all). Just because we saw extreme examples of character, for example, Matt Dillon is a racist policeman and a good caregiver for his heavy father, does not mean that the character is well developed. Yes, I admit that a big ensemble like this film is quite complicated for every character to be well-developed, but that doesn't mean that no character should have it. <br /> <br /> (2) The dialogue really seems to be that I am really surprised that this film became the best original scenario. They should show this in the film script writing class NO, because it's good, but to show students and future writers who MUST not do. I just felt that my head was over and over again, how bad racism is. I get it. <br /> <br /> (3) The plot seems so casual, it's ridiculous. What are the chances that a black car rider runs over an Asian man who is also a human trafficker when he entered his van, and the same black car robber ended up with this Asian man a few hours later when he was brought to the hospital just for that purpose to find out that several Asians are traded in vans to show you that a black car rig is a good thing? Or, if this is the scene where the bare white woman who had fallen down the stairs and all her prejudices and anger disappeared into the air? If it was easy, why don't we throw every racist in America down the stairs to turn them into heart? <br /> <br /> (4) I think my biggest doubts about this movie are unrealistic in terms of racism. As a person who has experienced racism in his life, there is a realistic view of racism that it is more hidden than his face. I have been refused entry into the supermarket because I am not white. Did the store owner say I wasn't white? No, he said the shop was shut down, although there were many people who went shopping. Did he shout about racial attacks? Racism in America is more hidden. Some cab drivers may no longer stop because you are not white, but that does not mean that they are trying to drive you or get out and tell you about racial slowness. When a Chinese woman finished me, I wouldn't say "blake! Blake! Learn some English bitch!". On the other hand, when I was a Chinese woman and I accidentally returned to a Mexican woman, I am not saying, "Mexicans are bad drivers" in front of her face. It's not how things work. Instead, I would give my insurance information, I apologize, and go home and tell my fellow Chinese friends and family that the Mexicans are poor drivers and amuse them behind. This is true racism. It's hidden and not your face. <br /> <br /> In any case, Crash is not an original, unlike what some people say. Locking and intertwining story lines, plots and signs have been made in the past. "Magnolia" is a movie that makes it much better than Crash, but it is never the Oscar's best picture. It had a constellation - Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman (who recently won the best actor), Tom Cruise, etc. It displaces my way of thinking, how Crash was even the best image candidate.
