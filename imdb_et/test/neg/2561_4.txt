I remember when it came out, this was the first kung fu movie we ever saw around our way and we were all happy about seeing it. Although the action was mediocre at best, we gave the first kung fu taste and the poor duplication of our first taste, as well bad film making or, more specifically, how the Chinese people made movies at that time. They were undoubtedly lower issues, but there was an entertaining value and it was definitely sure. Kung fu madness had begun and Bruce Lee and '' Chinese association '' will soon follow it or '' Chinese boxer '' with Jimmy Wang Yu. In any case, this film was chosen to lead.
