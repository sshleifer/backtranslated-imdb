If you want to see a fear film that is a terrible and very bad taste, it's definitely a movie to watch. These movies start with two young teenagers who get wild ideas about getting into the chat room and leaving the blind days. A lot of blood, gore, nudity, handcuffs and all kinds of blood drain hooks and things that a person never dreams of are able to fill men and women. If you like piercing, this piercing is a heavy heavy hook and a lot of tattoos; besides, there are lots of needles and yarns to close things to the human body. I really hope that this film will not give sick people in this world, the idea of ​​acting in their real life with these horrors.
