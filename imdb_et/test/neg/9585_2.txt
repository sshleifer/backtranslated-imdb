This is the worst exercise in the middle class of pretense that is still on our TV screens. Unfortunately, I did not see it for the first time, but it was a pleasure to look at a six-hour scary - and I'm still waiting to laugh.

But he played this part as well as he was able to consider the lack of any proper comedy material. I would like to remind broadcasters that the Trade Descriptions Act can be used if you continue to bill as a comedy material, at best pseudo-psychological romance and, at worst, a dramatic comedy to conceal a thing that is neither fish nor bird; .
