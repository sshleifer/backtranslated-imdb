It's hard to make it fill 10 rows .... But ill try it (just to prevent others from making the same mistake I did - watch this (terrible and boring) movie. <br /> <br /> I like Patrick swayze - he did great performance in movies like Ghost - Dirty Dancing - Point Break - North & South (TV series), but in this movie ..... ARGH .... This movie is so booooooring, acting terrible - script sucks - well. I can't even find one good thing, anything, absolutely nothing, I looked at it with two other friends, and we all agreed that it was one of the most boring films we had ever seen and that it lasts longer than 3 hours ( what we didn't know) - when part 1 was over and said "to be continued", we almost shouted "nooooooooooooo, do we have to watch another 90 minutes for this movie !!!!". <br /> <br /> the painful vision of the film: You never get the impression that the actors are Russians, the action is very bad. ULT good scene is when th The truck explodes at the beginning of the movie! The rest is CRAP! GO clean your toilet instead of watching this movie (and don't come rolling, crying when you see this movie - you were warned before!) Personally, I would advise Patrick Swayze to call his representative and ask them to remember this movie. so bad.
