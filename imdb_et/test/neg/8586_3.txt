I was looking forward to seeing this movie because the trailer saw it so cool. But the fact is that this movie is boring and completely confusing. There is no plot and half of the movie is a fast flashing picture of football games. Magnified in frames that do not give an overview of the games. I was constantly watching the timer to see when the movie was over! <br /> <br /> There is only one good thing in this movie. Sound! The soundtrack is awesome! ............. Don't expect anything from this movie.
