Don't do me wrong. I have a significant soft spot for Charles Bandi's work as a producer and director. But you have to raise the brow when a man who was ready to put his name "Dollman Vs Demonic Toys" puts it on a pseudonym. As a bit of a bad movie fun, the "Family Leader" is rather inadequate, although it has worked better than expected. Jacqueline Lovell is a solid talent who deserves better than such films. J.W. Perra is also quite funny as the title of a monster, although with such superintelligence it gets quite easy. I know I'm funny because the rest of the movie is, of course, so sharp and funny ... <br /> <br /> And who has the Lance Bogan token? Nice one guys. We didn't know the Americans knew this piece of slang!
