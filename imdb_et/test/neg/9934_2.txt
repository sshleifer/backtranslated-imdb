I have been a fierce Star Trek fan since 1966. One thing I learned from Star Trek is that special effects are next to the characters. Encounter At Farpoint fails in his mission. <br /> <br /> Greatly produced. <br /> <br /> Easily managed, written, acted. D.C. Fontana really blew it. This episode is so embarrassing that the captain tape should be burned. <br /> <br /> The first half of the first season wasn't much better.
