<br /> <br /> A very slow, confusing movie with a messy story. The only hope for the film to keep the audience interested is to have free nudity at regular intervals. Ellen Barkin has failed and her appearance won't last when she's on screen with a much younger Peta Wilson. Not sure what this movie was.
