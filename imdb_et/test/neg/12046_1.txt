I was going to watch this movie in the theater and the money I paid to think it would be at least a little fun. The only thing I had was when Robin Williams fell into the car at the bottom of the hill and at the end when he seems to have been killed. Glenn Close was uncomfortable and he probably didn't seem old enough to be Garp's mother. Mother, like Garp, would have been taken away by the Children's and Families Department. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams and his glazed donut with benign goodness are too sweet and fragrant for me. He has two roles he can play: a funny person or a sad, tragic, cordial victim. Watch Fisher King, Good Morning Vietnam and all his "dramatic" roles. It's always the same performance. Put them all in one long mini-series. Glenn Close is always a cold fish. Remember Fatal Attraction? Would you have a deal with him even on your worst day and if you were single? Did you feel any sparks between him and Michael Douglas? Have you ever seen Glenn Close warming up on any screen? John Lithgow had the only interesting role. It was back on the day he played with serial numbers and bad players, so seeing him as a transsexual was at least funny. The garp is made for all those people who love to see movies of sick, abnormal, disturbing people and claim it is beautiful and deep.
