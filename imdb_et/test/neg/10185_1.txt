My mother and I rent this movie. We think we love these Sci-Fi flaps, be they big Hollywood flexes or Indy flicks. <br /> <br /> But, we were deceived! Two journalists are investigating UFO abduction in a small town in Texas. Halfway, all of the sudden things come to us all Christian. My mother and I believe in God and in Jesus and the Devil, but how this film proclaimed it annoyed. All I really have to say is that we are Christians, but even we want to have fun. So don't blame the Christians as a whole, but blame the Christians who have to suck this movie in a fun way. <br /> <br /> In fact, you can clearly understand the position of directors in relation to UFOs, and that is that he believes it is all demonic. Now I can say a few words, but not. All I say is that you DO NOT watch this movie if you don't feel preached. In fact, he says several times that we must be perfect to enter heaven. Well, the last time I checked, the only perfect person died on the cross.
