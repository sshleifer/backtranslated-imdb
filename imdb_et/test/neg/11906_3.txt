There is some irony in the parody of the Gothic genre that has become a mess of filmmakers who had no idea what the purpose of this story was, or simply didn't care. All of the features of your middle family are modern younger siblings, a tough teenager who doesn't want to move, who are the central parents who can't see the revelation and of course the romantic sub-block. The film has very little in common with Wilde's original story, which was largely written for a fun melodramatic Gothic short story that was always a rage. If Wilde saw this version, he would probably laugh and then, of course, write a parody. One can only hope that children who looked at this wonderful, mass-produced cardboard eventually discovered the spirit and shine of the original version.
