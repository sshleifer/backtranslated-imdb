It is a rare feeling to meet a movie that is so embarrassing that you feel the urge to turn off the screen. But when you see a noble actor, like Sir John Gielgud, surrounded by naked, the couples are copying what you want to do. Add Peter O'Toole as the syphilis warrior Emperor Tiberius and Malcolm McDowell, who hold the finger in the hole, and you will begin to realize that Caligula is an interesting addict to the disgusting movie. <br /> <br The film describes the life of the infamous Roman Emperor Caligula (McDowell), a very disrupted person whose story has been spoken through sexual encounters, fraud, betrayal, murder, bleeding, and lesbian sexual scenes. Although> Caligula was completely crazy in real life, and most likely he went to his basic drills more than not, the film is still unforgivable. The sex used in the film is not used as one aspect of the multilayer story - sex is a story. After some time, all nudity, hip movement and nipple sucking will become quite repetitive. The performances are completely undisciplined, especially McDowell, who throws the wind gently and gives a play that is all wild. O'Toole seems to be contemptuous of what he deserves in dealing with the script (surely he's only for money?!). Rumors are abundant that, with the consent of the filmmakers, additional pornographic scenes were added during the post-production, but in fact, Caligula is not one minute that is dignified or well done. It is doubtful that this time, talent and money will ever be thrown into a porn film, so Caligula is one-of-a-kind experience in this sense ... on the other hand, it is so monumentally terrible that maybe it is "one -of-a-kind ", is a hidden blessing.
