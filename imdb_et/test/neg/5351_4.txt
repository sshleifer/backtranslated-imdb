I have not read John Grisham's "Time to Kill" and maybe it would have helped make the film better understood. But maybe not. I hear it is still the most faithful adaptation of Grisham, and if this is true, I see why so many publishers rejected the novel when Grisham introduced it first. <br /> <br /> "Time to Kill" is one of those movies that is seriously confused and wants to do too many things at once. He wants to be a thriller crowd of the crowd and at the same time a film dedicated to researching certain social and moral issues. Let's face it, these two types of movie don't go together in Hollywood, so Dead Man Walking had to do it independently. <br /> <br /> The story involves a young lawyer, Jake (Matthew McConaughy), to defend a black man named Carl (Samuel L. Jackson), murdering two mountain songs that raped his young daughter cruelly. The day before the rape trial, Carl hid in the courtyard building a court house, and when the rapists passed through the building, he put him down and both died. Protected by Jack with the help of a former lawyer (Sandra Bullock) who proves that his role in this film was totally unnecessary and that the film was only placed for marketing purposes. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, one of the rapist's brother (Kiefer Sutherland) was angry that the black man had killed his brother and decided to revenge. All this leads to the shooting of the courthouse, kidnapping, brutal beating and racial attack. I admit that all of this kept a lot of attention besides the courtroom scenes alongside the whole movie. What I later challenged was dealing with the ethical issues of the film and using it in the scheme. <br /> <br /> The main question the film constantly asks over and over is whether the black man will be a fair trial white tool. Of course they will, but that does not mean that the man has to be convicted for a fair trial. However, this film does not seem like that. In addition, there are a number of openings in the plot. For example, there is an unknown sign called the Mickey Mouse, a member of the Clan, and for unknown reasons the members of the defense team help to escape the serious dangers of other Clan members. After Bullher has been kidnapped by Sutherland and the company and left dead in the desert, this unknown person comes and rescues him --- and we never know who he is and why he helps people he should terrorize. /> <br /> And when talking about Sutherland's character of terror, it is astonishing that the character of the police and Bullock cannot stop him on the whole film. There's a scene where Sutherland becomes a sniper from a building outside the courthouse and tries to shoot Jake by shooting one instead. Now, you think, because there are dozens of police, it would be easy for a sniper to be surrounded and captured. There is no such happiness. Nobody even cared about what we saw, that the sniper was still open. Even after Bullock, Mickey Mouse rescued him, he never mentioned who was his kidnapper, nor was he questioned. Why was that? Easy. The character of Sutherland was needed throughout the film to add constant tension, although logically he should have been out of the picture. <br /> <br /> In addition to Bullock's character, there is another ungrateful character. He is Jake's assistant, played by Oliver Platt. The film seems to have one reason for its character - to provide the audience with several single liners. In my opinion, the use of a "one-liner" shows a significant weakness of "serious" films. This shows that filmmakers are not sure that the story and dialogue alone are enough to keep the audience's attention, and use them to make the audience laugh to convince everyone that they are watching an entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> But many of the film's minor problems are enough. But the movie message here? It is clear that Carl is guilty of murder. We saw how he planned to kill men who raped their daughter. Lawyers argue that it was a temporary madness, etc. that caused him to kill. In desperation, Jake asks the jury to close her eyes when she speaks in detail as part of her debate. After all that happened, he described one final line ... "The girl is white". Then we see the members of the jury with eye tears. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, the girl has to shout: "She's free! He's free! ‚Äù. Wait a minute! Do juries base their decisions on their emotions or facts? Most importantly, there were no scenes that would show the jury's discussions and what they really meant after the wear of their emotions. I'll tell you why. They could not show the debate because NO JURY could not justify a person for such a crime, no matter how many defense solutions their hearts touched. What is a message? The fact that someone is justified in killing if it is a form of revenge for crimes before them? <br /> <br /> This movie should have said boldly that the murder is not OK in this situation, because in reality it would not be justification. But because the dollars were at stake, filmmakers were more interested in saving the audience's feelings than in delivering a responsible message. When people begin to kill like a form of revenge, the filmmakers should be held accountable. What is a socially irresponsible film!
