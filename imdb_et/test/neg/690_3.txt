Although Humphrey Bogart received the letter of the Underworld King, I am ready to bet that he did not thank Jack Warner for that. In fact, this film was a hollow crown. <br /> <br /> King Alma was allegedly a Paul Muni movie, dr. Socrates, a remake, but Humphrey Bogart was given a thing, this character is written more in the Duke Mantee Petrified Fort. In James Stephenson's person, he even has an English writer. <br /> <br /> Kay Francis and John Eldredge are married doctors and Eldredge pulls down a sophisticated surgery to one of Bogart's messengers. Bogey is a man who values ​​good work on his behalf and gives Eldredge $ 500.00 and there is more than it came when he was playing his cards correctly. Eldredge, who has a gambling problem, sees a good opportunity to get some undeclared income. <br /> <br /> But when he was killed in a gang assault, it is believed that Francis is also involved in law and the American Medical Association, no matter how much he protests against his innocence. It's not good and he and his aunt Jessie Busley are moving to a small town to get away from the notoriety. <br /> <br /> Of course, the notoriety is Bogart and migrant Leslie Howard as a writer at Stephenson. again. But Kay is weird and inventive to say at least. <br /> <br /> The character of Bogart was ridiculous, no wonder the poor man screamed for better parts. He is a gangster, both of whom let the people ruthlessly down and give their wives a laugh. He is worried about his image and therefore abdicates the writer Stephenson that the ghost should be written on his autobiography and, of course, admits enough to burn him in all 48 countries. And then let's assume that Kay Francis will get over it completely, hard to believe he was a king. <br /> <br /> Certainly one of these characters is less.
