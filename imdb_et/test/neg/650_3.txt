I really wanted to like this movie, but it was just too slow. <br /> <br /> It was a nice story, but it was really like watching a slave. <br /> <br /> The movie would have been better served if it had anything else. I don't think anything big but at least something in the background. <br /> <br /> Songs that set the tone / mood of longer periods of lack of dialogue could also have helped. br /> <br /> It has been around 10 years since I've seen it, so maybe you have to give it another chance. <br /> <br /> 3/10 or * 1/2 (out of four)
