I can't really think of this movie as a good point. The story is absolutely terrible. Action is as blunt as a carrot and the script is so bad that it wants to kill itself. OK, if you love (and you need to love it to understand) riding a snowboard that you might enjoy microscopically, because it has big mountains and some cool moves, but it is terrible. It has some totally foolish ideas and racist with both black and whites who offend each other. The only time you laugh is when you laugh for stupidity or when you feel the film after embarrassment. I've seen a lot of movies and I have to say it's the worst movie I've ever seen. If you have this movie, I would recommend it back from where you bought it and get the money back.
