Every James Bond film has its own rules. Just like every Indiana Jones movie has its own rules. And the fact that scriptwriters do not violate these rules retains the integrity of the characters. The integrity of the film in both oceans is a completely unwanted plot twist somewhere between Airplane 2 and Roadrunner. Indy told Shorty and Willie they wouldn't worry because he had secretly supreme abilities on the first two films and they could fly for safety. <br /> <br /> Entertaining? Of course, Roadrunner comic. But Spielberg would never have done it because it would have destroyed the film's integrity. More importantly, it would be an ENGLISH audience. They were already sitting at their seats through Indiana Jones' 3-hour movies and they hoped for Indiana to get out of the tag incredibly. Where would he fly? People would have gone out of theaters like people in the 12th ocean. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> 1. Julia Roberts'character, Tess, invades the museum, hiding itself as ... Julia Roberts? Smart twisting? Breaking the fourth wall three hours after introducing these characters? Is it Naked Gun 33 and 1/3? This is a textbook example of how cheap laughter can ruin the whole movie. But wait ... only if you haven't gone out ... <br /> <br /> 2. The relationship builds the whole movie in the last hour - how they pull out of them - there's only 10 ... 8. .. 5 ... 2 DAYS LEFT! And then in the last 12 minutes of the movie, ONLY the fun part of this movie, we see that they were made days earlier and took Matt Damon for 30 seconds. The last 10 days? Perfect waste of time. <br /> <br /> BACK TO INDIAN JONES ROPE ... "Just relax, Willie! I stole REAL stones about a month ago! Kate Capshaw!" <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it yet, cut your losses and see Polar Express. I don't want to end the end for you, but there's really Santa. The most important thing is that you are not feeling disappointed about leaving the theater.
