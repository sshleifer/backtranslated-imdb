Lethal Panther 2, based in the Philippines, is a martial arts contest in the early 1990s, which sees careless policemen chasing criminals who killed their wife. Rather, cheap art, which has no artistic value, depends on the quality and quantity of its activity. But while there are no shortcomings, weapon battles and explosions, quality is simply not there. Endless battles are lacking in originality or excitement, with poor editing and daily routines that make this movie a real adornment to sit on. <br /> <br /> Usually impressive, Yukari Oshima is completely wasted, his natural athletic ability somewhat overshadowed by bad wires. Ballistic action scenes are an impressive blend of "slow-moving air-to-air-same-shot" heroes, crazy vehicle stunts, and endless bad guys. <br /> <br /> With so many better examples of the "girls and weapons" genre that is now available on DVD, I suggest you leave it alone (if you, like me, no longer suffer old rubbish that be a graduate).
