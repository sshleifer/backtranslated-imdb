There are so many things wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges's strange accent. <br /> <br /> Rita's ability to break the password code <br /> <br /> The whole script <br /> <br /> End - esp last scene when Jeff and Rita and the publisher have two coffee on the table. J & R laughs and says, "We don't drink coffee anymore". Well, why did they order it? They probably did. If they didn't do it and the waiter would bring everyone the coffee by default, there would have been three coffees. <br /> <br /> Total Tosh.
