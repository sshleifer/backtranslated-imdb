Kevin Spacey is undoubtedly one of the best actors of the 90s. After her performances at the usual suspect, Se7en and American Beauty, you expect more and more. That is why ordinary decent criminal crimes are a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> Michael Lynch is the most brilliant criminal in Dublin who is never in a bad mood. His next thoughts become obsessed when his partners begin to question Michael's ability to plan everything perfectly, even though it is the only thing he does when he doesn't play a good father at home. <br /> <br /> I think it's partly my fault that I didn't pay enough attention to the thousands of plot details that unfortunately turn out to be the "content" of the movie. I gave the film a chance to parody and .... well, the parodies are always funny, no matter what they're corrupted or how they do it. So, it wasn't a complete parody after all. It's just a different film that desperately tries to be funny and fails. Unlike some of his "colleagues", a normal decent criminal punishment depends too much on development and logical continuity, forgetting what is the main reason. The viewer has chosen such a movie - for entertainment. This is definitely not entertainment. It includes one of the most ridiculous scenes - introducing two of Michael's women. I don't know if this is a pointless metaphor or a strange, dark humor, but chicks are siblings. Remember that the Spacey character has children. You don't expect a funny scene. Instead, follow the dialogue carefully, because there is a great chance of losing yourself to the boring, pale universe, the film is inhabited. Go back to Spacey. I do not know in what situation he has signed this film. It's not twilight, but something much worse. Blame on his work in American Beauty, which appeared a year before the usual decent criminal proceedings. The character Michael is eccentric and conversational. Spacey is at times almost pathetic. Only to treat it is to think of Lester Burnham and Roger Kint. <br /> <br /> Writer Gerrard Stembridge should definitely reconsider his screen writing abilities and be more objective this time. Because dialogue is very weak and scenes are often meaningless. And we're still talking about comedy. The usual decent criminal procedure is really a bad criminal comedy that doesn't deserve your attention.
