Hedy Lamarr, who may be more men on the screen than any other actor, is once again a custodian of Kent Taylor, a playboy of society and a general rat. On Yucatan's boat, after Taylor gave her a brush, she committed suicide. But Dr. Spencer Tracy saves him from drowning in the Caribbean. <br /> <br /> Tracy is all medical staff. I think she never heard a word specialist. He leads a clinic for the poor in Manhattan and his trip was a secondary activity in medical research. Lamarr and he are getting married and trying to introduce him to his world, and he even becomes a partner of the socialist Louis Calhern. Of course, Kent Taylor's reenters picture and Hollywood inevitable happens. Look that I take this woman seemed to me that the writers were very much affected by Tracy's Oscar winning Boys Town. Unfortunately, his role is not the patch of Doctor Karl Decker as to what he did as Father Flanagan. Maybe they were trying to live in the movie so much that their father gave Flanagan a little romance. <br /> <br /> Tracy and Lamarr didn't get too good. In fact, this movie was called I Retake This Woman because the original director Joseph Von Sternberg walked out of the film, probably because Lamarr didn't work for him as Marlene Dietrich did. She made Lady of the Tropics and then MGM went back to filming it with her contract manager, Woody Van Dyke, who was known for the speed of her productions. And a completely new form of support was introduced. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, both Spence and Hedy had better roles for both.
