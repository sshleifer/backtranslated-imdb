It has to say something about the situation of our people that this program is one of the most popular ones currently being reviewed. <br /> <br /> The "Square" is carried by such an unhappy, unreliable, immoral, silly, relentless and pointless group of characters that you can imagine. Everyone has a backside who is trying to commit adultery, everyone is trying to cheat. That, or they're caught, beaten or kidnapped. No one is cheerful. No one laughs. No one is dazzling happiness or really a nice day. It's hell, with a cockney accent. <br /> <br /> I suspect that this program must be supported by the Samaritans. This is the perfect view of depression. It doesn't delight them; What he does is a whole community of such infinitely sad saddies that viewers are moved to believe that their party can really be worse - they can live in "Albert Square". <br /> <br /> above; As a representation of the East of London, it is a pure hockey.

They couldn't pass 5 minutes without any other racial or ethnic discrimination as their own and frightening and uncomfortable. 'Fackin' in Pakis 'and' fackin 'Maceroons' were small conversation changes. In fact, the stock of all (and extremely limited) adjectives associated with sexual organs and their implementation is. Alf Garnett was a paragon of liberal virtue. . Imagine a Ku Klux Klan script written by Quentin Tarantino. But if they weren't major accidents, they were at least extremely joyful. <br /> <br /> I don't know how such a soap opera was. This imaginary island of white ailments has no effect on the actual culture. And if you're relatively sanguine, it quickly reduces your grief to tears. Compared to ordinary actors who claim to be relatively common crown-depression with coke-accent - what's the point? Probably the most popular program for the sick and dying people. <br /> <br /> Avoid this as a plague.
