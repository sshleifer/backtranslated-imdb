My bad film guru (and the president of the exhibited film association) created it for us last week. Demented gleam in his eyes was not denied when he pulled out his brown paper bag and announced what he had for us: "The most dangerous game", filmed with a budget of about $ 2.95. <br /> <Br /> Of course, $ 2.95 went a lot further in 1962, but still ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is definitely a lot to please. It has a lot of technical gaffs (my favorite was a "recurring musket" that fired twice in two minutes without recharging). The hero is a horse who stands when his wounded friend fights for a henchman and kills. <br /> <br /> More? OK - The plot is a generation where there is no consistency to talk about. The film is wasted for five minutes with a "special guest star" who is the physical embodiment of villain's madness and paranoia, but never shows him. The hero is unconsciously suffocated by the henchman but does not mention it when he wakes up and meets for the first time in his host. The mute maid girl has been caught, put on a rack ... and then the film (and the hero who put her in that situation) just sort of "forgets" her. <br /> <br /> More? Well, kits are cheap and special effects are cheaper (makeup is an exception). Much of the plot is dragged by the narrator, a monotonous voice command that has less dramatic effect than the rationale behind Denny's menus. Most of the dialogue is simply ridiculous and stylish, as if it had been translated from Japanese. ("I want our conversation to be pleasant !!!") And the color values ​​tended to move violently, as if it were a cheap movie and a problematic lighting device day. (Note - this might be a bad print rather than a camera team). <br /> <br /> But here and there were a couple of good moments. In contrast to the rest of the film, the effects of the makeup were amazingly good, the actors were interested in the interesting, especially resilient maid and the Countess. In spite of everything, a creepy atmosphere was found, very disgusting and disturbing. <br /> <br /> What was this movie? I thought about it a little and realized that director / writer Pat Boyette was basically trying to tell the story of the old "EC" peacekeeping movie. It would mean stylistic dialogue, sketchy character development (in comic, physiognomy = character even more than in film), story in the inner logic of the eye ("EC" horror stories went to add nasty "shock" ends and was not great in psychological realism), excessive dependence on narrative the voices (which are in the headlines of the panels) and the interesting make-up effects that imitated the harsh images the old EC artists did so well. Indeed, I would be prepared to bet that when Boyette saw her leading man at the time of casting, she immediately saw that the companion was as close to the dusky, frightening figures and faces that artists like Johnny Craig and Jack Davis pulled real person, can and still is in the real world. He used costumes and lighting to emphasize the comic book of visuals and made all the living EC comics. (See: the beauty of the leading woman, the characteristics of the strong bones of the county, the strange bronze skin and the sharp chin, the platinum "with the long bones of black bones, etc.". This explains the shortcomings of the film. Boyette knew how to "frame" things, but he did not know how to deal with the three dimensions and moving bodies. Boyette knew how to talk about the horrible story within the comic book page, but the nuances of the movie and the living actors fled to him. He wouldn't be the first person to have this problem of course - see what Joel Schumacher did "Batman." But he had no big budget to hide. <br /> <br /> In any case, I imagine that Boyette walked away from the wreck of this train and probably spent less time thinking of "Harrow's Cave" than people posting on the movie bulletin boards Certainly, within the vague boundaries, he did what he did, and you have to respect him ... even if you don't care about Harrow.
