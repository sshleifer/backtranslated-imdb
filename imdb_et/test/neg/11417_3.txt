Simply put, it was a dog poopie piece. It is too gradual and everyone is the queen of all melodramatic drama at any moment. After a while I started to want every film character not to have such a stuffed anal return. <br /> <br /> And this movie is one of those really annoying things that have come in fashion recently and shouldn't be: all scenes are a blown, blue-steel-gray. Hmmm, the last time I checked, candles and flashlights can produce a pretty wide spectrum of colors. In fact, the light they put out tends to be in the warm, yellow-orange spectrum. So where are all the blue-steel-gray lights? <br /> <br /> This movie is fictional with sets and glitzy cgi fx, but it's still a dreck. This is a pathetic junk that is being released to today's film-makers, who are easily terrible pathetic junk. <br /> <br /> I am very pleased with the vampires and werewolves as drawing machines, but it was a complete hacker. <br /> <br /> Universal Studios' 1941 The Wolfman is endlessly better than this, although its fx is quite primitive compared to today's operations. <br /> <br /> I will do this with the franchise. The first film was reasonably decent. The second one is still somewhat fun. But it couldn't even finish up to the end, because it was so boring.
