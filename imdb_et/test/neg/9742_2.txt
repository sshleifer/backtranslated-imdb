The way the post office hired this character is far from me. The test that postal workers take is so difficult. It is not that the guy who gets this stupid can work in the post office. Everyone in this movie is just stupid and it's probably a movie point. How can they go all their lives and not see the elevator. I didn't take this movie too seriously, but it was so stupid. Then he tries to start the car without his keys? A lot of terrible scenes and terrible actions, and this movie is not funny at all. It's just a sad stupid mess. I liked the moms dress. <br /> <br /> Send it back to the sender as soon as possible.
