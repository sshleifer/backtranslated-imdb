this film plot revolves around the submarine builder who is a real bastard and wants to launch his new sub-school, which can travel thousands of feet deep. unfortunately he can't do that. Oh yes, and he haunts memories of his mother and father who have eaten megalodone during the child. The man meets some scientist who is quite hot, and they and the team who are about a hundred people put the main game on a submarine to kill the same megalodon that killed their parents. . basically it's sorta like Shark Attack 3, except for more frustrating. if you don't get what I mean, listen. The opening credits of the movie show the "home films" of the main game when he was with the child with his parents before they were killed, and there is really sad and depressing piano music. you would expect a shark or something and you do. CGI shark short shadow swims every few seconds, but that's just it. Also, I do not remember any happy facial expressions throughout the entire duration of the film, most of the film takes place in the dark depths of the abyss, where the story becomes even fader and all characters (including shark) die eventually. I thought Sabato would be able to kill the shark and save himself and the girl, but no, they all die and the film ends up in the shark, all blown and submerged (with the Sabato broken and burnt body in it) deeply sinking. if you're a happy person and you don't feel depressed, beware of this movie. if you are the opposite, congratulations, you found your movie.
