No word can be described as a terrible movie. It's like a filmmaker literally in a film roll *** and sent it to the audience. <br /> <br /> The action of this movie is terrible, the plot is so stupid and death every sign is ridiculously bad. Some foolish scenes are Akshay Kumar, who pulls out the gun somewhere to kill the hologram (yes hologram), Akshay Kumar, who wears the city in the capital, Rajat Bedi beats the poorly animated skeleton, Rajat Bedi and Siddharth double-penetrated Monisha Korella (How did they think they would it was straight?). I would also like to point out that the animations are absolutely terrible. The scene supporting this statement is when Kapal has a motorcycle and somehow glasses. The purchase looks like it's done in Microsoft colors. <br /> <br /> The best parts of this movie are Sunny Deol. This man is so strong that he even makes God fear. In one scene, he literally opens the door to the prison. Chuck Norris's round house has nothing! He's so powerful that he can fly from London to India in 10 minutes! In general, this film is the worst made film in the universe. If you look at it, check it out for fun (BTW this movie should be serious)
