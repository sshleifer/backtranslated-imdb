This film could have been an impressive epic, but the makers seem to have done their best to make it stupid. Even God has not been saved in this film because His words are exhausted with childish jokes. The result is pious and annoying. Only people who do not care to see a cheap parody of the biblical story can perhaps watch this movie without embarrassment. The makers of this tasteless production should see a film by Il Vangelo secondo Matteo (by Mathewi), Pier Paolo Pasolini, who shows that the words of the Bible are not indispensable to a good story; the most impressive result is achieved by loyal lyrics.
