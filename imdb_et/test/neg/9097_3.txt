This movie has some real gorey parts, like a boy who is going to turn a little down and other big bites. Castle Freak itself is a good monster. I'd be scared when he came after me. But the film had some parts on it. <br /> <br /> Spouse is drunk and kills her 3-year-old son and roller for her teenage daughter. I think death is greater than darkness, but you never know that parents feel bad when their daughter is blind. All they care about is that "J.J. is dead!" Though their teenage daughter walks in and talks about how she can never drive. Parents are like "honey, stop walking without a guide, you know it better," and then they cry and never stop depression because JJ is dead. Sounds like favortism to me. <br /> <br /> Dialogue lines are not very realistic or well done. For example, if there is a giant crash in the castle, everyone will go to the basement to see what it was. It was a big mirror that fell down and shattered. The husband runs into a broken mirror in horror and says clearly: "The mirror broke." I don't know, I'd say a little more than that, when a gigantic mirror fell on the ground in my castle. <br /> <br /> Spouse has some important relationships and it's funny to see how stupid they are with each other. Nobody believes in a dark girl. Tip: When a dark girl says she hears things, believe her and don't tell her to close. I think it's a moral story. Listen to people when they talk to you, or else you can finally prove your point. <br /> <br /> Finally, I thought the best character was the main police officer. He was the best actor and character. All the others (except Castle Freaks) were running the mill. 3/10
