The secret of a low-budget murder that concerns a public defender trying to explain his client's murder when he was convicted 12 years ago. The complication of things is that he escaped under custody after conviction, but PD believes that a person is innocent and works to find a real killer. Gig Young as a PD is fine and James Anderson, as a convicted killer, is actually pretty good, but the picture as a whole comes up with little tension and despite some good character designers, performances are usually below par. Director George Archainbaud was probably more in his homeland, doing western - he despised the Gene Autry TV series in Columbia around this time - but even if he tried to enliven that image, his attempts would be hacked. At best, the top of the film is a courtroom scene that is directly from the "Perry Mason" episode and is just as predictable.
