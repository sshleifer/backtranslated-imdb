Tyra Banks have to teach these girls that it's not just a beautiful look. Internal also reads something. Many past winners have felt half-decent, but are terribly cruel and trouble for other girls. I see that Tyra is less involved with girls every season. The only thing worth seeing is Jay Manuel. Recently, Tyra was a competitor who was op-transsexual. I felt he should have encouraged him more. It was obvious that he had uncertainty about his original anatomy, which shows his feminine appearance. Tyra should have given her tips or maybe she could have sent Trannie pr. Instead, the contestant met tough criticism and not enough positive criticism. It's a shame because I really enjoyed the first 3 seasons. The reason is that Project Runway has all four seasons on a DVD and the top model has only one season on the DVD. It's called flavors. The Top Model needs a lot more of humanity's renewal.
