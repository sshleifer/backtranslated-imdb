It seems to be a cinema spectrum. On the left are films made mainly for entertainment and / or commercial purposes. In the middle, there are movies that are both entertaining and artistic. On the right are films that are not so commercial but focus more on cinema than on art as cinema as a product. , but if the movie goes too far, it's rarely good. This is the case with Naqoyqats. <br /> <br /> I had no idea what to expect when I saw it. Some friends went and asked if I wanted to come. None of us knew what to expect, and finally, none of us was happy. <br /> <br /> Yes, there's a breathtaking picture. Yeah, I'm surprised what the filmmakers went to search for archive material. Yes, the audio track is enjoyable to listen to and probably the best part of this experience. The thing is that it goes so far to the right side of the spectrum that I have said that I can't say anything nice about the film as a whole. It is a symbolism and an obvious moral. It does not say anything new or force the viewer to explore a new life. It tells us things we already know (that is, we can even understand what it says). <br /> <br /> This movie is just for art. Attempt to say "See how deep and thoughtful we can be through assembly!" When a film becomes more about how clever or intelligent its creators are than its object, the film ceases to exist and simply becomes the satisfaction of the celluloid itself.
