I watched this movie about six years ago and did it recently. When I remember correctly, I didn't like it for the first time, and I appreciated it a second time more. <br /> <br /> This movie is probably on a big budget. Impacts are usually the upper limit (except for one or two "effects") and the cast is impressive. However, there are some elements that destroy the overall impression of the exhibition. First of all, who decided that Peter Stormare should act as a mad Russian astronaut should be fired. Being a Swede and a Peter's fan, I'm pretty sure he can play Russian well. But his performance in this case is a common fool, both in terms of expression and actor. So ... there must be something wrong with the script. I would like to see Peter as a professional Russian astronaut. Secondly, the action steps on the surface are so intense that viewing is almost intolerable. It's a total chaos that lasts for over thirty minutes to breathe. In addition, the events that occur are not just reliable. I would like to see a much more reasonable and written version of this part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, scenes involving flying shuttles are too active. Trains are maneuverable if they are a couple of MIGs, at a safe distance, while tapping car-sized ice blocks like ping-pong balls. The director should look at Apollo 13 to learn about the constraints of the spacecraft, like these. <br /> <br /> I like the music score because it is dramatic to the point that makes it very touching. The overall performance of the actors is great. In addition to the things mentioned above, the story is interesting and quite easy to follow. <br /> <br /> With some minor changes, it would have been an 8/10 movie. I'm sorry it's not!
