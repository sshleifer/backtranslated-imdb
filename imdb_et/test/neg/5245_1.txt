GOOD: Techno music accompanying the medieval sword game. The film also seems to be smoother than most b-movies, but let's face it: Quake or Doom has more atmosphere. I usually see the potential of even very bad films; Heck, I love a good B-movie like "Split Second" and like it. But it has nothing but boredom and a clich√© to offer ... Fully predictable from start to finish. Oh, and I forgot the bad special effects, they look like an old Playstation game as something out of myth! The classic poem to sell this mammal offends me! <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION: Quite simply boring. If you want to see Lara Crofti then buy game, it is sexy!
