Plankton or Animals from Abyss, as I am positive, is more famous than & filmed when the title Animals from Abyss appear on a moving image and in the same font as the rest of the credit, starts with 20 of 20 kids, Mike (Clay Rogers) his girlfriend Margaret (Sharon Twomey ), sisters Julie (Ann Wolf) & Dorothy (Loren DePalm) & the annoying idiot named Bobby (Michael Bon) who decide to fit everything into a small rubber boat and head to the sea, don't ask why I don't know. Oh and the complete idiot Bobby left behind gasoline and has never thought anyone would be surprised that they would get into the sea without using gasoline and worse that they would be stormy in the thunderstorms and discover the dead body floating in the water. Soon after luck, they seem to change when they come into contact with yachts and possible safety. First of all, they find a scientific laboratory with a variety of fish and computer equipment, then below they find fully furnished and luxurious cabins. They find a chemist (Deran Sarafian) who seems crazy and can't speak. They eat fish in the refrigerator, which makes Dorothy green vomiting, beetles and butterflies. They learn that these fish are 1000-year-old live fossils and they are contaminated with toxic wastes discharged into the sea and that they are flying, mutating, biting and generally unpleasant. I really can't bother to go ahead with this plot sketch, so I don't want to, here I think ... <br /> <br /> This Italian production was brought and staged by the alias Al Passer of Massimiliano Cerchi. (I would hide under another name when I made this movie) And I think Plankton is just one of the worst films ever, with so many things in this movie that it's hard to know where to start with this movie. First of all, Richard Bauman's script is a complete mess, it makes no sense and is so slow and boring that I was tortured. Why did five people just go to the middle of the ocean with a rubber bulb that was barely big enough to fit all? What exactly did they plan for? Why do we often get viewpoints from these fish creatures, but they seem to be completely invisible to the characters because they are not displayed on the screen, even though they are next to the character, and how do these fish stay on the boat because they do not have the water to swim? People's actions and reactions to things are all wrong, they are constantly divided, they make strange decisions that just don't make sense in a situation where they find themselves and some dialogue is as terrible as anything I've heard. I could go all day around all the holes in the parcels and ridiculous events, but when I do, I run out of space. Fish creatures themselves see terribly, as a mixture of rubbish rubber dolls, and some really bad stop-motion animations, scenes where they interact with the human flow, also see terribly some bad super-effects. I've heard a lot of comments saying Plankton is crazy, don't laugh at me! Forget that there is almost no blood or gore in Plankton, there are a few slimy scenes when Bobby becomes a kalamone during sex with Julie, but it is quite short and he doesn't kill him, he's just some slippery mite on him and a couple of tentacles grow on him. the head of the fish comes out of his mouth. Later, Julie begins to drip a little mucus into the vagina, but that is not the case, we can never see what happens to her or what is mucus. Dorothy has a fish creature that comes out from behind, below the screen and controls her, but we never see what happens to her again, while Margaret suicides, a very short image of a plastic harpoon attached to her forehead. The most difficult scene is when Dorothy pulls this green stuff with what looks like beetles and slugs. It's just that only one person dies on the screen, and most often the plankton is pretty tame and as exciting as drying the color and I almost fell asleep, it's so boring. I don't see how anyone can like this complete crap, I just can't. Operation is terrible, duplication is terrible, characters are terrible and I hated them all. Tecnically Plankton is also a predictable mess with an estimated budget of just $ 250,000. Sets are monotonous and with one another in the laboratory and in some cabins, the special effect is the lower part of the barrel's stuff, including the most fake exploding boat, the cinema is empty, the music sucks, the zero atmosphere or the tension and all the tension in Plankton, like his name, is in the food chain as low as it could be. I hate Plankton, it's terrible every 86 minutes. Do it yourself and avoid it at all costs if you are not a masochist or insomniac.
