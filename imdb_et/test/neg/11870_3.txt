I'm from Romania ... and that's why I'm sorry if my English isn't so good. <br /> <br /> I finished this movie and I have to say I'm very disappointed. I always liked the Wesley Snipes movies, but it's terrible. I'm sorry I spent that movie less than 3 hours. There are many mistakes in the movie. For example, the stadium on the film is not Lia Manoliu. The name of the stadium is Ghencea. The name of the football team is called Steaua Bucuresti, not Uli. It is not possible to display graphic images in the stadium scoreboard: video repeats, live images, etc. This is a simple scoreboard that shows only letters and numbers. Uli (Seaua) team opponents are in the Din scoreboard (probably Dinamo Bucuresti - Steaua's main competitors at the Romanian football championship). Pictures of the football match come from a meeting between Steaua Bucurest and Poli Timisoara (my favorite team and my only love). The police cars in the movie are not properly made. There are no dark blue police cars in Romania! They are all white! The "list of errors" can go on and on ... but I'll stop here! In short, this movie is terrible. It's not worth renting, not worth buying a movie ticket, it's not worth it to download! I honestly feel that Wesley snips were playing in this movie. Previous movie of her ... 7 seconds ... also filmed in Romania ... was fine, but it's terrible!
