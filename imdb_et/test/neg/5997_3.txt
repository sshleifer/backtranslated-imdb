Potential viewers should be warned, the current IMDb viewer rating "Tomorrow at Seven" is a low turnout anomaly. It has an interesting assumption that the killer leaves the Ace of Spades card at the scene of the crime, warning the victim beforehand. However, filling is gradually falling and saying that the film has some of the openings in the parcels, which would mean there is actually a plot. Spade Ace of Killer by his latest novel. Broderick plans to interview a rich businessman for his book, but first he has to go to the man's eccentric secretary - "If you go with your relatives, you would have enough nuts to keep Ford together". She is certainly congratulated by Martha (Vivienne Osborne), a daughter of "nut", who introduces her introduction. courier delivered in the morning. The only remaining pieces, as we learn in the next scenario, are a bold and black form, a shadow of shadows that contains the words "At Seven Tomorrow Night". Now that the person who makes the puzzle does not use contrasting objects first! Initially, I was intrigued by the appearance of Frank McHugh and Allen Jenkins as a pair of police detectives called Drake's residence. In general, their characters are colorful enough to offer a real comic, but here they are just annoying. In particular, McHugh Clancy is opposed to the insignificant comments made by his partner Dugan, and both usually lead in the opposite direction if real problems can arise. <br /> <br /> Now the question is - in the light of identity, Ace killer, why would he have invited his writer and a couple of police officers he just met to fly to his Louisiana plantation? Especially if at 7 o'clock, all parties would be in captivity on the first plane committed in the first murder. But not Drake is dead, but his secretary is Austin Winters (Grant Mitchell). Early suspicion falls on the pilot Henderson (Cornelius Keefe) after the fire scene, but Henderson has still not reported his murder to his instructor until he arrives at Drake's plant with all other people. Can you imagine someone trying to get it out today, unless your name was Ted Kennedy? <br /> <br /> When the cause of death is still determined, the local coroner is called, but the first who shows (Broderick's accomplice) is fake. But when a real coroner appears, he just disappears immediately! In the second dark scene, a letter from the murder victim, Austin Winter, should be read. It goes out when the lights come back, and since it may refer to the murderer, it becomes a clue that needs to be downloaded. So where was the letter? The winter daughter Martha grabbed it and put the living room coat! How much thought was there? <br /> <br /> Of course, the whole thing is that Morris's character solves the case quite easily. Even if the movie comes in just about an hour, it will become almost all the decorations to look with all the nonsense. There is only one humorous moment to repeat; While on an airplane, the detective has such a change: Dugan - "Hey Clancy, how often do these things fall?" Clancy - "Once!" <br /> <br /> Except for McHugh and Jenkins, I can't say I've seen some other age player, even though I'm a fan of most B-class mystery films. 'The 30s are through the 50s. Fortunately, a couple appreciates much better than Humphrey Bogart's horse in 1938 - "Swing Your Lady", where laughter is deliberate. The best I offer about "Tomorrow at Seven" is a quote from Martha Winters on the side of this turkey - "It's just a waste of time".
