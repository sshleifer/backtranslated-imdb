I believe that Cockpuncher is the best work that has come out of the Steven Seagal factory for a long time. This movie was the first I've seen after this exquisite movie preview. My point? He's done it. Each film is the same. Maybe she's good at Machetes because she's not a star. We can only hope. <br /> <br /> P.S. Thank you for talking to UCSB when I went to college. It was an amazing call. You really influenced some people there. <br /> <br /> So I have to write ten lines about this movie? Umm .... I like a smoker boy who killed a lot of fools. When someone smells menthol LOOK OUT. Because it can be a murder that has a silent wedge (and another loud) who wants to kill you. <br /> <br /> Is it ten?
