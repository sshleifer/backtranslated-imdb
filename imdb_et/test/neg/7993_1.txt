I stumbled upon the movie late in the evening on television. My brother and I couldn't laugh at how God was terrible for this movie. Twilight sound effects when the White Ninja or Black Ninja gun, kick or use a gun are fun. This movie is almost at the same level as the Evil Dead series, but you can watch this movie with only one shift. I'm not sure if the director wanted it to be so dirty because he knew that idiots like me would buy it.
