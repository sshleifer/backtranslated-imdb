Starting with tearful poetry and pictures of American missiles, starving children and injured Palestinians, I quickly realized that this was not an objective documentary. 5 young people convicted after the GÃ¶teborg riots are interviewed and we are very confused about the reasons why they had to pay the city center trash and then (my god) for what they did. I looked up and raised many questions about whether the trial was properly done and whether the police had the right to do what they did? Many questions ... and then fell. No interviews with judges or going through the documents trial .. nothing. <br /> <br /> In short, something new that every Swede has seen on TV a hundred times - just bad propaganda.
