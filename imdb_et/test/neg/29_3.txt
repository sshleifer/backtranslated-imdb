Like 'Singin in the Rain', 'Cover Girl' has two boys and a girl. In "Cover Girl" Phil Silvers (Genius) is a comic relief. He answers Donald O'Connor's funny part, Singin in the Rain. Cover Girl has Gene Kelly's love for Rita Hayworth and Rain, it's Debbie Reynolds. This is where the comparison ends. <br /> <br /> "Singin in the Rain" is a classic American film musical, "Cover Girl" is a mediocre incarnation that is not very complicated Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) is the dancer of Danny MacGuire renting a nightclub in Brooklyn, Rusty decides to enter Cover Girl, sponsored by a wealthy publisher, John Coudair, who made Rusty's grandmother a year ago a failed game. Coudair introduces Rusty's Noel Wheaton to Broadway's producer Danny feels easy when Rusty starts a late night at the nightclub and decides to close the club with entertainment at Genius. On the altar with Noel, he understands the path of his paths and goes back to Danny, who lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly is the least developed in the movie. is that he has a nightclub and has mad madness with Rusty. Coudair and Wheaton act as dirty teens for Rusty and Phil Silvers, who offer a nice rhinitis, but ununny shticki. The most interesting aspect of Rita Hayworth is the scene she drunk. This requires what happened to him. Anyone who has read his biography learns that he did not like Hollywood, kneeled a normal life he could never achieve, but eventually started drinking and ended his life with complete Alzheimer's disease in recent years. Almost all Cover Girl songs are old-fashioned and not very good. Gene Kelly has just one really great dance number and it is a scene where she dances her "alter ego". Previously, the trio has another number that is the predecessor of "Make em Laugh" "Singin" (Rain). <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing about Cover Girl is five How Rita Hayworth puts on the pedestal A couple of decades later, Raquel Welch had the same problem, and both actors who, later in their career, always try to find scripts that show their ability to act. They wanted to be known as "actors" and not "pinup girls" Unfortunately, Cover Girl is an example of how Hollywood used women to get financial benefits.
