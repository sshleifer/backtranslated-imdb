This film is about production line planning. The filmmakers seem to have watched the latest hits and threw the spaghetti on the screen - Jimmy Stewart! June Allyson! Anthony Mann! Baseball! War! Baby! Fly! - ROLL 'EM! - The film discusses the age of Stewart / Allyson performers; I am sure, however, that we still have to think that they are much younger. <br /> <br /> Strategic Air Command has messages. Element: Happy married couple is challenged when Mr Stewart's character makes a significant decision without consulting his wife. In the most dramatic scene of the film, he calls him. It ends completely unresolved - Allyson shouts her heart in her bed and Stewart walks on her. NO discussion; she just says she is right and walks to her devastated woman. Whatever he knows, he can split his wrists. <br /> <br /> Later, Allyson apologizes for challenging her husband's decision. <br /> <br /> Unbelievable! Keep Stewart-Allyson "The Stratton Story" (1949). <br /> <br /> ** Strategic Air Command (3/25/55) Anthony Mann ~ James Stewart, June Allyson, Frank Lovejoy
