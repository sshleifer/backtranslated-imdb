[potential spoilers] <br /> <br /> The sixth "Halloween" movie is a totally depressing thing, but unfortunately it is not in the eyes of filmmakers. By now, everyone knows that it was polished and freed in such a sloppy, inconsistent form. There is little point in the second half, because the elements of the plot are put into use and seemingly fall randomly. Very ended me scratching my head. What the hell happened? Is Dr Loomis dead or what? That's what you get when you put a shameless cage on a movie. It is not quite a sight. <br /> <br /> In a related note, this is the most graphical violent record in the series. I have no problem with gore if it is in the right place, but this film leads to an absurd level. The infamous explosive head must be a new low for the series. Michael himself seemed to have enjoyed the murder of another person, contrary to his effective and methodical approach to John Carpenter's original. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure who was responsible; director Joe Chappelle or producers, probably a combination of both. I would be very happy to give all those involved a grace if they only release the legendary "Cut of Producers", a more complete version of the film, which is a huge improvement on every account. What I understand is a totally different film. I offer a full price to buy a DVD when Miramax gets into her mind and releases it. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good elements. The idea that the Druids drive Michael is interesting. Paul Rudd is sure as Tommy Doyle, whose look is a clean tie with the original. Slick's visual images make the procedure a little more observable. But these small bids overshadow the generation overload we have to offer. <br /> <br /> Finally, "Michael Myers Curse" is Donald Pleasance's last film. Many of his scenes were left out of the final cut, and when he appears, he seems weak and unhappy. The film is dedicated to his memory, blatant (as an unintentional insult), if ever. The fact that a talented performer should end his career is too frustrating to even think. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out ****) <br /> <br /> Free Dimension Films released
