A boring movie about an unlucky loser ... it's Factotum at a glance. Matt Dillon plays Henry Chinas, the author of Charles Bukowski changed his ego, whose novel is based on film. If we meet Chinas, he may be a writer, but he is certainly not successful. He floods through life, firing one animal after another and not taking care of it. The fact that he is always drunk can have something to do with his negligence. She meets a woman, Jan, played Lili Taylor and the relationship. Chinaski moves into Jan's apartment and can't crush himself, but he can drink with someone. Good times. Eventually, he had enough of that relationship, so Chinaski himself knocked out. Unfortunately, he still can't work fast enough because he's broken. At this point, Marisa Tomei and for some reason her character Laura decides to save her lucky drunk loser she doesn't even know. Soon we will meet some of Laura's acquaintances and a movie where this rather eclectic cluster is a kind of bizarre world. Soon Tome and friends are out of the picture, and again we are left with Chinaski and his drinking and his unhappy little life. There is still more time with Jan, but usually it only drives, loses his job. And then the film is over and not for a moment too fast. 94 minutes of absolute monotony, and it seems like the film is postponed indefinitely longer. Nothing will happen. Nothing happens. If you want to watch your life for an hour and a half, looking at Matt Dillon's drink, it's a movie for you. If you are looking for a good story, well-developed characters, or any entertaining value, you have come to the wrong place. Dillon's performance is not at all bad. Too bad that the film around him is actually pretty bad.
