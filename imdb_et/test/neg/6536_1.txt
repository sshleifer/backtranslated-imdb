So then ... does it go to SXSW Film Festival and Sundance as a pleasant art? Well, I think I can associate as long as the story, script, dialogue, functioning (except Mrs Aselton), cinematography and editing are completely irrelevant. <br /> <br /> I remember other filmmakers friends a few years ago that the biggest problem with digital video was that we now have to come through the future sea of ​​nonsense to get something worth seeing, that everyone and his brother (or Duplas brothers) you could run out and make a movie. "Puffy tool". I needed to say more? <br /> <br /> This feature-length video is another chapter of the "dudeology" movie in a depressing and growing world; young weapons that are armed with DVX100A, a few thousand dollars, a quick-written, shallow script, and some friends who invite actors who decide to film and voila in the afternoon! Don't do me wrong - I'm all about the cinema (ie Hollywierd sucks). But by saying this, you cannot claim the reality of this system. <br /> <br /> If Duplass Brothers had to come out and bring up a real budget and bring real manufacturers, it wouldn't be a clear script like it was ever green! And there's a problem. There is no longer a process of checking the readiness to produce films (sorry ... videos). Just grab the DV / P2 camera and you go out! And even worse, the above-mentioned high-level festivals have and encourage such meaninglessness. And why? Just because it's not a budget. I think this is important, especially in the climate of today's indie films, in order to get rid of the high-level labeling of video-makers, "filmmakers". My book is quite different. If you have to go out and put your script on the line, asking your friends and family or a business man to make money with the "movie" feature, knowing the potential damage, then you know what it means to be a "filmmaker." But for a few centuries, dropping a few DV tapes at Sam's Club doesn't let any soda and chips do it. <br /> <br /> Oh ... and by the way ... I have to mention how totally annoying it was to listen to a woman covered by the whole movie "Dude". Even Mark Borchardt will only leave his male friends intensely superseded when it is at least a love where his friend Mike is concerned! <br /> <br /> I think the beginning of the indie movie community began to disgrace them, non-budget videos of what they are, and at the same time screaming prestigious festivals that give such a random effort. Do it or ask these festivals at least politely to add a new category to your category ... "Dude Films".
