From the extraordinary special effects I was completely hit by how bad someone can make a movie. That's how I say I have no management experience, and for the first time watching the movie, I thought, â€œI can do it better! at the same time he was sitting on the board looking at it. Acting in this movie was terrible, I think the best actor was the Lawnmower Man, but the French man from Aliens3 was so clean that I was thinking of how he got a former job. The story was mediocre and I think, like most movies, if the rest were well done, it would have risen. I usually don't write comments here, but after seeing a couple of people, this movie gave a good rating (must be cast / team) I felt I had to say my piece to save someone from accidentally recruiting or wasting money to buy a cack.
