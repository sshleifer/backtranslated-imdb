I like to think that I appreciate a movie that's a bit of a habit, and I love a good movie that makes me think. <br /> <br /> If you like ordinary movies that make you think, look elsewhere. This movie is so bad and so unequal that the only thing you mean after its end is how you can waste 90 minutes watching your life. <br /> <br /> The driver who needs this movie can buy from the viewer. Why are we interested in the main characters? What motivates these characters through their existence? Why do they make their decisions? This film makes a very weak attempt to do this and fails in the process. There are no chemistry between the two who are both excellent at being in any role. So why did they fail here? I am sure they did not know what their motivations were, and if the actor does not know, their audience cannot be monitored. <br /> <br /> All in all, I have seen macromedia Flash videos that were offered with more thought, at least I have more interest in a morphed hamster who loves six than why this married family "Code 46" would risk being violated.
