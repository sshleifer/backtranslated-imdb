This flick, "Life in the Fast Lane," is just one of the least fun movies I've ever seen. I think it was the sick, twisted and imprisoned L.A women who represented about 00000001 countries. The characters are all one-dimensional, even lead. After she pins her finger with her finger on her fingers, she tries (and fails) to laugh cheap when pasting the boy's skull to stop bleeding. Oh, smart! Patrick Dempsey (whose films are almost always a class action - sarcasm) plays the "devil" who changes his life - but what we've seen was his vignette at the beginning of his life. No emotions, no laughs, no story. The only reason I give it is that Jeffrey Jones is ok when a priest, and the camera industry has a bit of style (albie zero). Otherwise, one of the five worst films I've seen. Grade 2 out of 10 AN F! I think even the most stunning junkie who laughs under the toilet doesn't like this movie. I can't stress enough how much you should stay away from. <br /> <br />
