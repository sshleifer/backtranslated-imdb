I was relatively lost throughout this movie and I'm the one who usually understands the work of mysterious cinema events like David Lynch (Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me) and Darren Aronofsky (Pi). Not to say that Northfork has no sense in some sense, it simply does not combine to form a completely coherent film. After watching the movie, its themes and intentions become clearer, but during my initial viewing I was really confused and I find this to be the main guilt of the film - its absence. The center of the plot is the city of Montfort in 1955, Montana. The city has been emptied and soon flooded to create a hydroelectric dam. The main problem is that not all of its residents want to evacuate and relocate. A group of men have been hired to force the rest of the population out of town before it drowns, and most often they manage to succeed in some rather strange situations and in the middle of the city people. At the same time, the film is about Irwin, a very young young boy (or a fallen angel?), Whose adopted parents gave him back to Northfork's orphanage because of his illness, which they accepted. Father Harlan (Nick Nolte) takes care of the dying Irwin, but Irwin represents (or does it?) That a group of angels (including Daryl Hannah and Anthony Edwards) have reached a destructive and empty city looking for a fallen angel. Irwin has scars behind and in his head, and he tries to convince the angels that his scars are where people fired their wings and halo. Oh yes, and throughout it there is a strange surreal stroller running across the landscape. There are many other small events in the film, but none of them reach far beyond the instant intrigue. The artistic quality of the film can be understood (it is obvious that filmmakers take care of this film) and its rich cinematography, but the film still tries to be too hard to be different and then give up and finish without making much statements. As I wrote earlier, it becomes clearer after viewing what is possible in the film. Irwin is dying and so is Northfork and, in dealing with his losses and death, Irwin is likely to have created signs that come from the ideas that surround him in the orphanage to abandon him and prevent his life from ending. But then again, maybe he is actually an angel and he has found his character and can now return home. I must emphasize that the movie has really beautiful moments, heartbreaking, vivid and lonely and sad. Unfortunately, the movie is completely open and is somehow incomplete.
