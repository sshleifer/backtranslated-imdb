It's the worst movie I've ever seen. I hope that the REAL family and other depicted characters are lawyers of VH1 because there is a depiction there. Action is terrible, writing is worse, and character depiction is scary. He was supposed to be a drama, but it was a comedy for me, you have no choice but to laugh at acting. I like Flex Alexanders, but this time he has completely lost his character. <br /> <br /> It can be said that he took this role to a couple of laughs because it was so terrible. If you really want a dramatic movie for the night, DO NOT CHOOSE THIS ONE. But if you laugh after some bad and foolish writings, tune in. Otherwise, don't waste your time.
