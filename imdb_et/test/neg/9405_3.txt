Just stopped viewing 2FTM. Trailers interested me so much that I actually went to the weekend, which I never did. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. The story is so potential and it is frustrating to see that it has been turned. I really feel the film's problem was leadership and Matthew McConaughey. First of all, I am not a World Champion, I thought he was fantastic for both fire and Lone Star. I enjoyed his movies in these films without having to see him with his shirt 3-4 times. Yes, we all get it to be a good looking nice body, but I think most people knew it 10 years ago when it came to Time to Kill Time. Showing her with her shirt, the iron is pumped like a sweaty madman 3-4 times in the movie, is totally unnecessary. I think once it would have been enough. It would not be surprising if they threw those unnecessary scenes into both girlfriends and females so that they would want to tag their other important one, no woman wants to see a movie about sports gambling unless ... let's go to her role. I feel his act was very forced and he didn't seem very comfortable. I know his character was supposed to be this charming south, but his lines were horns and roots. It was almost like he referred days and confused lines a few times! In short, I didn't like his character, although I had to do it. Emphasis, his shirt is out of the way, wrinkles are folding, weak selling points. His character was just too big a tool like Brandon or Jonathan. Pacino and Assante were great, but it's not surprising. Piven is fun to look like Arie .... oooops I mean Jerry. I just feel this movie was very commercial and badly put together. It is offensive that they could take a great story and throw in the ingredients of the mess to try and make this box office a success. 1. A cool story that invites a male man to 2. Hunky Hollywood actress female women (make sure she has lots of scenes with a shirt lift) 3. Al Pacino's 4 great speech scenes and 25 big lining 3. Every character must be dressed in thousands of dollars and have a very dark tan 4. Jeremy Piven plays the same character he did in Entourage and Old School. 4. Throw Armand Assante to seal the deal 5. Plot, good writing, character development and intelligent casting are unnecessary <br /> <br /> This is good enough for most people, but not me! Anyone who disagrees with me ask for it. Would this film be much better if: A. Director Sodeberg B. DeCaprio or Ed Norton than Brandon World Cup <br /> <br /> I think I'm part of this minor sucking this movie. I realized when a woman next to me began to cry during the ridiculous Pacino scene when she swung against Russo. The financial success of this movie is one thing. The film goes public, what the film wants the public, a big budget.
