Remember when Rick Mercer was funny? 22 minutes was a great show when Rick Mercer was on it and Made In Canada was also a big show. Talking with the Americans was so funny too. But as my friend said, "Rick Mercer woke up one day and was no longer funny" I think that day was when Rick Mercer's report flew. What is the purpose of this exhibition? Rick Mercer reads terrible fake headlines, shows pictures of bad households that people post, and then spends about 20 minutes on a 30-minute show where somewhere and just talking to people who want to say something wisely or wisely to get on the TV and even make someone laughs. We should be interested in Rick Mercer visiting the gym and then trying to do some of his moves and then suck it with a goal, desperately trying to be "funny". Rick Mercer got old or just lost interest or is no longer funny. Even his classic bead bits have lost their bite and humor. You can say that the CBC comedy in general, because for several years they have been on TV with Air Farce to offer the same useless jokes?
