I had a great hope for this movie that I even gave up this movie from watching Stargate. I found that it had a quick feeling and lost many of the main biblical moments and facts. I can be a little imprisoned and spoiled for the 1956 version because I've been following it every 20 years. I doubt it will do the field of the annual classics, as the other has. If you haven't seen the 19546 version, you might like it, but I doubt it seriously and invite you to skip it and rent it or buy a classic one. It has some special special effects, but that's not what I'm looking for when I say a movie like ten commands. I was looking for how they told the story, and the writers didn't do a good job for it.
