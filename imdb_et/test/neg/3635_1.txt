This TV show is stereotypical in many respects and far removed. <br /> <br /> First, the device. All characters in the PCA, this incredible inner school painted with stylish dorms. The university has no reasonable rules - for example, boys are often seen in girls' dormitories and vice versa. But it may just be because dormitories, a silly character that basically entertains the viewer, rather than amusing them, as I assume that his goal should be, sit and do nothing. I have friends in internships and they laugh in many aspects of this exhibition school. <br /> <br /> Next marks. I was so disappointed that I discovered that Nickelodeon was not at all creative with the exhibitors. They all represent a character that is exaggerated to the extreme: Zoey is said to be perfect in everything he does (appearance, classes, sports, boys, judgment, creativity, etc.), Michael is a jock, Logan is a lofty jerk who basically does nothing to do everything Symbols for both bad and poor viewers, Nicole is a preppy idiot who knows nothing but somehow claims that As is honest, Dana was a hard girl, Quinn is an unrealistic smart child whom they constantly joke, Chase is the man who is afraid admit your "true feelings" that really deepen me when the show continues, and that the new girl - Lola or something - is just one of Nicole's clones. <br /> <br /> The two main symbols that make me hardest are Zoey and Quinn. First, I just don't understand Zoey's character. He was probably created to be a "perfect" character as I said above, but he seems to be the most inadequate of all of them - in most of the episodes he produces, it needs to fix it. What is depressing is that we should love her and I think she is amazing if she hasn't even created a very realistic character. <br /> <br /> Quinn, on the other hand, bothering me because he is too exaggerated to the point where his character is completely offensive. Nick's impression of his character is that "geeks" and "nerds" are people who laugh, criticize and mock. In a spring break episode a year ago, they introduced two more jokes that the characters had to "cool". I found it very offensive and stereotypical. What message does Nick send to these children? Is it: don't do well at school, don't get good grades, don't learn hard - you'll reach the geek and mock your profession in future TV series! Because this is definitely the message I get from these badly constructed characters, and it's a terrible message through and through. <br /> <br /> Everything I can do is to hope that Nick one day understands that intelligent people are putting us down in the world they are not doing good.
