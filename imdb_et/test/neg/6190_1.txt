Algeria is not a classic, it is a generation of wonderful original Pepe le Moko, led by Duvivier, who plays much more attractive and charming Pepe, Jean Gabin. If you want to fully experience Casbah and Algier characters, I suggest you not even watch this movie and see Pepe le Moko, because it is much more complicated, more beautifully filmed, the lines are not much more clich√©s and characters than reality. In addition, the ending is so dramatic and the key to Pepe's character is that the Algier version is unbearable. Although Algeria is doing an excellent job of imitating each scene, it works just like the credibility of the characters. In addition, the wardrobe is truly breathtaking in all scenes, especially on Pepe's last scene and Gaby (always), but also when she is on the boat. Frankly, Algiers are cheap when imitations go.
