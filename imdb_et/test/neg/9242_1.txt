I watched this movie and all I can say is ... I am not a student of the film or an artistic intellect who tries to look for a deeper meaning in anything I don't understand. But if I had to do it with this movie, my thoughts would be ... <br /> <br /> Yes! He's on drugs and I can take a picture of it now ... he bounced one night and sat with his friends laughing and saying things like, hey ... wouldn't it be funny if the nuns really fly? Like when one fell off the plane and freed for a while, bounced on the ground and got up and walked away? * cackles * or when the bucket gave the pope a bath? Oh, my God, I'm gonna end up with that! Dude! We have to make a movie about it! And then he tells his friend when he laughs ... Oh, and wouldn't it be fun if people loved it and called him a genius? So it happens to me when a man does too many medications and writes a script and produces a movie. Could I have done an LSD to understand what this man was thinking, so I could have laughed too? Because I have to tell you I'm not laughing. I woke up and checked the time. <br /> <br /> I think everyone who tries to find their hardest meaning is hysterical. I had never heard of this director until I read the comments I did because I was crazy that I lost it in the last 2 hours or how long it was, (it seemed like 12 hours of my life) and I can never get it back ... I have read that this guy is a heroine addict and he wanted to die for art? what the hell is that? So my point is sort of proven. This man is not all there, he is a drug addict, and his film is such proof ... So please give up on finding a deeper meaning. If anyone really wants to understand everything in this movie, then go to some LSD and sit back and relax, so it can really make sense. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of the time I looked at Gus Van San's last days, another movie I watched. I can't help but know what the reviews of this movie are when the same people looked through who looked at it. It seems as if the film's director is completely off his rocket, or if it's a French movie with sex and subtitles, or if it's a comic, it's going to be great comments, hands down, something else is boring and already boring. done. BLAH, bring boring please!
