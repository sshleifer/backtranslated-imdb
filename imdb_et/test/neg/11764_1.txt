If you are looking exactly for Che Guevara, the Cuban Revolutionary who helped Fidel Castro to gain power, read more about Cuban history or even write your name into the search engine after the internet). <br /> <br /> But whatever you do, DO NOT SEE "CHE!". <br /> <br /> If you don't just want to laugh, of course. <br /> <br /> All time (and moving) reviews gave "Che!" their vote for the worst film of the decade. And no wonder; have you seen this travesty? Its facts are, at best, weak, Sharif is even convincing about the body, and like Palance's Fidel Catsro imitation ... <br /> <br /> As I said, if you want to laugh. <br /> <br /> It's like looking at co-production between the channel and Mad Magazine. <br /> <br /> One Star. Wonder do not know if Palance can do W. C. Fields?
