This movie was terrible, not just a plot of weakness, but acting was incredible and sometimes pathetic. The very unrealistic dialogues that people don't talk about in real life know nothing and do not know what to say very monotonous, except for the almost indistinguishable whispering that is constantly happening. Even editing is bad, cuts are terrible. The work of the camera was sloppy and shaky on the side, even during conversations back and forth. There's nothing positive about this movie and George Katts has to work on heavy machines or something he doesn't need to talk to other people because he doesn't know clearly. How this film won / won the nominees for my prize, my god !!
