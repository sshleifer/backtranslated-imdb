I had a different experience with this movie - it never seemed to me charming or pleasant or funny. One big clue that this wasn't your typical movie was that the label did not signal the language spoken in the movie. the second was the lack of subtitle selection. <br /> <br /> I found a tedious lack of dialogue, especially when accompanied by exaggerated facial expressions, as it almost always was. The weak plot's wildly inconsistent development was puzzling. Were there any signs or only vague gestures? was there even a plot? <br /> <br /> On a separate issue, I've asked to correct the "dialog" spell and the suggested "dialog" replacement. maybe this movie is a whole, including the IMDb part, intended for puzzle or amazement, but I get more irises than amused.
