Seriously, I don't understand how Justin Long is becoming more and more popular. He has the best agent in Hollywood or sold his soul to Satan. He is almost unbearable to watch the screen, has little charisma and no terrible comedy timing. The only movie he's been trying to anchor, which I enjoyed remotely, was Waiting ... and it's almost just because I've been working in a restaurant. But I ground. In addition to being terrible, this film has other debits. I understand that this should be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that does not mean that it must completely offend our intelligence and write so incredibly that it restricts the offensive. Lewis Black's remarkable talent disappears here, because he is his offense if he is unlimited, which the PG-13 rating certainly does not allow. The only glittering spot in the movie was Jonah Hill (who is almost unknown to recent Superbad fans because he lost weight in the meantime). His liner was sometimes funny, but it was certainly not enough to get anywhere. If you want to turn off your brain completely (or better yet), you may want to enjoy it, but I can't recommend it at all.
