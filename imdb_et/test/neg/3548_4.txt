I usually don't try another crime, but Cleaner was just completely predictable. Samuel L. Jackson, who played Tom Cutler, created an interesting twist at the beginning of the movie, but that was it. Without even thinking, I knew where the plot would be taken and after 30 minutes I had already understood who was the killer. Instead of trusting myself and seeing a number of movies that make the turnabout, I watched it finish. With disappointment, I was right from the start. <br /> <br /> Casting characters was good, as was Jackson and Harris's actor ... except for Eva Mendes. From the initial goal, he didn't correlate with the script with a reliable character and it destroyed the whole plot too quickly. Maybe it was the story itself or the story itself. His role as Ann Norcut should have been more emotional and stressful about the situation around him. This would have made the construction a bit more convincing and more dramatic. However, Cleaner is traceable, not memorable. I've seen CSI episodes that were more exciting about it.
