STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Old Detroit is back, the giant Omni Consumer Corporation continues to swallow it all The road to building a new Delta city, and a new threat to fight the confusion between Cain, the brutal addiction and the resemblance of Christ, pushing a deadly new addiction to the streets called nuke. As he continues with the memories of his former life worshiping him, the hero of the tin hero puts this frog only to cut the remains of the forest. During Robocop's action, the ruthless OCP businessman offers plans for his new android - stomping, despicable beast, who needs the power of an equally disgusting pilot that Cain fits perfectly. After a short glitch in his system, Robo returns to bring justice to the streets and solve the score with Cain. <br /> <br /> Original Robocop is a movie that can always look at you every time, not how many times you have seen it, one of those movies that you just can't do again. That is, it is not surprising that the sequel has been made - it is even less surprising that this sequel is really compared to the original. Irvin Kirschner, the director of Empire Strikes Back, has designed an unpleasant, slightly inconsistent and protracted film that doesn't take the magic of the first movie, no matter how difficult it is. And it certainly makes the first movie's funny ads not working, the company's satire, designed to be a bit sharper and more brisk than fast and furious as before, but with blood / gore even when the first film. The first film was named after some nasty, blood-moistened violence (including male genitalia being blown away and the man burst into pieces), but even though it was more memorable, the violence / gore shown here is more sadistic and free. a nature that has a very unpleasant and medium tone tone. <br /> <br /> But in general, the film leaves you feeling a general apathy - why are you watching it if you could look at the original again? **
