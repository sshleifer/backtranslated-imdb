I tried to watch this movie, but I didn't do it in the first 15 minutes. This is a frightening disappointment given the lie, but I cannot see that the dialogue is in English and some actors claiming to be Indian are not even close (read: Kristin Kreuk). Given that India alone has one-sixth of the world's population and one of the largest film industries, I don't think filmmakers would have found it hard to find an excellent Indian actor. And I am not saying this because of the dark patriotism, but because it is absolutely and completely absurd when a non-Indian plays the role of India / Pakistan. Now some people say "as long as he persuades who cares?" but my thing is exactly that he is not convincing and can never be - not because of his acting skills but because of his ethnic origin. For example, although a good actor Tom Hanks may be, he can never play an Australian Aboriginal! <br /> <br /> But this is still a little when the filmmakers have done: a dialogue in English. It completely destroys any similarity between mood and authenticity. If the same film had been made in English with subtitles (Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi), it could be a great movie. Unfortunately, at this moment, I would not like to recommend anyone who would see it, except film students who want to learn "What not to do" in the film.
