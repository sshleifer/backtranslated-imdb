I know that such films sell tickets and make a profit for filmmakers, but it just doesn't make Vietnam. Vietnam was filled with terrible men who lived it out every day. <br /> <br /> This movie star Gene Hackman, a Korean military veterinarian whose task is to train a group tag member to return Vietnamese animals to this country to rescue American refugee groups in the camp there. These men are a former tunnel rat, a crazy fallen seaman, a blonde tanned surffer in California, and an inexperienced child (Patrick Swayze) who just happened to be a father who was killed in Namis. They train for the first time in a Texas camp and once in Namis they get to know and lose all their weapons. They are able to find replacement tools and continue their way to release imprisoned men. Most men are found and saved, but the rag-tag group is mostly wiped out. <br /> <br /> This movie played like a video game where you can understand what will happen next and who will pop out, what the bush and who died and who intended to live. Vietnam I think it wasn't like a video game.
