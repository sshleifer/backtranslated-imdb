When I looked at the review of this movie after I watched it, I was surprised that there were people who gave it a good rating. All "scary" happens next to the screen, usually accompanied by someone who screams "Did you see / hear it?" No, we didn't see it! We can not! And if there were no close-ups, the camera did something strange, as it turned upside down, or shaking back and forth really, really fast, whether to carry it on or to make us physically ill. <br /> <br /> The characters were unlikely because every two minutes they started shouting again and again. I don't care if it was "really" like I did, I didn't rent a scary movie to see reasonable things! I look forward to unreasonable things like aliens, demons or good actors! They were also fools - let's get closer to intimate relationships in the caves! All our clothes! Speaking that the end is somewhat contradictory to what Domingo said immediately before his death. It's a bit of a mistake for me, though not nearly as much as the end ended with a serious intrusion of one's privacy. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, no climax, no good action, no terrible camera - work. What's next? Oh right. The end may be "twisted", but in general, horror movies are the end that the ultimate distortion is actually understandable to what has happened during the film. Sixth Understanding - Explains Many. Also hid and searched. But the cave had a flat twist that acted as an "explanation" if you could name it as it is not. Explain. Something. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it. Please.
