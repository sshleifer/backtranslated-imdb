"Rocketship XM" is a science-based class thanks to more release (1950), its ability to benefit from the "destination month" disclosure and the presence of actors who later celebrate Mike Nelson, Rockford's father and Wyatt Earp. <br /> <br /> The film itself is bad enough to be a good feed for MST3K and is best viewed with comments from Joel and robots. This is the type of film that is best suited for adding reefs from MST3K characters; something preaching, slow pace, poorly written and painfully bad behavior. Although unintentionally funny things like "Plan 9 From Space Space" are not suited to satirical commentary (because the film has consistently built up hosts), very bad and dull films like "Rocketship X-M" are ideal. So add some letters to the rating when you look at the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> The main story is that the team takes a better turn to the moon and reaches Mars. What they find on this planet is a remnant of human-like civilization that has ravaged the atomic war. There is only one Martian in the vicinity, a normal-looking woman who is blind or has no eyes. Men look like "ghosts" in the old cartoons of Popeye, they despise the rocks and throw the boulder at the team with amazing accuracy - especially if they are blind. Of course, it is not explained that this would require some signs of logical analysis from the writers of the scenario. rest of B&W film. If you think the "Wizard of Oz" is frustrated because it is just a black and white stuff that is a little brown with the print added after production. <br /> <br /> In line with the movie about moral sexism, the icy female scientist screws her fuel calculations - both come and go. His inability to measure men causes the feminine side and he and Mike Nelson coo against each other when they face their destruction (enter the gagging sound here). <br /> <br /> Actual Stars Movie is a handheld reporter. So much so that MST3K was inspired specifically to greet these unhappy heroes. In the first 10 minutes of the film, a frightening team of "newsies" has emerged, then taken at stations around 12 inches behind technicians and tracking devices. Later, they are asked to ask the Head of Mission the necessary questions to explain the film's too obvious message. trailer. Although you are grateful that it is only 77 minutes, it is still about 60 minutes too long, as every 30-minute episode "The Twilight Zone" contains many times more content than this entire movie. <br /> <br /> Then what do I know? I'm just a child.
