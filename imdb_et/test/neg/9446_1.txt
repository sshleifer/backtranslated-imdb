I never comment on a movie, but I have to say that it was one of the worst films I've ever seen. I think this was done by a novice film student and not by talented film students, but it was terrible! I didn't buy a leader actor, and I felt like I was in a movie class with him. His decisions were very safe and I feel he imitates other actors in films and did not act or make his own decisions. The direction was very confusing and the sound was louder than the actors themselves. The end may be a little more meaningful if someone tells the events and not the song. I love Patsy Cline, but her songs often appear in movies. Maybe the choice of songs could have been a bit more original. The song "Crazy" was such a clich√©. As I said before I never commented on the film and didn't see my share of good and bad, but it was the worst. Sorry.
