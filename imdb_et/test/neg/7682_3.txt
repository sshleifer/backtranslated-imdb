Sorry people, I love Ray Bolger's work, but one thing he's not is a leading man. Perhaps, if you pretend to be the last man on earth, this romantic plot can work, but come now! <br /> <br /> Here's a movie that just exists to play a title song that was a big hit for Basie Band a year earlier (1951). And some pretty nice songs and dances will save it as a complete disaster. <br /> <br /> But the story is pathetic even with the 1952 music comedy standards. And other songs are equally forgotten as the evening in Paris. Dialogue tortures stars, Day & Bolger. Only Claude Dauphini's Boyeresque charms keep his character three-dimensional. <br /> <br /> So how do you enjoy this video? <br /> <br /> A.) Advancing all dialogues ... <br /> <br /> B.) Give yourself to Doris Day's vocal and Ray Bolger's loose feet. Don't miss Dauphin's fun rain that is rainy, windy "April In Paris" ... <br /> <br /> C.) Finally, keep a few bottles of Cabernet cool and handy. br /> <br /> Bob Raymond
