Sayles had a very interesting movie with Silver City, but it was somehow inconvenient to the beginning. Chris Cooper did an extraordinary job that was the essence of his character - sorba Dubya, but he wasn't given enough time on the screen. Instead, we find ourselves out of rampage, the nature of which is less personal, less developed, and generally too confusing. The way that Danny Huston guides us will inevitably become a movie. Too many characters are introduced to us in such a short time. These characters were randomly associated with the plot progress, which became too overtaking for a minute. Sayles knew what he had created, I just feel it wouldn't be translated into a silver screen. <br /> <br /> Sayles is the master of his trade. His films inspire and create thoughts even when they are not commercial. The trouble with Silver City is that I think he thought he was going too deep without enough money or time to explain it all. At the beginning of the film I had an idea of ​​what would happen, but as more and more signs were introduced, as more and more plots of land tried to emerge, I lost the end after the film. Although the end was very clever and very dark, I needed more clarification. I think some reason I lost my mind with this film was due to Danny Huston's leadership as our guide. He was pathetic. I didn't feel him to be a very exciting person who led us in this adventure. He seemed to be moving through the movements, but not at all. It was the first downfall of Sayles' important film. While I admit that Richard Dreyfuss, Miguel Ferrer, James Gammon, and Daryl Hannah played interesting characters, I just needed a better guide to help me understand their role in this political scandal. Danny Huston just didn't cut it for me. Outside the characters, Sayles needed a stronger script. Sometimes I felt that when I wasn't deeply rooted in the political world, some references were well over my head. The whole reason for building Silver City and the corruption behind it was for me. I am a simple person who loves advanced movies, but it just didn't make much sense to me. Many times I saw I asked, "Why" instead of seeing the whole picture. I felt that the individual stories were as clear as the glass, but the whole picture was dusty and dark at the same time. Instead of these smaller questions, Sayles had to focus more on the bigger picture that was ultimately stuck in the movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe I went with the wrong idea for this movie. I had been waiting for another version of primary colors, but instead of seeing something less cordial and technical. Without giving up, I thought the last scene was one of the most beautiful moments of political cinema history. Stylish insignia has remained in my mind for the last two days after watching this movie, while the rest of the movie quickly blended with me. Maybe another look would be better for me, but for some strange reasons, Silver City didn't make me with me. There seems to be too many loopholes that have never been explained or taken into account. The ensemble's piece is always good for me, but if the characters are introduced without explanation, it simply loses steam. It was one of those rare cases. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was very disturbed by this movie. Being very democratic, I wanted to see a policy that I didn't know and the other side that would make you fool. I wanted to be involved in corporate money and the chosen world of dufus. I wanted the intelligent humor that was made by George W.'s words, but instead I found everything I found, a very confusing story that was directed at a certain audience I never participate in. Sad, this picture was so much a wasted promise. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** *****
