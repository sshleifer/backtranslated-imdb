Although inevitably linked to the 1970s, the term "exploitation-cinema" is actually almost as old as the cinema itself. What's more, Universal Studios invented this concept practically with its long running monsters Dracula, Frankenstein, Wolf Man and The Mummy. Every original classic class created at least a few sequences, and after a while they even thought of the idea of ​​making a real monster color! The "House of Frankenstein" released earlier a year, which was also staged by Erle C. Kenton, was quite successful with interesting ideas and enthusiastic productions, but "House of Dracula" is too desirable for me. The plot has too many irritating "casual" situations, forced turns and dialogues, and ?? before anything else ?? too short working hours to develop monster personalities as they deserve. Onslow Stevens does not get a top-notch bill, but plays the most important miracle as a doctor who has challenged Count Dracula (Carradine) to treat his uncontrolled blood needs, and affirm Lawrence Talbot's disease by mutating the hairy Wolf Man when the moon is full. Walking in some caves at night, they also take the remains of the Frankenstein monster, and a good doctor himself undergoes Jekyll / Hyde metamorphosis due to poor blood supply. The last call for a dirty party is to hit a woman (though not from Notre Dame). Something is very wrong when you look at a movie that is literally filled with horror icons, but the only sign of a movie that can conceive you is an ordinary villager named Siegfried. The actual monsters are boring and their once fabulous background is completely emptied. Count Dracula is a fabulous romantic, Talbot is a gracious and also whimsical work of old martyr and Frankenstein. Well, its part of the plot is not even worth noting. In this universal film, there is a serious lack of atmospheric and funny photography, especially when compared to all other efforts, and a sharp climax is a disaster.
