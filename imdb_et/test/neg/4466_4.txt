After seeing the previews some time ago, I waited for Steve Martin in comedy, which I thought it might be a keeper. Unfortunately I was wrong. The problem was that the previews were the only funny parts of the movie. The rest of the movie was pretty much spam, scenes made to death, and the characters we've all seen thousands of times. You can talk to someone on the table. Steve Martin is my favorite, but it was a great clunker. The only actor in the movie who was worth watching was Eugene Levy; he was the best mighty flat group.
