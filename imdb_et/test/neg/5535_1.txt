Gun is probably the worst film I've ever seen. The direction of the comedians is very bad, dialogues sound like they are written by a 13-year-old teenager, a plot (what plot?) Is another "break" where it is very difficult to get in touch. Finally, there is nothing good about this movie. Great thumb for all involved and especially for the Montreal Film Festival, who presented this film in COMPETITION!
