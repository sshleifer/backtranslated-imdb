This film has many activities and a small heart. We forget in a few minutes that it will almost all aspects of the Russian revolution wrong - after all, we only have a story here to tell our story. In fact, after the First World War, the Tsar died as a catastrophe for the state, and the interim government tried to rule as a pseudo-democracy until Leninists took power nine months later, mainly because they promised Russia to withdraw Russia immediately. Now, back to our story. <br /> <br /> Here we have a revolution that "drives" Russian newspapers, which still seem to be a functioning state, until the violence suddenly breaks out and violates the life of the noble baron Nikita 'Nikki. "Krasnoff (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.). He escapes from his home with his former servant Tanyusha (Nancy Carroll) and they are starting to make a new life in Constantinople. Before the revolution, Baron regularly played for girls, not any real passion, but boredom that was articulated. Revolution does not change this, and he continues to try to take advantage of what is probably a very simple girl, and this audience will not make a guy to play with him. ‚ÄùTanyusha follows the baron because he literally is not the place after revolutions Baron's home, and he knows no life other than waiting for Nikki's hand and leg. Once in Constantinople, Nikki quickly heard life as a failed manpower, and he met his former lover, Russian aristocrat Vera Zimin, who is planning to get them to Paris where the tsars are Unfortunately, for Tanyusha, Vera has no plan for her. <br /> <br /> This movie can completely destroy remarkable ability of acting actress Nancy Carroll. He does a good job of the little he is given, but it is not much. Here is Lilyan Tashman, though she has only a small role as a Russian Vamp. Lilyan was often given a support role as she is here, but her reputation for voice and glamorous appearance puts her at the center of every scene she appears on. Guy Kibbee even appears in a humorous little bit of American tourist who is curious about Russian royalties, which have been drastically expelled from home.
