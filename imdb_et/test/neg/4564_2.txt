I usually love a genre of teen / high school, but this movie wasn't quite original. The only assumption is that this movie is four friends who cheat their way through high school and the strain they put on their friendship. The story or the characters are not just deep enough for the viewers to pay attention to the full length of the movie. Working is not so bad, although the participants do not really have much work, because the dialogue is due to the stairs and the clich√© ... ... After watching this movie, it is to be wondered how on earth the manufacturer can meet such a project and think, "I have this movie do. " No wonder he didn't get the theater release. Andrew Gurland is a cage, avoid or burn.
