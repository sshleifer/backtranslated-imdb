I wouldn't give too much of the movie to say that there are many, many, many, walking and watching Lucas (the young protagonist). Yep. And you are glad to know that the first third of the movie is meaningless, meaningless, and ignored for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is populated by the dullest people who are doing stupid things and their eternal person is young Lucas who goes blind and needs surgery. You see, he's frustrated, terrible scams! She thinks the killer is for the dark women! She walks a lot and acts like an inadequate jerk! <br /> <br /> Patience doesn't pay for this movie. After all, the plot and events are as confusing and sleepy as it is, and it is very difficult to take care of one way or another of what a nightmare picture meant. Nothing has been made clear, the film moves at a snail's pace and left me with the consequences of similar events. <br /> <br /> By judging "Fear of Darkness", the British do not make foolish thrillers like Americans; they do boring.
