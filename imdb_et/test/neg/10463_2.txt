Bad, bad and did I mention bad? In addition to the comic monster that terrorizes the workers, the more fun part of the film was when the inspectors were in the desert and one comment that they had one hour of daylight, but you can clearly see in your shadows and bright sky that it's probably only 2 or 2:30 in the afternoon. Talk about consistency. READ SCRIPT Director! <br /> <br /> The only cool part of this movie, of course, on the shelf at Clara Bryantis (as the other reviewer mentioned) is the skeleton horse that Bone Eater is driving. This thing was pretty cool because it drove the inspectors on their motorcycles.
