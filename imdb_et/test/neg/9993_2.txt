As I read the script on-line, I thought "Capote" needed trimming. Having just seen it in PPV, I can tell you that it's not trimmed, it was polished like this poor family! Example: Truman Shawni copies "Adorable One" in the script; here he is "Mr. Shawn". <br /> <br /> The amateurs of this movie are wrong enough to shoot Capote and bashs in their circle (do we really think they thought so little about Nelle, they mixed her up a little in Opus like an unpleasant joke?) , they turn Perry Smith into such a sensitive victim, even if he has shown the sending of Clutters. This is one thing to bring to the fudge, it's another to hit the ball: executions were done 12: 45-1: 19 AM, April 14; Truman is shown in prison 22 hours later! <br /> <br /> I was completely "bothered". Even Keener doesn't even try to speak Alabama as a native. How Cooper yelled "Alvin!", Waiting for Chimpmunks to appear! Hoffman does not give us a charming flower, but pathetic breastfeeding, which sees terrible action as a ticket for a long time. When Hoffman was angry that the endless complaints were "tortured", I wanted to give him a shotgun to make us both good and to make his brains!
