I thought it was an Ok movie after you see the ads on it. It was funny in some parts and some very disgusting. The only person I was sorry for is Horatio Sans, who got a hot woman cheating on her with other women. But he never had a chance to get the threesome together until it was good, but they should have increased the film more.
