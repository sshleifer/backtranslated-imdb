A typical story of an evil child who goes after people. I suspect that Antonio Fargas (Huggy Bear "Starsky and Hutch") and Vincent Schiavelli did not want to emphasize this junk of their revival (in fact, Schiavelli continued to do this for a good continuation mostly). Sometimes I want the killers of these films to go after the idiots who decide we need a new movie every two months (note: this comment should not be taken seriously; I think slashers have lost their touch)). <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is one movie you can best avoid. It's ninety minutes to two hours that I never get back.
