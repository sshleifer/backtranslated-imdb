Why oh, why they had to try and continue the biggest Christmas movies of all time. The film is the wreck of the train at every level and it should never have been done. Randy Quaid's imagination of the cousin Eddie is the upper caricature of his previous competitions, such as the cousin Eddie. The Eddie character is not interesting enough to wear the entire movie. Even the "eye candy" Sung Hi Lee could not celebrate this mound. Please do not waste your time in this movement, check the original again.
