Diane Lane is beautiful and sexy and Tuscany is proud, but this film is no better than mediocre and it is generous. The story is embroidered on the travel record and remains fully involved. <br /> <br /> Set (say) a suburb of Newark, the plot would be ridiculous. Everything that captures the movie is a Tuscan countryside and occasionally in Florence and Positano, and while the sun-sun-slow-western film has shown better what is definitely the most pleasing place in the world.
