Dr Stephens (Micheal Harvey) leads the spiritual refuge. He has a different approach to mad. He deals with unusual treatments. He treats everyone like the family, there are no locks on the doors of the patients, and he lets some inmates do their twisted fantasies. She lets Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin) dress up and act as a soldier, and Harriet (Camilla Carr) is the mother of her mother, including letting her put her in bed. Dr Stevens, with out-of-court judge Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Ross), is signing up with an ax, it turns out to be a bad move when Dr Stevens returns, the judge sits on an ax. Shortly after the sister Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives at the sanatorium, Dr. Stevens conducted an interview on possible work. She meets the head of the Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick as Anne McAdams) and is offered a trail. He feels and becomes very pleasant among patients. But things will finally become sour, phone lines cut, old lady named Mrs. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams) has cut out her tongue and she starts a strange feeling that things just don't fit in any way. Then, one night, all sanitary dark secrets will be revealed. Produced and directed by S.f. Brownrigg has an excellent central idea for the film, based on a cool twisting curve, but in the end it is a bit of a chore to sit through this low budget constraint and Tim Pope's relatively slow script. Prisoners are just too long for eternal dialogues, not much really happening up to the last twenty minutes. The film has no real visual quality as it is entirely set in the Sanitary and its causes, which is basically just a big boring house somewhere in the middle. There's no graphical gateway, some bleeds here and there and that's a lot. There's a bit of nudity, but like gore isn't much. The actor is pretty strong, especially Holotik and Weenick. Photography is flat and infallible, and I don't even remember what the music was. Addressing is great, but it just takes too long. A film that had a lot of potential that was probably hampered by its budget. OK, I guess, but I think it would have worked much better if the story had turned into a half hour "Tales Crypt" episode.
