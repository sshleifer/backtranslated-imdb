RAP, the film that this film was based on, was one of the hardest books I've ever read. But I couldn't put it down. Dirty, raw, unpleasant, bad ... you call it, he had it. It also had the best characterization of any novel I ever read. <br /> <br /> Well, like a flick ... it was unfortunate. I mean, Tim Mcintire as Wasco? Wasco was the worst mutha ... speaks of WASCO ... Mcintire as Wasco is like Tim Conway casting Charles Manson. <br /> <br /> What happened to MAIN? Little Number. He doesn't even exist in the movie ... Fast Walking is NOT the main guy in the book. Why even name this thing with RAP? None of the spirit, atmosphere, nastiness or drama of the book was captured in this film. <br /> <br /> For me this was not just a disappointment, but a loss of time and celluloid.
