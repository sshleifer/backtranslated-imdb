Awful! Awful! Awful! Drag, unthinkable, predictable - and all the usual suspects. That's the kind of movie that the Irish film industry shouldn't do. And a treacle-coated end with added value. Ill is an example of how talent and originality have passed in favor of almost aggressive mediocrity. Yes - the kids are sweet. Yes - it seems almost professionally done. But it is making movies by numbers, smashing and grabbing what the director probably thinks of "success" - a film that patronizes and despises the audience. It is quite astonishing that the title of the works will pour 3 million pounds of garbage into it. But then they actually paid for love. Don't waste your money.
