I went to watch this movie in my movie, a potentially interesting subject, a good lie, a director who had previously made a highly acclaimed "Once upon a Time Warriors" and my favorite LA-Noir-Ish films. Forty and fifty. I would say I am pleasant enough in this movie category; I appreciate the genre of the genre, but I sit and enjoy the semi-generations as well as the derivatives. But I found this movie completely unbearable. <br /> <br /> Despite the good situation in which to place the story, no one seems to do or say anything far from being interesting or entertaining with this two-year plus. . Good actors are wasted in endless dialogue scenes, ranging from banal and embarrassing. The narrative is relaxed and unbearable, and none of the events he portrayed are good enough to do anything other than the death of the audience. No drama, no atmosphere, no tension, no entertaining value, and finally I just didn't care what happened because I didn't believe anything in the movie. <br /> <br /> L.A. The confidential came out a year later and regardless of whether one story is more alive, the last film has served all departments for their excellence. By contrast, Mulholland Falls fails in all departments, the fact that the talent is more tragic. If they ever show it on an airplane, I'm still out.
