it was absolutely the most tragic cinema I have ever witnessed. Not only was the name a complete misconception - because the film has nothing to do with the pirans - but it works both hollow and old when trying to actually make a plot. When you watch this movie, you can't help but spend the second wake-up interview if you've had enough time and it's time to turn it off. unfortunately I waited until the end of my case. it's two hours of my life that I can never recover.
