"Dolemite" is a story about Dolemite (Gotta love blaxploitation film title), ex-con, who should probably be in prison. He is struggling with the police, friends, drug dealers, women, prostitutes and society in general. She just doesn't like the guy. It's not a movie, though, it's still fun and worth watching. <br /> <br /> The shameful premise is that Dolemite (playing as much enthusiasm as the star Rudy Ray Moore gets) is in jail for a crime he claims to have not done. When a drug attack or a drug bust or drug is going on, the caregiver relieves him or her of stopping or helping or just looking at it. Not very clear. I know I did not know that the judiciary freed the convicted to allow them to prove their innocence. I think my ignorance is pointless. <br /> <br /> The plot is complicated and irrelevant, basically Dolemite kills people (usually very poorly choreographed karate), having sex and being sad with people, sometimes even in rhymes. The joy of the film is its total incompetence and its indifference to this issue. <br /> <br /> I stopped to see how many times I saw the boom mike after he was in one scene for the entire duration (about two minutes of the movie). I ended up questioning why the caregiver looked at the Dolem sitting, even after he stood up and walked around when they cut back and Dolemite sat inexplicably again. I paused to think about why Dolem was dressed in the way he was naked on the street, because he didn't want to get ugly (read: normal) clothes in his car that the prison gave him. And I stopped thinking about where he studied karate when his hand tilted the boy on the stomach and somehow cut him open. The only time I'd ever been nervous and tense was how nasty, flabby the white mayor was walking around completely naked, but not just a towel hanging around his neck, just bothering him. You say, "Cut off ... cut off ... cut off" but by the time they do, you are already emotionally in love. <br /> <br /> The film is ridiculous in every sense imaginable. Moore, as Dolemite, is either funny, cool or both. When you watch a bad movie, you've found it in "Dolemite".
