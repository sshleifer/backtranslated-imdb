This film has all the components of a great horror story and it loses its last half. Few movies give me chilli. It did. Few horror movies give me a sense of fear. It did. It kept me out. I care about the story. I care about the characters. Operation was decent. Unfortunately, the story is not about half way that the story just fails. It is obvious that all the cooling of the plot goes to self-destruction. It does. What builds on a strong horror concept in the first half shifts fear and absurdity. Reliable fear becomes the unreasonable reactions of the characters. The story ends with disappointment. Although this film seems to be complete, there is one endless end that could set the stage. The film is not a sufficient sequel. This movie is worth mentioning in the theater, just wait for it to be stunned. It is best suited for a rental movie. This is probably not the movie you want to own.
