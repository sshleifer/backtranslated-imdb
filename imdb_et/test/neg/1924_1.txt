*** This comment may include a spoiler *** Warning: This includes a spoiler. And it only makes sense if I see about 80 films a year. I have to say that of the 80 films I see in the theater, maybe 5 is really very good, 15 or 20 aren't that big, 40 or 50 is okay, and maybe 5 or 10 is totally terrible. Here on Earth, the category itself falls. This is one of the most predictable, toughest and most despicable films I've ever seen. It's loaded with unlikable characters, a maudlin situation after school-special kind of topics and enough fluffy here to make the young and recovered look like American BEAUTY. And I'm not unfair. It's a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> This is a rich man, a poor girl, a poor man and a small town that makes fresh cookies for the people of his city every day. Are you still warm and foggy? Let me continue. One day, a rich tatt reaches the city where her new graduation opportunity, which her father has bought, and she insults a beautiful girl at the dining place, is almost fighting her long-time girlfriend and then competing with her and destroying the small dinner she is working on. This is how he is understood in the small town by summer, where he and the boy come together with the organizer. This gives us many opportunities to see Chris Klein without a shirt so we can understand why the girl falls for him at the dining place. She has abs! Oh and he's rich !!! And .... he's the biggest jerk with no respect. He's James Dean, he's a rebel who doesn't give up! He is rude to every city, he does not want to associate with someone who is trying to be nice to him and he acts like a corrupt rich. But Leelee Sobieski is still against him. There is no reason why he does it, he just does. Excuse me, that's right, I forgot to mention that he likes the same poet he does. Well, if it doesn't get you, I don't know what. <br /> <br /> Here on Earth there are also some of the most predictable moments I've ever given in a movie. There was one point when I left the theater to get popcorn and read graffiti on the bathroom wall and I told my bride exactly what would happen in the next ten minutes. After returning, she just laughed and said I was right, even when I said she could get a dance picture. In addition, the disease he suddenly contracted is cancer. This is the most beautiful cancer patient I've ever seen. Have you ever watched a cancer patient die slowly? They lose weight, lose their hair, their gums start to rot. This is not a beautiful picture. Sobieski shines after cancer, as she is pregnant. What kind of insult to people who have been watching love dies slowly because of this disease. And how do you contract the knee joints? <br /> <br /> Now I understand that I've seen too many movies, and this causes my cynicism to run slowly, but it's ridiculous. There wasn't one thing about this film or the character of Chris Klein. He is a jerk, he is unpleasant and he never tries to make peace with him. Here on Earth is not only a bad film, but it is irresponsible. It got 4.2 on the IMDb and it's too big. It is embarrassing to write on the screen and who gave this green light should not only lose its job, but should allow it not to get closer to the script again. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10 and it's generous. This movie should be shown in film schools as a way not to write and manage a movie. <br /> <br /> If you get bored and need something you need to do, and your choices clear the cow's manure or look at it, choose a cow manure cleaning. It smells better and you feel that you have done something good within two hours.
