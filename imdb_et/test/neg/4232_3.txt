The trio sits at the restaurant table and stares literally into space. Later, they rely on the railway and looked over the English Channel. The man works repeatedly in his garden, but his head and upper body are visible on the screen. The man and the woman look at the other man against the stone wall. All these quiet shots last about one minute. Absolutely no information is given, which was not given to us for about a quarter of a time. The editor must be half asleep. I know I was. <br /> <br /> The film opens with an amazing picture of the obvious dead body raw vagina. His throat rises. But then the policeman (Schotte) will change a couple of words to the next couple and start to mark them, and the case will be forgotten in the next half hour, while Schotte and his friends trade with each other and strangers with unfair insults. Finally, the body thread is lifted again, but continues slowly, almost without targeting, following the stylistic pattern already created. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, in such films, taking a position is an atmosphere that compensates for the story, but not here. French village houses are attached to each other by a long line. The front of the house is located directly on the pavement without steps. The front panels show practically no decoration and are pretty much indistinguishable. Flat arable land is characteristic. What could have been one of the most interesting episodes - visiting the stone fortress on the coast - the trio is drifting until they begin to behave like snots and are asked to leave. <br /> <br /> Operation is minimal. No one seems to be particularly eager to say anything. No jokes. Nothing fun will happen. The police face is almost as interesting as Randy Quaid. Babe, a long rough blonde, looks like steroids used by the East Germans at the Olympics. <br /> <br /> I sat for more than one hour before that. Maybe I'll break it at some other time. If I have not forgotten anything or if it does not end up as a routine routine for Monty Python, I don't think you can rent it.
