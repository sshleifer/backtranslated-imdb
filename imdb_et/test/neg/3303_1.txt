In particular, you should not take this film seriously. Unfortunately, it takes you seriously, but it can't help. This anime ninja flic must be a crowning achievement that breaks what might have been pleasant, if the unigiginal story spins with a bad plot, ridiculous time injuries and one outrageous guest that makes you laugh or mute (or both, like me). <br /> <br /> Although I am usually a fan of ninja / samurai anime (for some Ninja Scroll and Ruroun Kenshin), this must be an exception. For this film, from the technical point of view, it was a very good animation and construction. This is the plot that collapsed. The authors of this film clearly decided (what rational reason I do not know) that they might in some way compensate for the absence of a script when the treasures that he learns and dies are looking for halfway around the world. In the process, he records a black slave Sami, meets a French girl who lives in Apache village, makes friends with a ninja whose members then try to kill her, meets more with family members, but she knew she was the strangest place and circumstances (and who will all die later) at some point in the movie). # 1: Jiro met with two cowboys with a ridiculously cliche who meets a man who introduces himself as "Mark Twain." Saying here, apparently, "What ****? !!" This "meeting" serves one purpose: it completely discredits a film that tries to add itself to an educated historical background. I was disappointed that the authors went to all this problem to explore the US in the 1860s and could not understand that the real name of "Mark Twain" was Samuel Clemens. # 2: When Jiro finally finds the treasure, it turns out that it was previously Captain Kidd. Now I hear fools now. <br /> <br /> Finally, there are ongoing scenes. These scenes show a variety of symbols where the landscape moves statically behind them for several minutes and there are many of them. It is these scenes that make this movie 2 hours 12 weeks a week and a half. <br /> <br /> If you and your friends are looking for a movie with bad subtitles that just ask for fun this is. Feel free to have fun with every aspect of it and enjoy it. Just don't take it seriously. 3/10
