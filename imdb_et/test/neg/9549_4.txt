The style has too many mistakes and illogical sequences that are worth it. Jolie's action is pretty flat and poor, Washington is OK, the rest is cardboard cutouts. Somehow almost everything about this movie is mediocre. The plot is flat. The only thing I liked more or less about this movie is the relatively original methods used by the offender to end his victims. The technical details are worse than the far-stretched CSI knowledge and gizmos, and the semi-semi-wonder of the film is whether the director even took care of detailed credibility. (Some Spoilers below!) I mean an ECG machine that has a clean sinus wave that reflects the human heartbeat, quadriplegic with body muscle spasms and one working finger. A killer killing a human intestine, keeping him alive so that rats can have a party, followed by a rat who wants a man's FACE! What is all this stupidity? There are quite a few inconsistencies, but they can also be found elsewhere in IMDb. Honestly, I found it a bit offensive even to my limited intelligence. <br /> <br /> A waste of time. Still 10 out of 10 to keep my girlfriend from hitting me.
