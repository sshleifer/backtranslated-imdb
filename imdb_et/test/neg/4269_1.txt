This terrible activity? sci-fi movie is a mess. I've just spent 90 minutes looking at one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story doesn't make any sense, there are a lot of mistakes in the scenario, the characters are badly developed, the unknown cast is terrible, the lead hammer seems too old for his role. I was invited to buy this VHS that has a great cover and I can see it because of the illegal IMDb user rating and some 'ten stars' ratings. I just checked the authors and each of them has only one brief overview ("L.I.N.X.") issued in IMDb and nothing else. Why are they advertising such garbage? My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "L.I.N.X. Conex√£o Letal" ("L.I.N.X. Deadly Connection")
