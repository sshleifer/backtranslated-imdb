Oliver Stone's very disappointing film, unlike his recent epic J.F.K. does not stimulate any real emotion. "Talk Radio" is a speech-and-return receiver "Barry Champlain", a very picky, minded man who can distract many people and still pull the audience, most of whom want to just call and abuse him. His boss in the film (Alec Baldwin) takes his character very well, saying he is just a mouth-seller. And if Barry (Eric Bogosian) gets the risk of death in the event of death, the end result is almost inevitable. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that usually has something very powerful to say. But "Talk Radio" doesn't make a serious comment and is still a frustrating, pointless movie. <br /> <br /> Thursday, September 17, 1992 - Video
