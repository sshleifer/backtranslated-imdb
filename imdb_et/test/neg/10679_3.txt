Just like the whole cast and the team knows about making a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is about the adventures and predictions of today's cocktail batsman and the aging of his obsolete vampire. lover. This plot in itself gives up clich√©s and promises of boredom when the film is as small as it is, and that's exactly what you get. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me tell you that I will never miss movies because they are B-movies, in fact some of my favorite movies are B-films like Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter, but it stays next to the coin . <br /> <br /> Everyone who has knowledge of small budget movies knows that the actor is rarely thrilling and emotional, but Razor Blade Smile creates a whole new dimension to grab it. Some of the actors are simply inexplicably bad, the characters are struck by a single lining of cheese that falls off, and a discourse that expresses as much emotion and conviction as a terminator after a few horses calming. <br /> <br /> A large part of the movie is also received by vampire characters, especially the protagonist, unnecessarily moving his mouth, showing ridiculously large vampire teeth and exhaling very loudly. It must literally happen almost every scene at least once and quickly become annoying and pointless, as if the faces of many loose jawed supposedly frightening vampires were used to fill just a little while and pull out the rest of this sandwich Against what some other reviewers think of here , I feel that this film (especially the director) is really trying to take this movie seriously in many parts. The number of dramatic action pictures and extreme close-ups shows me that the director really wanted people to know this movie and make it legitimate for their genre and not to break it and fail. Attempts to allegedly tasteful sex scenes come out as a comic and stupid, and action sequences are sometimes just stupid. <br /> <br /> The end of this movie was also one of the weakest and most pathetic conclusions I saw in the movie, B-film. If such films force you to sit down for hours only when they are given "oh, it was all a game" that actually ends up sick. The end result of the "plot" seems to be the successor of the leader that he realized on the last day of shooting that they had run their end of the budget for their shoe game. <br /> <br /> But I have not rated this film as one star despite the overwhelming embarrassment, and this is due to the only plus point that I really can give to this movie. Intentionally or not, it was funny. I'm pretty sure that the parts I found humorous were not meant to be, and I found most of the efforts for real gags infertile, but when I looked at my friends, this is a good movie to take away.
