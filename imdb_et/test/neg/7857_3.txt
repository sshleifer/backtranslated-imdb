For some of us, director Ernst Lubitsch, who respected his excitement and ironic comic, was rather damp when the material came. It is not that Lubitsch is overestimated - on the contrary, he was probably visually narrative before his time, but the projects he received (or assigned) are not his comedy landmarks. fans want to tag them. "Waiting for Heaven", the adaptation of Lazlo Bus-Fekete's "Birthday" to Lubitsch gets into the sleepy Don Ameche - and the combination of anemic plot, colorless star and blind rebound guides the director. The perpetrator at the turn of the century "sleeps without understanding", presenting the facts of his life to the entrance to hell. Ameche ... evil? That was the first problem. The promising opening sequence (placed in the Hades lobby) quickly gives way to terrible fear and supportive casting is of little help. * 1/2 from ****
