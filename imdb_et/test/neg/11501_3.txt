this is the right show to watch, not the best or the worst. I've been watching this for a long time and I don't like any new ones. This exhibition has become a teenage garbage and lives a lot differently. I don't like this mess ... I have no IQ why they completely changed the theme of this show. The first season was really enjoyable to watch and it was partly amusing. Season 2 is just stupid from this world. I don't really know why the writers / directors show it. a lot more people liked the first season better than 2nd and 3rd place. I'm just looking at the first season of this show, when I see a new episode, I change the f * ckin channel badly ... you've heard me! It will be 3/10 because I enjoyed the first season somewhat, but I hated the other and the third
