This film would have come with the responsibility that it is similar to the left back. I didn't know it was a Bible-acting film. I was expecting it to be a movie about UFOs and an alien abduction for entertainment. Like previous reviewers, it would be good to show in the church, but not in a public theater, at least not without the consumer's prior knowledge of the film's premise. I felt like I was wrong for my $ $ movie because none of the above refers to his religious surprises. If you go to church, it's probably shown there for free. Except for covering his actual subject, the film was very good for the action and script. But I have to say that I went to the movie for an hour when I saw what direction he was heading for and that I was not going to entertain, but preached.
