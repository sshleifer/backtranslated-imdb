What can I say? It was one terrible movie to watch. Usually I am not very nice about the film, because most of them are usually low budget, but it really brought me to the wall. I mean, has this happened to gay cinema? Did the gay producers and directors learn anything about Gus Van Saints and Ang Lee movies? Just sitting across the film was like being in the chair of a dentist and removing the teeth of my wisdom. I was praying for moments where I felt no connection with any character, but it never happened. Most of the characters' performances were not convincing. It was like watching one of these poorly produced TV movies on the local access roads. I can not tell you how disappointed this film was when he was the second fan of the other fans of Tori Spell and the last to work with the saints of recent days. It certainly wasn't waiting. Certainly, for a few hours in my life I can never get back and definitely won't buy it on a DVD.
