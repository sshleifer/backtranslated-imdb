This is one of the movies I watched and wondered why I was watching it? What did I get so interesting about it? Being a truck driver himself, it was not very realistic. No, I've never used a "lot of lizard" and have never seen or heard anyone traveling in a brand new $ 70,000 RV. <br /> <br /> The same thing that has never been tried by this lady (until the end of the movie and well, she still didn't really do ...), and only 50 bucks when she gets $ 200.00 ( well, $ 150.00) after his cut, yes ...). <br /> <br /> I still laugh at the lot lizard commentary Ivey (their Lot Lizards, they screw something 20 bucks and some men dress as a woman). .. or something equally strange), which means we are better than them because we can still be prostitutes, but we can pay better. <br /> <br /> Other then it's just a story about a young woman who wanted something more from life than a dead job, living at home (she's 18 years old, remember?) and embarrassed by her mother basically the same thing (dead job) . At least he had the roof of his head and work. He turned to the highway FIVE tricks ... I wonder if his $ 750.00 worth was worth it? I don't think so.
