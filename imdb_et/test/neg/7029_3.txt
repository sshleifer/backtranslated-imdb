This movie was terrible! Ashley Rose Orr, though a talented tap dancer and singer (the latter is somewhat better than a temple), is a terrible actor. He plays such a character as Shirley, which we saw in his films on the screen, whether he is playing on the screen or offscreen person. So what we get is too cutesy and completely unreal (not to mention uninteresting) portrait. If someone wants to see that his side is, one can rent one of his films. The only bright light here is Connie Britton's image of the Gertrude Temple. I don't think it would be terribly realistic, but at least it worked well. Save yourself in trouble and rent a bad little rich girl.
