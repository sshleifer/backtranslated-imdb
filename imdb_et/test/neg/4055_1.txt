When I see such a video, I have to ask myself how it was financed. HBO or Showtime or anything that has to pay for producers to move through the drive - hire someone who can actually speak English to get high and grab something that approaches the plot to pay the stripper with terrible boob jobs. and under the heavily waxed dudes' torsos to find people with a set of design and luminaires, buy rights for technical music, and so on. But I have to imagine it must be a vanity for a project that serves as an executive producer ... He had to nail all these girls, right? And the bro is not "Spanish looking" for the girl wrong, but the police calling "stunning" is terribly generous. In fact, I would go so far as to call them "closer" or "wrong". Watching these women - sometimes * clearly * on high painkillers - was so far from erotic that my testicles actually rose into my body. Gross. <br /> <br /> Why waste time with so much free hardcore porn on the Internet? I don't know if popularizing internet video slowly kills the soft video industry ... Can only hope, right?
