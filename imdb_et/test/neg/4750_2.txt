I'm sorry to say that this movie was the biggest disappointment of the year. After one of the biggest disappointments in the film, the monster fits with history to learn from the mistakes of the previous incarnation. The sequel falls into many of the same traps, the plot line was completely forced, the dialogue was so bad that the film could be quieter and the action was developed and far from the heartbeat of the original texts from every monster. The best part of AVP-Requiem is actually a trailer that, after passing the movie, finally realizes that almost every single death and the really cool fire of each movie is already shown in the trailer, which leaves little open and little excitement. I gave the movie an extra star to see that the extra hot female looks almost naked. the movie was played as a color-sci-fi monster fest, which also played something that was not a surprise when it happened because you saw it a thousand times before. The main failure of both films is that the creators thought that setting up movies from our time would make us more interested in the story than it might happen one day with us. But what pulled people out when they released the arcade game during the day was that it took place within the top futuristic version of the ALIEN trilogue, which allowed for more suspicion of infidelity. this is the place where future films have to be inspired. because frankly, when we see that ALIEN is being killed by a waitress, we've all been frightened since childhood but really for us. lets the series back to the roots. learn from the former masters and do not confuse the winning formula, trying to make a "bold new vision" that we liked the originals, we want to see it again. Finally, the whole movie's actual WTF moment, * after the big peaks SPOILER *, the survivors are hidden by special ops soldiers who justify their terrible activities by saying "we had followed the orders" and then switched on the dime and start acting nice and become rescuers. then after a long pull with one of the survivors who searched heaven with evil effort, we cut the most bizarre flock I've ever seen, with the characters you didn't see in the rest of the movie (Save the Government Dude), all along with the nuances of the Punch face one movie with a hint of a plot line that would make the original movie of the sci-fi channel red and its nose up. So, summing up, if you have to choose this movie and do other activities on Earth, skip this movie and do another thing.
