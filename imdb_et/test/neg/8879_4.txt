Having watched this film many times, I have come to the conclusion that Milos Forman made a very bold decision to make a museum for Goya, when the artist led what most weighs the passionate, passionate life, while the French Revolution and the rage of the Napoleon era throughout Europe, certainly on it with enough drama to do. When I realized that Mr. Forman was involved in the microcosm of the tragedy of Ines' life, I had a world ruin at that time, I felt there was so much Goya, so much of his humanity. The strongest and most obvious point that this film made was that, because of the fallen nature of the man, each of us in life is a potential villain, each of us has evil that we must fight with God's help. How beautiful when Goya says she should have helped Ines more, how is it true for all of us? We need to protect and defend the innocent. An excellent ironic scene, where the once captured priest condemns the death sentence to Lorenzo, who condemned him, is a genius. There was more to me when I rolled credit. Maybe less unrealistic coincidences and more inner characters in the characters.
