This is happening on Fire Island in the 1970s. Couple Peter (Craig Dudley) and Buddy (J. Will Deane) will throw their house on July 4th. Unfortunately, their relationship is falling apart and they have to prepare for a very strange guest house. The rest of the film crowns the party and what is going on between Peter and Buddy. <br /> <br /> OK - I'm a gay man, but I was 8 years old when it was done. If this is a real view of what gay life was like in the 1970s, I'm glad I wasn't around. From a nice opening credit that shows that children play in the sand (???), this film slowly slides into disaster. There's a guru (Robert Case) who says no importance in any way. I wanted a boy halfway to my first LONG call. There's a young boy Danny who's there for the first time. There's a lesbian couple (who doesn't do anything except one strip for no reason). There's a leather queen. The worst is the feminine man named Jimmy (Jimmy Foster). We introduce him and his friend (whose name I never got) when they get a solid tire. Basically screaming and screaming for 10 minutes and they have no idea how to fix the apartment. I know some people find it funny, but I found it offensive and quite sad. The party itself is full of people you never want to know. It's like getting a dumped party full of bad players playing unpleasant people. Only with Dudley's exception can anyone act. <br /> <br /> It can be valuable when Fire Island was like in the 1970s ... but it's a pretty boring look. It gets 2 nudity from just a few very nice body men.
