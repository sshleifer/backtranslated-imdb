Naach would have won the worst film in 2004 (may be general) if it were global. Halle Berry does not fit the Antra Template if it works badly (eg Attitude / Waking / Over (Not)). While Kassar had a hero with a microscopic costume, a supposedly hot actor and some action sequences, Naach had nothing at all. <br /> <br /> One of those movies that makes me wonder why IMDb lets the movie be rated at 0/10. What's more, I think the film doesn't deserve even 0. It must be something negative or minus infinity. <br /> <br /> What is a plot sketch? It is a fundamental talent, arrogant, full of attitude to a choreographer who meets a useless, skillless and entertaining person who wants to be an actor. The story is so short that if just another sentence, IMDb can disable spoiler writing. The story speaks? It's like a bunch (regretted by 2 people mostly) who are moving in super slow motion. Don't try this movie if you have purchased a new DVD player. You finally believe that the DVD is bad or the DVD player is hit. Not his fault at all. <br /> <br /> After all, you give credit to the director. At least he realized that both Antra Mall and Abhishek Bachan (at least at that time) could not talk convincingly about the dialogue, so there are not too many dialogues in this film. So, at least you can sleep through the movie, with some annoying noises from these Antra-template songs. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie when you're new to Bollywood Cinema. If you have endured this movie, you will see and enjoy every Bollywood movie. <br /> <br /> The 3-hour torture must not be worse than that!
