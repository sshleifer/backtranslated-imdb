The third in the series is that Paul Kersey (Bronson) turns the vigilant into a revenge to kill his old friend. I don't know why this film made me, but somehow it did. I found myself at Bronson to wipe the floor with these puppets. Every time he blew one of them, I felt good. This movie doesn't take itself seriously, but what if it happened? The fireworks finals have a good design where Bronson goes rampage. But as far as acting and the plot goes, it just doesn't measure. When I live in this neighborhood, I get out as soon as possible, but people seem to be in trouble. I know there is a kind of mentality we need to save on our streets, but there is a limit here. I had to give it. 4. Of course, there are good "shock-em" scenes, but that's it. At that time, Bronson was 64. I'm sure these thugs really wanted them to get their way with Bronson. Bronson is located instead of Schwarzanegger or Stallone. This movie gives you joy. A general person can save the neighborhood by saving the day. All in all, this is far from the original death contest, but it is quite good if you are looking for an hour and a half victory.
