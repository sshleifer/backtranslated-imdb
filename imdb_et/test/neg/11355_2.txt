I never thought about watching this movie. I saw it in a local video rental shop on the horror shelf and I didn't think much about it. Just running your grinder, blan zombie tends to get a little gore and sex scene. Something special, can Python look ... oh don't wait, it's a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> I only decided to watch it when some of my friends saw it on the TV and said it was a terrible trash. So, I decided to check these stories and only then did I realize how horrible is the movie that hides behind a joyous and uninteresting DVD box. <br /> <br /> Not that the idea itself is bad. The plane is a restricted area and it would be a real death trap for the people on board when the zombies look like ... would be a good prerequisite for a zombie movie. However, this movie made a good setting and created bad performance, unstable camera work, annoying signs and terrible scores. <br /> <br /> All of them have different levels of hate. There are two young couples who are mostly friends on vacation in France. One pair consists of a jockey and his annoying bitchy girlfriend who communicates with Mr Jock, who came with his girlfriend, a blonde psycho. There is also a policeman who sends a companion (feminine and very annoying con-man). The police are probably one of the least irritating signs. Then there are a whole host of masters who mostly reach the zombie-chow ... I didn't watch the whole movie, it was just too painful to carry out the experience, almost as bad as watching Cannibal Holocaust. Oh and there is also a golfer with his wife, some strange airmen who really don't seem to be important until he is called to help zombie escape. pilots. The work of the camera is often trembling and although many people do not feel like it, it can really get into their nerves after a while. It's small, but it's there and it's annoying. The adulterous couple is really annoying. All they do is having sex in the airplane toilets when their husbands are not looking for ... in fact, all the young adults in this movie are madly annoying. They whine, bitches, argue and have some ugly and thoughtlessly boring dialogues in the movie ... yes, it makes you happy that they are dying. <br /> <br /> The result is cruel. It is so general and unnecessary that it kills any temporary event that the scene might have caused, and replaces it with the feeling that someone scratches the board with his nail and laughs with you. In fact, it looks like a ... Python! This movie never ends with me. There is also a sign that filmmakers seemed incredibly intent on taking as many shots as possible. A nun who sits close to young adults and associates his Bible with so many shots, you start wondering if he plays a big part in the movie ... but he's not, why is he in so many scenes? Was it because the film's original project was nun porn? Nobody ever knows. <br /> <br /> Zombies look pretty good. Their makeup is good and probably much better than the living characters, they are much more convincing and enjoyable! The lawyer responsible for tracking the illegal cargo of the researcher was quite funny. He seems to have a big box, and the camera briefly tells the audience that his leg has pierced some kind of sharp object ... but he does not yell, twist or throw pain. He just grunts and confirms trying to get things out of his feet ... he actually sounds more like an overweight man who tries to scratch his back when a painful man. All in all, I give it 1 interesting setting and 1 for zombies. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie only if you like young adults worship and throw things at each other, and unfortunately there is really nothing funny about the whole thing, so you probably won't get a smile if you don't have any psychoactive drug .
