It wasn't really too much of this movie to hear, so I went and saw it. I realized that this film only calls someone who has not lived in the real world. And even these people would think this movie is moving too slowly. <br /> <br /> When the movie opens, you'll see Nicole Kidman in a nudist camp. Hey. Shock. This scene, the dialouge, was all great. And then the film went downhill. <br /> <br /> While I respect the filmmaker's vision, this film is sucked. It was too slow, too predictable and not moving enough. Robert Downey Jr is great as usual, but this movie is not good enough to sit. It tries to be shocking and abnormal, but uses the talents of all participants badly. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money, even sex scenes were boring.
