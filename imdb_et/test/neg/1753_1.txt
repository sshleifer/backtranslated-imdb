Kidman and the law have no chemistry to do this sluggishly directed, poorly written romance / melodrama at some other level than grandiosity. Kidman pouts and <br /> <br /> are pleased with their missing lover's law. He met him when he won the southern battle during the Civil War, and they have only exchanged about 5 sentences and one kiss, but they are completely nailed. The main direction of the law seems to be "Look free and shocked, but sensitive." Rene Zellweger is the only spark in this single script, but she's playing it too wide and top as she was "Annie Get Your Gunis". Yee-hah boy crying! Something about his character seemed more than it was in the Monty Python sketch - the "Holy Grail" scheme, where peasants spent all their time to eat mud, making sludge pies without reason. Kidman is a pretty smart actor who will stay away from his path as he gets. Their scenes are like a comic book hidden in a Victorian novel. <br /> <br /> At a time when bogs are moving into tedium, which is often all, all writers shout. ! and Teague (Ray Winstone) is nowhere to come to make his unspeakable dirty acts, such as killing and torturing innocent pious townspeople who are loyal to fading fast <br /> <br /> Confederacy. At all other times, he's lost in action, which is even redundant in this cornball script. There are many other talented participants who give reliable results with a small role. These are the characters that the law meets when he makes his Johnny Applesee track on the frontline where he is abandoned to desperately love Kidman's acceptance in Cold Mountain. Ultimately, none of these characters is important. The law has no time for them or their lives. All these small mini-movies have the same tired subject: war is a gol-durn heck and otherwise makes a decent Christian nation a rabies. <br /> <br /> And the script is too predictable, too hard. Moreover, the story is slowly slow. You spend the whole movie waiting for the inevitable reunion of Rome and Julia, where Kidman wrists his hands and sighs, the Law goes beyond the incredible coefficients and gives up the balls. And when it finally comes, it just doesn't care anymore. You look at your watch, thinking about how much you need to withstand this clip. <br /> <br /> I give him one star of five battle scenes. Here's a strong anti-war message. The amazing concern that generals lose human life on both sides of the conflict is a powerful stuff. But it is only about 15 minutes from this 150-minute dog.
