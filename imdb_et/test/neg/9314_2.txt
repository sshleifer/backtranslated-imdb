What can be said about this independent effort, except that it has been captured by television cameras, and whether it was due to perceptions or budgetary constraints, Romero's topic does not make it easier to see this variation. I was constantly reminded that I was looking at someone's school project, in the best possible way, at the worst. what tells me more about his editorial style than his leadership style, which consists of a close-up of his face with TV cameras that made me think I was watching public television, not a real, honest movie. story /> <br /> The story copies and pastes different sources, including the Romero DEAD trilogy mentioned above, ROAD WARRIOR (digs a "future" that looks like the past) and BLAIR WITCH PROJECT <br /> > What are the results of hours and nothing worthy of zombies that follow and eat people. (Okay, "people" in this case are clones, but that doesn't change anything. It's the same menu.) <br /> <br /> The year is 2031 and nineteen people are cloned. years of malfunction, especially in nutrition. Of course, if the clones are bad, the first thing they have is human flesh (or cloned human meat in that case). It is not safe to be indoors. It's just a matter of time before the gums that eat meat eat our heroes. Have you seen it before? <br /> <br /> I don't mind Romero hanging when it's well done, but there is no new territory in this movie. It is a nightlife that corresponds to the BLAIR WITCH PROJECT taken with television cameras. Especially disappointing is that the DVD cover looks like it was photographed with at least 8 mm film. It would not have been a problem for me if the story hadn't been equally cheap. The film offers a vision of the future where technology has evolved to enable human cloning. Do we need to continue cloning our favorite movies?
