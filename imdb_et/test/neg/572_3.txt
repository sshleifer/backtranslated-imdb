A movie about a mysterious love letter that puts a small town in your ear should be fun, romantic, and easy. Instead, this film is more about things that have not been said and that have not been expressed so that it reaches the point where you are grateful, even if the dialogue is not exactly quoted. <br /> <br /> SPOILER - <br /> <br /> If the relationship that says the most is the least visible on the screen (Danner and McEwan), you know you're in trouble. But these two actors are a very welcome phenomenon in the film screaming for some genuine people. <br /> <br /> END OF THE SPOILER <br /> <br /> Capshaw is given the task of creating a badge and he is not completely successful. As I said above, it seems that the subject is repression and I understand that it is an element of life and love, but I do not want to see it, at least not. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend it at all, despite the very talented pains that are left to take care of themselves.
