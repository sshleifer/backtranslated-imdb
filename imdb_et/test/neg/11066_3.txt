Monday, 02 October 2006 So I got with my dad as I always do. We ordered some Japanese extracts, turned off the lights and pushed the game. I'm a terrible movie fan. However, the cave, released in October, was definitely a recession. It seemed promising to meet all the standard requirements of horror films: pulled out at the beginning with an antagonistic character, no sexual scene can be omitted, and too familiar with the pre-spook (if they bless you unexpectedly, but it turns out to be an idiot friend). Finally, when he reached nitty gritt, he was ready for some real gore action. The director, I admitted, was eager. Of course, you should complete the entire 81 minutes when people move back and forth in a room that is about 10 feet wide. Everything starts when some college-related "cavers" gather in another cave. They all look like experienced pros, very serious and spiritual about the whole cave experience. This time, they bring in a new, somewhat irritating photographer, too blinded by his National Geographic cover to understand the full danger of diving in caves. When they fall deep into what they call "Hell Pit," they will soon realize that they are not alone in the line of death. I'll politely leave out all the spoilers if you're naive enough not to hear my advice and avoid wasting my time. Although the atmosphere and background music were spooky; and there was a definite blood and gore when the moments that saw the actual breakdown were, rather than the complete front panel, watching porn. The camera was purposefully dark and sketchy. I think the director used it to get the effect. I think the thing I like most was the moving characters. They deserved the Acadamy Awards for those who were touched. I was almost tearful when they finally "got" ... Tear of joy! If you like dry horror, soft porn and you hated Braveheart. Then that's the right movie for your next Saturday night.
