My trailers were high after the trailer. They were even bigger when I saw the film with the same leader as Independence Day and Godzilla. The special effects of Independence Day were much better in this film. The whole movie I was expecting to show spiders. The rest of the story was really boring. And when the spiders came, they had a very amateur appearance, as the special effects came from a film made in the 60s. I didn't watch the whole movie. When I was playing for about an hour, I switched off my DVD player. I watch 3 movies almost every night and I've never gone away from the movie, even if it was boring. The only thing in this movie was the real sheriff :) That's why I voted for 2 instead of 1) So don't look at it, instead you should go out and rent Starship Troopers, that's just 10,000 times better.
