When the Family Guy first appeared, I was not in a discriminatory mood. What in the 1990s were smart, surrealistic cartoons, why should I be? Nickelodeon was manufactured by Dougi; The modern life of Ren and Stimpy and Rockos with other fine cartoons (yes, it includes Spongebob) .All were peculiar, dreamy animations and surprisingly complex stories and dialogue. The Simpsons became a direct phenomenon, maybe not as brilliant as his biggest defenders claim it is, but a very long time investment and definitely rejects the wrong axiom that all TV is junk. South Park began with crude oil, but a fun attack on everything that has unique and intelligent satire. It turned into a Monty Pythonquire show, which was the protection of terrible concepts and brutally fast and sharp social criticism (such as protecting the dwarfs of false panties) and ultimately a self-standing reference and "meta" like the Simpsons, and unfortunately jumped to shark. Family Guy is superficially like Simpsons and South Park. It pushes the buttons and is a favorite among college students and love enthusiasts. But what he's insecure is really nice. <br /> <br /> The show is famous for gimmicks, especially rebounds. Many of them are references to bad TVs or ads. Some are funny (especially in the first two seasons), most of them are not. Are the references funny in nature? I am not sure, but they are mostly about what the exhibition is about, given that its characters are painfully uninteresting. When Homer and Bart have a charm and Cartman has artillery and pure behavior of self-consciousness, Peter Griffin is sorry. He's just a pick, an unpleasant pig. Anything that comes from his character is just because writers forget how to forget that day. Lois is also very low and dull; Meg is a prop, just for abuse; Chris's outline has slowed down and only occasionally funny, and the two main stars of the show (Stewie and Brian) are so inconsistent in their characterization that it is really pointless. <br /> <br /> Other tricks that I can not stand when the sign is obviously obvious and leaves it uncomfortable for a long time. It happens a lot lately and I can't bear it anymore. Not only the most mentioned chicken that likes to beat Peter, I speak of painful moments where they talk about pop culture and are like foreigners. It doesn't make sense, or even ironic humor, it's totally boring and inanimate. <br /> <br /> Not that the show can't be funny, in fact some of the earlier episodes were running for me. Highlights include a pilot episode where Peter loses reality after losing his valuable television; When Peters Religious Girl Appears and Destroys; When Peter turns into Megsi school, he is a dick and "pancake" episode. I suspect that these are episodes that inadvertently incorporated actual human attributes or were only those times when writers had real comic inspiration. <br /> <br /> One last thing, the show is not offensive. It's just offensive to those who don't see the presentation for the first time, so it's almost like pulling a circle on the hipster choir.
