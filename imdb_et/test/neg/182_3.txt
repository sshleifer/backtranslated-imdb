Honest young insurance agent Ronald Reagan (Eric Gregg) is optimistic but poor. Her husband, representing Sheila Bromley (Nona Gregg), misses the finer things of life. Describing himself as "not weighted ton of justice", Ms. Bromley will spend more money than Mr. Reagan earns. Bromley acquires finer things in life, but puts on a couple of debts. Bromley is a fun coat. <br /> <br /> Handsome Reagan attracts other women like a perky official Gloria Blondell (like Patricia Carmody); but he doesn't care. In order to pay for the bill, Bromley gets into a racket that helps her trigger her. Unemployed Reagan seems to be tempted in the life of a crime - will he stay upright or twist? Clinton Rosemond has an uncomfortable "broken hand" scene. <br /> <br /> *** Accidents happen (1938) William Clemens ~ Ronald Reagan, Sheila Bromley, Gloria Blondell
