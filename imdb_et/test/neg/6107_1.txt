The film is a misunderstanding of the true Orthodox way of life and practice. NEVER a divorce between Jews and couples without a Jewish court. Although the term is in Jewish law, the conditions are too much to actually happen. Couples without children have a hard time coping with their childhood community, where children are a very important part of life, but somewhere their community is not depicted in the "movie". They are treated with extreme sensitivity. In fact, many great rabbis have lived their entire lives without children and never have a divorce. <br /> <br /> The depiction of the horrible person of Yosef is - perhaps subconsciously - meant to show typical orthodox behavior. man. In fact, it is as typical as the violent drunkard is typical of a secular society. Both exist on their own worlds and both are despicable. <br /> <br /> It is surprising that so many people create their own opinion about a society based on MOVIE (someone who is personally biased against the community). I have always thought that only an orthodox who, because of his narrow-mindedness and isolated lifestyle, treats all secular people, based on the violence and immoral behavior they see in newspapers or films.
