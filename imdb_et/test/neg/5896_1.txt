This documentary was very amateurish. This could have been done by students. Assuming it was, my classification is as follows. Content: C, sound quality: F, operator: F, acting: D, soundtrack: F, casting: C, boobshot: A ...... Overall rating: D <br /> <br /> when we walked through the streets by characters, dropping up and down with every cameraman's move. My mother-father even changed her prodigal batteries and she couldn't hear a tuned dial. This bomb would not contribute to extensive post-production editing and CGI. These students "hardly" would pass my course. My advice ... don't waste your time or money on one "A".
