Stanley Kubrick, the director I hold in the highest values ​​of my masterpieces (Clockwork Orange, 2001, The Killing, Shining, Dr. Strangelove, etc.), took the film out of circulation, leaving it only for serious fans and graduates. After seeing the film myself, I saw why. At the age of 24, Kubrick was still a photographic craftsman for the scheduled LOOK press and made some brief papers. Like many of the first filmmakers that came decades after him, his ambition for fear and desire, in short, was just to go and make the film cheaper than likely to see if he could do it. He was successful at this level. But the film is definitely not so. <br /> <br /> I can't really say the movie has failed because there was something I liked about it. Even if the story of the film went on and the actors (whom Kubrick had no idea how to lead, not as a theater artist), his skills in producing and capturing some great pictures will be the seeds of this film. . Sometimes there are some pictures of close-ups and fast shots that are eye-catching / functional scenes. Unfortunately, that's all I can really say about the movie. Although the film has a couple of "name" actors (Frank Sliver, who also appeared in Killer's Kiss and Paul Mazursky, director himself), performances are generally boring and routine. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is the main death of the film for me; when I look at Kubrick's film, even the kiss and kill of Killer's early art, I can tell who did it because his style now became special, which would continue as an artist. It was not "artistic" as I would have seen (this is usually the first time for managers like Scorsese and Spielberg), but watching this movie not only knew it was Kubrick, it seemed a lot since I looked at B-Class ( or even a C-Class movie that the director forgot - not quite "Ed Wood" bad, but close. Music is as standard as possible, pedestrians disappear, and the plot does not seem to have paid much attention. <br /> <br /> In short, as others have said, and what I agree with, this "Doodle pad" is the future earthmaster who shows some shots and some edits to grab some attention (the best scene is usually when the soldiers take the fool a girl hostage) but not enough to really recommend it except those like myself who finally see everything from Kubrick (or maybe you need to see every ever extremely low budget war movie) if it is just curiosity.
