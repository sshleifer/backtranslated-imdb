My roommate and I have another friend who works in the local Blockbuster Video. He finds us really horrible movies and talks about them. One of them was the movie "Christmas Horror" featuring former professional wrestler Bill Goldberg killer Satna Clausina. We didn't look at it right away, but we didn't think there could be anything worse. Probably we were wrong. We were shown this film "starring" Ken Shamrock versus murderous scarecrow. At first we thought that Ken would actually be a killer in a scarecrow and that is why we wanted to look, but he wasn't and it made the movie even worse. What the film was absolutely was a teen drama. If you want to save your brain cells from escaping from your head, NEVER GET THIS MOVIE.
