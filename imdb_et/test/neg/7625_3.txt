weird.this is a TV movie, but the rating given in the box says it is rated in the R.there movie for something that would qualify as an R rating. Nevertheless, the film is very slow and pointless. the idea was good but nothing was done in the storyline.it just wasn't developed.It is lightly horrible and the operation is actually pretty good, better than the movie deserves.i don't see myself watching it again anytime ever.there have had other movies that deal with the same concept that is better made than this one. I haven't seen too many Wes Craven Movies so I can't really compare it to other movies. Yeah, I think it's poorly prepared and badly executed. I can't give Chiller a higher rating than 3/10
