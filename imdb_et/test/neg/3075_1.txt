Years ago, I was trying to make a pretty good movie "Linda". It was made in 1973 and celebrated the title of femme fatale in the roll with Stella Stevens. Imagine your surprise when I saw the same story late on TV in the late ten years. But it was the 1993 version where Virginia Madsen played. Don't make me wrong, I can handle remakes, even hide. However, this poorly written and poorly filmed recovery ring did damage both Madsen and the co-star Richard Thomas. Unlike the original, this dialogue is in dialogue, so I thought, "Why did they bother to rewrite it?" Secondly, the work of the camera is very heavy and the stock of the film is bad. Sometimes I was reminded that Christopher Guest's "The Big Picture" started with a student film contest. Finally, it looks either boring (Madsen) or suffering (Thomas). In fact, Ted McGinley is the only one who seems to really enjoy the job. Of course, he stretches out his earlier work "The Love Boat" with his superbly peeled hair and finite teeth. Bottom line to borrow Opuse Penguin's criticism in Bloom County: <br /> <br /> "This movie makes a movie that Jonestown did for School Help." <br /> <br /> Thomkat
