This is one of those films where the acting, determined location, direction and effects were so bad that you need to rent a copy of 5 or 6 buds, a barrel of beer, to sit and watch. To borrow from late Douglas Adams: "Watching this movie is like your brain, which is broken with a piece of lemon ... surrounded by a large gold brick." <br /> <br /> What's wrong? Everything. British actors, Americans, have had many who can pull it like Bob Hoskins, but he's not. It was not even necessary to choose North America as a location, why not say it was in England or something? The director seemed pleased that girls' tits and asses took more pictures than the actual motif. So here you talk about drunken buddies, "ALL right! Second R&D!" There is not much dialogue, so you can freely go to the kitchen and make these sandwiches. What did I like about this movie? When my friends went out, I managed to collect $ 185 and told them that they spent it on the bar after watching the terrible movie.
