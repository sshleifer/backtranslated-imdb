It was honestly the worst film I've ever seen. acting was God's terrible, also the story was bad. however, it was a good idea. if that film had a better cinematic and much better actors, I'd better say something. Edgar Allen Store was a great Gothic writer and this movie destroyed it. why people always have to kill good stories when making bad movies. the only good part was when the killer put the floor under the floor, which was pretty good. the swinging ax was just horrible, there was no tension. and even when the killer runs all the way to the end, he went from one place to another within a few seconds, it makes no sense.
