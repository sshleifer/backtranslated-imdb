I saw an exhibition last night at 12:45 and I would have gone out in 20 minutes. in, but there was nowhere to go! Dirty product placement, juvenile scripting, so many talent has been wasted, gay bashing ... what did they do? The film is also extremely long (we got 3). As a person who rarely pays for the full price of movies, imagine my amazing $ 22 for this self-conscious, mid-spiritual nightmare (plus $ 2 parking). I still woke up today and have not been able to shake it all day. I love Vince Vaughn and he seemed to have disappeared immediately, as it was I. When Cedric entertainer is a high watermark (man so amusing that he must call himself "entertainer", so understand what he thinks he is doing), you have a serious problem. The appearance of Robert Pastorell is also right-handed as he died almost a year ago (March 10). It should give you an idea of ​​how long they have polished this turtle. This movie means bitter end. We just stayed to make sure they didn't give Robert the "Memory" they didn't. Save yourself! Save Your Money! Save your soul!
