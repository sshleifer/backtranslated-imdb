The annoying group of former students from "Monte Alto International High School" decides to stay in an abandoned institution, where the "mystery" killer, called the guard, played by the horror legend, Paul Naschy, murders them one by one. "School Killer" contains some references to such servant clips as "Scream" or "Friday the 13th". The end of climate change looks like "The Sixth Sense." The certainty that a murderous guard is alive or dead offers some light interest, but the characters are one-dimensional and endless scenes of blind school corridors walking really to my nerves. The charismatic presence of Paul Naschy almost saves the slippage of this clich√©. There are also some decent gore on the screen, which includes superb blood burning. It's nice to see Manuela Velascot's "Rec" fame in small roles.4.
