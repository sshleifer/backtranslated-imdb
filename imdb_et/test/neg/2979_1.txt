It seems like the length of the function of a comedy routine that could have been said within ten minutes. There are also technical loans for par. The film really feels like a film school diploma project. <br /> <br /> There is a mix of experienced stages and talented newcomers, but the problems are superficial. Their lines are built up, just like the cued TV show material. <br /> <br /> The director does not take his main character seriously, so it does not concern their problems and conflicts. <br /> <br /> The film is cleverly marketed and offers a unique sales point, but ultimately loses the film at all levels.
