This is arguably the biggest of Ava Gardner's films. Yes, he's proud. But it can be thin over time, especially after the bright and predictable end of the movie. <br /> <br /> In this Turkey, Robert Walker must pretend to be Eddie Bracken (who's definitely ashamed of him). Olga San Juan plays Jane Powell's part. Dick Haymes plays a kind of dusk (!) And Eve Arden plays Helen Broderick (and several other smartly split half-comedians). Yes, the movie contains a great popular song "Speak Low". But look at another, completely unforgettable piece. Of course, Dick Haymes is very good at singing, and so does a non-qualified singer for Ava. <br /> <br /> Sets are cheap, the script is full of clich√©s and unsuccessful humor, and Tom Conway looks like it was a fight for a liqueur (as he really was). In short, if you want to see open your prime, buy a photo and stay clear of this movie.
