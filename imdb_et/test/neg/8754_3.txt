Hollywood had a long love affair with fake Arabian Nights, but few of these products have tried time. Most memorable were Jon Hall, Maria Montez's films that have long been in the camp. It is filled with duplicate songs, anachronistic slang and slapstick. This is a truly rich crop of Mesopotamia maize and today it is almost intolerable. It was nominated for its imaginative special effects that are almost unnoticeable on this day and age, and which consist mainly of trick photography. The only outstanding, positive feature that remains is its beautiful color and clarity. Unfortunately, many of the films made in this genre have little to come to Alexander Korda's original "Baghdad Thief". Almost all other Arab Nights films are better than that. It's a loser.
