I don't want to feel too much nervous spoilsport, but if a butterfly with a deadly death time had such a huge change in the timeline, how could that be because the butterfly would have burned a pyroclastic blast anyway? And how could the passengers from time to time return to the same moments and not meet their previous and later ones who were on the same few minutes on the timeline? It seems that a large crowd was facing this dinosaur loading. Although I can agree with the idea of ​​a timeline, I doubt that the wave would have only made some changes. When the wave passed, all the changes that would have happened would have happened at the same time as the wave passed. So, scratch the idea that the city will grow into the jungle. And why the jungle at all? The city would still have been at a latitude and longitude that would have been in the past and matched its geographical location with vegetation. <br /> <br /> And an endless list of other illogical failures. <Br /> <br /> Bwahahaha! This flick is a strange combination of some pretty decent production value and totally ridiculous plot holes and factual errors. <br /> <br /> Too bad. An amazing story about an idea that was built with foolish knowledge. <br /> <br /> Sigh ... why, why, why, why? Why spend all that money on production and not even effortlessly correct the script to see if it made any real sense?
