This movie is a mysterious love letter that turned 4 people's love back to life. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the movie is interesting and the film could have been funny. But this movie is just what romantic comedy should not be. At first, the characters are inadequately used, so it becomes so confusing. Supporting characters come and go without reason, as if they exist for only one particular scene and then disappear into thin air. Stimulation is terribly slow that it takes 90 minutes to appear more than 180 minutes. <br /> <br /> It could have been romantic and funny, but this film couldn't do it impressively.
