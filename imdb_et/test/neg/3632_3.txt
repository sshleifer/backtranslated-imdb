First, I want a clear general misconception: it is not unrealistic for Zoey to give laptops to students. In my school, 7th and higher students must have an Apple Macbook (paid for entrance fee). Moving on. This exhibition is very annoying. This is a boring, predictable plot and bad behavior. Often, at the exhibition, "girl power" brings a new high, girls beat the boys in everything they try. But that's not the worst. The worst thing is that girls are portrayed as the centerpiece of their personal performances and screaming when they are happy. Except one smart girl depicted as a freak, obsessed with ugly boys and science. But this exhibition is very addictive. I don't know why, but it is. Although the last season has been so terrible, bringing stereotypes, boring plots and bad actions to extreme situations that I never thought about, I am no longer fortunate to be addicted.
