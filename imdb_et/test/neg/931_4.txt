First of all, Tsui Harki Zu Warriors (2001), which is visually groundbreaking, but not much in the hands of actors and writing departments, is now a film that is visually almost as good as Zu (though no longer groundbreaking), but is even worse for action and writing departments. It's really sad that the HK film industry seems to have almost no lack of action and writing skills. I think you need to understand Cantonese to understand how bad and vulgar the film dialogues are. It's like some criminals who talk on the street, it's so bad. To make it worse, the actors and actors themselves look like criminals and can't act even when their lives depend on it. I understand that this film should be a comedy directed at the younger generation in HK, but is HK young really so brain-dead that they can't judge anything like such a minor and vulgar action / writing? If that is the case, I am ashamed that I am from HK. <br /> <br /> I want HK filmmakers to learn some of the lessons learned by Zhang Yi-Mou or Ang Lee, and finally make a film that is both visually stunning and competent and mature, and writing. And stop using young singers / idols / heartbeats as actresses because they can't act for the many fans they have in HK!
