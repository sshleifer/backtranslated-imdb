This movie is from TRASH. First, it gives an overview of the season that took place for 16 years! Who cares? This film was deeper than the bottle cap. This makes a complicated person like Bob Knight's comic book character. <br /> <br /> Breathing doesn't bother me, but I'm still amazed that ESPN showed a film that was more passionate than Kevin Smith's film on the main cable channel. The F-word dropped at least 20 times before the first commercial break. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible and anyone involved should be embarrassed. I appreciate it at the same level as jaws IV - revenge, and everyone wins ... 2 movies in the Crapfest Hall of Fame.
