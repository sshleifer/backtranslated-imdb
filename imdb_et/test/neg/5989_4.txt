The best thing about Shrieker is the dialogue. Like Scream, and I know what you did last summer, this movie is aware of these types of horror movie conventions, and you can come up with some good lines and scenes that play with these conventions. Unfortunately, the Shrieker is just boring. The plot is your main ten small Indians with one monster under the control of suspects / victims. You know from the beginning that every character will hit until only the hero (s) is left to defeat evil. And that's what happens. There are no surprises or tensions. Production values ​​and action were ok, but I had no motivation to look to the end (although I did) because I already knew how the end scene was playing. The end result surprised me a bit, because it literally succeeded instead of throwing special effects. Perhaps the special effects budget was spent to the end.
