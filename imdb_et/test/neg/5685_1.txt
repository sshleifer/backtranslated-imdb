I have no idea what these people thought about making this movie. No plot, very limited action and what is the comment of the third person in the whole movie ???? Instead of riding on the planet to shoot at all these places, they would have had to spend money on script writing and actors. What worked there was bad. It was 90 minutes of my life, which I can never get back to. I should be billing the director for the cost of renting this movie. Please give up to the director and writers of this movie now. This film must have a sign on its front that prevents boredom. The only good thing you can say about this movie is the computer generation. This is OK because the generation is. This movie should never have a sequel .... ever.
