Chris Chan Lee attempts to debut his collection of "Yellow" debut of the Hollywood Asian-American imagination, leaving the usual stereotypes depicted in the usual film. In doing so, Lee makes a lot of horrible crime: he exaggerates his own American stereotypes to his disbelief. The result? Scary one-dimensional characters and an unprecedentedly low script trigger the cast over-regulation to crazy, ultimately resulting in a film that is physically painful to look at. <br /> <br /> Positive reviews collected by the "yellow"; everyone belongs to one of two camps. In one corner (eg imdb.com), you will find Asian Americans who are so alive that the Asian character can be displayed on the screen without the thick glasses and the book of mathematics, that they somehow forget Lee's end product idiot. On the other hand, you will find critics of the film who have simply assumed that it would be yellow to give the yellow a solid foundation that it deserves; After all, it is an Asian-American film made by an independent Asian-American filmmaker ... in a protected area. <br /> <br /> Case Study: The main character Sin Lee (Michael Chung). Writer / director Lee achieves monumental sound with Mon by editing "yellow" in such a way that Sin does not appear on the screen unless he hits or yells. See Blue Friend Support. Scowl. See Sin walk along the beach and animal. Scowl. (Cries out.) See Sin at your father's shop. Scowl. Look at Sin urination. Scowl. Look at Sin's breathing. Crazy, I don't know if Sin is full of Asian-American angs. Do you think? I'm not sure. Scowl. Just to be thorough, Lee introduces us to Sin's father, Woon Lee (Soon-tek Oh). Throughout the movie, when Sin just rubs or screams, Mr. Lee fucks * and * cries. In fact, this is the main role of Woon in the "yellow": simultaneous shifting and screaming. Gee, I don't know if Woon is an Asian father with complexity. Do you think? I'm not sure. Scowl. Yell. <br /> <br /> If Lee's one-dimensional characters don't irritate you, his story will speak. Meet Me (Mary Chen) and Joey (John Cho), two characters characterizing a movie that are only meant to turn a tangential and completely irrelevant love story into a movie. You see, Lee learned at the film school that every good movie must contain some love-related subtext and these two characters allow him to fulfill his duty. I and Joey's exceptionally uneven flirtation dialogue consists of one liner insults ending with a kiss: "Nerd!"; "Stupidhead!"; (total eyes); (smiley understanding); (you can kiss) <br /> <br /> But for sure there's somewhere there, Sin is glowing when it's all happening. <br /> <br /> The fact that Me and Joey do not contribute in any way to the film's plot will not surprise me as much as Lee has demanded the most hackneyed movie clichés to fill his unnecessary movies. And trust me, the flirting order is just the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, we find that Woon Lee is trying to explain his constant scourge and shouting to her girlfriend Teri (Mia Suh), which I am sure Lee had to be an embarrassing moment. What a surprise: when Woon refers to a metaphorical story of his homeland to illustrate his point, he hanged directly from Reader digest, his voice burst in this special paternal way. The camera puts Teri's shaking hand into a mandatory picture. We feel compelled to roll our eyes unless we understand that Woon's explanation doesn't make sense. But the lack of substance did not stop Lee making the film, so why not cut this ineffective scene? After all, the world can always use another cliché. <br /> <br /> Well, you say the film can be painful, but at least it must be a technical masterpiece - say, "What dreams can come. Unfortunately," yellow "also disappears technically. Lee's edits are inconvenient and disturbing what is a little film at all, but I'm sure Lee thought they looked like a hip. Even worse, every frame is either an under-exposure or an over-exposure. Although the light meter was invented in 1932, the new technology did not change the "yellow" set. br /> <br /> In the light of the film's total lack, the actor Burt Bolos, who plays Alex's best friend, is doing quite well, but although Bolos moves lightly, you can't really blame him if Lee's script consists only of shouting and screaming. the foundries, on the other hand, did not see any restrictions on their over-burning. <br /> <br /> I didn't see the movie as long as "yellow." And I really pray that I wouldn't see the film as halbana as ane "for some time. Please do not waste it; life is already too short. Thank you.
