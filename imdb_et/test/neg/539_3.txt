Well OK, I've seen Ninja anger. <br /> <br /> This is not something I would recommend to people who are not serious about Japanese fighting films. This is a kind of Japanese fight ninja film with a complex plot. It is these three old ninja schools that had these 3 "sorcerers swords". I saw a subtitled version (not recommended by the route, something is just missed) and I couldn't keep up with it. It had tough scenes, but in general it wasn't very pleasant for me.
