The director was probably still in his early stages when he tried his hand in Western countries. Look at stocks. Everyone seems to be well-cleaned, well-brushed, well-dressed, and well-ironing as if ready for the church. Even horses look groomed and shiny. It's the West that shouts out loud! It should be dusty, nasty and sweaty. And then this bird is a female amateur action. The whole lot, a dozen, all pretty and blessed, was just rape and widows, but hardly a tear. Instead, they all look with great interest (if not lust) in the newly arrived seven, who later eat, bind and love the bandits during the attacks. The same management criticism also applies to Lee van Cleef, who is doing a good good deal. Our Lee, who played the law, just lost his dear wife. But Lee, who is hard as an organic stone, does not show any emotion and finds himself within a few days after the death of her husband, with whom she and her family will go in the future. Cad. And then there is another thing that always disturbs me with this type of film: it doesn't matter how many dynamite-induced explosions occur in the middle of about 50 horse packages. Tracking on them, only killing dead and chewing are always in one piece. (I know ... silly moi ... it's just a movie ...). It's not the hardest western ever made, but prepare for a serious awakening.
