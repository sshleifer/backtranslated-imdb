I don't see what the whole movie is about this movie. Patricia Kaas sings yes, and it makes the movie charming, but the song isn't enough. I want to say that if you want to get all the benefits, buy a Patricia CD and enjoy! The plot is simple (if you dream); the main characters seem to love each other instantly and the other acquaintances immediately forget. Relationships seem almost "mandatory", and the little "detective story" thrown away makes things worse. What at first seemed to be the perfect end of the movie is first turned up and then comes out like a dream. I think about the movies, how well I remember them, and for that I started to forget the details.
