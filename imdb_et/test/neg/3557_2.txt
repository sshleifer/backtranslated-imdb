I watched this movie on the basis of this good review, and I'm not making that mistake again. <br /> <br /> The first few minutes show that a group of people are concentrated on some tragedy, but you don't see what it is. 12-hour recall and we see the dull life of every person that is ultimately meaningless to what is happening. When the end is finally reveled, you realize that you are just wasting one hour of your life, waiting for great profitability that doesn't happen, and doesn't mean something you're looking at. The only connection these people have is that they all have a "bad day" - but even that continuity is lost in boredom. <br /> <br /> If it were to be a "Crash" clone, it's a complete failure.
