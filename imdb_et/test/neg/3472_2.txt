For a good interception of the Roman Empire, see the great BBC-produced minisums "I, Claudius". It's just a miracle. It was pathetic and you saw almost looking at the camera. Hans Matheson was irritating. The cheese factor was so high that it promotes recurring constipation. Even Caligula was annoying. I think that such a film was quietly supported by "religious" groups that are not mentioned;). The manifestations of Christian favoritism and persecution were blatant when it gave clues. Stay away from whatever you do - running time is so long that I could read Harry Potter's first book faster than the time it took to look at it. <br /> <br /> Italy has done better - don't let Hans fool you. He's not a big actor ... he's a big cage.
