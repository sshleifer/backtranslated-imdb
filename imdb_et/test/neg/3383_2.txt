What is the absolute joke of the film. In this film, you would think Duel will meet Jeepers Creepers, who is a Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Three good movies in their own way and you think that using your plan, MM could not go wrong. Well, that's what I thought, and I was very mistaken! We follow two college students when they travel miles across the desert to reach the wedding. They pick up a girl (she can't get her clothes off), they get the bats hanging on Monster Truck, which they call the F ** kface (AKA Monster Man). <br /> <br /> The Monster Truck I testify is a very cool vehicle, but less than a halting chase without compromising its potential. <br /> <br /> So MM decides he has a little bit of mercy for these boys and chasing them a bit, they lose him for a while and stop at the bar full of amputee, then they go to the motel where lead character Adam sleeps hitch-hiker Sarah (though they both wear underwear!). They then catch up with the MM, take their home to where they flee from death and try to kill the MM but can't, so the order is set. Apart from a little "twisting", that's it. <br /> <br /> When can you get in the first 2 minutes? where Adam's friend Harley jumps at the back of Adam's car to try to frighten him, without explaining how Harley even got there, how long ago or how Adam couldn't even understand? without thinking you hate it, you can just enjoy this movie. It's a movie that's one of the 20 films that you never heard of. <br /> <br /> What is so irritating is that Blockbuster has so many bad-quality movies that some amateur film students take digitally, that's exactly what MM is like (although IMDb says this leader was born in 1961) . <br /> <br /> The action of this movie is cruel. The script that the writer is probably funny is irritating and childish. You get the impression that only one draft was started before you took the picture. In fact, the script is very scary and a lot of the movie seems to be improvised, filled with boring and fun conversations that are just funny or important to real people. Imagine you were filming yourself and your friends in a conversation, are the points funny? For you, but mostly it's a trash. This is the MM script. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it for gore? it is quite minimal and there are many better movies (Bad Taste, Evil Dead, etc.). <br /> <br /> Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2, even with their joy and holes in the plot, is a much better film. Compare with Jeepers Creepers intro Monster Man introduction and see what I mean.
