"Mame" is a shame for many things - Lucille Ball, a story that has been talked about several times more, and a musical genre at all. Mrs Ball does not understand her character at all, and she seems to be very relaxed. Bea Arthur is good, but that's not enough. Production is very dirty and inexpensive to look for, songs are the minimum parameters and almost every joke. Lucy was also unable to dance well, so the music had to be slowed down at the funeral rate. Avoid at all costs, but watch the adorable "aunt".
