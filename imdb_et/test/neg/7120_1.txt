All I can say about this movie is whether it's totally boring. The introduction to the film is probably the worst intro horror I've ever seen. I mean, the angry chick that strikes his head on his head is not at all scary, which I assume the director was trying for, but in fact it was "slightly" funny. <br /> <br /> Working in this picture was not pathetic; note to drivers when you make a horror movie, please hire some good actors, not some popular teenage soap stars who have no idea how to act. <br /> <br /> The death scenes of this movie were boring. .. no gore, and I'm sorry, but horror movies without gore or good intermediate control are just the roots. I mean, this girl can kill hair that is surrounded by her in the middle of Tokyo, and not one person can see it happen, they just proclaim her "lost", wow thats awesome! <br /> <br /> To sum up, if you and your friends want to see this movie, make sure you bring some sleeping pills because I guarantee you won't finish it. I and my friend went out because we don't care about what happened at the end. <br /> <br /> Greetings
