Calling this movie a decent or enjoyable horror is too optimistic. Heck, you can't even refer to it as a beautiful genre, because it's below average (it's funny, but not "haha-funny", but you know). For just a lot of trivia elements, by the way, all those people who complain about this movie in their comments are only guilty. If you see the DVD cover of this movie, you should already know that it doesn't come to the same level as the "piano", so don't complain later ... <br /> <br /> Evil Ed could have been anything but completely twisted. I think the main idea of ​​this film is criticism today of the terrifying "cutting committee" that shows Edward, who is slowly (well, not too slow) nuts, seeing violence and gore in all the films produced. The big boss is called Sam Campbell ... Funny, isn't it? urprise wasn't there. Anyway, this guy got rich when he made films called "Loose Limbs". They are characterized by (and I'm not kidding!) Scenes where a girl gets rape by BEAVER (?) And then she gets headed !!! Now, who says that horror is no longer original? <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe this whole whore and "open limbs", but it's really boring very fast. After a good first 25 minutes, Evil Ed will be completely boring and never recover. The only way to do that (after pressing the eject button naturally) is to look for obvious references to other, much better horror movies. I obviously saw shadows from Evil Dead, the silence of the Sheep Lambs, Braindead and many others. In Sweden. I'm convinced that there's a lot of talent, far from the bottom (for example, Denmark's "Nattevagten") ... but none of them gave Evil Ed's team or team. Only to see if you are stupid and you don't want to use your brain at all.
