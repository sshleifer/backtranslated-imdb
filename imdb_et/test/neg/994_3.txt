This is a bad excuse for the film. Busbee Berkeley movie noir? Please! First of all, let's forget about the plot, really simple thinking, the cynical tough guy became holy as the beautiful blonde loved. Jechh. So what makes her feel bad about her? Together with other groups, he helps the child to sink, because they all swim in the water tower and try to survive when the water is aired, occupying them. It's not exactly heroic, but he's suddenly beaten. It's really painful to look at Claude Rains, who is trying to portray a hard-bitten, harshly speaking, Noir-type police. Kroheline grimace is his main and rather pathetic means of action with a crumbling voice. Most of his energy seems to be trying to hide the intelligence that appears in all other roles. How he ever talked about doing this work, I never understand. Enjoy it for a while with details, old cars and gas pumps, but don't wait for a good movie experience. It wasted 1-1 / 12 hours of my life.
