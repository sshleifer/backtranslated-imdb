I saw this movie and thought it was a sleeping place. Sometimes I get into intellectual romantic movies. This movie didn't move me. I felt it was about one hour long. Camille is depicted as a very sympathetic sculptor who loses almost everything. I thought the whole movie was just sad and scared. If you like the tragedy, it should. I just thought it was too long, which means it has many unnecessary scenes that will eventually lead to about one hour of boredom. I don't recommend this movie. If you want to see a good romantic tragedy, look at Titanic.
