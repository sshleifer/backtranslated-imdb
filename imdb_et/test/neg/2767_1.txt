This movie really sucks. <br /> <br /> Just try to stay awake for 5 minutes when you look at this beautiful girl (Joan Woodbury) who is involved in the "underworld" because she needs money (and because she's too lazy to work with her friends when they offer it to them). Alan Ladd was supposed to be the star of this thing, but she hasn't found the first freaking for half an hour and when she appears, she's standing like a constipated mannequin. A real fool with enough spoken scenes and unlikely (as well as stupid) characters to let someone shoot as fast as you can. <br /> <br /> Bring the pillow.
