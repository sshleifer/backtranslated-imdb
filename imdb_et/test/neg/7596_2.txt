It was hit in many ways. Filming a location in Ireland, though sometimes pretty beautiful, can't be saved by forgetting the flick. Greg Evigan and Alexandra Paul, when the couple are trying to get married and who inherit the haunting mansion, are not just interesting signs. Paul, at the end of the film, becomes incredibly annoying and wants him to just close his mouth and close, because he seems to be screaming as if he had just become an Olympic event! The other problems associated with this film are odd segments that have nothing to do with the core of the film, such as the opening sequence with two clean women and a woman in bed with a broken hand that climbs her twisted, bare body. Although a woman is quite enough, it does nothing. One has left to think that the production team needs a short run and just throws on some cushioning and a bit of T and A. CGI's influence is also on cartoons and fiery financial tourists, who is a senior Roger Corman, a much earlier and much better film Usher's fall in all inefficient cheapness. With this small budget, all the attempts for real tension and skipping and hence chills were thrown out of the window. If you like Irish pictures, you can find something here, but you would make a travel offer for better rent or purchase. Leave it out if you are not discriminated against and think the plot is secondary. Rent another low budget ghost story (if you find it) called Woman Black and see how good and scary the film may be. It was a wasted opportunity.
