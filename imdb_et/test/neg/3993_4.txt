I was always confronted with the efforts of the Italian horror maestro Dario Argento as a producer with some suspicion and were only confirmed after I recently attended Lamberto Bava's terrible DEMONS (1985); The fact that it was supposed to be his third installment is not eligible at all, but I decided to rent the film, regardless of the fact that we are in full swing at Halloween. Did I check the Anchor Bay DVD Theater Trolley before viewing the main feature? Undoubtedly, the striking visuality has attracted me to be sure, but then the right film (which is no longer useful for what is presented in two minutes of assembly, and retrospectively shows that it has wisely aggregated most of its highlights) Probably let go! <br /> <br /> Open with promising medieval prologue from Alexander NEVSKY (1938), it will quickly go down because it relies too much on surreal images at the expense of narrative. Consequently, many symbols randomly take center stage? When an immortal man leads early to the dark forces, the despicable bishop (Feodor Chaliapin), which results in a mere red herring, a mysterious black priest who gradually heroic heroes, is the leading lady for any reason to be the victim of a deer (culminated in other cultists) Sexual Rite, which emerged too probably from ROSEMARY'S BABY [1968]) and a relatively impressive 13-year-old Asian Argento as a rebellious but pleasing sacristan daughter (who appears only at the end of survival). Incidentally, Elder Argento also wrote the story and scenario of the film with director Soavi and (pseudonym after appearing with Dario in the early stages of production) original Mr. Lamberto Bava and fruitful genre master Dardano Sacchetti (whom I met at the 61st Venice Film Festival in 2004) . <br /> <br /> The extremely confusing side of the movie will then see a group of people? including the inevitable teenage but also the failed English couple (whose constant beating is a funny punchline)? Similarly to a closed building in the hands of evil spirits (the church is a burial place for satanic culture), it is not that this outrage of horror is likely to dissipate the memories of Luis Bunuel's extremely surreal EXTERNAL ANGEL (1962)! Ultimately, the film is even more disappointing (although Sergio Stivaletti has an encouraging effect at least remarkable), since I had thoroughly enjoyed the only other Soavi title I watched. CEMETERY MAN (1994) by your own R2 SE DVD. Does that mean I'd still like to catch my debut file? STAGE FRIGHT (1987)? and Director Follow-Up to THE SECT (1991) ...
