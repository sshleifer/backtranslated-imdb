This movie was the worst film I've ever seen. It was a complete waste of money. Had I not been in the cinema, my two young cousins ​​(who thought it was disappointing, but not as terrible as I thought) would have left the cinema. There were two points in the film that I almost laughed at, but the rest was either boring, ridiculous or painful. I thought it would be all the looting of superhero films (which I love), but it was basically based on Spiderman, which had some slanting references to other superhero films like Fantastic Four and Batman. I can't really think of a good movie. Don't waste your money on this movie - there are many other better movies!
