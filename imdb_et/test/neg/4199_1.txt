No. Just NO. That's all you have to say. <br /> <br /> Summary: A casual boy is in a corn field. For some reason, I'm not sure, but it's his duty to run. Next big thriller? <br /> <br /> A five-year-old could make a better film that just filmed anthill or even grass. Seriously ..... <br /> <br /> You can't say that it has bad behavior because NOT TO DO. You cannot say that it has a bad writing because it has no writing. You can't say he has bad cinematography because there's no cinematography. You can't say it's a bad movie. If you don't believe me, look at it. Just don't say I've never warned you .....
