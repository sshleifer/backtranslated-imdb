This is the worst film I've ever seen. The story is a joke, the effects are terrible, the cinema does not match the tone of the film, the dialogue is cheesy, and the actors do a good job for the rest. People just don't do it in real life. My question is: Who finances this mess? <br /> <br /> The film begins where some miners fall on the mining shaft after they are not rescued by the fireman. Next, we will join some cyclists in the woods that drive bikes. One man falls and breaks his leg or something. The firefighter can help them. In the meantime, someone starts to fire. Still some bike stunts. Bla bla bla. <br /> <br /> I wasted my time. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie.
