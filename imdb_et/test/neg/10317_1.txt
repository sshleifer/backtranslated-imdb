My first warning should have been that this dvd was sold for $ 5.00. But since it was Sandra Bullock, who I generally like, I bought it. My disappointment with the film started almost immediately. Dialogues are slow and rigid. The color is distorted. I had the volume to listen to conversations. Action is amateurish. Even the scenes of killing have failed. Dead people died twice. When my money's inadequate daughter offered me a dollar to turn off the movie, I filled it immediately and gladly. This is an amazingly bad film. Tomorrow I'll give this DVD a company white elephant Christmas party.
