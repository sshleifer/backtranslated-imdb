This is a candidate for the worst films I've ever seen. It wanted to be as shocking as "The Silence of Lambs", but it does not have the style and intelligence mentioned above. Make-up is great, the actor is pretty good, but the story seems to be going on for years and the murders are so severe that they are more annoying than entertaining.
