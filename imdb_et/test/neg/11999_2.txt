Ladies and gentlemen, let us introduce you? Toltecs! This ancient Latin American tribe, even before the Aztecs, was said to have been the most malicious and bloodthirsty witches, but they got their asses with a couple of college floating and one-hundred-seven-year-old attorneys. But before that you can see that you have to fight through the boredom of over 40 minutes, the worship of toddlers and sliding sequences that do not contain the actual gap. If I have not yet made it quite clear: "The Dark Power" is an indescribably cheesy and intuitive 80s horror piece that still succeeds to be interesting because it is pure and somewhat charming. The writer / director Phil Smoot's intentions were obviously admirable, but he? as well as the rest of the cast and team? there was no talent and no money to offer something even decent. Smoot looked closely at "The Evil Dead" and other similar demonic themes, and somehow he had to think he could pull it out. The film opens with an old Indian man who dies in his isolated country house; barely say your last word over whisper? Toltecs. His grandson rents the house right now to college chicks, including the typically 80's aerobics babe, the cute black girl and the racist redhead gal. Soon they will discover why the old Indian lived like a hermit because he was actually the guardian of the old Toltec burial ground. Toltec's sorcerers buried themselves alive, but came back thousands of years later and lived in the living flesh. And frankly, is there better tasty meat than bimbos? As mentioned earlier, "The Dark Power" is terribly flat and sleepy in the first half. Classical worship, slow-down dialogues, and laughingly long Lash LaRue films that turn around their whips seem to go on. Then the film loses its smile of last confidence when Toltec's witches come out of the country. Instead of an accident, they look like hard stone stars with imbued masks and soldered gestures. At this point, it is worth mentioning one exciting moment when the boy's lips are stretched out across his skull, but in general, even the slaughterhouse aspect of this film is disappointing. The only far-off moments are totally pointless, like when a 9-year-old boy (named Cletus!) Is happy with his uncle's truck or a vulgar naked chick eating in a bath after processing. Seriously, if you don't turn on the western veteran of the 1940s, who is not confined to his whip, I would recommend skipping this movie.
