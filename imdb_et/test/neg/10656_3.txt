Man's love for an innocent child who finds that he has been wrongly formed and on the other side of the world is a low-centered "valley girl" who shares her date of birth with a big difference in both lives there. What a great and worthy story. But it speaks so poor about writing and / or redirecting the screen and / or editing it so that the story can be taken out of the joy of most. Linda Hamilton's character goes from the mother's understanding to the evil witch and back faster than the speeding month and for what purpose? Conflict, conflict, conflict, hat fall. Katie (California girl) and her boyfriend, Katie's mother and all, including the poor lady at the airport check-in, Lin's father, the most beautiful, most attentive person and her wife and biological son, all in constant conflict. I really wanted to enjoy a story of warmth, but the only thing that made me into SMILE was when all the hate and fight ended. There were too many inexplicable or illogical events many of which didn't add a story. My wife and I looked at each other and asked ourselves how such a good lie and what should be a great story could be so badly held.
