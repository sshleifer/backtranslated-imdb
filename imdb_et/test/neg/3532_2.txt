The stupid government tried to rebuild an inexhaustible and indestructible soldier and, of course, the experiments went awfully wrong, loading us with a half-man mutant who beats an awful lot and strikes like a little girl when he is upset. Lance Henriksen marks an honest scientist who immediately cut off the test when he heard it as a military project, but he returns (with the whole family with him) when he finds that his beloved guinea pig has been killed in a laughing gate. Mind Ripper is definitely an observable horror film, but it is very unnatural and has quite a lot of flat cliches that can be thought out (including alien father / rebellious teenage sons ... yawn). The characters are like wooden dolls, stupid things are spoken and done and there is a totally pointless dream ... coming to a monster! There are a handful of interesting gory scenes to enjoy and some isolated desert places are actually eerie. Lance Henriksen is always enough, although it is one of the lower productions he celebrates, and Giovanni Ribisi certainly earned a better film to make his debut. For some reason, this anonymous thriller in the 90's is also known as "The Hills Have Eyes Part 3". Is it because it deals with members of the same family who are being terrorized in the desert? Is it because Wes Craven was once again involved as a producer this time? Or maybe it's because the monster gets the bare end in the same way as in 1977. Who knows ... Who cares? Wes Craven probably funded this project because his son wrote the script together and he is always moving to discover that your offspring are equally untalented as you are. Not recommended!
