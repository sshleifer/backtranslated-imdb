I don't understand how this picture was allowed. For the most part, if not completely, it is so inaccurate that the main character does not even resemble the way physically sees him in history. This movie made me go online and go through my books to make sure I remember Nero's personality correctly. For God's sake, I have a book that lists Nero as the world's worst man and made me feel bad. I have to say that the character of Aggrapina seemed to me both physically and psychologically. While all the makers did a good job, this movie was terrible, and I'm not sure I won't see what this unfortunate team did.
