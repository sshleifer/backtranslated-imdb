In 1993, Sega published a boring, incomplete video game of one of the greatest films ever. Quickly realizing their mistake, they tried out the second version of the game, claiming it was bigger, tougher and better. <br /> <br /> Neither of them was. Both were slow, boring games. <br /> <br /> You can choose either Dr. Alan Grant or ... Raptor. Both have their own problems. Why should Dr. Grant destroy all those military boys (what they do in this game)? And why does Raptor kill other Raptors? Weird. <br /> <br /> Of course, Sega did not manage to learn the first issue of the ball from the original release and the so-called Rampage Edition. One of the slower, slower, and stupid platforms I've ever played.
