The blood and chocolate of the movie is not like a book. The plot has changed completely and everyone who has chosen the choice to read the book. First, the girl is not an introvert. Aden is. Vivian was the one who took Aden. His mother had to live and be after Gabriel. Astrid was the one who did all the killings with Rally's former Vivian. Gabriel is not old. She's old looking. And Aden didn't end up with Vivian, Gabriel. The title came from Vivian, where he compared Aden (sweet like chocolate) and Gabriel (delicious as blood) kisses. He chose blood because he promised more and he understood him more. It reminds me that Gabriel is not against people like in the movie. He just avoids their proximity because they have hurt him in the past. Really, this book is much better than film. But if you want to see running, dating and lots of jumping. Then this is the movie to see.
