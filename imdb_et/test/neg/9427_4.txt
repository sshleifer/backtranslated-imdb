Anonymous movie that could have been guided by anyone at all. Where is Anthony Mann, the leader of such classics as "El Cid", "naked spur" or "Laramie man"? <br /> <br /> There are wonderful pictures of airplanes in the clouds, lovingly filmed. The story is very tricky, and almost completely without dramatization. The couple lives in a nearly routine life and the user who complains about June Allyson's choice for a woman, IMHO, totally remains her less As an attractive appearance, his harsh voice, he was the perfect housewife in the necessary scenario. At that time, women were barefoot and pregnant: there are no women among the basic staff, even at the table all they had to do was worrying about the hubs who fought for democracy and the enemy whose name we never heard, but in 1955 it wasn't hard to guess. <br /> <br /> One wonders why a young person who has never seen a Mann movie should choose one of the great movies.
