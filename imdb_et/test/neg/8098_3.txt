When a group of businessmen begins to die in the presence of a mysterious Mr Coulomb, the case is assigned to the FBI agent Dick Martin. As deaths continue, Mr Martin is clearly not making much progress. At the end of the movie, there is a strange truth that I am not publishing here. <br /> <br /> Users commenting on other users "This is a classic movie and it should be ENJOYED and not picked". I am sorry, but I must respectfully respect this opinion. It is "classic" only if it is old, not in any way of its quality. I've enjoyed a lot of low-budget "B" movies around this time period, but it's not one of them. <br /> <br /> Acceleration is unbearably slow, the camera's work is more blissful, most of the show is pretty clean (even in my opinion, Lugosi's not big) and the plot, although it's an interesting assumption, seems very difficult to follow .
