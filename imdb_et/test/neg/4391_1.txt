This movie is really painful. Not only did you laugh once, I got a serious headache. Sometimes I felt so sorry for the parties involved. The best way to summarize this is to note that among sex lovers it is probably the least funny and the least sexy. I only regret that I cannot give less than one vote. Giving such a rating is an insult to any movie that appreciates two or better. <br /> <br /> Now I see they are filming sequel. Listening to the fact that someone is actually paying for a second movie for those people convinces me that there is too much money in Hollywood. OUT OF THESE TAXES !!! Continuing this film can be a crime against humanity; perhaps an international court or sanctions against filmmakers should be convened. <br /> <br /> In short, it's really a bad movie. Really really.
