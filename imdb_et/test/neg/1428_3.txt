Strangeland is a terrible horror / technological thriller. Dee Snider plays Carleton Hendricks, a nasty computer gateway that talks through young girls in chat rooms. His ridiculous philosophies about pain and suffering are both erroneous and totally unfounded. The ideas presented in this film are not related to reality, rather Dee Snider has sat down and tried to think of the most wonderful things that can be done to impress horror and perhaps some of his old fans, but the end result is just terrible. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, as a spooky fan, it is very good on the cover of this movie and it immediately hit my interest, which is the main reason why I was seen. I assure you that this is not a high-quality horror film. This is a worrying but boring attempt to show what could go on in the minds of those who treat themselves to Carleton Hendrics in this movie. The sad part is that nobody does it himself. Marilyn Freakin 'Manson doesn't even go so far, and the fact that he had a song on the soundtrack makes it clear that the movie wasn't meant to entertain the type of music (it would snider itself)), it's more like Dee Snider tried to die from his career and himself once again as an ill person. Dee, it looks like it's time to let him die ...
