I had noticed that this movie had been a lot in Cinemax lately, so I decided to watch it this morning. I had just finished infiltration, which is a great movie, and I thought it seemed good. According to the description, the cable was at least. This movie was terrible. It's slow, the pace is terrible, it seems to last for 4 hours. There is no real plot to speak ... agh! How can anyone say something good about this movie? Rickman is good ... but he's always ... the other two characters work fine, but there's no real story to support. After 2 hours and you're sitting there, I wondered what was going on on the ground, where the ground is on the ground - it ends up with a surprise that, frankly, is sick to me. Don't bother about that.
