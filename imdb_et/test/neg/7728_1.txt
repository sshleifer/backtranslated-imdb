I have not had the opportunity to watch the previous film, but what I have read in other posts was worse than that, although I doubt it is possible. I am a big fan of the "Zombie" genre and I have psychological aspects of fascinated beings that are human for all purposes and purposes, only fears worthy of just shooting. That means HOTD 2 takes the "Zombie" movie into a new low. <br /> <br /> Without big spoilers (which I should do just so that you don't bother wasting your movie's actual viewing time)) I would like to express my total contempt for how the writers of this film represent the special forces of our countries. Gomer Pile could probably have lived longer than the "Spec Ops" soldiers. To call out loud, they should have called them a special educational power. If you intend to write a script where you send an elite group to deal with the outbreak of zombies, at least be soldiers smarter than the walking corpses. I understand that you have to kill some or most of the crew, but you will find better ways to do this by putting them off your machine guns and strolling to put a gentle hand on the burning mad man's shoulders, who will turn back and forth in the dark, horrible basement of the basement. <br /> <br /> The writers are actually trying to take the whole zombie thing to a high-tech level, turning it into a virus they are looking for, and this idea has been earned if it wasn't in the middle of such a ridiculous movie-making pointer. I mean fire, zombie movies aren't exactly "high art", and the viewer looks for some language and excitement with gore and excitement, but HOTD 2 is a type of cheese that puts you in the dowry of the channel and the stupidity of the characters of fear. If you're a zombie movie fan like me, please do yourself a favor and stay away from it.
