Although not a big fan of the Coen Brothers, I am a fan of their dark humor films such as Fargo and Miller Crossing. I have been much less impressed with their second comic mode, goofy-camp (or is it Camp Goofy?) Unfortunately, "Oh brother, where are you?" belongs to the latter category and is not as good as "The Big Lebowski" or "The Hudsucker Proxy". <br /> <br /> 'O Brother' is basically an episodic series of in-angels that doesn't have much points. nor all so much humor or intelligence. As most reviewers have pointed out, is the plot plot very loose? and as far as I could say, completely arbitrary? based on Odyssey. His main character, Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), is the "adventurer", as the namesake of his homerite, and his "real" goal is to return to avoid the marriage of his wife Penny. Of course, we do not think this is exactly what Clooney / Ulysses really wants, until the end of the care. And what Homer has to do with "Cool Hand Luke" chain tangles, Ku Klux Clan meetings "Indiana Jones" cultural events, loose lawyer vocabulary, talent for blue grass music, link to Baby Face Nelson, Clark Gable's beautiful hairstyle and other casual and diverse traits and meetings ? I will leave it to the attention of others. <br /> <br /> The reference to Preston Sturges' 'Sullivan's Travels' in the' O Brother 'title is just as meaningless. Yes, viewers who are familiar with Sturges' small screw comedy classics may be somewhat satisfied with recognizing the name of a socially conscious depression film, Sullivan, giving up Hollywood and making comedy hope. And they can even be somewhat amused by a couple of hit / scene reefs (eg jumping freight wagons and chain gang shuffle to watch a movie). But what? Coen's brothers do not seem to be in any way adding art-artistic interests to a critical discussion of moral gravity over the function of art. Obviously, they belong to a former school, but it does not seem to point to the slightest. Is that a respect? If so, why? I like the postmodern pop culture reference and textual game, as far as the next person is, but it is much more beautiful if it means something at least tonically, if not thematically, consistently? and not just arbitrary mixing. <br /> <br /> This scenario is just a foolish confusion. The only consistent and constantly pleasing element is the soundtrack of folk music. It's not much related to Homer or Preston Sturges, but, considering the rest of the movie, it's probably good. On the other hand, I would recommend using the price of access to the audio line CD.
