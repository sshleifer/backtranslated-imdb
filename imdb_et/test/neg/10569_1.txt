It's terrible! It's like someone gave the child a faulty camcorder and $ 30 and said he was making a movie. Even then, get a better and more professional movie. The story is so stupid that you can say one is not. I do not believe that the man who did it knew what to do at all - watching movies of foreign art throughout the day is not enough to make someone an immediate director. Action is very bad, really kindergarten level and writing is just terrible. The only scene I hated was where the caravan was, but even that means it was just a bit creepy than the rest of the movie. How can people finance this money? I don't mind alternative movies, but should they at least be a big steaming man? I would call "Milk Price" an amateur if it wasn't an insult to the amateurs. It wouldn't even be a good movie if you were drunk or stunned!
