This film is very scary for scenes where the devil uses Gabriel to open the sky and pulls out good angel dogs and sees them in Alkatraz. The devil sings and dances for a couple of songs of bad joy and at one point eats a living rat. <br /> <br /> We got this movie with pizza for free. You get what you pay for.
