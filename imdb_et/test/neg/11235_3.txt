So when Bob and Marion Boxletter see a man at the hotel, Marion believes his long-lost brother Brian, but when he approaches him, there seems to be someone else with the same face. Marion is able to retrieve his fingerprints and take it to the police, and once his identity is confirmed, his brother Brian and Bob had left New York after following his whereabouts. They get stuck in Brian, but they don't know what they're talking about, but all couples want to know where Brian has his 8-year-old 9-year-old son Joey ... and even when they see Joey don't know them too . The thickening of the plot and they find themselves one day thinking that they are someone else. The experiments that were done on people only to make a perfect assassin, but the question of why they were putting Bob and Marion in the same building as each other. Personally, Gregory Harrison played his 2 parts perfectly, but I have no idea what was wrong with the other participants, they felt bored and lost. Of the 10 out of 10, a little, yes, but that's it.
