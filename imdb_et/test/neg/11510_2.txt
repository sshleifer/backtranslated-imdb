For the first time, I saw the commercial time for this show when my sisters watched Kim Possible film. Trade was shown by Sadie and her friend who talked about the meaning of the word. This is one of the most stupid ads I've ever seen. Basically, they go back and forth like "Nothing is so, so technically nothing is nothing,". When I saw it, I thought it would be another flat Lizzie Maguire by Disney. But I had no idea how bad. <br /> <br /> Fast forward about 3 weeks when my sister turns to T.V. Sadie, of course. What I saw was one of the most unintentionally fun exhibitions I've ever seen. How did it go? Something like this: <br /> <br /> Sadie, a vegetarian, is incredibly unhealthy, an obsessive breakthrough in a very monotonous, and poorly-acted out of Owen. For some reason, his friend Margret decides that Owen should be "tested" to see if he is as good as he looks. What exactly do these tests cover? Well, one thing they do puts their laptop on a cockroach. Why? So he can be nervous and ask his monotonous knight to get it out in bright armor. Because if he tears it, he means he is steadfast and does not believe that the mistakes, as Sadie puts it, are also "innocent animals". THEIR CHALLENGES AND PESTILANCE! RECOMMEND THAT! But of course, Owen brushes it out of the window and Sadie is still in love. But that's not all! Margret says she has to be challenged once more. This includes pulling sharks into pants (yes, you read this right) and walking to buy her to see if she sees her big bun. Predictably he doesn't notice, and we see Sadie in his bizarre and strange laptop world. Sadie decides that she wants to be with Owen forever, raise her family, and when she says it, "lives like a tree with their family". It's just wrong. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: This is the strangest, craziest exhibition I watched. For those who want funny things to joke, you love it. Someone else, leave it in the show.
