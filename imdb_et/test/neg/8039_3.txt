The great war is interrupted and the father is a brave pilot who goes through to bring Jerry to his place. Mummy is doing her sister, so five children are evacuated to their horrible uncle in a country where a secret passage leads them to the mischievous sand fairy and the beginning of a magical adventure. <br /> <br /> Based on the century's best written book, they no longer make such stories. And there's a reason. Men fly airplanes and book books; women exchange ties and clean house. Boys run their compass and coat at night; girls do what they say and play violin - badly. Fat kids who wear specs are nasty. All of the children speak of the truncated, vivid accents that are soppy and prim, but what a certain English economic class grows. The seemingly and longing for the Imperial Albion is a plot of holes that five years old cannot tolerate. I mean, literally - my son asked why his father disappeared before sunset, why the compass did not disappear from his hand. The film tries at least to have children until Eddie Izzard (a waste of true comic talent) is a totally inappropriate and uncomfortable monologue playing on final credits. <br /> <br /> Two percent of British schoolchildren who go to expensive state schools in the UK find that this is all such a cheerful spirit. The remaining 95 percent of British families who are no longer living in the 19th century are good news for Wall-E, Ratatouille and Wallace and Gromit are all on DVD.
