After the success of Star Wars, there was interest in Sci-Fi films. It was one of those cheap events in cash fast. <br /> <br /> A group of survivors from spacecraft to the ground where stop-motion dinosaurs live, half of whom are systematically killed (people are not dinosaurs). Porn movie level. Cheap special effects, even for a while, although they seem to have been struggling. <br /> <br /> Costumes were pure 1970s, as were hairstyles. Ahh, 70s. I expected the disco to leave at any minute. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie really suggests.
