One of my friends gave it to me, thinking Peter Fonda was playing this, it can't be bad. ERROR! It's bad because everything can be. There's so much laugh and it's not jokes. For example, in one scene, Hawken walks through the forest and when he comes out, he suddenly wears a completely different outfit! Where was the "director" brain when he shot this scene?!? Probably the same place was for Fonda when he gave his consent to the flick. It's really disgraceful to see that this exquisite actor rubs in this poor movie for apology. <br /> <br /> Nobody can be an example in this movie. Jack Elam is brought just to bring the stars here, but everything he does is awaiting a very dark and terrible scene in a bar. Not to mention the "Indians", the girl was as good as she wanted to kill her and quit the mine. If I could give it, I would. It is a shame that there is no sign here. It recalls bad jokes or amateur shots that have been made just for fun. This should be a proof of how bad B-movies will be.
