When I first saw this example, I thought to myself "What is this !!!!!" One of them shows where there is a perfect counterfeit high school world with stupid problems that are considered "big". Then there is Sadie. It's a complete confusion for her friends and her family. He's totally obsessed with the nature that it's not a bad thing, but he compares high school students with animals! like what it is! they also made him another Lizzie Miguire clone (yes, because the world definitely needs one more!) It's also very perfect, like most of the TV girls that make me sick! So please, it is stupid to show that it makes no sense to just skip if you didn't like Lizzie McGuire or other such shows.
