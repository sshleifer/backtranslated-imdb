Ed Gein, one of the most famous serum killers of the time, was inspired by famous film-makers like Norman Bates, Leatherface and Buffalo Bill. He's also one of the most sick and disturbing killers of all time, I watched him in a documentary, so I know his story pretty well. When I saw it, I was curious because I thought it was supposed to be like a documentary, but I have to say it was just a pathetic waste of time. First, the facts are totally wrong, some minor exceptions, and secondly, it was just a stupid Hollywood story when these terrible murders really happened and they just made it cheap. Not to mention that if they were going to make this horror movie, it worked badly! Ed Gein, he lives in a small town of Wisconsin called Plainfield, but he has a little secret that the whole city has come through, he digs dead bodies and also cruelly murders people. Vice President Bobby is only obliged to get Ed Ge, no one knows who the killer is in the beginning, but found the crime position after the crime scene. But things become "personal" when Ed starts preaching with the police family and friends. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie was just a ridiculous and completely offensive story. I have always thought that bad behavior is a necessary tool for a horror attack, but it would have been a better film for this story, not to mention that it should have been more of a documentary than a stupid clich√© movie. Please leave this movie away, it's totally pathetic and incorrect about Ed Ge's story. <br /> <br /> 1/10
