Mount Godwin-Austin (otherwise known as K2) is the second largest mountain in the world, and if the evidence presented in this film is to be believed, the most difficult mountain to successfully climb without being killed. "K2" is basically a girlfriend set for a breathtaking dangerous mountaineering world. While outdoor photography takes some truly awesome scenery, the characters stand in front of all these glorious landscapes in a crashing drill - and there lies the mistake of the whole film. <br /> <br /> Cocksure lawyer Taylor Brooks (Michael Biehn) and his quiet married friend Harold Jamieson (Matt Craven) spend free time on rock climbing. During one trip, they meet another set of climbing tools, funded by wealthy mountain joy Philip Claibourne (Raymond J. Barry). The Claibourne team is trained in the famous K2, the mountains that Taylor and Harold both love to solve, but can never afford it. During the training, two Claibourne teams will kill in the avalanche. Taylor and Harold presented themselves as possible substitutes. Despite the initial reluctance, Claibourne gives them approval and the couple finds themselves joining the Himalayas with their team. Harold's wife, Cindy (Julia Nickson-Soul), is disappointed that her husband is taking such a dangerous climb, especially since he has recently become a father. The tension on the climbing team track, as Taylor has repeatedly encountered with another member of the group, is equally striking and arrogant for Dallas Woolf (Luca Bercovici). In the meantime, Claibourne itself is growing more and more sick when it takes the body to pay for the disease. Do the boys reach the top of the K2 or are they trying to put an end to frustration or even death? <br /> <br /> "K2" has spent quite some time introducing its somewhat unpleasant characters. Biehn is an unlikely oral cavity, an adventurous and adventurous type is especially difficult, like Barry as a millionaire climbing a hard nose. But on the other side of the coin, Craven is so bored that it is hard to believe that his wife could give him a damn to climb K2 - he's better than never to come back! Rounding the main characters is Bercovici, whose characterization of Dallas Woolfina is the same campy and over-the-top as every other role he ever played. The story itself is completely taming and disposable? just a simple yarn for boys trying to reach the top of the hill. There's some male bonding, but the whole Harold and his wife's sub-block is zero, and the personality clashes between Taylor and Dallas are totally wrong. "K2" evaluates some of its achievements only on the basis of Gabriel Berastain's stunning cinematography? In the Himalayan queues, the range and awe of the mountains are pretty beautiful. I'm totally critical of Kim Newman who violently wrote in the Empire magazine: "On this evidence, K2 climbing can't be harder than sitting through it!" Quite True, Kim, quite true!
