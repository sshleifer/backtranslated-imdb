COC had its moments. I enjoyed the action sequences, but I despise the scenario and plot. I hate this movie so much, I just write a stupid part. First, the plot would never happen. Secondly, the Chinese President's darkness was not asked. It would never happen. Finally a dialog. The use of non-Chinese actors to play Chinese roles is understandable, but writing a dialogue for them is a FULL POI! For those who understood Chinese in the film, you know what I mean.
