Mummy's curse is the last in the series of Kharis mummy films and it seems that creativity was somewhat dry at the time it was created. Kharis and his companion Ananka arrive at the bay of Louisiana and, with his resurrection, he is looking for his beloved princess. How they can't get to Louisiana is not completely clear, but with different people trying to find them, the viewer can be confident in the murder of a grandma. nothing special. I felt the whole movie I saw earlier. Frankly speaking, except for the original Mummy with Boris Karloff, the mummy movies are not my favorite among the old universal horrors. They are not bad, but they get a little repetitive. <br /> <br /> There are some great scenes in the movie (ie Ananka will come to live for example), but generally it wasn't much for me. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing if you want to be perfect and see all the mummy movies, but otherwise you can pass it on.
