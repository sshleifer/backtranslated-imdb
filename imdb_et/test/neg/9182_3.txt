this comic is not right lol, I disagree with the many things he imagined, but it ended with a positive comment, but for me and for me, we do not look at it in our household mainly because we fight stereotypes every day and this comic is just confirmed what most white people feel black people like <br /> <br /> comment one little black girls made by cartoon was that his boy was so aware (he was white) that really offended me that there is nothing we Black people take lightly consciousness, a situation where black people understand their true ability
