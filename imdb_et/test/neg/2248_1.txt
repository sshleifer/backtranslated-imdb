This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this movie? A number of Americans enter the Nazi occupied France and begin to kill the Germans. You see they burn their enemies and kill them with baseball bats. Of course, joking. <br /> <br /> Some say this movie is a parody of a particular genre. It's not funny or funny for a parody. Content is zero. It is extraordinarily brutal and nasty. Below is a subtle political message because it is again the "good guys" who kill the "bad Nazis". The whole plot is unthinkable when you turn it around. Could you imagine that the Nazis would kill everyone in the Warsaw ghetto with flame burners? Probably not, but this film is exactly the same, except that it satisfies the strange moral expectations of a certain audience: killing is as cool as the right people do. because of the hidden Nazi ideology below. It does not consider the enemy to be human. And if the latter should be a fun part, I'm happy to say that this fun always remains a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> The second secret is how this type of violence is the crowd of the United States, while a little nudity they are amazing. But if the naked body is pornography, it is all the brutal film of pure pornography in the worst way.
