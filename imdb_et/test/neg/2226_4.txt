Warner Brothers social responsibility with the toughest hand, sermoning every five minutes or how we are Americans, we don't run into trouble, we face our responsibilities. It also indicates that if you are ready to protect your family from clearly dead gangsters, you are an American. Looking bored, Walter Huston is a frustrated DA and "middle American family" includes familiar faces like Sally Blane (looking much like Sister, Loretta Young) and Dickie Moore, supposedly a divine mop. Both things have been regularly pulled out by Chic Sale, just the 47's, but they play the octogenarian civil war veteran, jumping and jumping into the language and morals of how we Americans dag nabbit. His St Vitus dance old coin performance is a tiring schtick; it's like Walter Brennan, based on his entire career. William Wellman manages efficiently and quickly, like his earlier "Public Enemy", but he and the screenwriter ignore what is happening to this family after a happy fadeout, ie Mob.
