In fact, I just joined this site about this movie. I was sitting in my living room and this movie came to a local channel. I did it about an hour before I just had enough. Curious to see what the general public view of the film was about this film. I was totally shocked to see that there were a large number of people who thought it was great. I had to say, and here it is: this film is an absolute garbage. It was sitting out. "Jokes" were one of the best performances and movies in a unique rhythm, and the Leguizamo manic image of this unpleasant character should only be ten years old and below. It can actually be a stretch for even that age. I'm all ridiculous, but not even the weakest mindset. I have an idea to promise to take bad uninspired obvious jokes and play them twice as fast. It's funny now. Ha. Ha. <br /> <br /> Films you should see that you take foolish humor and add comic timing and originality: Marx Brothers Night Opera, Monty Python Life Meaning, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, ... and the list goes on. Don't lose an hour and half of your life with an unemorable crap. By the way, I can only assume that the reason why David Bar Katz (another writer) made very little film after this movie is because he was instantly blacklisted. I really have the impression that Leguizamo was able to recover after that.
