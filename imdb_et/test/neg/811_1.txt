Founded in 1945, Skenbart follows an unsuccessful editor of Swedish books that decides to stop Berlin. Unfortunately, there is a catastrophic disaster around him, which causes loss everywhere. There is also a man and his lover on the train who kill a man's wife (who is also on the train), a soldier home, two gay gentlemen, an angry train driver, two nuns, a number of refugees and even more people. <br /> <br /> Designed to be a noir-ish thriller mix (that's pretty well - at least in the beginning) and comedy, both movies don't work. It doesn't sit right because the film changes the tone of each new scene. And when the train travels to its final destination, the film becomes stranger and ends with a truly surreal. <br /> <br /> A good bit is wasted with lots of meaningless plots and characters. Skenbart is packed with famous Swedish actors, no matter how small it is. It seems that the filmmakers called everyone they ever worked on and offered them a part of the film. Too bad that the performances are as bad as the script (do your work - don't read them!). <br /> <br /> Comedy is more or less sloppy, the same joke is repeated over and over again. Time is from time to time (quite often) slow slow, especially by dragging about ten minutes without good reason. It also seems that the scriptwriter thinks that swearing is a good way to replace a proper dialogue. The film looks good, moody B&W, but it wastes such inert filmmaking in every other department.
