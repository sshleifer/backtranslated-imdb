This movie is like many biopilot movies I've seen: formal, exaggerated, badly acted, and most importantly, too early. <br /> <br /> What I mean is the film filmed and an issue that has been incited before Michael Jackson gave his child a rebellion of testimony, which I thought was one of Jackson's most important lives and careers. This would probably have made this a big end to this docu-drama. But this film already bites more than it is able to chew, too much detail in the cramped project. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that Michael Jackson has so far led the musician's most interesting life. not to mention the modern pop star and his story probably takes six to say exactly what music is. This movie tried to talk too much for three hours and it goes without saying that it failed. <br /> <br /> Flex Alexander did what he could play with Jackson, but he came more like an SNL caricature. Tim Meadows and Amy Poehler. Certainly it would be quite difficult to find someone who exactly represents Jackson without meeting the methods of the pop king and his insanity. However, the roof budget may only depend on what they see in tabloids, and may not provide a precise representation. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the director's effort to make Alexander look like Jackson is completely silly. The Caucasian makeup on Alexander's face makes him a rather opposed minstrel show, and anyone who has been in the grocery store knows that Jackson's nose is not as big as Alexander. I also find it amazing that the film documents Jackson with a knife to get cosmetic surgery, but on the next scene, Alexander has the same nose. Such a halt to the uncertainty that the director expects will not be able to keep the television viewers in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> It was even more annoying than the actual Michael Jackson movie material (ie, the time when his baby's baby over the balcony in Germany) was in real time. It was nice to try, but it just didn't work. <br /> <br /> If this movie, if it is released into theaters, would only make a profit because of its stickiness. It's even comparable to "Mommie Dearest" and says a lot. Above all, it was a film that was apparently rushed, like many TVs that aren't in HBO. It could have been much better than just talking about one aspect of Jackson. Even if it covered only the allegations of torture of children, it would probably be much better and would have been even more intriguing.
