I recently watched this movie because I'm a big Kinski fan. But, my God. Don't do me wrong. I love this guy. But in this movie all his act is just a refusal to work! But fortunately he's not the only guilty. First of all, the complete story is completely weak, with regard to the army looking for the murderer, while Kinski has been detained for a crime he did not. That is all. All the dialogues and characters are so bad that it screams you. But maybe it's all fun. If you know the Kinski biography, it is obvious that Kinski was not interested in these films at all. Especially all of his Italian-Western roles. He just took the money and it was. again, this whole movie is completely strange. Only for genre hardcore fans.
