These films shook my will to live, why this abomination is not the bottom 100 list I don't know. <br /> <br /> My life was saved by the healing power of danny trejo. <br /> <br /> The worst movie ever, I dare to watch. It's like a 90-minute call, but much worse. I rather look at a blue screen that is so bad
