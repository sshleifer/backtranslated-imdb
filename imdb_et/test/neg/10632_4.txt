I'd say it's a background film. Play it as a background when you tend to be busy (lingerie, email checking, etc.). I thought it was a movie that was made before Amy Adams was successful after Enchanted. Wrong! It was done in 2009! The scenario / script is quite terrible. I love musicals, but singing is just average and doesn't move the plot. Ughh. This seems to have been done on film based on film art. Do I watch TV shows? <br /> <br /> Even the secretary breaks the song. What's f @ # $ going on?! In fact, he seemed to have the best voice. Amy Adams was so big in Enchanted. The main participant is the average. Disappointed for sure. This movie would have been a lifetime, but that's it. (
