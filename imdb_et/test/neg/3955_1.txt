Not only does Frankie Muniz speak too quickly to understand (Malcolm's downside?), This film can't be intimidating. There was a story about the "Countess" and its surrounding history, but there is no connection between the plot and many side plates. Plot Summary: Assassination of spirits through victims through video games. Toss in some blood sprinkling and special effects and you have another bombardment to have a horror flick. The ghosts of the ghost resemble too many "Ring Two" ghosts. The behavior and constant and dramatic change of all emotions is incredible. Save your money.
