This film looked like the excluded scenes in high school film class. It didn't make sense! It worked fine, but I only felt sorry for these stars because they had to appear on this slop. Aliens machines were created in the absence of Pentium I technology and creativity, these were crabs! The illuminated and barely seen foreigners were frisbee with their feet. WHERE ARE THE HIGH? Director / Writer / Producer / Make-up Artist / Gripper Latt Editing Jumps All Over, Some Scenes Repeat. Most seemed to be filmed after Hurricane Katrina. The next time Latt wants to make a movie, somebody must hit him. In 2005 alone, he produced 11 films! It does not include writing, editing, directing or credits for visual effects. If the rest are such tatt-loads, he just makes us joke. It was a filthy sum of Spielberg's movie, nothing more. I look forward to Latti "BackBroke Ridge", "X-Man IIV", "Hillocks on Eyes".
