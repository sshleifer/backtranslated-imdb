Just listen to Broadway's cast album and the votes of Barbara Harris and John Cullum, who admire the excellent Lerner and Lane scores. Then, looking at the fresh fresh picture, watch the movie with Streisand Streisand and Yves Montand, who read their rows with such a heavy French accent that the chainsaw couldn't cut it. The best part (for those who are waiting for something) is what Montand is heading to in the introductory part of the song. Listen when he sings / says: Can any of us be angry or wonder what a magician and a voodoo magic soul can do? (The fact that one part of the problem comes from choosing the "stars" of the musicals of the film instead of the appropriate talent for different roles.) I just see Rex Harrison entering this scene and suggesting that Montand could also learn to do justice to the beauty of English. <br /> <br />
