I'm not kidding: this movie has a scene where the hobo hits his head in a tunnel with a headline and explodes (without a fireball) a million pieces! It made me fear of the child! ... on a G-rated movie! <br /> <br /> This movie can convince children that Santa is EVIL! His helpers are ugly, misanthropic, up and mean! When Santa Claus (here is Satan's anagram) appears, all 200,000 elves begin to sing "Santa Clause arrives in the city" as if it were a Druid war song. Then, the object of this movie "Rosebud" (jingle bell, whispering clues as to why you can't hear it ring,) appears the old Saint Nick, which looks like stoic Donald Sutherland, his face glowing like Moses "K10C- st ". When we hear him, his thunderstorm sounds less than a cheerful old elf, and more like James Earl Jones's voice slowed down by about 20%. br /> <br /> Syrupic music is inappropriate, boring, and repetitive; it does not follow emotional threads (such as the very effective point of "Titanic"). without creating the feelings of heat and magic, partly because it does not match the image of the film, the musical train wreck (not provided), where a failed, symphonic score hits a suddenly happy, childish POLKA title on locomotive, which makes the whole sound of the film so as it was rushed to production. <br /> <br /> With some other reviewers, how ... well "dead" everyone can see. It seems sometimes small. The technique of capturing the movement is good that the sequences of the Roller Miners trains like Kings Island would look far from convincing, but close, would have had to use "real" participants. In general, beautiful candies are in front of the TV but not much else.
