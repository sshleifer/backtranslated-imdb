Here in Australia, Rodanthe nights are introduced in the same class as a laptop. Frankly, what much rots. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a recipe. The paper has all the right ingredients ... Richard Gere is usually perfect in this genre, Diane Lane is an old favorite "Under Tuscan Sun" and "Unfaithful", an ocean-based location, loneliness, and more movie sucking. At the sitting, we went to bed with women next to the woman yesterday afternoon, and the movie halfway up and left! The main problem is that the relationship is not first built or trusted. And maybe there are too many long faces and downsides if you like the history that Gere and Lane bring to the movie. There are those who are balanced and maybe 5 minutes of what we can see ... romance! There is no heat in the character of Gere, Lane sees terrible at the beginning of the movie and everything is washed. As a viewer, we can't deal with characters. <br /> <br /> Others say the book is great. Well, whether it's a scenario, a direction, or a production that somebody really made up in this movie. It's like scenes and accumulation is a deck of cards, except instead of being in the right order, they are just thrown all over the place. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing ... save your money when it hits video stores and even expects a good deal when it goes to the week.
