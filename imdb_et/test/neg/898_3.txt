I didn't get Barnens O really? this is one of the strange things I watched. Music was also quite unusual? Jean Michel Jarre wrote and does it - it makes the film worse than it was. I have to admit that I almost intended to change it and look again, sometimes the movie seemed to me a stupid or boring? or confusing. There are quite a few sexual references in this movie? they are also confused. Probably the only phrase I remember about it, "If you are alone, can you manage things"? and "I'll show them" - or something like that. The boy in this movie was obsessed with the idea not to grow? "last summer as a child" did he think once? and he lived in that max. So if you have a few hours to spare, can you watch this movie? but if you don't, you won't.
