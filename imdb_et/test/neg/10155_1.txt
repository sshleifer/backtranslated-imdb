O boy, was it really bad. <br /> <br /> I saw it on a video tape. <br /> <br /> In scenes with soundtrack music, the dialogue was hard to hear. When people were on the phone, it was hard to hear the other side. It turned out that at least two different types of films or videos were used because colors and focus have sometimes changed drastically between changes. And there were lots of focus shots that didn't seem deliberate. <br /> <br /> One budget figure (one of many) was when the news report was on television. On the TV screen, the "flash of news" and the news publisher's voice are very poorly named with the video effect. They could not save an extract from the newspaper and then actually show it on TV? <br /> <br /> The film starts with a murderer who carries a surgical cleaning and a mask with a scalpel. He is alleged to be a paranoid schizophrenia who escapes from the hospital to avoid his lobotomy. <br /> <br /> Pupils stop school and three young women decide they have a dream. Three men decide to crash and the geek, called Science, will decide on this crash. The sleeping party is quite boring, and boys are still casually wearing masks, taking off their masks and then disappearing. One girl's mother and father (a surgeon who was supposed to make a lobotom) also appear. The killer strikes the throat of people if no one really notices. The obvious conductivity of the film is more or less a dream through the film. Maybe it was bad action or maybe it was deliberate, because much of the movie is a nightmare, and some of it is a nightmare nightmare. <br /> <br /> The end is also terrible. <br /> <br /> The best movie in the movie is the United Home Video VHS artwork that was revived for a DVD (dual feature with Terror in Tenkiller). I cannot honestly say whether it is a photo or a painting or a combination of both. The accompanying women are not in the movie and the clothing they wear is more revealing than anything women wore in the movie. The throat slicing on the lid is more frightening than the ones in the movie, where people tend to influence the glowing pop-eyed look. That's why the killer is usually timed: the head dropped and the eyes tend to loot the camera. Often, the scalpel was kept close to the camera while the face of the killer mask was in the immediate vicinity but was not in the background.
