Talk about the wrong ad! I wasted an hour and twenty-five minutes watching this mess, and there was no free leisure, not one platform shoe, no finger dance, no disc. I watched it on Saturday night and ended up with a terrible fever, but it had nothing to do with music. <br /> <br /> Seriously, with or without John Travolt, this film sucked. <br /> <br /> The opening scene asks you: "Where did the rope come from and does it hang for me?" From its biased bias towards Pennsylvania's Dutch driving ability, with the scandalous advancement of Alienware's laptop batteries, with its evidently eternal capability, with cheap horrendous effects raised directly by Japanese cinema, this is the worst film that hits the theater from The Grudge.
