The action was very low, you had Costas Mandalar, who acted like the appearance of a Triple H forest ranger-brother, Scott McMahon, like his statement I think you should care about, but there is no emotional involvement. You have a stupid lesbian, not that I have anything against lesbians, I'm not just fools running around like a shirt and a grunge like a hat asking if anyone saw their dead lover. <br /> <br /> Modern can be frightening and there is a moral story somewhere trying to fight age and death, but it's lost in this movie. Costas Hurst Helmsley will soon refer to the victims that he will return to the city, but probably the city lights behind him. <br /> <br /> Also Ed Ge's wrong pronunciation but pronounced Gine. As a citizen of Wisconsin. We've had our part of Monsters Gein, Dahmer and McCarth, but when you use it, he says it right. <br /> <br /> God Why do I watch all these terrible movies? Oh yeah, I'm a punishment and I look at them so you don't have to.
