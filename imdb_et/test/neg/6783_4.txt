I watched this movie together with a group of friends at the 1999 Melbourne International Film Festival and nobody got a good word about it. <br /> <br /> I love Bluegras and country music, so it's not the way I'm m is atypical about the subject. The problem is, however, that the heart is a very conservative film - a little more than the filmed Mills and Boon story. The most simple-minded and soppy-type looter. <br /> <br /> It's not just that his love story, Reece and dr. (Why would any man be lured into the human nostril Lily burning in the nostril, and frankly, Mike Harding, like Reece, just moves through the movements). <br /> <br /> It's just that the whole movie is too shy and kind of good. There is little danger, dirt or drama. Certainly Lily is "excited" at a school run by a younger sister, but this episode is more fun than dramatic (it's just so badly written and behaved). And the film gives its conservative agenda as to how this sub-block is solved. <br /> <br /> Good old Reece about Kinkaid (now what's wrong with the name of Eberneezer Bumpass?) I ask you! Is the end of this movie plausible? Was this movie previously entered? I don't think ...
