I was afraid to watch it last night at the BBC, I think I could be the only viewer. From the very beginning there was something wrong with the movie, and after a few minutes of watching, I managed to find out what it was. MOVIE MORE! Not as good as the Wolfpack or Seagal movie, which is just old, bad bad. <br /> <br /> Why this movie? I've seen some TV episodes and I thought it was okay, but I just saw that they did it because they did it. <br /> <br /> I spent most of the movie trying to figure out what the story was and finally I was smarter. It seems to me that at some point I remember a character, maybe Farina mentions that Mod Squad might get into the ordinary police. "Place" turns out to be a "club", one of the most difficult places, maybe it was a student at night? I lost the plot or maybe there was no plot and the movie was simply cut off from the remainder of the TV series. <br /> <br /> Was it an active comedy? I don't remember any smiles. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie did not have a real scene that stole someone like Seymour Hoffman as a bad guy. With her, Ribis would bounce somebody.
