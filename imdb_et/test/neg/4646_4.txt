Well, I read the book first and thought that if it were to be seen in the movie, it would be as cool as I started looking and found that it was already a movie ... I bought the movie back on DVD a week ago and watched it ... they did it terribly wrong! at the beginning, this child, Hapi, who is not a character of the book, a mix of two books ("the god of the river" and "the seventh scroll") that Nicolas needs in the book he himself is, is actually the winner of the whole thing of Himes is also wrong. a light trolley .. the whole grave thing is also very wrong .. there should be a channel with some vacuum miracle around it .. the tomb itself was made in a maze where there was only a chance to pass through the rules of the old ancient game. There was nothing in the movie that Nicolas is English and Royan was a Coptic-Christian in the book, not a Muslim. This list is endless .. There were only a few things in the movie, actors who played Royan, Nahood, Taita, Boris, Mick and Tessay were well chosen, the rest were the characters of the book's characters, Rasfer was the worst, it didn't even come close to what was written in my head. It is a shame that such a big book is so bad in reproduction ... I don't know why Wilbur Smith once gave this permission.
