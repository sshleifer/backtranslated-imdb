I had a bad feeling in the movie for ten seconds because a couple of excess tumbleweeds (probably left in the bad west) blew the whole scene. The bad feeling grew ten seconds later when the mandatory opening for a stranger-turned-man without visible reason lowered his rear-view mirror to see the shadow in the back seat. In the next five minutes, when we open credit, we will be treated back and forth in the car, but only the dramatic TV-movie music will tell us about the killing, not the field process. Over the next 27 or more hours, we will be treated with two idiotic psychotics who, for some reason, will be forced to drive through the desert through the southwest, one after the other, demented Abbot & Costello. Even when the "shocking" twist is over, we simply shake our heads and wonder whether the producers and the director / writer feel ashamed and embarrassed because they should create this contradictory, inconsistent mess.
