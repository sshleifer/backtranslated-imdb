First, what's really great about this movie: <br /> <br /> - Ryan Reynolds, a great actor! There are very few participants I really like and now he is one of them. He has an amazing skill to perform characters. <br /> <br /> - Soundtrack! Very good music is played on time. <br /> <br /> - Nine lost ideas in your world, unable to leave. Still, I'll give her only three out of 10 for some mistakes: <br /> <br /> - The second part of the scary. It seems that the director was very eager to do something new, but despite the effort it was really boring <br /> <br /> - Very tedious sign of Melissa. I was unable to hold the scenes with him, ie it was constantly annoying. He represents everything that is wrong with an American woman. <br /> <br /> - Terrible explanation of numbers. The director was so busy with forming a character that he missed a very good story. Excuse me for koala? brr ... terrible! <br /> <br /> This movie had great potential. Filming is nicely done, music is really good, but nothing else. <br /> <br /> Look at it only if you are a fan of Ryan Reynolds or have a lot of time saving.
