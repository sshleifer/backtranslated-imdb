When a friend and I saw it in recent publications, we decided to get it, despite the fact that neither of us had heard of it before. We both like Costas Mandylor and we had James Coburn, so we thought it wasn't that bad. We were wrong. It was. It was really so bad. No actor or actor would have seen this film worth seeing. It was like Titanic, Poseidon's adventure and some nuclear bomb films and tried to cut and paste it all. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that there were a few smiles. I smiled when the head of the booth asked Alan (Costas Mandylor) when he was a "sea of ​​tuss". The other is laughing at the film, although he had nothing to do with writing. I would love to know how the people who made this movie thought you could have a cruise ship knocked upside down and that it would remain permanent. It is neither biased nor anything. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something to watch for Costas Mandylor, James Coburn, or any other story, go ahead. Find something good they did.
