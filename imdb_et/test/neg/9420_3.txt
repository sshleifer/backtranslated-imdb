Solo begins when a US troops team goes to Soth America to incite the rebel runway, linking them to a robot called Solo (Mario Van Peebles), who can use any weapon ever made, 15 times stronger and ten times faster than any being a person. Something goes wrong, although & Solo refuses to kill innocent civilians, which Colonel Frank Madden (William Sadler) is unhappy with, backing & General Haynes (Barry Corbin) that Solo is being shut down and reprogrammed. One of Solo's main directives is self-preservation, so he decides to flee back to the South American jungle where Colonel Madden and his men are being sent for recovery ... <br /> <br /> Mexican American co-production led by Norberto Barba & one must say that Solo is terrible. The David Corley script was based on Robert Mason's novel "Weapon" and is one clich√© after another, robots were popular at that time. Solo was made in Hollywood and in the ticket office, so Solo hung up for Robocop in 1987), Universal Soldier (1992) and two Terminator flaps and the same settings and basic story as Predator (1987). It is a normal garbage from an emotionally robot who grows among people in terms of mankind, first of all he does not know what a joke is or why one person cares for another, but eventually he develops emotions and starts friendliness with people, sounds like Terminator 2: Court Day (1991) to me . The character is poor, and especially Colonel Madden is not given any motivation to hate Solo and why he would kill other US soldiers and did not tell him to destroy it. You know that last night I saw free cable TV (thanks to God I didn't spend any money on it) and looked at it in the TV guide and do you know what he said? My TV Guide described Solo as a "terrible sci-fi activity in which Mario Van Peebels plays", which I think is a perfect description of Solo. In less than a dozen words, my TV guide has hit a nail head, I mean it's a sci-fi movie, it definitely marks Mario Van Peebles and it's definitely terrible. Enough said really. <br /> <br /> Director Barba is not particularly special at this point and the scenes of action lack real thrill and sci-fi elements are virtually nonexistent except that Solo is a robot. So are the soldiers sent back to Solo and Colonel Madden to restore it properly? I'm not funny, but wouldn't the army make Solo a "self-destructive" mechanism when something like that happens? Certainly at least Solo would have had a tracking device inside, so the army would have known at least where it was at any time? I'm not funny, but these people can come with a walking robot soldier, but they aren't smart enough to realize that a tracking or self-destruction device might be useful if something went wrong? Violence is easy, there are some OK fighting scenes, but it's pretty weak stuff. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film looks gently and expertly made, it is actually in Mexico. Agent Red (2000) by Dolph Lundgren's action flick changed Solo's footage into this film. It's working bad, Van Peebles was the perfect choice to play an emotional robot ... William Sadler deserves better than this, just a few years before he looked at the fantastic Die Hard 2: Die Harder (1990). Solo is really a bad sci-fi action flick, which is basically a big big budget Hollywood sci-fi action film like Robocop, Universal Soldier & Terminator. Not recommended and I will start and pay more attention to the TV guide if you want to watch movies to watch ...
