It must be one of the biggest horror movies. Charles Band made a little pearl of the best of the 96's. A very realistic and incredibly stylized visual flair, David Fincher, would have been envious, it would not be difficult to see why Band made classics such as "Killjoy 2: Deliverance From Evil", "Regina Pierce Affair", "Sherwood Virgins" Forest 'and' Timegate: Saddle Tramps 'stories'. <br /> <br /> With a very complicated story - a small body with a big head controls a strange family who is experimenting with naked women. Be too young for the younger viewers, and it is only for the most educated viewers, but for those who see it, the Band is able to deliver fine messages through its masterpiece. The main symbol of lost love and longing for your inner self, which we all have to stand at one point or another, and therefore I could communicate with this film deeply on a personal level. Although many previous critics have compared Bandi's film with Re-animator and other minor works, this head and heels are the rest. It's gorier, but not pointless. The gore of this movie is well designed and used to improve the storyline, rather than just get out of the viewer. Also the special effects of this movie are absolutely top-notch, easily the best work in horror movie ... well ... ever! The work done in this film makes Savin's effects equivalent to a blind, endless hobby. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have with this movie is the huge quantities of front nudity that were not the ultimate goal of the composer - to create a timeless epic that will forever fall in history, possibly the biggest movie of all time . If it wasn't such a small problem, I'd be perfect for this movie 10.
