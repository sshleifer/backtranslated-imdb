Operation was terrible. The film had a particular effect, although it was extraordinary. Writing was pathetic and the dialogue was incredible. And the silly little love story between Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck was unsuccessful. "Asteroid is the size of Texas," says Billy Bob Thornton. Er, it's 800 miles wide! Does anyone from NASA even see an asteroid until the midday meteor shower destroys New York? Mouthpiece. NASA hires a drilling team to join astronauts and trains them a week? Yeah, of course. Does anyone bring them to the Space Shuttle? Yes, it is realistic. And Bruce Willis blows the asteroid for three seconds to save. How Disney Esque! <br /> <br /> How bad was this movie? I took the asteroid!
