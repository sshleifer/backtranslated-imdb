I have seen the comments of the Turkish people (which I have not) saying that this film is fantastic and exactly represents Turkish life. I have to say that ... Turkey must be one of the most boring and frustrating places in the world, because I think it was this movie for me. If I were Turkish, I think it would have had a greater impact. But if you are not from Turkey, I would advise you not to waste it within two hours. <br /> <br /> "Far" seems to be forever. Many scenes are very small for a long time or not. I do not understand the director's goals even in many scenes. It is noted that the director used his car, apartment and friends to make the film ... Well, I guess what? It shows. There seems to be a small budget. Operation is bad. If this is a cultural thing, be it. I just don't understand the film as the basis for this story. It's incredibly boring.
