This is a great prerequisite for the film. The whole plot is very original, interesting and something to think about. Nonetheless, it is a classic, but poor production, obviously a small budget, a prickly actor in the main characters, and a number of side actors inhibiting. The prospective producer should try to rebuild this story and give it much support for the release.
