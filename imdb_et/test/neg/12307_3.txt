Dr Seuss would surely be crazy if he were alive. A cat in a cat shows how film productions can take a classical story and make it meaningless. We have Mike Myers, a notorious cat, a big mistake! Myers proves he can't act in this movie. She acts as a prissy show girl with thousands of tricks on her sleeve. The children of this film are all right, somewhere between dull and annoying lines. The story is like an original pair of tweaks and like most movies based on other stories, there is never an original story! The evil neighbor Quin was a bad idea. He's a stupid bitch who never gets out of life. This movie is like a newspaper rejection comic when you think about it. The film is definitely sticky! Of course, there are funny adult jokes like where his tail and censor break before he says naughty word, slightly funny. At least Grinch was drunk and the movie was really good! This film is in bright colors and has a poor mediocre action. Was Mike Myers even in this movie? And the second thing, fish. What is this stupid fish! For the first time you see him, he's the real fish. The next time you see him, he's all animated and talked. But she looks like an animated rubber band piece! This movie is the total amount of target wrecks. Good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! I'm surprised that he even had good jokes like a water park ride, it was good. So please, if you have a choice, check out Grinch for this confusion.
