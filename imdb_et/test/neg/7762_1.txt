Week after week these women wipe all feet. Get real. None of these women are "knockouts". Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) looks at how female men take up! Yet she is a queen bee, a super-sexy man-killer. The other three aren't much better. And their constant dirty oral comment ... ... not to mention that they jump in bed and out there with strange men and never get sick. This exhibition is pathetic. And horrible. I don't think any of these people would be terribly interested in any of these women, even when he jumped on the shore of Viagra like Tic Tacs.
