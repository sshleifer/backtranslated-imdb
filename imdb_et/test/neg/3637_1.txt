For all Nickelodeon fans who watched the network in the 80s and 90s, there was always something good. You had an entertaining act as you can't do it on television. You had wonderful but good shows like Pete & Pete. You even had cartoons that taught morals like Doug. But like Disney, Nickelodeon has fallen into the pipes, limiting their demographic minority and giving us excuses for new, innovative exhibitions. As I was trying to watch Zoey 101, I just shook my head. <br /> <br /> The device could not be more fake than this. Each character participates in a quiet coastal academy with everything that a corrupted child wants. Sushi bars, laptops everywhere, flat-screen TVs in every room, cool dorms to hang, etc. This looks like a place to spend on a nice summer holiday rather than work and study in college preparation. <br /> <br /> Characters were also a factor that turned me off. Each episode consists of boys' problems, the situations they caused themselves, and the problems that should be solved. Each character is a stereotype. Zoey (Jamie Lynn) seems to be perfect in everything he does, and each of his friends asks him for help if they feel they are in serious danger. Just pointing her to the other side. I've been to school and I can tell you that nobody is. Chase is stupid. Logan plays a lofty tough man. Quinn plays a lad who is very unreal in what he does. Michael is an idiot. Lola is a clone of Nicole. Dana is just a good, tough person. Why not use some originality? Something that is unique to these characters and different from other people? Are the best creators of this exhibition stereotyped? Instead, these actors are boring personalities, in the sense of a lack of creativity that includes their roles. There is nothing surprised or surprised here. <br /> <br /> Not only this, but the exhibition is clearly meant for children of adolescents who are faced with a stage where they have to develop into being an adult. During this time, they must learn to learn independently, make their own decisions and do what they have. Zoey 101 does not contain anything from these values. In this case, we should believe that good looks and a stereotypical personality are all that is needed to succeed. I'm sorry, but it's just not true. People can't expect things to be given to them, like actors, and just let them sit there. If I assume that Zoey 101's things happen in real life, I would live in a fantasy world locked in a dream house. Nothing in this exhibition concerns those who come into contact with health and money. It is also not about children who want to learn something meaningful. <br /> <br /> So Zoey 101 is a Nickelodeon display that only falls on the face. It shows the children a terrible message and I think the show itself is simply inappropriate for them. Of course, it has no illness, but it teaches everything that a child does to act and look stupid. The terrible exhibition and it must be forgotten with the rest of the trash can Nickelodeon has done in recent years. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10.
