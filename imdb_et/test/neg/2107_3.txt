For its credit, this is one of their most competent trash bins, and because there is a lot of good gore and interesting taking "Snakes on the plane." But if there are more examples of the latest contradiction between the latest rip-offs in the refuge, these are the two early signs of illegal immigrants who do not understand and speak English who cross them, but when they get on the train and meet with friends, they understand and speak perfect English. <br /> <br /> In addition to being a bad Hollywood formula, "Snakes is a Train" is completely boring. At least with "Snakes on a Plane" we were given the opportunity to watch the actors as a cartoon and try to be interesting. Mallachi Brothers Contribution includes some of the most boring characters I've ever seen, from an electrical engineer (a gee, I don't know how he'll be useful later), to some stoner surfers, just to our two main characters trying to fight "Snakes" fun, and even if it's very gentle, it's still not as good as it can be, because "Snakes" could have been a funny short film and instead it just takes it too seriously and never lets it at any moment. Instead of taking their own small budget and making original images of precedent, they force their small budget to fight against them. Although Mallach's brothers seem to have tried, the train just seems incredibly artificial. <br /> <br /> It looks almost like a play-out game with those inconsistent and terribly cunning pieces that are desperately trying to get out of the way of real train cars, while every time it shakes so often, the background of the windows is blurred and the sound effects disappear every time and let us know that they are actually on the train; not to mention that on such a large expanded train there seems to be about ten passengers. And besides the train event and the pulled out sex, we are forced to submit to a plot that is zero. And not even the directors can not work on the "deadly" snakes on this train, far from being toxic or dangerous. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie tends to only go to a one-minute hospital. and a bad sub-block of a former drug substance that tries to scare passengers. All of this boring exposition ends with a really ridiculous climax, where a poorly computerized snake (I saw a super animation on Super Nintendo) completely absorbs the train as a whole, and then a method that should have been used from the start is issued. Applications for asylum again. <br /> <br /> Asylum applications are once again hackneyed, lazy, terribly targeted and boring with a better film. "Snakes on a Train" takes itself too seriously and that's why it's never fun or memorable.
