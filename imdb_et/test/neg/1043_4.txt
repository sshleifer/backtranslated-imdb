Karen and her boyfriend Jerry are moving to their new Los Angeles apartment. They discover an old copper bed that Karen likes, but unfortunately it has a very bad history that includes a kinky murder. "Death Bed" tries to be a horrible supernatural story, but fails to fail. Action is slow, action is nothing special and there is no tension. Any sexual scene is flat. The climax is pretty funny and violent, so fans should be happy. "is deadly boring and offers some tired horror movie conventions and cheap atrocities. Finally one avoid.My rating: 4 out of 10 and it's generous. Look" Re-Animator "or" Castle Freak "instead.
