How pointless, ugly character and boring film. Recorded with short sexual scenes, mad witches, gorgeous desert and brooks. The plot is weak, signs are low and unlikely. Having said that I managed to look at all this, mainly because I had the perfect jiggling and hoped that his character would finally be good. The film was well shot, well-managed, but maybe it was some way down. Disappointment. It is likely that the review was merged in the first row, but this website says you need to write at least 10 lines. It would be better to spend time watching another movie.
