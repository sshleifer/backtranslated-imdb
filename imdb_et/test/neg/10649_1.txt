The Joe Cool Review - Hellraiser: Bloodline <br /> <br /> This is Bruce Ramsay Phillip L'Merchant / John Merchant / Dr. Paul Merchant, Valentina Vargas as Angelique and Doug Bradley as Pinhead <br /> <br /> Plot: It follows the Merchant Blood Linear, which started with Phillip L'Merchant, who created a box that opens the doorway to hell. From the 18th century until now, when Pinhead first meets a merchant and tries to break the bloodline .. (he is the only one who can stop Pinhead, and finally in the future, where Paul Merchant has finally understood how to send Pinhead to hell. < br /> <br /> Opener: This is a movie that has hated so many people, they proclaimed a fictional director Alan Smithee as a credited director, they pull out Smithee wood only if they really think they've made a terrible movie like Classics like Birds II: Land's End or Bloodsucking Pharaohs in Pittsburgh No, I didn't do it How did I like it? You read it so I'm sure what you want to know. <br /> <br /> Good: This movie is not as bad as you believed ... Oh, I'm not going to cover this sugar, this movie was full of so much potential and ended up with a catastrophe, but it has some positive ones. Cooler cenobites this time around starters like twins and demon Ange lique. Pinhead still plays a key role and still has good lines ("Pain is face, let me show you this") and it's a little fun. Gorehounds love the movie because of its endless offer. There is also some consistency with the rest of the series, though you have to look at it. Chatterer Dog is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Bad: But the story of Hell and the damn merchant's bloodline, which can close the gate forever, was really complicated and with the channeling. Nothing really explored its full potential and there were some really stupid things. Pinhead kidnaps the child and keeps him from ransom! Random deaths are just more blood (not always bad, but not for the sake of the story). Pinhead is the worst here, pounding and stroking, even when he's dying! For a very smart demon that he used to be, he has reduced nothing more than a Bond villain, at best. If the fans of Hellraiser ever needed a reason to move to a role similar to that of the other, this is the case. Bloodline destroyed it for all of us. <br /> <br /> Ugly: Gore is always mentioned here. It has skin ripping, drilling, hooking, spraying and more. Chatterer Dog, though fantastic, reeks bad special effects during chase scenes. <br /> <br /> Final Decision: This movie had the potential of something great, even at Hellbound levels in size. But it was all wasted. Who knows exactly what went into producing this mess, but we can only blame Alan Smithee. <br /> <br /> The rest: this film is the worst of the Hellraiser series. Only for graduates. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * *****
