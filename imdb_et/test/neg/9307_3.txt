Mr. Accident is a deliberate series of non-monetary disasters and deaths that resemble Saturday's Warner Brothers cartoons. Like a coyote who falls on a rock 5 times in an episode, a "leading person" (more than a grown-up klutzy child) is always able to postpone his meeting with Grimm Reaper. <br /> <br /> This Australian surprise is insulting and sometimes even depressing. 2 (out of 10) are designed for visual stunts (some have never tried anyone after Daffy Duck) and vivid colors (like high quality national laundry) <br /> <br /> There may be an age class where this "comedy" finds the following: I've definitely gone to this age long. Calling all the preteens: Here's "ha-ha" for ya!
