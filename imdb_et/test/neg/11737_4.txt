The 1998 Psycho version had to be put back in the 60s, not today. Headsets would have done a good job with this setting. There were two scenes that just fell out like a painful thumb. The first was at the beginning of the film when Marian Crane (Anne Heche) was sitting at her desk. His boss took his client to his office because "it was air conditioning." I imagine that most Arizona companies have air conditioning. The second was a meeting between Lila Crane (Julianne Moore) and Sam Loomis (Viggo Mortensen). Purple sporting The Walkman seemed like an exaggeration to update the movie. The film showed a number of viewers in the theater.
