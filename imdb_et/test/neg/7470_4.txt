This movie was nothing more than an exploitative gay cheesecake. It was not an "art" film; just an excuse to show you several free, exploitative, top-notch scenes with extensive male genital nudity. There was a dressing room with over a dozen naked men. The camera zooms in on the men's donkey and penis as they are displayed for several minutes in full screen. In this movie, there are several scenes showing the penis after the penis. It becomes superfluous REAL and makes this movie impossible seriously. I was wondering if I was watching the Playgirl video wrong. If these same scenes were filmed with women (for example, fully showing their naked and their vagina repeatedly), it is simply left as soft porn porn and an excuse to show a lot of eye candy ... all this movie. Each artistic value went under the ghost of the homosexual ghetto. The topics of class differentiation, homosexuality, longing and others were simple and superficial; no more advanced than what one would expect from a first year student of philosophy. Just cut the chase and rent out gay porn.
