I don't know about you, but I'm going to be scared to be scared and it was something more frightening, the film had several opportunities to be really scary and failed every time! Several of these allegedly stopping moments haunted some of the worst cgs you see this year, maybe a decade! I mean, when I say that cg looks like television in the daytime, I'll give the TV a bad name, I've seen better things on the sci-fi channel. Who I really know are the actors (that their names are added to this movie), they did a good job, I cared about most of the characters, and felt that their performances were pretty good, but that wasn't enough to get this movie out of the gutter. What's really fun is to reuse some of the kits if you've seen an "exorcist: start", so reuse some buildings is easy. But what I thought was the worst thing about this movie, even if cg problems were the main demon, he wasn't just scary anyway, his form, the way he spoke, he was very blessed. All in all, this movie was a terrible experience and I would have left the theater if my wife didn't want to see the end.
