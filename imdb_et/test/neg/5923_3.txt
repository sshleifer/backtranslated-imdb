I really liked the idea of ​​traveling between dimensions and I even liked the Wade / Quinn tensions early. Some of their created worlds gave the main characters very interesting backgrounds for their stories. At the same time, as the show went on, there were more stupid disputes and less real bonds among friends. There was less wonder and excitement when they were involved in other worlds and more pressure. And every world had one love. Writing just got bored and everything was too up. Too bad it would have been nice to have a band of friends (la Star Wars) who have been traveling for several years on a television, not a tired ring-maker group.
