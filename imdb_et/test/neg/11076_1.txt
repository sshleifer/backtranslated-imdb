Horror movies are a curious thing, sometimes they manage to compromise with a very well-functioning formula, sometimes they are bravely trying to say a worthy story, despite time and budget problems, sometimes they are so bad that they are really fun ... and sometimes they are "caves" . <br /> <br /> A good horror / intermediate campaign should include the nuances that you think should allow you to be interested in characters and their motivation so that you actually have some sort of reaction when they die. At the same time, Cavern chooses instead to introduce the elements that work first, but that it is a peculiar storytelling. <br /> <br /> All characters are completely forgotten, and any real backtrack that can even make them irrelevant is within a 30-second monologue that makes it impossible to do more than laugh because characters are chosen almost randomly and more than once the least intimidating. <br /> <br /> (For a bit of a scenes, one victim will be taken during a break that could have been a little scary if his sound effect on death did not like mixing too thick macaroni and cheese in a pot. The camera that does the job thinks the director saw too much Nine Inch Nails videos and end, which is a shocking attempt, almost no purpose, but the viewer is confusing and confusing and you have a virtually inconceivable horror movie that doesn't work at all levels. <br /> <br /> I am honest with you if you want the claustrophobic relaxing horror movie to look at "The Descent," and I find it strange that it doesn't particularly enjoy this movie.
