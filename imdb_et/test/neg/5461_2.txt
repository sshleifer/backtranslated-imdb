It looks like one of Australia's films made by "talented" students and funded by the government. Art students and teachers appreciate it in the full range of fresh and shape and verbal excursions into Freud's psychology, but generally perceived as a good cinema, good storytelling, and generally a good-tasting fool. What's happening, I think art students become so obsessive. "Pink Flamingoes" are miles ahead of the same topics. Some of the 70's porn movies are much more traceable and inspiring. The revelation book is not entirely unjustified, but as a general experience it is significantly lower than the class B average.
