Director Michael Ritchie and actor Robert Redford's second documentary drama "Candidate" is a political satire that still seems fresh and relevant. So it is a pity that a "downhill racer" made a short time ago seems the opposite. Music is ugly and perhaps innovative skiing sequences are now a standard for the television coverage of sport. The world of skiing seems strangely amateurish (probably, given the time of making the film, but it is difficult to associate with today's professional world) and the American theme in Europe still seems to be easier to travel. Perhaps the biggest problem is the flat plot that focuses on a lofty but mysterious hero; unfortunately, it is a terrible performance by Redford, which gives us a little understanding of his care or motivation. And a character-like film with no big sign is never a good bet. I was expecting a lot, but unfortunately this is a boring film.
