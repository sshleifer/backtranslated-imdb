A dignified movie. Don't even compare one breath "To kill Mockingbird" or "In the Heat of the Night". <br /> <br /> Come on now. Do you really have Elizabeth Patterson, of all the people who watch the prison, to avoid lynching? Patterson was the mother of everyone on his day and was a homeowner at "I Love Lucy" before buying Fred and Ethel Mertz. man gun killed white man? Claude Jarman Jr., who was so fabulous in The Yearling in 1946, appears confused. He still had those sad eyes. My eyes would be sad even if I appeared on this terrible movie. <br /> <br /> It was something other than the Faulkner flop all the way.
