What a ugly movie! The main character of this film was to be born and grow up in Canada, but he had a thicker Indian accent than his parents! Is it just me or Uday sees this movie gay? Are all Canadian chicks like bitches? At least that's in this movie. All women are dressed like strippers. Don't waste your time with it! The only good thing about this movie is the beautiful Vancouver. Interestingly, why is Bollywood going through? This is because of such films. I miss the good days when Hindi movies were really fun! I couldn't even finish this movie because it was so bad. I think Bollywood has to stop repeating the Hollywood style because it just doesn't work. They have to stick to their roots because it makes Indian movies fun.
