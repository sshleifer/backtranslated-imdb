I'm a kind of intermittent review and hate review. I've been a fan of Lovecraft (and Lovecraft 'purist') for a long time, and even though this little amateur movie was of poor quality, it had several redemption features. I went to see that I was looking for the worst thing I've ever seen, and I was wondering if Lovecraft would turn to his grave, but I was shocked to find that I really like it. <br /> <br /> do not want to catalog the film's mistakes, so I will mention just a few that keep this movie a "star of amateur effort". <br /> <br /> This is a very low budget and video camera, so it has some soap operas, but if you are used to this idea, it is no longer. The direction is pretty amateur, and the use of frame frames and distances is rather clumsy. STILL, this movie was actually a kind of crappy and it remained more loyal to Lovecrafia's intent than almost all of Stuart Gordan's and Brian Yuzna's travels (my main exception to those films that were Re-Animator and Dagon). The idea that some of the old ones have been impregnated is reminiscent of Dunwich Horror and Shadow above Innsmouth (which does not mean that this film is as good as those stories)! One of the things that irritated me was that the words left out of the Bible saw the zombie jailed and frightened. I'm not sure if it had to show that the words of "God" disturb the old zombie or that particular zombie. There was no real answer to this. The rest of the Christian symbolism reminds me of August Derleth's myths. So it was Derleth's style to take in my thoughts. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie only with curiosity. This shows how a relatively atmospheric film can be made with almost zero. I liked setting up wine cellars. The exterior images were sad. Using the same coastline and trees (and almost the same damn fire) to send a 3-character long journey was really sad. The director needs it behind his head. Acting as a standard for amateur film, the blonde zombie girl received a personal award "Best Gollum Personalization by an Italian Actress". In fact, I think this film was made before the Lord of the Rings. Maybe Andy Sedaris looked at him and thought, "Dang, he's making a big Gollum!" <br /> <br /> One little bark to the director. The makeup in Zombies was like bad Gothic children. I was disturbed and almost interrupted. I was like "Oh so how do we know he's evil and possessed", but later in the movie you see a girl who paints makeup like an older woman (both living). So it was not an attempt to say "goth makeup = zombie" but "goth makeup remained after zombie". But the acquired / zombie makes equal "blue contact lens" ... heh. <br /> <br /> In general, I liked this film even better than the Yuzna and Gordan films (banning the above exceptions). The budgets of Yuzna and Gordan were much better, but the film did a better job than filming a story like Lovecraft in a small budget. <br /> <br /> One quick word for a make-up artist: I know you wanted "claws" or something on Zariah's fingers, but long black press-nails seemed really stupid. <br /> <br /> A quick word to the scorer: I know you didn't get resistance, and probably the director who made it right, but if two characters attacked with weapons for a "duel", played this little whistle "Good , bad and ugly, killed any mood that had accumulated. It was lovely, but cute was not suitable. <br /> <br /> The makers of this movie have read Lovecraft and have been highly respected. I liked the little arrows here and there: the bad dreams Carter and the character Pickman, who turns into a strange zombie.
