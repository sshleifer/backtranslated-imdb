Bad. Personal opinion? People who did it? They knew it when they did it. To celebrate this movie, I think you have to fulfill three criteria again ... # 1: You had to have your own Goth style clothes and jewelry. This makes the wardrobe easier and cheaper. # 2: You had to be able to remember and repeat your lines with smart cards. Note that I didn't say you had to do it well. Saves time and paperwork. # 3: You had to be naked. Provides R-Class and therefore supports sales. Want to watch a better movie? Easy. Take the camera and some of your friends together and do it yourself. Believe me, you don't do anything worse. Like vampire movies, it goes well. And a hint for people like me who want to look for a few wonderful things in a movie ... Think about the relationship between vampires and crosses. Now, look at the symbols and names that are in the parts of the cemetery of the object where you filmed. Ed Wood couldn't predict this accident better.
