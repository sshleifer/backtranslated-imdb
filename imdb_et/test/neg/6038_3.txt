Friz Freleng's "Snafuperman" is one of Snafu's private short shorts. A warning about the importance of learning your field manual, "Snafuperman" makes it more cumbersome. The story that a technical fairy, the first class, makes Snafu supreme to help her see her road bug is predictable and uncomfortable. Freleng's earlier Snafu's short "Rumors" were breaking up with ideas and laughing, but here's the director's a pretty boring topic, and he's trying to make it fun for a short time. Even in about three minutes, Snafuperman seems to be dragging and, unlike the best cartoons in the series, it seems to be the first educational material and second entertainment. Though they knocked faster than the usual Warner cartoons, Snafu's shorts were largely surprisingly high. "Snafuperman" is a reflection of the quality you expect more from the less talented creative minds.
