I went to see it by Albert Finney alone. He's one of my favorite actors and he rarely can do it. I'm not sure if the plot is interesting or just silly: it's about a little boy who is born, but when his mother goes to work, he refuses to come out! It sends the factory of God and the whole man into crisis, and Albert Finney is called out of the cleaning plant to try and convince the boy to think and decide to be born. So Finney hopes that she wants to show her all the reasons she would like to live, the unborn son of Big Apple. <br /> <br /> Despite the plot's ridicule, I could have accepted it if the director hadn't tried to turn it into a typical Hollywood sentimental moral movie. The film was changed by the frightening music that Hollywood directors could not resist, making it unbearable. <br /> <br /> He tried a little unusual story, giving his hand at any moment. Regardless of which spins were stored, the story remained completely open. Just like a director would have taken, the audience is just a bunch of idiots who don't see the obvious clues coming out of the mile. <br /> <br /> Even Finney's presentation, though satisfactory, seemed a bit uncomfortable and uncomfortable; and the boy who had curly locks, though he was supposed to be cute, was actually quite bored. Bridget Fonda seemed to be duplicating Demi Moore's "Ghost" performance with tears slightly warning. <br /> <br /> I understand that the film is not yet successful in distributing in the US, which surprises me, I think it is the potential of post offices to be modest for both children and sentimental adults. In terms of quality, this is not a terrible film, it is not very good. (4 out of 10)
