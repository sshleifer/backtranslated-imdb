Ghost Story has an interesting feminist presumption of vengeance, A-list veteran actors, colorful setbacks with fancy looks of old men. Scary Staccato Music, which marks the upcoming horrors, the atmosphere of New England's winter weather and a great charismatic actor title. Ghost Story could have been much more effective in black and white, and some of the most delicate special effects and more convincing scenarios would be lost (we should not think about why there are two trailer-parkist actuators inside the script). ) The biggest disadvantage of the film is Craig Wassan (definitely divorced from the birth of Bill Maher), who may be completely ineffective in editing or just doing bad things. He seems to be specializing in wide-eyed, wide-ranging reactions; there is not much personality here. Revelation, however, is Alice Krige, a pale, mysterious, terrible exterior. But his Eva Galli is horrible even before he meets his destiny; I mean, a young woman who says things like "I'd like to bite you" or "Dance with me, you're a little toad!" is not already a land of land. Ghost Story would have been a much better low key, in Val Lewton mode. Overweight special effects completely reduce the cooling factor.
