Another example that we should be missing out on in Sweden is not working, except for Widerbergs, which is still insurmountable to MANNEN PAK. I think Stormarel is the best possible and some scenes are somewhat effective, but the chart is full of holes. Why does Hamilton continue to attack the base, knowing that his wife is hostage? Mark Hamill was fun to see, but his bad man was very well-known. I am surprised that such relatively large Swedish films are made without a reasonable and functional script. 1/5.
