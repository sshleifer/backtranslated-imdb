Irwin Allen, the captain of the former cinematic valve, pulled all stops in VOYAGE under SEA. The poorly aged Walter Pidgeon, who was actually dead when playing this role, is the commander of the atomic submarine, which must be the size of the Empire State Building. Each room is gigantic and some do not even have a ceiling. In some of these rooms, you could keep the bowl and the official ball at the same time. The bottom, called the Sea View, is on its birthday when all the hell breaks down: Van Allen's strap is catching fire and the sea view has to kick off a rocket for a certain period of time, or the world falls into the flames of global warming! Alongside the ride, there are a bunch of really horrible actors, many of whom have borrowed from the TV. This makes them TV hackers. The worst thing is probably that the poor man, Stella Stevens, Barbara Eden, is a naval secretary, squeezing too tight clothes, doing high heels and acting like she's appeared on the beach party. Perhaps it is because Frankie Avalon is also driving. The poorly aged Joan Fontaine, who is almost unknown here, plays a visiting doctor who has a big bad secret, but actually who cares? VOYAGE is a really bad movie that is obviously meant for small children, but which child still sits on the infinite frame of a small Seaview model that moves over and over again from right to left, which is obviously a studio tank? There is no single scene where we believe these people are actually sub-board. When the sea is shaking, the actors hit themselves in opposite directions. Like the good old STAR TREK TV series, when the bridge breaks. If I remember correctly, there is no fish or sea animal visible - except for the octopus, which temporarily closes to the bottom, nodding by 20,000 LEAGUE SEA. The octopus, if it was real, was probably about a leg long and shows. Worse still, when people stand at the glass gaze of the sea, the ocean they're supposed to look at is clearly an invisible air hose that is probably filmed in a fish tank. You have never seen bigger ones in your life. You think these bubbles would be broken apart. Unfortunately, poorly aged Peter Lorre is also driving. At the end, when the rocket enters the burning belts, Lorre congratulates Pidgeon, while all others are still waiting to start shaking their hands and winning each other. A one-time scene when I've ever seen it. What a stink. It's not even good to laugh. Stay with SILENT RUNNING.
