I don't know what those filmmakers were trying to achieve or say, but they failed badly anyway. Of course, the goal was not to confuse the viewer completely. I just watched this movie just because Drew Barrymore was in it and found that he had a smaller than a small coat. The whole idea that this child goes on a wild trip to win a big cash prize at a petrol station game and meet all kinds of wackas is totally ridiculous.
