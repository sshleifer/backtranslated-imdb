I like Noel Coward, wit. I like Noel Coward, play write. I like Noel Coward, composer and singer, but I let Noel Coward actor. <br /> <br /> For me, the man who should have stayed behind the scenes, write his own stories and make his own music and make his deep and fun observations. He should never be allowed in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Don't make a mistake, he's one of the 20th century's top achievements, but he just couldn't act and his voice .. R and R's have a very round tonal quality ... . <br /> <br /> This is one of my least favorite offers from Coward because he does not persuade a psychiatrist convincingly about starting a relationship with a much younger woman, which is further aggravated by the fact that a much younger woman is a friend of her younger old school. <br /> <br /> Celia Johnson is as much joyful as ever before Cowards sent her to the bad. This is his power that saves this movie from an unsightly numbness. I think her little fasting at Coward's short collision four years earlier qualified her for this role because she had to lift up some eyebrows that played such a promising woman and it gave her the chance to win back some fans and get some loss of compassion. <br /> <br /> She was such a wonderful actor and you see why Noel Coward used her so much in her many products. <br /> <br /> But the rest of the movie is drab, malfunctioning, predictable and a whole boring almost ass-clenching level. <br /> <br /> If you want the coward of Noel, look at the time we serve, the Blythe Spirit or this Happy Breed. Three Noel cowards. With nice movies like I think we can forgive her this turkey. <br /> <br /> I have given this four letters purely to add Miss Johnson, but in general I would be like a plague. .
