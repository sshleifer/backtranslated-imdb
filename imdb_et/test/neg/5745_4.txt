Slayer is a meaningless vampire movie with a few twists at an ancient plot. A special team will be sent to South America to cool the blood. Their leader is a real old man who is well aged. Vampires are attacking villages because their rainforests and wildlife's old diet have been lost to greedy corporations and farmers. The battle is lost and so much blood that they just did not bother to wash the whole lingerie of the film. It seems they slept in bloody clothes and threw blood. Although every cast member brought his talents, it wasn't all in film. The effects were OK, except for the vampires that climbed the buildings in the buildings. If you're looking for a lot of blood and violence, that's for you.
