Like many others tonight, I set up the cold winter and the long lines to see what I had been waiting for as one of the best films this year. However, after the credit was left, I unfortunately missed a lot of desire. To be fair, there were redeemable qualities (albeit very little). Let's start with what worked. First, Lycans: Every Point? their terrifying physicality to fear of wildness. Activity: sublimely visceral? if it happened. Nighy / Victor and Sheen / Lucian: Perfect. Now, what's not (and there's a lot). It was less of a movie and a sequential collage (and don't expect to see other characters supporting Raze and Tannis). The well-written story and the real thing was lost to bring these movies together. The story seemed to start right in the middle? at the end where Lucian was rebellious. There was therefore no context; there is no tension; is there no feeling of betrayal? all other equipment needed to do the job. What's more, it ended where the climax should start (which was supposed to be after a bit of a frustration). Oh and it was too short. Purist also finds a violation of some of the freedoms taken from certain facts that have appeared in the first two films before? Eventually, this film remained for a long time, which should have been short "background" scenes (eg various council scenes), so we never got major players ... or movie (ouch). -D
