It's been a long time ago I saw this movie and it's still one of the worst I've ever seen. I like a lot of movies; sci-fi, action, drama, thriller and sometimes even horror. There is no combination of the two. It could have been a great movie, but they all flew. I didn't want to see this movie, but my friends demanded it. I didn't know it was such a mess. I loved the first part, where Clooney and Tarantino traveled through Texas, killing everyone on the road (especially the scene where the drink was very good), but at the turning point the titty twister bar changed everything. The Stupid vampires took over this place and could have been the perfect gangster movie, becoming a foolish fear movie like "Nightmare on Elmsteet". If you like horror, watch a real horror movie. And if you love thrombotic thrillers, don't look at it at all, you are ultimately very disappointed.
