When he leaves the water, a young psychic woman named Jessica Burns (Carolyn Kearney) stumbles at nothing. She discovers a chest that has been buried in her aunt's ranch for decades. Instead of Aarde, Gideon Drew, the devil's worshiper, who is hit by Sir Francis Drake, reads his aunt's chest. Drew's head goes to the attacked hired man who drives the attack, and he's looking for the rest of the body? also buried in Jessica's aunt farm. While Jessica is sure she knows the evil presence, can she stop Drew's plans and will she get on time to prevent her from changing? I thought I was quite familiar with most of Universal's horror production before the 1960s, but it is one of the 50th universal films that is definitely little mentioned. Although the thing that could not die is not what I would call a "good" movie, but it does have some things for it. Firstly, the film has interesting ideas and is actually quite ambitious. Director Will Cowan, with happiness or intent, can give the film a nice atmosphere for a while. And the main special effects are definitely horrible. However, the whole project has been withdrawn by the operation. I'm shocked when I found out that some of the supposed "participants" in this matter ever appeared. You think it was a movie made for most of the people involved. Kearney is the worst offender. He's terrible. Also, a thing that could not die could be too ambitious for your good. Given the budget and other constraints, the film had no chance of setting its own higher ideas. Finally, the film ends in a rather steep way. Just as things get interested, it ends. What is this?
