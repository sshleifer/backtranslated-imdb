This is the worst show in Nickelodeon's history. First of all, no school has a Sushi bar, a flat-screen TV and any student laptop. This makes the exhibition unrealistic and boring. The plots are pointless and incredibly boring. The actors are so bad that I want to take my life. I really hate the show that Zoey is the most popular girl in school and the most beautiful and smart, and gets the best grades without any work. He never has any real problems, and every man wants to carry him here. He's so perfect. There is no one like that. I also hate that everyone does something for him, and everyone chooses him for each team or club. It's so annoying. Quinn is so unpleasant. His experiments are pathetic, pointless and fake. Chase is such a wimp. He says he loves Zoey, but when he tells him, it would destroy their friendship. How pathetic. Michael is trying to be funny, but he never does anything. Nichole is so perky and shouts a lot. She never sees work or learning, but she's a straight A student. Lola thinks she's an actress, but she sucks (excuse my language). Can I say more? I don't think so. Show off your own well being at all costs.
