I haven't seen such a horrible movie for a long time. I was hoping that at least Adam Sandler might be funny ... hopeless. It seems like a teenager has written this script and he has pushed it up so far that someone agreed to shoot it. (Film) The world could be a better place without it, no matter what it is.
