This film is worse than the Cat People I saw in the same week. This is the style of the 80s. MTV punk rockers, real who are social, not commercial PCs of today, frat-boys and a bad guy called Splater. I really like Splater and the film does it in the 80s of blue lighting, but the rest looks like Canada's low budget. I have seen so much in this great country and realized that these films have been made for tax breaks. Avoid at all costs.
