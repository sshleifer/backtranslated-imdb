As a local gay magazine film reviewer, I automatically send all drives if it has gay. Chicken Tikka Masala burns in the background when I write it. I gave her my indivisible attention for 53 minutes before I cried inadvertently - like Tourrette's sufferer - "This is ** a test film I've ever seen." We just come to an emotional climax where the son gives a certain speech to his father at his wedding. The father seems to do it quite well. At this point, an attempt to kill honor at least would have made the film a bit lively. And made it more funny. <br /> <br /> I didn't like a very nice thing, but I can at least see why other people did. It was done with some professionalism and it seems to remember that it had at least a few good lines. The lack of wisdom of this film is quite amazing - even the most mediocre sitcom has usually recognizable jokes. The closest this movie was funny (at least in its first 53 minutes) was a subtitled comment that was sent to a fat unpleasant female cook "Look at her - she's like a Mersey tunnel." Completely witless and I won't break a smile, but I could imagine someone with a low IQ (who might be running a chip shop) enjoying it. If not, at least with the console, I can say that supporters are losing a significant amount of money, because even with a small budget, a British movie sets back on a million. Seriously, when I met the world's most beautiful bliss and I returned to my sweet love, I found a copy of it in my DVD collection ("Man, I Love This Movie"). him in nuts and leave right away. And this is someone who has gone about six months without the aforementioned sweet love. <br /> <br /> Oh Lord I hate this movie.
