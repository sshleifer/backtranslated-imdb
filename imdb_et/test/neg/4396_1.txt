It must be one of the biggest misfire ever ... the script was nice and could have stopped much better. Participants should have played better and maybe then I would have given this film a slightly better rating. maybe Hollywood should redesign this film with some better actors and better director. Like the disappointment, but the movie is bad. <br /> <br /> If I were to look at it again, it would be like torture. I don't want to spoil everyone's opinion in the mine, so ... my advice is to watch the movie first ... see if u like it and after the vote (don't vote until you watch it!) And by the way ... Have fun watching it! Don't look just ... look at this' till the end :))))))))) !!
