The biggest and most uncomfortable thing about the Raptor film ended for Tyransaur, which is identical to Carnosaur, except when the loader was a little better than the child and then the adult. Similarities with Carnosaur films were rather a bad choice on the plot line. The only thing that approached the good was the beginning with children in Jeep. Then the plot went down the hill. It would have been nice if another plot had been developed, rather than cloning earlier films. The Raptor movie should have learned from Jurasic Park series of different plots. The only film that has recently been close to a good dinosaur film is Aztec Rex. Repeated scenes, as if taken from Carnosaur's films, leave people thinking of these films.
