The Wong Direction is probably the worst of all the film I've ever seen. This film makes the worst film of the year 2000, Courtney Soloman's Dungeons and Dragons look like an Oscar winner. The shortcomings of this film have not been explained. The biggest is the lack of depth. Each scene does not fully develop if the editing room does not know how to do its job correctly. It is a shame that, due to the lack of vision, such a lack of vision can destroy both the powerful talent and the famous popular tradition. <br /> <br /> I'm so nasty and I hope some big directors like John Woo or Ang Lee decide to make this movie again and do justice. I'm not even sure if I can rate 0/10?
