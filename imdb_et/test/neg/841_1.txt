OK, so one night and some friends really decided to get stuck and watch the movie. Unfortunately, we chose "Ernest Goes for Africa". I never laughed so hard in my life. This film is worse. I literally picked up better movies than "Ernest goes to Africa". (I Movies) <br /> <br /> Highlighting this movie at least for me was the opening when Ernest made a stupid face. When they showed him the size of the head peanut, I lost it. Maybe I found it so funny because at the moment I was the highest. Maybe you are right. <br /> <br /> When I think of George W. Bush's favorite film, I think "Ernest is going to Africa". Never have I ever seen a movie more than the 1950 color stereotypes. There were times when the words fled to me and just looked at awe. <br /> <br /> As I watched, did I wonder if this movie is for children? Are the literate adults actually looking at it? How could Ernest's entire franchise be? Is this really my life? Is this real? <br /> <br /> I hated this movie.
