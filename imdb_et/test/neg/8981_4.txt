It owes much to the CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS plot. Although he has grown up quite well, it is a story of a wealthy boys who is shanghai as a crew member on a merchant ship and who gets this man. The title Moran is a boy-young woman who has grown up on a ship owned by her father. When the cargo is burned, it and the crew are evacuated by our boy's ship. Nonetheless, the captain, in his mind, is smuggling and his intentions are not respectful of Moran. It will inevitably arise - our boyfriend will fall for the manor Moran and for him. Finally the evil is weak and the lovers are connected. Some interesting dialogues point out that Moran does not belong to any person - nor to a woman. (Sapphole is here). Dorothy Dalton is appropriately sexless as Moran and not too attractive. Valentino works well in a romantic role. His sexy construction and build are shown and his role is quite masculine. He's very tempting. It's not a great movie, but it's going through time. It's really Valentino's beauty and sexuality.
