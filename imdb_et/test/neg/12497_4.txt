Plot Summary: Los Angeles Future. Crime is controlled by Core Trackers, the android killers sent by the United States computerized court system to blame. The secret service agent Eric Phillips hampers the attack on his boss, Senator Robert Dilly (the person who founded USCJS), a group of activists of the Human Rights Union. Dilly tries to initiate Phillips in her private career, but the SS agent is running after she has seen Dilly's murder in cold blood. Dilly sends Core Tracker after him. Phillips joins the UHR group and helps them discover Dilly-related conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Cyber ​​Tracker is the first of many sci-fi / action hybrids directed by Richard Pepin, co-founder of PM Entertainment in the 1990s. Other Pepin films include "Hologram Man", "T-Force", "Silencers" and "Dark Breed". Pepin's films usually start with a big action that lasts about 10 minutes before the plot can be hit. The script in this movie has some plot holes? it is never clear what conspiracy the heroes are actually trying to stop. As for the actor, Don "The Dragon" Wilson may be tough, but he doesn't get a little charisma for the beans. His co-stars are much better. The best contribution of the film is the action scenes that put some impressive artillery fire, enormous amounts and not one, but three moments when the vehicle travels through the air, drags and hits the ground, exploding. Visual effects limit the cheap side and the musical score is low key and gentle.
