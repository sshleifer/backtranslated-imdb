I mean, nothing happens, 5 foolish children go to Oklahoma to find a magical forest of marijuana ... it could have been fun if it hadn't been the world's five worst participants. Dialogues were not even half an inch fun. The only thing I almost showed was when the dark police stopped teenagers in Oklahoma or Kansas ... The plot could have been fun if there hadn't been an abysmal interpretation. If you are even thinking about watching this movie, don't do it. How stupid it is for a man to get away from the police, telling them he is gay, as his friend did (just not pretending to be ...) and there is the stupid guy joking with the word "gay". ..
