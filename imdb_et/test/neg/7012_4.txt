Well, frankly, it's beyond the stupid boundaries, but "Killer Pussy" is still one of the most amazing little flick. No plot, tons of oiled up cha-chas, cheesy effects and penis eats monster! What not to love? Quite a lot - a couple of researchers find the creature who loves to place her in the female cattle curtains until the chocolate is unfortunately ... ah, pull her mouth. She finds it a host who was later discovered in an abandoned house by a frozen boy and their equally useless, slut girlfriend, whose van is broken. The creature jumps from every girl because they all abandon like drunk rabbits ... There are some cheap gore, girl-girl's "blood wrestling", KY Jelly vomits, sock-doll-monsters and a lot of soft heart sex. Ridiculous, but a waste of time ...
