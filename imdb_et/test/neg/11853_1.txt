This movie was really terrible. <br /> <br /> But it's worth seeing because it ever contains the world's most unnecessarily extended sex scene. I mean, this thing took about 7-8 minutes (repeating the same "movements" over and over again), it's almost 10% of the whole movie! I didn't laugh as long as I laughed at it. <br /> <br /> There were some serious strange and pointless events in this movie, but what I found most funny was when (not for a reason) staying near the complex with helicopter land and 5 or 6 orange costumes. 2 minutes later they run again. What the hell was that? Also a small white forklift that became magically a big yellow miner was pretty classic. I have to believe that this is because they used material stored in the trilogy of 'carnivore' to place this absolute donkey. I have to see them now! <br /> <br /> The movie is worth a laugh or two, but if you can't find the bad movies funny, stay away!
