Well, where do you start to describe this breakdown of celluloids? You already know NADA of big fats that pass through the plot, so let's say it's both computer and offensive. It is hard to believe that Frank Oz, the same guy who gave us ridiculous riots, such as the small horror shop and Bowfinger, made this awkward confusion. <br /> <br /> So this guy doesn't know he's gay until it's the actress's point. OK, sure. If someone says I'm gay, I know the truth, even if I like girls like George Luca $ like the dollar. <br /> <br /> And how to know your sexuality? Well, if I like classical literature, dancing and Barbra Streisand, I'm gay. When I dress like a blind man (half my shirt hangs out), I'm straight. Oh, sure. <br /> <br /> And here's a big cliché of clichés: no matter how you look, there is always a very attractive Hollywood actor who adores any fat under the skin or top model I love your zero-IQ, your butt -The wrong face and your ears draw your attention. If all these homosexual places were not enough to anger me, it was. In the real world, the thing seems to be people, and I know for sure. <br /> <br /> I see it coming: now you say "Relax! It's a comedy! Don't take it so seriously!". If the comedy gives something "carte blanche" to suck, then I think the world has a serious problem. Wouldn't it be much better (and more fun) to make a movie to deny these old tired clichés, instead of increasing them again and again? So, one of the absolutely worst films I've ever seen. 1 out of 10 If this rating is related to my sexual inclination, please let me know. I am interested.
