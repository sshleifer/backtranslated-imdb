The reason this film sucks, has these people even read the Bible? Everything in the movie was about Moses, God was out of it. HOW TO NOT CHANGE! God led everything, he told them where to go and what to do. People also traveled 40 years after they reached Canan and betrayed God again! They did not travel for 40 years, then suddenly found it, it was a punishment for these doubts. Maybe if the people who made the movie first started to say the Bible, they would say no, we got it all wrong again. Everything in this movie was about Moses. They made God look like a jerk who was confused with Moses all the time. NO NOT NO NO NO !!!!!! God was all their time and he wanted people to see that he was taking care of them. How dare they say otherwise, even in the immediate vicinity. And Moses went out, because he was angry with the people, and was blessed with God. He sinned badly and was told he was not allowed to enter. When did Moses run down and shouted to God in the Bible? Never !!!!!! In fact, read your story before you do everything you think is a good idea. This whole God, too, was mostly out of it and made them self, not true! God did everything for the people, he gave them in every sense, and God told them where to go. He was there all the time. All we have to do is in some ways true, but then it is not how it worked! Yes today He does not work directly for everyone to see, but he actually killed after the golden calf thing! God worked directly with people. Read the Bible Next time the Echo Bridge or do another Bible movie!
