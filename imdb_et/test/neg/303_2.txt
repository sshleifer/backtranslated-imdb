This movie has been made before. Basically, it is a unique combination of "Napoleon Dynamite" and "Varieties of Lives". There are some funny bits, but otherwise it's clich√©s. It is a good first attempt to film and the director (who also marks and wrote this feature) shows a lot of promises. But writing was kind of evil and the story was not very original. I swear I have heard some lines in other movies. However, it worked very well and the film was interesting. It is also refreshing to see that gay-themed movies are not so politically correct and tired of stories of anger. The main character seemed quite well adapted to the gay countryside of the Texas countryside, so there was no saccharin here.
