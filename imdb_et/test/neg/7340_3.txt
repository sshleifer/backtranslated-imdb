I lived in Barstow Ca. In 1968, The Killers Three came to the local theater. The trailer was enough for me to pay my hard earned money to watch this movie. I was really waiting for the Bonnie and Clyde films and I got Dick Clark, who plays a shy joke while Robert Walker and Diane Varsi tried to revive Bonnie and Clyde. Needless to say, it never went well. Maybe that's why he never made a video. Even as a boy, when I left the theater I missed something that hanged. After all, the best parts for a movie trailer. The film was boring and pretty much meaningless. By the way, Dick Clark is killed, so it wasn't a complete shoot.
