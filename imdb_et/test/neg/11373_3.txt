I gave him a rating of 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> And what's sad, I did this channel movie timeline to not see it. I wanted to watch this movie because it is based on a book by one of my favorite authors, Barbara Wilson. Like a lesbian, I thought I would love this movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know how Mrs Wilson felt about the movie, but I found it a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> should have been intriguing - it was a mystery - in Spain and the main character Cassandra is a language translator who is contacted by a mysterious, beautiful woman who offers Cassandra a lot of money to find her former wife Ben. <br /> <br /> There are many secrets that have been revealed, but for some reason it just doesn't matter. It was like, oh, what then. I couldn't deal with them or come to care for them or feel them. I couldn't even identify those letters. <br /> <br /> I think a big part of the film's failure was the main fighter. He looked old, tired, worn and damp as the water of the water. Her hair was an eternal confusion, her delicate clothes were boring, and she was simply not attractive or interesting. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie was to hear Dean Martin's record, but even this was a strange make-up worn by a dancing man and a song of lips. Believe me - it was not like seeing this very beautiful Martin Martin. <br /> <br /> The end is so syrup that you want you to have pancakes with syrup. <br /> <br />
