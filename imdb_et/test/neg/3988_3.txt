For a country that has brought some of the best dramatists in the world and has such a rich musical legacy, I have always been confused by the reason why so many domestic cinemas in Ireland have been so terrible. Maybe because talented talent in Ireland's cinema has quickly given up their homeland for a career in the UK or America, (Colin Farrell is the last case) and the truly successful Irish leaders who have worked in Ireland and have made their films internationally and an eye on the international market. I am especially mindful of Jim Sheridan and Neil Jordan, who alternate between Irish films and projects filmed abroad. <br /> <br /> "Middletown" is, however, a very Irish film, even if the two main players are English. Surely it is a kind of well done and maybe a downward trend that Irish movies aren't really very good; (Paddy Breathnachi "I went down", written by a brilliant young playwright Conor McPherson) is an important exception. Unfortunately, this is the story of fundamentality in a fictitious city of Ireland, probably in Northern Ireland, judging by accents (Mid-Ulster Bible Belt, if you ask me), and probably in the recent past (fifty??), So overwhelming that it is really ridiculous . <br /> <br /> Nothing in the movie tells the truth and you can't help feel that writer Daragh Carville is heavily influenced by Flannery O'Connor and that the whole thing could have been more meaningful if it had been placed on the American Bible and not in Ireland, where even the most extreme Protestant fundamentalist was never as loony as that. It all meant that they would be gloomy in the big guignol somehow and certainly it was, even though I was more inclined than the fresh Reverand Matthew Macfayden's antics. He is an Ulster accent off pat and has nothing wrong with his acting or actually that Daniel Mays as his brother, Gerard McSorley as his father or Eva Birthistle as a Mays woman, but the script is so terribly a derivative that good act cannot do anything in the movie to save. So increasing the ladder of the Irish movie "Middletown" is, I'm afraid, this is another nail coffin.
