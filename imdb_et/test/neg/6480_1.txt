I don't know where to start. The main problem, however, is that the essence of the book, Sam's adventure that paves the way for the improvement of all his family members, has not even been touched. Instead, the film tells her family and leaves her rich parents in her home and when she gets tired she goes home. Where is his development? Where's the arc? winds that stop dialogue and restart, etc.) I think it can be good for 8 years. But compared to the complexity of the book, it is a terrible disappointment. <br /> <br /> Read the book.
