It's a good idea to throw it away. The main idea of ​​the film is to travel to past lives, which - fortunately - is not a journey, but a trip within a person that has nothing to do with the past or the future. (Maybe they shouldn't live in the movie right now if I mean ... Another minus, I think). It's all now, in a different space ... Very interesting without much religious stress. <br /> <br /> But music is completely repetitive, melodramatic, sentimental, and inappropriate (not to mention the West). There should have been more and more to think about where music should be and where it shouldn't be. It is not bad, though language has kept me from better understanding. <br /> <br /> I think the idea needs a little more thinking, developing and opening up. in many cases, they seem unrealistic. In conclusion, I would say that this film leaves much to be desired ...
