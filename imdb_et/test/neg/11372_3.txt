This movie was not as bad as the story went, but the work of the camera is hard to see. I just don't like the so-called "realistic" camera work that is currently being done; you know about the type hopping center, reversal, etc. What annoyed me especially about this film, though it was a new thing they threw in with a mix of shots, taking a few shots of each scene in black and white. I believe the film would have been much better if the camera work was done in a more conventional way because I couldn't concentrate on it and found myself analyzing the work of the camera. Perhaps, if more people express dissatisfaction with the work of the camera, the filmmakers will eventually get a hint.
