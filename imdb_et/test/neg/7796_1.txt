Think the most about a movie-worthy subject that you get and it's 10 times worse. A woman has to fill as many crosswords as she can in one day. We don't even see questions and think about our own words, but look at his struggle. The woman seems to be so concerned and hurried to make crosswords, but for some reason she spends time in the whole city when she can focus at home, walk. Acting is terrible, actress huffs and kicks when she tried to think of these words, and we're completely dark. The New York landscape is nice, but the film relies too much on it and it gets old. The film plays like a rejected NYU student film. This movie has no redeeming qualities and I never recommend it to anyone.
