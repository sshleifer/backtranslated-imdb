It's terrible, you just couldn't believe it. The result is tedious, for example, filming is bad, sometimes you see a camera man's shadow in some of the participants. The quality of the film is very bad, it seems to have been done in the 20s. It's terrible. At the beginning of the movie and through the film, there is some blood, but always filmed. No effects. The director did some better than Blood Rites. But there's a man next, because searching for this cheap flick is not that difficult, but you have to pay for the hard earned money. Certainly, with my ten worst horrormovies, I don't know if I would call it horror. Too much talk, you get a bloody look after that
