I thought it was a comedy! What a hoot! I can't believe Forsythe or Reynolds will appear in this trash. And then there is the beautiful Erika Eleniak or whatever the eye candy is called. about 50! The story is ridiculous, operating an absolutely terrible and tired old clich√© that moves over and over again, the boy took a lot of endurance through this dog. The only thing that was worth it was LAUGHS !! And there is a lot! If you really want to kill the say, the hour and a half will choose this child in the rental building, but make sure you have room full of dead people to watch it with you. I think that was what it was written for. It plays as they thought for a real low rent, drug-induced audience.
