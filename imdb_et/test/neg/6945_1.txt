It was one of the worst films I've seen in my life. They said it was a man's answer to wait for Exha ... All I say is that we didn't really respond at all. I couldn't believe it was actually done. The director should choose another profession because he cannot make the film. The script was not good. It didn't make sense and was very dirty. But the films are much better than it was, and I was terribly disappointed to see the talented actor Terrence in this bad excuse. If I could return to time, I would not go back to the media to ever buy this movie.
