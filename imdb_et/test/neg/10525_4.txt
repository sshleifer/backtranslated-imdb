What I'm not doing to rewrite this movie. Particularly disappointing, due to the great start, Solo Dios Sabe worsens after the half-point confusion of superstitious bull and ends with a ridiculous, funny and melodious note. I couldn't believe I was watching the same movie I started. The film had many useful elements, such as chemistry between Diego Luna and Alice Braga, so I thought the screen would glow, a great soundtrack and beautiful spots. Instead of ending a heavy mumbo jumbo with a heavy hand, the film should have focused on being a fluffy tea film that could have some subtleties of fate and superstition and logic. I understand that the goal of the director's entire film was to make it from religion, but the fact is that it just didn't work and he dropped so many great things from the beginning.
