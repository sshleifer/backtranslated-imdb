I don't understand the humor of this movie. I also found it offensive to how the Korean people depicted in this film, no matter how it is their Korean caricature. First, the actors are Japanese and they make the most severe Korean expressions in this film. It frustrates me about how these people are expressed. I felt anger looking at this scene, and how they were so badly prepared in the film. Humor lasts just one laugh and then you don't understand why it's even funny. It is raw humor with the representation of the most disgusting society there. I found this to be a generally offensive film ... Maybe it was just because I never lived in a "hood" and didn't see any "hood" movies, but I'm not going to do it.
