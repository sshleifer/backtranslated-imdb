You know, when you get older, you somehow think that the movies you didn't like were younger and experienced. If I saw a godfather at age 14, I thought it was boring. 20 years later it was an incredible movie for me. In other words, I grew up and started to appreciate great movies. <br /> <br /> So I rented my girlfriend Dirty Dancing last night when she loved her when she was 14 and hated it at the same time. But I was hoping I was young and stupid at the age of 14, maybe it would be a new experience for me. So I sat with him to look, hoping to be enlightened. <br /> <br /> Well, after watching Dirty Dancing, I feel a violation. I feel someone came to my soul and robbed me of a 2-hour life to see this cheese festival. <br /> <br /> First, Patrick plays Swayze for 20 years but looks like he is 35. And the prerequisite for the film is that he seduces a minor teenager dancing with his dances. Really horrible. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is a plot of clich√© where the "wrong half-way" guy and the "rich smart girl" fall in love with each other. Of course, their romance is brought about by the fact that the "rich girl" can not dance to the lick, so "bad hero" teaches her a week that she will become an expert dancer for a big ending exposition or something like this. <br /> <br /> But you thought : The Disgusting Dad enters and forbids the two to see each other soon, and the film progresses through the secret meetings and making love of the dance classes. All this culminates in a final scene where the whole resort captures two young lovers, while the one-time antagonist father accepts 35-year-old dancers from their new male teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> Even my girlfriend finally created when she admitted it wasn't like she remembered. I didn't need him, but I looked a bit and put the godfather on Part II for a DVD player.
