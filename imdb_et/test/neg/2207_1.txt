I'd rather have someone cut my eyes with the razor when I watch this movie again. I looked at it from start to finish, thinking it couldn't get worse. Writers and producers should be defeated to put it on television. The actors are all terrible. Get out of Hollywood to fool you and go to work on McDonald's wiping floors and emptying your trash. Anyone who thinks that this movie is even far off should be hung up. They are embarrassing to humanity. To think that we have soldiers who put a line in their lives, that anyone who produces such a man's garbage. I'm embarrassed that I'm an American.
