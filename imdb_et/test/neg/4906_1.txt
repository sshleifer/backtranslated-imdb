I respect Mike Hodges and liked Get Carter's tremendously prominent prospect, but the Croupier seems just like a dull ITV drama. <br /> <br /> Reserved, cold acting is not just about keeping wires, it's common to all the pain, which means that Owen's character is not in conflict. <br /> <br /> No character makes any feelings at all except boredom. Film termination is at best unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Camera work etc is pretty good, but if you want to see Hodges' best view Get Carter, don't worry about this uninteresting, unimaginable trawl that he covered better than 20 years ago
