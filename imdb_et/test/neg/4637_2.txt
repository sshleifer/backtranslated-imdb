This film has been advertised in Greece for more than three months, which is Greece's biggest production. Well, it may be, but ... If you hear a big production, you expect something new, something else. What you look at is a movie that has no reason. George Corraface looks like he didn't enjoy the movie. His action is so easy that looks almost amateur. Sound, especially when some Turkish actors speak English (dubbed?), Is full of a lift. Fortunately, some of the special effects that show Istanbul and Athens in the late 50s and early 70s are more than digital paintings as computer graphics. Finally, we see the same boy from 1959 (age 5) until 1968 (age 14), but wonderfully he becomes a teenager five years later. "At least one would think there would be some interesting script to get such an expensive production. And everyone gets a love story between 7-year-olds who meet again 40 years later. Oh, there is a political side. A couple of ironic notes '67 -'74 'Greek" junta ", so childish, that seems almost forced. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are a few good things in the movie: most of the actors are big, mostly in the Michael of Michael, the very good terrain and the great music of Evanthia Remboutsika, but they are so small for such expensive production. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: is the film so bad? The truth I don't know. I just know that it doesn't justify its huge budget (Greek standards) in any case.
