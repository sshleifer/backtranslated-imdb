Let me start by saying that I love horror films. A big budget, a low budget, big namesellers, namesellers, doesn't matter. And when it comes to film evaluation, I'm very forgiving. But this movie is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Actors show little or no emotion when transmitting their lines, and the actor is inferior to much lower budgets. If the actors are killed, you can take less care. There is very little gore (I have no idea what kind of movie other observers were watching when they say there is a good gore because it is not) and the special effects are at best inadequate. They steal so many better horror films (Jeepers Creepers, Friday, 13, Leprachaun) and it still doesn't help. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I saw it in Showtime and didn't really have to pay any extra money to view it or waste it on my Netflix queue. There are so many better horror films and I suggest you see them instead of this big fall.
