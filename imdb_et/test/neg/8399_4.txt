... now, please, move on, because it goes to my nerves. <br /> <br /> Seriously, it is behind bright objects such as "My Own Private Idaho" and "To Die For" (and other not so brilliant movies, ie, an unnecessary "Psycho" remake started the experimental phase with "Gerry", which reached its top with a thoughtful "elephant". "Recent days" had some interesting aspects, but it was very uneven, while "Paranoid Park", his new film, is also a beautiful 15 year old who goes around ... and not much more important are some cool references to Fellin (the sound track recovers some beautiful Nino Rota pieces) and the legendary Christopher Doyle's elegant cinematography ("Mood in Love"), but the film is just too artistic and pointless for his own punishment. I don't see anything artistic when I see Gabe Nevins in my underwear or shower, or when Nevins and 13-year-old Taylor Momsen ("How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is a little girlfriend) k) Who plays his cheerleading girlfriend, having sex for the first time, just because he felt they had to do it and after that, he calls his friend to say how amazing it was (and you can say that Nevini face as traumatic it was). Everyone knows that they start earlier and sooner, nowadays films like "Thirteenth" and even "Elephant" themselves (which shows how the lost mind is generally not just about sexuality) have shown it better. Gus tries to be minimalist and artistic, but the end result is just boring and uninteresting. His next project "Milk", which is biological about Harvey Milk starring Sean Penn, will hopefully bring a good old Guse back because, frankly, this is the obsession of juvenile children almost ... scary. 4.5 / 10.
