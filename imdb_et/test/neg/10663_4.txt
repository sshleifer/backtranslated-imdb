Like a nice anecdote to one of the above comments: Mummy was in Mumbai about two weeks before the release of this movie when I was white - to copy some of the lines in this movie recording studio. <br /> While I speak German, I was asked to do all English duplicating scenes, otherwise it would be too confusing for the Indian audience ... So all the Germans in this movie will speak English! funny enough, I did several characters, so if you want to ruin the movie for a while, listen carefully; <br /> <br /> All non-Indian characters have only 4 votes! . . . .
