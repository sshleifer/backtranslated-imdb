This movie was so bad. It wasn't funny at all. Even the sarcastic scenes were not funny. Oh man, bad, so bad. Slightly down. Spoofed, Karate Kid, Teen Wolf, Footloose, Dirty Dancing, Certain Wonderful, Soul Man and probably another or two. Chris Kattan is his worst than a high school keeper who is a talented dancer who heads a dance studio in the store. She has a jealous girlfriend who interrupts her ankle and her dancing place goes to the cute blonde newcomer to whom Chris has eyes. I thought it was very bad. I like to laugh loud comedy, it wasn't one. "No other teenage movie" was funny, but he had a lot of funny scenes than Totally Awesome. "Scary Movie" is a super funny joke. I always laugh when I look at them, very enjoyable. This movie, not funny.
