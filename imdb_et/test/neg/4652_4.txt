In turn, the super-sleazy 'classic' TOOLBOX MURDERS (1978) is considered to be the ultimate horror of Cameron Mitchell. It's a bit slow for my taste, it has zero-pleasant characters and not much action until the end, but Mitchell's dedicated central psychological performance as a vengeance-minded Vincent Rinard is fun. Not Anthony Perkins good, remember, but definitely fun. Like the Hollywood slump, it's just that; if the horror film is just fair. And just as a simple vintage, it's just OK. I am a big fan of the unnecessary free dance series, so I was also grateful for the appearance of Gazzarri dancers who just reign. Five of these T-bones "Do not cry, look for a rainbow" look at the "mad", floor-butterfly, hip-shaking. Watching these women with big smiles on their face in their bluntly covered bikini and parachute ensemble is the key reason why I give it a slightly higher rating, which is usually the case. <br /> <br /> Former movie makeup man Vincent Rinard ("Best of Lon Chaney!") goes after Paragon Studios people. Recall shows how Max Black (Berry Kroeger), jealous and drunk studio executive, took Vinnie's face to the right when he lit the smoke. He has fired into the flames and dives into the pool, but not before intimidating his face and losing his eyeball (not to mention his mystery). Nowadays "World famous" Movieland Wax Design Museum in Buena Park, California has a special serum (described as a mixture of truth serum, nervous system and special "vitamins and minerals ... watch out for Centrum!) To paralyze victims. They disappear and close detectives in the case (led by Scott Brady) are confusing as the museum displays new "shapes". Vince speaks to himself ("I'm a terribly nice man!"), Chained, grumbles, hisses, and describes how he "inspires" the smile. <br /> <br /> He must also deal with a number of spin-offs and self-absorbing witches, most of whom deserve what comes to them. There's also Nick (Hollis Morrison), a cozy, inert museum guide who sees the "shape" flashing, but doesn't go to the police. In addition to Max (a real A-class jerk ... who doesn't even die!) And the foolish policemen are the other two leading roles in women and both are pretty cruel. Marie Morgan (Anne Helm) is not your typical innocent heroine; this tramp has participated in this movie with at least five different characters (!), including Vince, Max and two wax dummies / no male stars (I think he never had time to go to a lost girl). For some reason, he also comes up with Vince's irritating baby's voice to give him a "copy of the head" he has made from the newest acting actor (and groom Number 5) from Tony Deen (Phillip Baird). He doesn't know that Vince has already injected his syringe on the back of his neck, but I love it when Mitchell accepts his demands "so you can completely withdraw from reality." He also wants him to "put" him, which means he has finally been imprisoned. Unfortunately, the box has a hole where its head hits, so we have to continue phonetically attacking its high-level plywood. <br /> <br /> Another "woman" is Theresa (Victoria Carroll), one of the above go-go girls. He has seen for the first time that he is thoroughly rhythmic, sliding on the lime-green bikini stage. Theresa is acceptable before she speaks, but if you realize that her grates are combined with Lorraine Bracco's abrasive and Landers nurses, you want Vincent to inject her with serum as soon as possible. Unfortunately, for the first time, his scene is subjected to endless demands on the studio and runs around the museum trying to avoid Mitchell. He and the rest of the characters are completely atypical, but generally act as a way of entertainment for the Hollywood system. And I'll probably give this film more credit than it really deserves. Pros are little and far away, but contain (after Mitchell's and dance's routine) a colorful, slightly stylized illumination and a strange ending that seems to indicate that Rinard is being punished for his crimes seriously, spending the rest of his life on his personal hell ... Married Marie ! ... Yikes, now it's scary. <br /> <br /> Also directed by John Bud, Cardos (also production manager) police sergeant James Forrest as film director, Virgil Frye, Rini Martin and Kent Osborne bartender. Many of the people who worked on it (including manager and manuscript writer Rex Carlton) also worked for Al Adamson's BLAC OF DRACULA CASTLE and other atrocities. <br /> <br /> My score: 4 out of 10
