This film is shameful. How can you take one of the greatest scientific literature in history and make it a half-loved story. The movie wasn't all about H.G. Wells's story and it doesn't have to be. Eloi was also made completely wrong. They built houses or formed a real society. They don't care at all. It was an important part of the story. How they had formed a world without difficulty or complex emotions. They were barely aware of Morlocks. I don't know why this movie was done the way it was, but some stories should be said when they are alone or alone.
