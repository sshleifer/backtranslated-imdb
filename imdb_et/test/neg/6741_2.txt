I've been watching a lot of TV over the years. So much so that when I see new exhibitions that basically look like old exhibitions, I am offended. Fortunately, I am not too sensitive because all "Hot Properties" are refreshed by "Designing Women" (meaning to make them sexier) and fall in New York instead of Georgia. <br /> <br /> Jokes are more of a TV-14 ish, but it doesn't improve the example. The only thing this show has shown is that Nicole Sullivan is so good that she could have been shown as "My Mother's Car" classic. His comic talents resemble one of today's Lucille Ball - only funny. Unfortunately, the rest is painful and sexy, which can be useful for some brain-free soap, but they're just not funny. <br /> <br /> Fred
