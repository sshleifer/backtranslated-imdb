You expect this to be a minor, but you expect at least a complete and unified film. What waste. I'm extremely disappointed, not just because I watched a bad movie, but with such a great concept, it's the general movie we all saw before. If this crud makes $ 1 for his budget, it would be wise for the studio to declare victory, round out all existing copies, store them deep in the nuclear waste storage facility under Mount Yucca, and never make it again. Most of this movie keeps you thinking, "It's not what I wanted to see." This film pulls out the naughty and maybe teenagers. This is a real shame because most movies are made for this demography. I had much higher hopes for this movie.
