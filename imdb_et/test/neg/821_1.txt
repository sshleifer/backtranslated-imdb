I had already heard Ali Gst Madonna's music video "Music". I think she's always funny. (Actually, he's actually.) Just last year, I always thought to buy "Ali G Indahouse" VCD. That's why I bought it a few months later cheaply and started watching it. My older brother and I expected it to be a great ridiculous comedy. It turns out that "Indahouse" is just a stupid piece of garbage. It was really very bad. It also includes explicit sexual content and very raw humor. Nor did he make me laugh, even a big smile. Be sure to hate this movie. Oh, by the way, I'm going to sell it. <br /> <br /> Ali G was very different in her movie compared to her TV shows - so negatively. Maybe he wasn't really well focused and serious enough to make that flick. Just because there are some sexual scenes, it does not mean that it is funny fun (because sometimes it is no longer too ridiculous). For the first time I was disappointed with her. It was rather sad and happy for me. <br /> <br /> I have given this movie over 10. In fact, I really want to give it 0 ratings. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. I would not recommend to anyone who wants to see good comedies that are not too clear or terrible.
