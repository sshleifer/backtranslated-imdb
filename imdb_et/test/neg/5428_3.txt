Oh God. Why is Nickelodeon having such a hard time even a decent film? This movie may be good, but it was: <br /> <br /> A. Too short B. Rather superficial, stereotypical, and offensive to some C. and very offensive. It has stereotypical colds-fools, glasses, never kissed, mom breaks, etc. Well, maybe the reason a man has never been able to have a girl is because he is gay! Does that mean all gays are nerds? And what's wrong with your mom's friends? The worst part was far from the end. The whole drama of the film, which turned around Zoey, found that Chase loved her, and blah blah blah and then when Chase finally decided to tell her, <br /> <br /> A. she didn't tell her personally because he had come to a typical disturbance, came to B. He tried to send him a message, but his PDA fell to the fountain and died before he received the message. /> End. <br /> <br /> HOW IS LAME ON THIS ????? I mean, why is it that cartoonists can't change anything in this series? So many of us would like to have these two together. Why don't we see that? I mean, are the producers really so creative that they can't think of new issues to go with a series of changes? So they have to stay on the same plot and drawings and do as many episodes they just can use? After a while, it becomes dull and depressing. <br /> <br /> WANT IT NOT AN ACTUAL ROMAN, HOW IT IS! <br /> <br /> Okay, okay? I've done it with my beach.
