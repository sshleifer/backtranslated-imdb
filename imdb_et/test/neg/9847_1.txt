This film attempted to capture the naive idealism that many young teenage girls have fun, friendliness, escape, danger, sex, maturity, and so on. The problem was that it could not create these things at all levels; that is why he couldn't create a decent story around them. I could not follow any part of this story and no reason why I should take care. <br /> <br /> This movie is not about pedophilia at all. Basically, the girl is in love with her sister and her sister is in love with the "men" idea. Although the latter tries to try his love with men, the former sister tries to get back, even "getting". <br /> <br /> The plot is weak, the characters are weak, and its reality was all like an amateur porn movie (without sexual substance).
