"De Dominee" is based on the real Dutch gangster Klaas Bruinsma! In the film he is called Klaas Donkers! I doubt the events in the film have anything to do with what actually happened! But that's not really important! Because it couldn't grab my attention! This movie worshiped me! There is no content and style! The ingredient could have been forgiven if the action was good and the director tried to do something original! Without substance, you must at least bring style or decent work! Don't we have to be entertained? It would have helped if the director had seen more gangster movies! It's obvious he doesn't! Otherwise, he wouldn't have done it the way he did! This movie got a lot of advertising because of the little scandal surrounding Glass Bruinsma and the royal family member of the Netherlands! This scandal has nothing to do with the movie that ever is! Without it, De Dominee would never have been successful! I'm sure of that!
