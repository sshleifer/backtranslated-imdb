The best thing about this movie for me was that Bryan Dick played Rafe and made me melt. Rafe and all her pride made the film valuable, even though I lit up to rise and shout. I've never seen the hottest man. <br /> <br /> - But it's not. <br /> <br /> Title? It's really what it is. They took the beautiful story of Annette Curtis Klause and threw it out. I note all my respect for respect, which in the film is a shortage that has changed and everything else is wrong. <br /> <br /> Sit tight and go here: <br /> <br /> - If RAFE is the son of ASTRID and GABRIEL, and apparently ULF is no longer an ASTRID child, as in the book. And as I recall from the book, RAFE and ASTRID LOVERS were. <br /> <br /> The ASTRID is probably BLOND, unlike the RED HAIR described in the book. I believe the book said it looked like FOX as WOLF. The film also shows that ASTRID is a VIVIAN aunt. <br /> <br /> - Where's AXEL GO? <br /> <br /> -VIVIAN is in the 19th book, where he was 16. <br /> <br /> -VIVIAN and AIDEN meet at college where they both participate in the book. VIVIAN sees AIDEN in his poem "Wolf Change". But according to the film, AIDEN beat his father, fled and now lives in Romania and draws graphic novels. It made me go "With F ** K". <br /> <br /> - There is no "Kelly" in the movie. WHAT MOVESIS KELLI KELLI. In the KELLY book, however, VIVIAN hated. And he also dated AIDEN after their disintegration. Vivian is even going to hit the book and trash his room. <br /> <br /> -GABRIEL is a strikingly similar film on Colombian drugs. And he sounds like no one. His actions were very good, but his appearance kicked me off. <br /> <br /> -VIVANALI had no parents in the movie. His father and mother and two other sisters died in the film. But in her book, when she arrives home one night, her mother, ESME is sitting on the couch after fighting ASTRID over GABRIEL. And VIVIAN doesn't have siblings. Only his father died in the book. <br /> <br /> -VILAN accepts what it is. It really got me. He kills RAFE in a horrible church, stands against VIVIAN and rescues him from other wolves except AIDEN, who strikes him so that they can find medicine and then try to leave the city. WTF?! AIDEN makes a wolf in the book and shouts like a chick, throws stuff on her and panic and jumps out of the window. Then he makes a story that he was trying to break him, and he threw the chair out of the window. It doesn't seem to me acceptable. <br /> <br /> - AIDEN wants her to attack her. In the book, he doesn't want to do anything with VIVAN when he turns to him. Nor does he lovingly hold his face and say he can control it. She cries like a woman because she's her FALSE. <br /> <br /> And the ultimate indignation ... that almost gave my three best friends and I BIRTHDAY OUR SEARCH: <br /> <br /> - The film AIDEN and VIVIAN ran away with VIVAN killing GABRIEL. As she SHOOTS her. GABRIEL dies. * BOOK * not just VIVIAN killed GABRIEL, I believe they will finish. As well, he does not reach AIDEN, he reaches GABRIEL. NOT HIGH. <br /> <br /> Little things were also noticed: Ulf's red hair he gets from Astrid has become brown in the film and Vivian is working in the chocolate shop. Dreadful shock; I am ashamed. The book was not really difficult to follow. When Disney Can Use Random H! School, why couldn't the manager find a random H! <br /> <br /> * I sighed * I was really waiting for this movie, I loved this book, it's sad that it didn't follow it a little. I'll give him 2, just because (if it's at the top of the review) was Rafe (playing Bryan Dick) sexy and Agnes Bruckner did a great job. AND they kept a poem about Steppenwolf with <br /> <br /> love, <br /> <br /> Caitlin
