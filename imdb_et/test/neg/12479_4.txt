There are certain horror teachers whom I have built over the years with so much respect and admiration that they can't tell me what garbage decides to put on the film. Lucio Fulci is definitely one of them, but fucking, he's trying to disappoint me with his later efforts! You can easily afford to leave most of the films staged or produced at the end of the 80s on Fulc's "cat in the brain" because one title collects and repeats the best and absolute material that is at least SEVEN's other Fulci file, including sick murders that performing "When Alice Broke Mirror". All in all, this film is definitely one of the weakest and most meaningless achievements of our director. The script is insecure as hell, the basic assumption is completely unlikely and somewhat stupid and there is no tension to enjoy. I love the title, but it is actually totally pointless. The story contains the name of Alice, but it has only a supporting role and it certainly does not break any mirror. I think he can just break his voice as he is an opera singer, but he is not. The plot revolves around a middle-aged and gambling addicted playboy who spends his days attracting wealthy widows and killing their money. Lester Parson's meat workers (as well as unwanted witnesses) in strange ways make steaks out of their juicy body parts and feed the rest of their remains on their cats. There is also a silly psychological sub-section where he thinks that his shadow is responsible for murder instead of him. The Difference "When Alice Broke the Mirror" and some of Fulci's biggest horror movies ("The Beyond", "Living Dead", ??) lie in not disturbing the characters, including Lester, are colorless and boring and murders are usually illustrated as it is the most common thing in the world to put a woman's head in a microwave or run over the human body repeatedly with a car. I think Lucio deliberately made a movie to protest all the harsh critics who don't like his repertoire, no matter how much spirit and effort he put in, it is obvious that enjoying here is just outrageous gore and bloodshed because even an attempt to blend in with black comedy swing his chainsaw and cut off women's legs, "when Alice broke the mirror" is a terrible fear of entertainment, but besides, there is not much to recommend.
