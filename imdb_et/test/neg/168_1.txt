This is one of the most frightening movies I've ever seen, apparently surpassing only the terrible and completely pointless blueberry. How can Harald Zwart even put his name on this mess. I feel that every ounce of respect I had for him has fallen so quickly. <br /> <br /> What is this movie that makes it so poor? Is this a story? Yes, yes. Is it an actor? Yes, yes. This is the whole look and feel of the movie? Yes, yes. <br /> <br /> Start the story, my God! It's like a clich√©-driven and predictable, like what you expect from drunk 14-year-olds who write their paper late in writing. What I did this summer. Sensitive features that the creators are trying to achieve completely completely drowned when we suffer from another embarrassing turn of the story. <br /> <br /> Actors are amateurs, I know and so we cannot assume they are of the same quality as professional participants. But in order for it to work, the characters must be charming and / or funny (preferably both) so that the viewers do not mind embarrassing action, or maybe even add characters. In this case, not even close to the child! You start remembering the characters and at the end of the movie (I think it's about 90 minutes long, though it seems like it's 4 hours) you have a strong desire to hurt to get their thoughts about their annoying fools! The sense of humor in this movie experiment should not be successful unless you really are like those fools. Their previous lack of talent and credibility in the way of doing things only makes stupid and too simple scenes more difficult on the ground. Even the family of the people involved find it hard to find, but very embarrassing (rather, my sister would be stupid on American Idol). <br /> <br /> Finally, why cram a number of inappropriate Norwegian celebrities? If possible, they look beyond the actors. These celebrities cameos just to add an inexpensive feeling to the movie and are in itself a beautiful review in the dark trying to fix something even before it starts. <br /> <br /> I can't even start emphasizing how much I look at the color rather than ever watching this movie again ...
