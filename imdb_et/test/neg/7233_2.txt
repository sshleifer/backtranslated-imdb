I bought this movie on a DVD for 4 pounds, but it was a waste, the movie is very bad. The plot is your average monster movie, where he kills some people, the mayor / leader does not believe it and they fight at the end. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, film quality is very good and the New York setting is impressive for a budget movie - unlike small coastal areas. Action is also sensible. <br /> <br /> However, the special effects, ridiculous in the foreground of the monster movie, and the inclusion of a random bus load on the children 's plot are just odd. The end is just bad. <br /> <br /> In summary, if you have the opportunity to see it, then no - there's something better. <br /> <br /> RTC "Real Horror Movies Not PG Ratings"
