This movie hangs from ever made mobster / gangster movie. MP Da Last Don has a reference to every movie. Action was by far the worst thing I've seen. Who the hell is John Mario anyway? His actions were the worst I've ever seen. He makes the bad actors good. When Master P goes, he sells faster than the N * synchronous concert. I really wish I was there to tell the whole production company: WHAT IS YOU DEFINED WHEN IMPLEMENTATION IS? "Obviously, these people are so fixed to the gangster image that they decided to make a movie and live their gangster. One thing I know is that there was no one who wanted to distribute this movie, so it seems (and how predictable) that NO LIMIT boys had to start, NO LIMIT FILMS. This movie is terrible and it doesn't deserve to be called a movie!
