(This review is based on the English version) <br /> <br /> Orson Welles' legendary unfinished epic was just that - unfinished. It should have been such that it would not be clumsy in the cumbersome material that was compiled. <br /> <br /> Although I am sure that this was done with the best intentions, filmmakers are not only able to understand Welles' vision correctly, they have also been able to do this when it created this version for the audience. The newly dubbed voices are not only weak, but also inconsistent - Welles' original recordings (using his voice as he often did) have retained a handful of scenes and they don't respond at all. There has been no consistency. It is accompanied by an extremely empty sound mix that has only a minimal sound effect and an atmosphere - a long sequence during a huge festival (including the running of bulls), as it was recorded on an abandoned suburban street with about three people. A number of crowds designed to be in thousands. <br /> <br /> But the real problem is that Don Quixote was incomplete, and that is obviously obvious. The film consists of a handful of scenes that are put together and pulled into ridiculous lengths just to make working time. The case - the sequence in which Sancho is looking for Don Quixot is going on forever. It's just Sancho, who is approaching the crowd and asking them the same questions over and over - it is by no means possible that Welles should ever have used every shot as a whole, but it is here. It lasts more than twelve minutes, if in fact the absolute maximum value of the film was likely to last for about two minutes. <br /> <br /> Although the start of the movie is relatively complete and quite well done, the rest of the massive holes that you just can't fill with Spanish endless cover and even more Don Quijote & Sancho shots back and forth. There is also no end. There is no resolution, no conclusion, no point, no point. <br /> <br /> Although private collections have no material for filmmakers, it couldn't take into account what would be needed to make it complete and coherent. Welles just did not stop shooting, largely due to the fact that his leadership died before they could stop. <br /> <br /> However, ignoring the fact that it was not complete, and never, one would think that a masterpiece of material that could have been sufficient would be sufficient to see the collection of material. Unfortunately, it all leaves so much that it leaves the film with a very negative impression. Particularly, what Akim Tamiroff clearly outlined from Sancho is a completely new voice and a long, drawn-out scene that ultimately causes him to be irritated. <br /> <br /> Orson Welles' vision of this movie was much more ambitious and more complicated than just repeating Don Quixote's story, but what's been trying here is so lost. The only person who could have collected all the material for anything valuable would have been Welles himself, and he didn't. <br /> <br /> The video could have been much better used in the documentary of the whole saga. Welles is trying to make a movie. Welles himself got the perfect title for such a document: "When do you stop Don Quixote?"
