When I saw this movie, it was already a forced choice because my original intention was sold out. what was then sharp, this film is so bad that I hardly carry it. The story is not worth noting, the gay goalkeeper forms a gay football team to play against his old straight team, who gave him a hard time discovering his sexual orientation. Loaded with unbearably old and overwhelming gays, the thin plot is a perfect advocate of the plot ... it's amazing that actors like Dietmar BÃ¤r or Charly Hyper waste their talents and time on this mess. 1/10
