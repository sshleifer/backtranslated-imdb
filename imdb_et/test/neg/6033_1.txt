It has a slower fight scene. When I was a veteran of any war, I'd cry when I see this movie, not because I remember staying in Vietnam, but because it's a bad performance for this war veteran. Even if troops carry M16, this film resembles something from Vietnam. Viet Cong even uniforms look like old Japanese uniforms from WWII movies. The device is obviously a modest back of Hollywood. The worst scene includes a US soldier who is fighting for a "hand on hand" like a bad martial film. After he has sent several enemy forces, he says, "Come down here and let go!" helicopter in the air. Then he will be released. This movie is a trash.
