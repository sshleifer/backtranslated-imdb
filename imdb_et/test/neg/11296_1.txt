One year for the worst theater films, if not all the time. Anthony Hopkins even hits this joke. I can't believe that David Mamet and Ridley Scott's name will appear on this travestine. The best career for Jody Foster has ever done it. Julianne Moore was as emotional as female Keanu Reeves. Gary Oldman was, of course, his brilliant self. He is a Hannibal exhausted victim and make-up is so good, I didn't know it was Gary up to the final credits. but eaten in cattle? Leave me alone! The rumor is that he didn't want to mention his name in the credits. And baking and feeding your brain to Ray Liotta ... I laughed at this absurdity, not doing that stupidity at this point. I have not seen so many people coming out of the movie, who is this girl. <br /> <br /> Pay someone else if you need to, but leave it ALL COSTS !!!
