Most of this movie was okay, a sequel to the sequel to the sequel ... <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the amount of intercourse there was; I was actually expecting the window to be split for gore, gore, gore. It was not, but there is some pretty ridiculous death. <br /> <br /> What I did not like was all the complications of the plot. These could have been okay if the scriptwriters had all explained them. But what was the purpose of the secret society's secret society? Why did they protect Michael from harm for a while? What exactly did they do to the child? How did Jaime Lloyd get pregnant because of this? Why lock him for 20 years to get pregnant? Why did Michael kill all his conspirators? Why were you in the lab? The actors showed that they had "hoped everything out" when they saw what they saw. But it has never been explained to the audience. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie to see people get nervous, that's okay for you. If you can't throw a plot that remains unresolved at the time of rolling the credit, you should go see something else.
