I've never seen a movie so terribly that I've gone crazy. It was a great waste of time to see this filthy movie. There are a lot of things I hate about this movie: The songs are so terrible (still a little memorable), I hit my head on the wall (especially from the song "Grandpa begins to put out the court, which hit 10 times * shrugs *), character design and it Evil, Greedy and Bitchy Cousin Mel. <br /> <br /> I can't stand him for a second, he must be one of the toughest people I've seen. Even if I like his southern voice. <br /> <br /> The only bright side is that Austin Bucks is played by a person who is the voice of Metal Gear Solid's liquid snake. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend people to watch for the holidays because it was a huge stigma with x-mas.
