We apologize for this spoilers. But if you still want to read: I really don't know why so many people in Kevin Williamson are so high. Let's just look at our work as a scriptwriter, do we? There's Scream 1 and 2 (plus the story next), which I find pretty funny but very overpriced. Besides, turning Scream into a franchise, he stopped unchanging from the horror movie parody and became just another. Then I know what you did last summer, which is essentially the same film. He also wrote Halloween: H20, but even he had no point in taking credit for what he did with this monster. Then the faculty I can only say was terrible. (A lot of fun to do). Don't let me start off with the ridiculous, soap operative Dawson's Creek, I could hurt how bad it was for an hour. Then we'll teach Mrs Tingle. First, there are many tons of unlikely. For example: In most colleges I know, valedictorian is not the only one to go to the cavity! The idea that Katie Holmes's character would never be anywhere she was not a false culprit was absurd. Have you ever heard of financial aid, hell? I also don't think you can get out of high school or get to college because one attempt is deceiving. There are a lot of others, but now you're gonna get big. The end brought me to bother: they committed a crime, but it was okay because the teacher was a bitch. Great. Do you know how many of my teachers can rob me under this logic? I am sure the police never made any statement to find out the whole story. This would certainly not be necessary. Helen Mirren was fine, she added a nice beauty to a character who (as the previous comment noted) had no reason to do it. And has anyone noticed that Katie Holmes can't do anything? His independence became incredibly annoying. "You wanted me to fail. Blah blah blah." His last two scenes with Mrs. Tingle were the worst. The only reason I regret losing $ 8.25 for this disaster is that he was beaten a little. No, wait, I regret losing money: it was not real and he survived. Mr Williamson, if you read it, you have made the same film (some of the violence and / or intimidation things compensated by wise children who make sarcastic jokes and references to other films) just a little too many times (I think so 6, not Scream 3 and following), and I would really appreciate it if you stop. Otherwise, I can just rob you and threaten you. Okay? :-)
