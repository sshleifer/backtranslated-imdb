In summary, how stupid this film is with two details: Arnold Antichrist: "Let's see who's the most meaningful" by saying directly to the face. And you can say they're not trying to be funny. <br /> <br /> How does Arnold fight all evil evil? <br /> <br /> Blessed water, crucifix, priest. .nooo! with bazooka, Satan doesn't even expect them to be so wise. <br /> <br /> After an interesting start (which reminds you of a fucking lawyer) it won't go anywhere. Someone takes me these two hours back from my life. Never look at it, rent it, not buy it. <br /> <br />
