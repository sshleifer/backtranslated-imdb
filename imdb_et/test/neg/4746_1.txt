If I had only read Alex Sander's (sic) review here, instead of looking at the rating of more than six categories with the chosen ignorance of the public choice, I would not have seen this contempt. Alien was a fantastic, dramatic and well-made horror / sci-fi. Predator was a great sci-fi / action mess-about. I really only have to blame when I saw Alien versus Predator. Also, on average, this site has an average of over 6 stars from well-known movie witnesses. /> <br /> From the beginning, this film was ridiculous. No explanation was given to the aliens for crossing / crossing the Predator ship. OK, so suddenly they started to hunt aliens again on Earth and something went wrong, but how did this result in a foreign / Predator hybrid and why didn't the rest of the team understand it before, despite its great technology? The beginning was actually the most cohesive and interesting part of the film because we had the idea of ​​who was who or what and what and why. Since then, it really becomes ridiculous. I always keep my disbelief strictly at the door of the screen before entering and leaving it. I couldn't get here. <br /> <br /> Father and son in the woods in the forest. Damaged ship accidents land (from this perspective) to calculate at least 10 pairs of miles away through a thick forest. The man and the boy watch there alone and find the ship and get the face. Even at this point, you feel very little for them, mainly because the face hugs are comic rather than frightening your movements and activities, and the father seems to be such an irresponsible, stupid reddish muppet. The thriller-type scenario is presented with an ex-con, which returns to the city near the crash site to fulfill its somewhat emotional, troublesome bus friend. When I said in the introduction, I mean a weak experiment with nonsense actors and no feeling. The Sassher / horror element is then introduced to a sexy girl and is conventionally claimed to be a nerdy or somehow undesirable cute boy who is beaten by defensive, crazy, nasty jock (American athlete is not a Scottish man). Oh cute / not cute boy is otherwise ex-con brother. Yes, they are the smart brothers of the director, whose name I am studying, to avoid any other guilt they put out again. Then the modern role shift is so dull with a PC, the introduction of the Ripley proxy type signs is accompanied by a female soldier who returns to her husband and child. <br /> <br /> Guess what happens next? I'm not going to tell you much more about the real thing (smiles for sadness, when he has told about the disappearance of storytelling from most recent films) just when you are so far away and not the brightest star in the Alien-knotted universe <br /> > Predator is stupid for the reasons given in the previous poster, whose post is too late. Aliens are bored. Predator-Alien is ridiculous. Activities are sometimes exploitative, free and disgusting. Hospital scene with pregnant mothers?!?! Oh, I was surprised. Disappointed, how small people go, what to get? Scaring? Some shock? For perverse titration? What? If you really wanted to shock, bother, and intimidate people who are not pregnant or waiting for fathers, or who have no soul, why not just strangers / Predator fret instead of killing rodents and teenage girls? Characters have no depth or drawing. It's filmed and the temple is bad. It works by non-interested people, not that I can blame them. It enriches two more interesting and good sci-fi characters. This movie was garbage and if you enjoy it, I have to worry about you seriously. If you haven't seen it, please make your own decision. <br /> <br /> PS Did I even mention how trained soldiers are killed in about 20 seconds when amateur civilians live all the time?
