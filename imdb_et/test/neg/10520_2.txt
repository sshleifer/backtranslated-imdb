"Air Bud" dirty burst, this movie really is that parents worry too much about their parents. All character fans (such as adult coaches who do not know this game) are taken to the extreme - so much that they are absolutely unbelievable, not funny. <br /> <br /> There is no reality here. , people and you do not compassion for ALL characters. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film is the good-looking sets (uniforms) of the opposing team in the first game the dog plays. Maybe it was because the device is said to be close to Arlington Heights, IL, the home of Columbus Crews franchisee Brian McBride.
