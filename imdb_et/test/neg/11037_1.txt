I've been reading IMDb comments for some time. The average 8.3 in this movie is just my nerves. I don't want to pull one of them "I just signed up for an account so I could post this movie" bitte ..... but I just did. The only thing you leave this movie is that the incest doesn't deserve ridicule. <br /> <br /> Now, I realize that many "love" movies love this movie; however, it is crap. What I really like is that the director expects you to have compassion for the "cable" movie. If you have sexual relations with your sister, you should be out of society. I just think of my personal feelings. But I was sitting for 2 hours of this * exploding *, waiting for a really deep reason behind Dae-Soo's imprisonment. <br /> <br /> I tend to like a lot of foreign movies, but it's my first meeting with Korea to slip and it's the latest in my book. Oh ... I feel better after a little breath.
