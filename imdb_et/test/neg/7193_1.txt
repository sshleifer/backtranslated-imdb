Do not worry. This film seems so tired, the actor is both old-fashioned and plot and drabid so it should be looked at instead of looking. It's really a terrible waste of movies; Stereotypes, clich√©s, crap and amateur film. I looked at it incredibly frightened by the mouth. How could such a film be made and more interesting, how could anyone find it funny or traceable? Old, tired, sloppy ... younger-high skit, at best. There's nothing to watch out for, except for a very old movie. Not a good movie, but an ancient one. It's not Abbott and Costello, nor Laurel and Hardy. This is pointless. The action is so bad that it may be worth watching to laugh. Some movies are so bad that they are good. But it goes all over the corner and again bad.
