It's hard to imagine what they were thinking about making this movie (ie, writers, directors, producers, actors, editors, etc.). Christopher Plummer, 129 film veteran, obviously despises more motivation than other actors to collect wages. I think there is nothing wrong with that, but when they are paid it doesn't mean that someone has to look at it. <br /> <br /> This is a mistake to me that this movie is really a good review. Art? If you want to go to the art gallery, don't look at this movie. Comedy? See Flintstones again, for the same plot with less time wasted. <br /> <br /> Dabney Coleman gives your normal performance better or worse. And some young actors could have a good experience of making this movie. But Plummer ?? It was embarrassing to look at his performance, in fact I had a positive picture throughout the film, knowing that it was the fame of the Plummer of Music of Music! I see in my biology that he called the sound of music "mute sound" so he thought he didn't like as many as 100 million people who liked it. <br /> <br /> I don't know if he was asked today how you would appreciate the sound of music compared to what he says .....? <br /> <br /> Probably something like "where the money is".
