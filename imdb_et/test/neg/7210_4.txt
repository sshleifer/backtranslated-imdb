Only the classic ROADHOUSE is followed only by the DEA agent (John Schaech), who rescues his uncle (Will Patton) when his uncle is badly beaten by a local drug group led by its wooden Indian India. actress Jake Busey. Gang wants to take over the bad boy's bar for bad reasons. Patrick Swayze is very much here. Schaech is an indifferent actor who is not persuasive as the ass. The struggles here are intermittent and not nearly as vigorous or cruel as ROADHOUSE. Finale is equally weak. Some beautiful women keep things a little. The Daisy Duke type, which is convenient for both fists and weapons, is a terrible fight and Busey's, with a handy tool. At first there is a little dressed gal who is co-author of Schaech, but unfortunately he never comes again in the film. Damage. He makes Schaech a short lap, which was under my full attention. If nothing else, ROADHOUSE 2 will start with a strip club that goes closer to what the real strip looks like in the club, which is any movie. The rest is the slowdown time.
