I wanted to like this movie, but there is very little. It begins with the song of Jean Stapleton and Randy Newman in Iowa (Northwest Iowa, I think), recalling Norman Lear's cold Turkey, one of the best films ever made, according to IMDb people. So far, it's okay. And the idea that Archangel Michael lives in Pansy Milban's motel on earth? Give her a chance, this should be a comedy. Okay, so good so far. But Michael does things that the angel did not fall into, and it completely breaks any credibility that the film might have. Other characters in the movie are not great either. Michael brings the dog back to life and we should be. People make tasty paintings. Finally, Stapleton dances with Travolt. Great thing. If he were smart, he wouldn't even be in that movie. When it was over, I thought, "Gee, what a stupid, tasteless, boring, dirty, frustrated movie!" It is not suitable for children or others.
