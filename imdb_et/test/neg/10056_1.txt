Arizona was mostly filmed by a foreign team, "Nightkill" is one of the biggest crime dramas I've ever seen. Robert Mitchum (in a cowboy hat) has recently looked around for Jaclyn Smith, hoping to see if he had a hand on his man's death. Jacly's wardrobe is from Dale Evans, and her dog is called "Cowboy" ... it seems like someone was sure to buy an American myth that all Westerners are talking and dresses like John Wayne's descendants! The scenario of Joan Andrei and John Case may have worked better when approaching the parody; this mysterious thriller is just playing taming, director Ted Post is sleeping in the chair. Don't draw the art of Jaclyn's screaming box in the shower. He's really in the shower in this movie, but it's not revealing (nor a dusky plot). NO STARS from ****
