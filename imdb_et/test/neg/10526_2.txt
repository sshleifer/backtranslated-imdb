I thought this film had an interesting name and maybe it would have been a way of thinking, but was it wrong. This movie was boring, especially in the beginning and middle. I can't comment on the end because I couldn't hold on to the whole movie. There is no point in assuming that a student researcher is simply signing up to go to his laboratory. This student had an interesting mobile robot type in her apartment and unfortunately this unforgettable thing is more interesting than the characters in this movie. So if you have sleep problems, I suggest you rent this movie.
