The biography of the mostly living doctor "Robert Merivel" (Robert Downey), who is on his way to the first half of the film in the Royal Palace and then assists in the second half, mainly "Katharine" (Meg Ryan). <br /> <br /> The HEA - a fantastic set (ie a lush king's palace) and a costume make it a visual treat. The language is also very tame. Ian McKellen and Hugh Grant offer interesting support. <br /> <br /> BAD - After 50-60 minutes, this movie just gets too boring. It was urgently needed for some spark in one hour, but it does the opposite: it pulls on and on. The script definitely needed the necessary "recovery," say? The film may sound nice, but it's a long two hours to sit ..... for too long.
