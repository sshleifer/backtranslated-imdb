Red glasses <br /> <br /> I loved Avalon, I think this director has made some fantastic visions of the future. But this film was a boring pretentious mess. The Open Scene showed a great promise that the cover design and description allow for a surreal life activity amimae style future noir. I feel I got it with Avalon. <br /> <br /> With red glasses, I was only forced to feel uncomfortable when I wished this hell was. The film didn't make me understandable and I couldn't care less about the people in it. That would be fine if the film was an effective art. The scene of the opening seemed interesting and the scene where the giant machine gun was kept in the rain was cool, but it did not look at the movie worth watching. <br /> <br /> Slightly down.
