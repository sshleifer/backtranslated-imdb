This movie is not comedy. It's not even funny "this movie is so bad that it's a funny" department. Rather, it is just bad. Other reviewers mention bad lighting, but further away there is bad plastic surgery. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, many great acting talents were wasted in the direction of a bad scenario and uninspired. The main characters are one-dimensional and boring. (Whichever one is hard to feel compassion). It's also hard to see four characters close friends. It seems that only one woman is thrown away, pretending to be close. <br /> <br /> I do not list all the problems associated with this movie because it does not deserve the attention of someone. (It is also not worth the time to watch it).
