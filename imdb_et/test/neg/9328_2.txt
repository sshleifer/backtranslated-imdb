Well, after seeing "Beginning," I wondered why they burned Schrader's version of hell and made it poor. But now, having seen "Dominion", I understand this decision deeply. Even they didn't get that much better. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but this movie is really crap. Some good moments, but a really boring story and some bigger plot holes kill this movie. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of exoriginal story in its forerunner, which can be built a lot and give references to what the audience wants to see. But there is so much in the movie. Impacts are really bad - not even TV standards.
