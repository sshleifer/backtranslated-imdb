This film obviously had good intentions. Finally, the name of Kellie is dedicated to someone who, as a viewer, can only assume that it is similar to a film-like situation. Maybe he made the wrong choice. This dedication is ONLY the quality of love and suicide. <br /> <br /> Film becomes unbearable from opening sequence. If the viewer is already annoying the film for only about five minutes, it is pretty much downhill after ... what it was. I know the movie was a low budget and the camera shots were actually pretty good ... unfortunately, everything was terrible. Functional, plot, sound quality, picture quality ... acting. I'm sorry, but acting is terrible. Over terrible. Just as the actors try to act like the people who are acting. This is the only way to think about it. As I looked, I actually photographed the script towards the production. No movement was natural and no reaction from the characters matched each other. In short, the timing is OFF. The timing of the whole movie is far away. I'm not a director, so I know the boundaries of my knowledge, but I feel that some ways had to pass by the time ... until they explained that graduation wasn't too far away, I had the impression that the first part of the movie had taken place in a week. .. maximum of six. <br /> <br /> All of this is said to be a shame. This film could have been very unfortunate. All the moments of the film where we should know something are obvious, but only because the structure is obvious (which is bad). Moving scenes fell completely. For example, if Kaye's brother takes his head and puts it on himself, we should feel that he has understood him, the innocence and protection of his brother's love ... somehow it just doesn't come out of it. Such scenes are so many (for example: ALL fighting scenes) and everything they do is away from the movie. All these things put together, Love & Suicide comes out as one long, cheesy, low-budget commercial.
