This movie made me so angry! Here I mean, here's a new movie, one sense of intelligence, and then the movie starts. Should I Go For Landscape, Line Delivery, Costume, Fake Award? There are better dialogues out there. I understand the concept behind the indie movie, but my goodness, it was not just an indie, it was a high school book report that was made with the camera and all friends and loved ones. This is one movie that was doomed from the very beginning. Perhaps it would be a film instead of a millennium in 1982. However, it seems to me that someone hung a stone around this neck of the albatross and it sank at a constant speed.
