It's really the worst film I've ever seen in my life (I'm going 47)! The description on the back of the cover was equal to the scrolling text right at the beginning of the movie. The further plot was zero and even a bunch of corpses would have shown more "life". I looked at its full length and it was really relaxed when the last death of the character signaled the end of his suffering! The location was either a vault or a dirty beach. I think the home video was a camera and the lighting was substandard. Dialogues were unnecessary and meaningless. Like the participants. What brings me to the "make-up" theme: they saw some of my teenagers' "first own make-up" or similar tricks. What made me buy a DVD was the name "Lovecraft" printed on the cover. The only connection with the work of this brilliant mind was the use of the name "Necronomicon", which was misinterpreted as the "Book of Light". The â‚¬ 4.70 I paid for this DVD was a complete loss because the DVD went into the recycling box without any additional help.
