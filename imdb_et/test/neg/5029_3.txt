Film is nothing but nudity. Has anyone noticed that all three main female characters are naked? It seems that the only winner of the Portuguese filmmakers is the nudity of the local stars (if not many) with the slang that is otherwise in fear in today's Portuguese society. When you watch Portuguese film advertising on Portuguese TVs, they all have added a "hot" scene from the movie. I am in no way saying that Portuguese society is alienated; just that the film industry can't find other ways to succeed. Going back to the movie ... There's nothing in the book that's a masterpiece. The film could have been good if the actual idea of ​​the book (reality at any time) was emphasized, not the strictly erotic part. It was almost all the ingredients ... but the "cook" was terrible ...
