I'm used to being patient with movies because I've generally found that it usually costs. But some of the work takes a new level and come into the field of provocation .... "Last year's Marienbad" comes to mind. Well, "Pola X" is not "last year in Marienbad". On the one hand, I can count on the number of films I have gone through over the years. "Pola X" achieved membership in this August group. In my defense, I believe I bravely made my ground hoping things would change. Finally, I threw a little 90-minute mark into a shame that was quite respectable in this situation. "Pola X" is not going to live anywhere until Carax's earlier work promise. After a ten-year break, it must be bitter for her. Melville still spits in his grave!
