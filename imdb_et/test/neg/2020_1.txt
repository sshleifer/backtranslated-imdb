Heaven. And here I thought Uwe Boll had no worse directors. <br /> <br /> Imagine how many decisions you need to shoot. Conceptual approval. Writing a script. Editing a dialog. Casting. Set and proportion. Location selection. Acting. Timing. Cinematography. Lighting. Music. Audio and video editing. Direction. <br /> <br /> Now imagine that one of these decisions is wrong. <br /> <br /> Hit: Dracula 3000. <br /> <br /> For a movie that has been allegedly placed in the 2900s, this movie looks surprisingly like a cheap gangsta flick of the 1970s. The set is ridiculous during this time. Dialogue is cruel. The timing of each scene is ridiculous. The action is beyond the abysmal. Everything stinks. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, props. If you have a movie on a spacecraft that was built in 2900, how likely is it to have open oil pipelines and hydraulic doors in the 1960s? What, technology hasn't changed for 900 years? 'Professor' uses a computer on a standard tandy keyboard and for fixing a radio transmitter. What, they haven't found voice control yet? Of course, it is associated with Prof wheelchair. Wheels. Although you know that they have an intergalactic walkthrough ... but probably not even a motorcycle wheelchair, much less floating, or bionic feet or anything. And apparently, this merchant ship wore an intergalactic shipment of rosewood corpses. How convenient. Then there are weapons - the team carries standard 20th century firearms. Ship. Space in vacuum, where one bullethole would kill them all. Nice plan, prop department. <br /> <br /> Why go.
