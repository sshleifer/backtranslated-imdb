Movies just don't get worse. Terrible plot, terribly timed, pathetic characters and effects and yes it uses B standards. <br /> <br /> And guys: Nothing, this movie is not terrible, a few scenes that could have been big but you won't get anything but no construction. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't want anyone, a terrible movie, it was bad; plot, functioning, "B" taste, special effects and everything else. Plus no naked or erotica boys or girls.
