First, how can one of his creativity right to believe in such a film. I saw this movie and after a few hours my head was scratching what exactly the director says. <br /> <br /> If it is a thriller, there is no excitement if his action is not an activity that prevents the chase of chasing, there is no drama and much talk of love, it never really rises. No passion, no emotion. <br /> <br /> In fact, I did not expect a miracle from the movie, but after he had opened the bumper, I thought of giving it a chance. I have no problems with Himesh Reshamiya, and I'm not one of the boys who subdue him whenever possible. I was open minded and came out. <br /> <br /> Don't put Himesh Reshamiya in charge, he's just a debut actor. However, direction, scenario, writing, makeup, everything has gone to throw. <br /> <br /> Himesh is very stiff and takes time to get out of the curve. He can do this type of roles. Hansika is just a baby, and it shows your baby's fat and how it walks on the screen. <br /> <br /> The only actor who was good was Himeshi's friend in the movie, I don't know his name, but he looks promising. <br /> <br /> Look at it at your own risk, not even looking at it over time. <br /> <br /> ** We recommend that you avoid this movie. **
