If that were possible, I would have given this excusable excuse for the ZERO star movie. It was far worse than I have ever seen. It would be like a home video that some dull high school students decided to make fun. "Functional" was terrible. "Participants" did not even react to being murdered. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I bought this movie erroneously. The Spanish title said Jeepers Creepers 3, so I thought hmm maybe it's okay. Wrong. It was honestly the worst. I didn't get a fool of the last 20 minutes. I missed the chapters and didn't seem interesting. <br /> <br /> Camera players were also terrible. It was like a home movie. I'd never want to see anyone. Terrible scary movie.
