The most pleasant parts of this movie were the original movie clips. Action was bad, and reluctance was a prerequisite for sexual scoreboards. Effects were at best marginal at best. There were no exhibitions, Amy Irving was put on this movie to try and become part of the Halloween H20 audience. The original was much more enjoyable and more enjoyable. I'm sorry to say it's not one of the ten best years ... so far it's at the bottom of my list. Don't worry about this people!
