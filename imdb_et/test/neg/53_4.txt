I can't get it! "Horror Star" teenagers are supposedly all committed to horror fans, but when their favorite idol (Conrad Radzoff) goes away, they dig their body and do all kinds of disrespectful things like discotheque around the house and throw away food. It doesn't sound like something real horror fans do now? I am a big horror fan and I have immensely idolize left icons like Vincent Price, Peter Cushing and Boris Karloff, but it would never seem to me to laugh at their memory. No wonder Conrad comes back from the dead? yes, after s√©ance? Wipe them all off the earth! Mr. Radzoff was not already known for his friendliness because he sometimes killed directors who did not agree with his visions, and even after his death a huge ego suffers. Even within your grave, there are video footage to mitigate potential visitors, and the teenage group is experiencing a lively experience of being murdered outside their movie sets. "Horror Star" ("terrifying" and "Body Snatchers") is a pretty flat 80s horror strike, but there's a handful of cheesy & gory highlighting. The film mainly carries its fool because no one? not even a film student? is stupid enough to steal a recently buried body and actually think he's going to get away with it and there are too many tedious moments to fight. Conrad's video calls away from the grave are too talkative and will certainly undermine tension, but on the other hand his methods of killing are pleasantly resourceful. One teenager enjoys the experience of cremation alive and another (Jeffrey Combs in one of his first roles!) Loses his head in an amazing decapitation sequence. In absolute prominence, the poor girl crushes the head of the coffin. Writer / director Norman Thaddeus Vane wanted to bring a vintage fear cinema and he obviously made the film innocent. Locations and landscapes are great, but Vane did not have the necessary tools to provide proper film continuity and editing. Functional performances are universal, as Ferdy Mayne (imitating Christopher Lee) and Jeffrey Combs offer the most memorable roles. "Horror Star" can hardly be called black-or-even good movies, but it's worth watching if you're an enthusiastic fan of B-horror.
