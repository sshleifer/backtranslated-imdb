L'Auberge Espagnole is less funny and less interesting than any Dobie Gillis episode. Where are their Bob Denver? Do they even have Dwayne Hickman? French man moves to Barcelona for classes. He moves with other students who are no longer interesting than themselves, and they do and say interesting things. This movie is incredibly fun. The only bright place was a pretty French girl who played Belgian lesbian. He puts his hands behind his head and exposes shaved armpits, not the usual dark, smelly hair. But naked underarms don't make a good movie. L'Emmerdeur was funny, so was La Cage aux Folles. L'Auberge Espagnole and Le Placard make you think about what goes wrong with French comedy.
