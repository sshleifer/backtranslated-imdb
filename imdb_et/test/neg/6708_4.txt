This movie starts with this horrible song that gave me some chills like "Nightmare on Elmstreet"! It immediately creates the mood! The following sequence also shows what to expect! We are aware that there is a ghost! The secret to this ghost is what keeps this movie together! But the structure of the plot is so complex that it's hard to understand! The ideas behind the plot are quite interesting! Only as we have been told is too abstract! I understand that the director thought he had to keep the secret for as long as possible! The problem is that if certain issues become clear, you will never get a satisfactory explanation! Important character motifs are omitted and some of the issues raised in the movie do not match at all! Because we don't have enough characters, caring for them is hard! And consequently you lose interest! Only a few fears and twists will save the complete failure of this movie! Twist is an interesting but not a real shock! An experienced viewer will see it coming! Some reviewers complain that this movie is too much like "Ring" and is not at all original! Well, it's true that some effects and fears are borrowed from this movie! But the main difference is! "Ring" was based mainly on the turn where the viewer explains how the characters are killed! In "Ryeong" ("Ring" as) twist is used for horrible effects accompanied by another crazy twist! "Ryeong" is heavily dependent on a complex structured plot and twist that does not contain enough fear to keep your interest! Simply put: it's not a scary movie!
