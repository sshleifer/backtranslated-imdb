No, no, no, no, no, no, no! It's not a movie, it's an excuse for people to dance. It's not just good. Even dancing is slow and not semi-entertaining than mediocre "Dirty Dancing", not to mention other good dance movies. <br /> <br /> Is this a love story? Is it musical? Is it a drama? Is this a comedy? It is not that this movie is a bit of everything, it is that this movie does not succeed in everything it tries to be. The film becomes even more meaningless as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> Action is terrible on every side, the scenario is trying to tell us something, but it can't fail. <br /> <br /> WATCHING ATTENTION - When Patrick Stewart enters the scene and you think the film can make the mood lighter. One second.
