Does anyone remember BRAVEHEART? He played Mel Gibson, who also led and wrote Randall Wallace. The film contains over 200 errors. Does anyone remember GREEN BERET? It is in the western part of John Wayne, where the Duke records a Vietnamese farm from community tribes. If you look like we were SOLDIERS, you can help these two movies, but remind them. <br /> <br /> First of all, there are four in the movie three times when you count the final credits? I mean, what's the connection between Scotland and Nam? Maybe Wallace uses in vain the hope that because BRAVEHEART was bombarded - I could add violently - with several Oscars, so this movie could be like that? Regardless of why it is added, the jars really do. Gibson plays Hal Moore as a cross between William Wallace and John Wayne and I was expecting him to say something like "They never take our freedom - they want hell" and it's impossible not to see other similarities with GREEN BERETs . like a journalist sub-block that rises into a weapon and becomes a soldier and moor who speaks to a journalist in a scene that is almost identical to what is seen in Wayne's movie <br /> <br /> If you don't remember other audiences, WWS can't stand on its feet , it is based on real events in 1965, but it seems to have no story that is needed to make the story fair, he never knows 1965 and has no time and judgment because it was filmed in America, not in Asia. Hal Moore could have practiced the French experience in Indo-China, but if it was, he was unique because the American army went out of his way to not read the French Indian-Chinese war, even when asked the previous conflict Westmoreland replied that he had nothing to learn from the French "Who has not won the Napoleonic Day", so I was confused about depicting NVA in this film, when in 1965 the high command of North Vietnam and VC, adapted to Huber, was disdainful. A similar history has been rewritten to show that Vietnamese rice growers are the ultimate warriors. They are, but very few Americans believed it in the mid-1960s. <br /> <br /> There are a few other things that confused me, as women at home get telegrams saying their spouses are dead? No body has been shown to fly back to the base and no one on the screen can see who was killed in La Drang Valley. Also, we don't see any attachment to the screen, so how do we suddenly see Americans out of NVA? I put them on Wallace's leaders / editors who didn't hit me as much as the director and his biggest problem seems to be the transmission of the horror of the battle. Take a scene where the American burned crisp, rides yelling "Tell your wife I love her". It should have an emotional effect similar to the scene of death in PLATOON, but there is no effect here. In fact, I found the scene as piano and patronizing, and he is not the only word in the word "Tell your spouse ..." when I get corrupted or dying, I counted at least two other characters in the phrase. Did the characters really say it in the battle? I have no idea, but since Randall Wallace wrote the script, I have reservations. <br /> <br /> I was shocked by watching the eyes of APOCALYPSE NOW, PLATOON and KILLING FIELDS in the water, laughing at FULL METAL JACKET, I watched my watch with DEER HUNTER and after I was SOLDIERS, I was completely patronized
