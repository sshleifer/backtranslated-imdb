What I understand was Fox's embarrassment when they released the PG-13 Alien / Predator movie so long ago. In no way was it well received. it is a small but knowledgeable group of monkeys to get answers. <br /> <br /> These monkeys were not veterans who wrote sci-fi cinemas, but saw the remake of the Burton planet's apeside and the dead house. <br /> <br /> Their first mission is to hire actors. Fox gave them a reasonable budget, but the monkeys wanted to save money. They hired fifteen television actors right after that. <br /> <br /> Now, script. Monkeys wanted to save the budget more by writing the movie themselves. The exclusion of two essential aspects of the two franchises was an easy part. Thinking of the big new lines that the public would remember years ago - it was harder. They tried for a while and brought out an award-winning scenario equipped with clich√© characters, idiotic decisions, and cracked plot holes. movie center - aliens and predators. Monkeys again wanted to save money in the budget, so they decided to trash the big robot used in the terrible AvP original and go with the old man in the old movie. Participants playing aliens had difficulty matching the suits because the size of the monkeys was not large enough to hold all the plastic heads. In the case of predators, monkeys decided that one predator was sufficient from that time (again saving the budget) to fight the alien hordes that seemingly come out. But what are the consequences, you ask? Come on, people. They may be monkeys, but they knew clearly that CGI plays a key role in the film. Without diving into the budget, the monkeys used the standard Final Cut program and cut and pasted very nice fire and spark effects. Placing red and green filters on the camera lens gave the Predator great visions. <br /> <br /> The device was something the monkeys thought long and hard. If it were to be on earth in all places in Colorado, they would have to make it realistic. It was a place where they admitted they could make a mistake. See, monkeys did not have proper training in this department, so they thought that turning off the lights in the city and playing the movie at night and in the rain was the right thing. They just forgot that people wanted to see creatures, not to look out for the shadow and the whole film rain. To offend the damage, the monkeys accidentally added to all the fighting scenes incredibly close, so no one saw what was fighting or who it was. But again, a beginner's mistake. <br /> <br /> Rating. Fox told the monkey movie R-rated. It was easy. Without showing how many injuries or deaths actually happened, monkeys wont show off carnage after that. It was simple: the viewers got the desired gate and the monkeys did not have to shoot most of the acts involving such violence. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors were initially involved in the questionnaire. Why does blue liquid Predator have endless quantities of magically decomposing what he wants, and nothing more? Why is the former convicting police car around the movie? Why did monkeys forget about the full body of aliens? Why does the watch play a more memorable role than any major character? The list of questions grew constantly, but the monkeys ignored and ended up in their masterpiece. Fox was excited about their work. So cheerful that they opened the movie nationwide on Christmas Eve and even spent a few bucks in advertising this week before it appeared. The monkeys successfully made another installment in the franchises. <br /> <br /> But some ask what happened to the budget that the monkeys forgot to use? They put it in their next movie: Aliens vs. Predator vs. Hulk Hogan. They knew the public would be upset with the title, but since then, this statement has been issued: <br /> <br /> "For people - don't worry about our upcoming movie." And everyone lived happily . End.
