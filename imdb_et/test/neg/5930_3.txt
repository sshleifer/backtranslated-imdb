This movie was OK for movies. It could have been a crossword for secular movies. However, it had little to do with the left-wing books that it allegedly based on. Larger story spaces were removed and new larger story rooms were added. <br /> <br /> What cheated me the most about how Nicolae was portrayed. He was shown with supernatural powers that he had not had in this book. The Antichrist is not Satan, not all-conscious, nor omnipotent. <br /> <br /> Faith and beliefs were depicted in strange, surrealistic ways that seemed just as stupid.
