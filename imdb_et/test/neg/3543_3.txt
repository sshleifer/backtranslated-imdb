Nightscream is a TV movie, so it's definitely terrible, especially if it's a supposed horror movie. This young girl is haunted by dreams when she arrives in a small town where a woman was murdered a year earlier. She is surprised if all the people in the city think she looks like a killed girl. The townspeople are surprised when he enters into dreams like transit, where he shows the exact details of the murder and the murderer, because the police apparently got it all wrong. Thinking that they are in danger of being discovered, the murderers (there are two) will start the plan to get rid of it before it comes to the truth. By then, you probably have fallen asleep, and why the filmmakers are the "fogging" machine on full throttle of dream lines.
