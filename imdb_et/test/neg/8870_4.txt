Police Officer Michael (Tomas Arana, "The Church") is full of hands exploring a serial killer who has left some of the human bodies he was murdered in a recently-housed Tracy (Joanna Pacula) house. Mike must find a way to stop the organs, but maybe find love in this process. <br /> <br /> This movie is known for giallo films, although we know who the killer is from get-go and the movie contains some good sets (a scene that is especially memorable in a dark school movie later), but it doesn't make much sense if everything is said and done. All in all, it is almost as good as Bava's earlier "Macabre" or his first two "Demons" movies, but quite enjoyable when you can forgive at the end of the movie the rather terrible features. I'm sorry that the Image Entertainment DVD didn't have any additional features because I would have been interested. <br /> <br /> My Class: C-
