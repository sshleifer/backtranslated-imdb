As other comments have said, another countless alien clones, this time with a large number of The Terminator thrown away, add a little classic SF story "Who's going there?" Andromeda strain (apparently flashing red lights make rambling killer droids impossible to detect frightened people standing three inches away). and we kill each other, we get the title. <br /> <br /> 25 years later. The crew of the 48-hour army station racing around Mars will discover a huge spaceship on a collision course. It's Siberia, the ship we saw in the opening order. It is not a good time for a relay station to need some useful shutdowns to make some improvements. The approaching ship does not deviate from its journey and passes "DO NOT MAKE DETAILS Enter this ship!" warning. After much shouting at each other, the relay station team improves something together and simply sends the station in timing. But the ship will of course change and ram it in any way - one of the crew members trying to turn it off. Cable begins to "immunity". Bits pressurized. Much more screaming and running, where only two teams of people are sucked back into space. (Why are they ALWAYS inverted?). After some keystrokes with a wheelchair-related technique (called "Wheeler" - the only detectable joke in the whole movie), he concludes that Siberian has drained them all over his power and they have to go on board and turn off their engines. They all go on board and take off the helmets. "DO NOT enter this ship!" this probably means going into the ship and causing possible deadly infectious diseases. One team manages the main computer room where they find a dead frozen guy who looks like an American Express card, but turns out to be a minidisc. Another team finds some switches. Amazingly, the dead is the father of an attractive female member of the team who voted most likely to survive the meeting with strangers. They turn off the engines, but that means the ships' reactor explodes. The horrible point of view begins to kill people. Here's some excuse about Siberia who has discovered a new ore, a potential source of energy worth millions, which means that a greater number of members of the team will force themselves to be at risk. POV shot to return who is! who! sounds on the sound track. Unfortunately, they give you the idea that the killer is wearing shorts and the effect is wasted. <br /> <br /> After that, it's just running and killing in an ugly and acting order until only clear survivors live - with a cute dog who has been able to die for at least two crew members. Just why space tempered veterans are driving a certain death into the jaws, searching for their pets cats and dogs have long been the mystery of such a movie. Other stupid places are all who forget to act with a falling oxygen content until the voice of the on-board computer speaks (not that the low level of oxygen somehow lowers such an idiot load). If the Killer Droid id is so clever, it can drive the ship in a narrow curve and go on the track of another track. warning signal .. i'm sure if he was looking for more people, GO AWAY shouts! Musetta Vander is the only person who can act - everybody just burns their nostrils all the time, keeping their teeth shut and screaming and pushing each other. This is such a script; full of exclamation marks - the only thing that looked at me in the end was the hope that the script would require it to take off all the clothes or get wet when they carry a lot. Unfortunately, it wasn't. One thing that is wrong in this movie (besides having more cyan than any other movie) is that there was no free nudity.
