How could they take a beautifully animated gemstone like all of Don Bluth's dogs, who are getting tougher with this amazing, chewing, endless sequel. Haunted music and delightful characters have disappeared, now replaced with sticky animation and an unimaginable plot. <br /> <br /> Pros: Charlie Sheen is sometimes fun like Charlie, but she has no charming tough guy. The life of Burt Reynolds. I especially enjoyed the song "I'm always with you" and "It's too heavenly here". <br /> <br /> Cons: There seems to be no connection between this and the original. At first, Charlie is with Carface, but wait a moment. Isn't that the same person who was responsible for Charlie's murder and kidnapped the cute little orphan he loved? I think all the changes in the sky, but why didn't Anne-Marie even mention it? If Itchy did heaven, wouldn't Flo and Killer have done that? What's with a whippet voice with Annabelle? The original sounded feminine and charming, and the offspring sounds like a tiny, slippery, parrot. New characters are not so big (except Sasha). And animation is better than Saturday morning comics. Continuous multimedia "humor" is smooth and uncomfortable and "heart" doesn't work when compared to an original that had such a moving uncomfortable touch that makes me cry every time. <br /> <br /> All dogs go to heaven as one of my favorite films of all time. How Don Bluth promised to continue this sequel is outside of me. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: Not all sequels go to heaven.
