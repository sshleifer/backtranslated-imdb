For marked death (1990), more time is spent on the sequence of operations when it is associated with its characters. After the first two strenuous efforts, above the law (1988) and the heavy kill (1989), this third Steven Seagal picture makes an impression: anyone who is against him is meant to be seen as a fool; bad guys are right there to look good. <br /> <br /> Seagal had consistently built an audience that seemed a bit bigger than Chuck Norris or Jean Claude. Van Damme. This film contains loads of graphical violence, gore and nudity that seem to be there for some other reason than please that you would like to have dirty movers who are unable to distinguish between story-telling action and those that simply cast excitement without rhyme or reason. And he deserves a real fault for the sense of taste that Marked for Death is. <br /> <br /> Seagal plays John Hatcher, a retired DEA agent who arrives in Chicago, where his family is attacked by Jamaican Street Gang, who is attacking his sister's house, and the film proves that it's not puzzled when Hatcher The nephew (Danielle Harris) is attacking. Hatcher gets crazy and he decides with his old friend Max (Keith David), a school gym teacher and Charles (Tom Wright), a Jamaican policeman. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Hatcher announces the nasty nickname, which probably means "surprisingly excessive action", as the main bad boy, a locked Jamaica voodoo priest named Screwface (Basil Wallace). <br /> <br /> And it is almost incredible how Seagal pours different gang members: he moves into one boy's eyeball, he breaks the boy's back, and he crushes numerous hands and limbs. All the logic of this movie is thrown through the window - through the glass. Why aren't Hatcher and friends accused of all the property damage they cause or the body that sinks? And how did they get the automatic weapon cache from Illinois to Jamaica without being detected? <br /> <br /> Seagal has a Clint Eastwood stoicism about him, which fans seemed to enjoy and despite the three different characters he played in so many films, every dress with oriental black bathrobes and a ponytail. One of the problems I have with a Seagale movie is that the main characters never seem to be in serious danger and because he is a star, of course, no one can endorse him except a bad boy. br /> <br /> Seagull heroes are all interchangeable, as are most plot lines and action sequences. Regardless of whether he disguises the cook, the firefighter or the L.A policeman who carries the beads of love, Seagal is always Seagal, his fans. In fact, the similarity of these films is such that, if I wanted to, I can take an old picture, change names and have a new movie reasonably accurately. Not that I ever ...
