I happened to rent this movie to my sister to see a great entertainment movie that was humorous, but my expectations were down. This film was disgusting and reluctant for the PG-13 movie, it should have been appreciated for the many mature references that went on in this film. I would not recommend it for a 13 year old teenager. <br /> <br /> Even if someone under the age of 17 doesn't watch this movie, beware of a really stupid movie, no humor in the movie, just a bunch of sexual references, including small pedophilia, something that shouldn't even be fun. <br /> <br /> I would like to know what happened to PG-13 movies that were actually safe for 13-year-olds? This is an unfortunate film and should be reassessed.
