I usually love the old (and some non-old) westerns I haven't seen for evening entertainment. It's a great way to sit, relax and get away from politics and world issues for a few hours. But this was not the case when this version was great. Casting and styling this series will closely follow the Hollywood formula for politically correct entertainment; good old get-your-mind-right, revolutionary history where "bad guys" must all be white, male, confederate (in this case) and preferably christian (if it can somehow work in script). It's sad, really. The best films are now and have always been just a good story on the big screen - not on someone's political ideology.
