This movie was terrible lighting and terrible camera movement. This movie is an amazing horror that has no meaning. Slashes are completely fake. It seems that a 17-year-old idiot wrote this movie and a 10-year-old boy shot it. The worst thing you can ever find is. People are tired of knives. At least, move towards weapons or fire. It has almost exact lines of "When the strangers' calls". Only crazy people would enjoy this movie with terrifying killings. It is obvious that the writer does not have children or even care for them. I mean show some mercy. All in all, this movie is a "B" film and it is sucked. Just for your own sake, don't even think about wasting your time watching this crappy movie.
