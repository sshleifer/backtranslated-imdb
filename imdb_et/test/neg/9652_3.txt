Oh what a disappointment this movie is. I can't believe it was led by Wajda. There is practically no plot, and 90% of the film is made up of different people walking around the screen and trying to communicate with each other when talking about Katyn's massacre. The most interesting part comes at the end, but by the time I just finished taking care of trying to suppress my jewels. <br /> <br /> Almost the entire movie is filmed with a handheld camera, which should be a "personal exchange" feeling, but for most movies there is nothing personal or instant. Instead, the camera was constantly pulling me to the sea. To be fair, there are also some great shots (not intended), but something that makes you "Wow!" Go on. <br /> <br /> If you don't know Katy's massacre, the movie will keep you head scratched. If you are familiar, you also need to scratch your head, though perhaps for other reasons. In principle, the film reaffirms and repeats that in 1940 thousands of Polish soldiers were murdered by the Soviet Union. This point has been repeatedly wrapped up as someone in the audience is convinced of this historical fact. However, the film never tries to explain why they were killed. After all, tens of thousands of Polish soldiers in other Soviet military camps were not damaged and released in 1941. Nor is it enough to explain how many people were killed, though the figure of 20,000 is thrown a few times. > <br /> Actresses are just enough for Komorowska (old woman) and Chyra (Jerzy), who give noticeable performances, but they get together for 10-15 minutes. It is certainly not enough to wear the whole movie. Many other actors seem to have chosen their ability to act instead of seeing their mathematics, but I do not mention their names. Suffice it to say that they are certainly not Oscar material, so all the claims that this film was "ransomed by the Academy Award" are simply ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The film's tone is also wrong. On the one hand, it is trying to be an exact historical drama, on the other hand it is cheap cheap anti-Soviet propaganda, such as tearing down the Russian flag of a Russian soldier and using it to clean his boots. Then there are some imaginable scenes that have no connection to the plot, such as a couple climbing the roof or winding up the University of Krakow. <br /> <br /> There are many unanswered ways to make this movie more interesting, such as adding a story to a political angle or discovering German, or even portraying Anna's journey from the Soviet occupied part of Germany to the occupied Krakow. All of these aspects could have been the main part of the movie, but instead they are reduced to a few minutes. Finally, we get a compilation of loosely matching, confusing, boring scenes concerning one of the greatest tragedies of World War II in the Polish reaction. Not very convincing and not worthy of Wajda.
