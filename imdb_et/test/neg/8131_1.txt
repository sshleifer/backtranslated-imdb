I thought inadvertently about the "trap" of the movie. <br /> <br /> If I could get back in time or just get refunds, I'd be happy. <br /> <br /> It was 19:30 and the Cinderella man didn't start before 22:00 so I hurried to the theater to try the movie that started at 7:20 pm ... and I dare say that God arrived ( or pulled it back) and allowed me to punish my movie This movie may be unfair to criticize a movie that wasn't directed to my heterosexual male cohort, but there is no excuse for poor audio and video editing. This movie was the most valuable to the college project budget ... and I think I've seen the French short shorts of feature films we did with Louis Laloup. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because I'm in Canada and this film was for the LA fudge-packing team and their compassionate games. It was a woe to me when I realized that the whole audience would save me from all the jokes and rivals ... I realized completely hated humor ... but I just couldn't associate. <br /> <br /> Show me how Gay Men are timing and creating relationships. Even if it was the purpose of the film, I feel that "Gayness" was focused too heavily .... humanity seemed incomplete .... but again, maybe it was ... just to be an avant-garde ... and to spray. <br /> <br /> I think that with a small budget and poor equipment you have to make your movie "hard" to get the crowd and the money back. I really wish I had just read your Sheldon Van Auken. Hehe ... I was a totally wrong audience.
