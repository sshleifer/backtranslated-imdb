So far, I didn't like every Jean Rollin movie I've ever seen, and it has always bothered me because he is a recognized Euro Trash Memorial and very popular with many regular reviewers on this beautiful website; people whose opinions I always value and usually agree with. Apparently, everything in my work that has been completely lost to me always looks like some gloomy and stylistic movie characters. Rollin's films are dull-minded, they all have the same basic concept (lesbian vampires in various conditions), dialogues are extremely absurd, wonderful Gothic settings are always underestimated and production values ​​are cheaper than the price of a bus ticket. I had actually given up Rollin's repertoire (especially after "Iron Rose") until I learned about "Hunted Night". Supposedly, this film has no flat lesbian vampires and stands as bona fide horror movies with horrible killings and macabre. And the decision is? yes and no! On the one hand, it is undoubtedly the most convincing and inventive Rollin film that had the pleasure of seeing (and the only one I watch?). On the other hand, it is still a moral film that has sequences with a meaningless plot and an emotional sequence to compensate for anesthesia. Jean Rollin is working hard to create an atmosphere of secrecy and midpoint, mainly through lack of information and vaguely used characters, but he is able to hide the fact that he has not actually said the story at all. The only elements that keep you on the screen are the unique beautiful leading actor Brigitte Lahaie and the beautiful evil musical guidelines. Driving back to Paris at night, the young man must stop suddenly for confusion and hardly dressed girl running out of the woods. Her name is Elisabeth, but she can't remember anything about herself and what she's running for. His amnesia case is so bad that he forgets constantly who took him. The next day, he robs the old guy again and was taken to an abducted apartment complex where several people with the same bizarre mental state have been imprisoned. Elisabeth knows nothing, but she feels she has to flee from here. Of course, I'm not saying, but I can assure you that it's pretty stupid, illogical and far-fetched. Obviously, Rollin understood it too, because the explanation is very short and fast. There are a lot of overly strange and pointless sequences, sex material is terrible and filmed without passion, nasty make-up effects look cheap and randomly thrown without real purpose. As said, the score is enchanting and Brigitte Lahaie's perfect body is dependent on glaze.
