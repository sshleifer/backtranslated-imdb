What a terrible adaptation. The worst part was music. Saxophone Musicals and Synthesizers that Play the Story of the early 1800s, ?????? The only sign I didn't sleep was Robert Hardy. I had to fight to keep my eyes open, and I usually love Jane Austen's films. I didn't even rent it, I borrowed it from the library. They should have paid for it. I don't quite understand how Catherine and Henry were able to kiss at the end when there were no chemistry and no signs of caring for each other throughout the film. Isabella and her brother were on their way; it was no secret to me that he and his brother were "bad guys" and part of the excitement of Jane Austen's films is the discovery that who you think is good is not. This is probably on the list of my ten worst films.
