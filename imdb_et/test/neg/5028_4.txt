Would you like to end the films related to social conflicts or other people's disasters? Okay "Care" is about parenting, "Care" means boys misuse at school and how nasty it can be if it is a poor script movie and it is done with bad players, but it remains a bad film. "Care" is a movie that could have been, but is it that it was a tvmovie, which I don't know, but it all seemed so limited that it's like a cheap movie that some housewives and fathers see who do not decide go to bed. There are so many unanswered things in this movie, such as the relationship with a mother or the death of some abused boy we don't know anything more about. "Care" should have been much better.
