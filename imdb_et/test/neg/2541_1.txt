First of all, this is the worst film I've ever seen. It can see you, but it's not good. It is boring, unreliable, badly fired, ridiculously written, and lacks the consequences of disasters. Everyone will give up the Japanese within the hours they need. Especially Korean. The most exquisite symbols choose the blacksmith that goes along with your ship to sink into your beloved island. "Only the Japanese think in this way," the Prime Minister says. stop making such movies.
