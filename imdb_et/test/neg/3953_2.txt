It was a video tape in the ring; The website was a problem with Feardotcom; The risk of pulse was from computers; and the phone and one missed call were, in your opinion, deadly phones. Stay Alive has a technology that causes all kinds of problems, there is an online game: those who play it will end death right after that. How smart! Directed by William Brent Bell (who?) And having twenty milligrams of unprofessional lie that you have seen before, but probably don't remember where or what the hell is, it's highly derived from cinematic art directed to the PG-13 horror set; Experienced scary movie viewers will undoubtedly find Stay Alive extremely annoying, very predictable, and not the least intimidating. <br /> <br /> A poorly-developed plot follows a group of players with extremely high names (October, Loomis, Phineus, Hutch, and Swink!?!) who are trying to break the deadly game before they become victims. Finally, they discover that the spirit of the legendary Countess Elizabeth Bathory, who kills everyone who dares to play, and their only hope of survival, is to continue to the end of the game. <br /> <br /> What the story is as stupid as it is, viewers should wait for the end of a movie, not one logic (who made the game, how and why it is never explained), very little to scare or gore and stupid Closing the scene to leave the door open? God forbid the sequel.
