Call me old-fashioned, but I like movies with plots. I thought "stoner comedy" was just a way of describing the comedy that smoked a lot of weeds and the people who watch it, enjoy it more. The "grandmother's boy", however, has decided that it is an inflatable niche and that stoners represent a piece of comedy holiday that must be achieved. Apparently Allen Covert (star and producer) and Happy Madison gang were right, but it doesn't make "grandma's boy" less boring and uncomfortable. They can be completely stoned - but the characters are mostly half burned. <br /> <br /> Alex (Covert, Adam Sandler's long-standing supporter, first-ever star) is a professional video game tester of the 1930s that has been lifted by a roommate. He could look for a new apartment, but then we don't have a movie. After catching a few friends, he lives with his good-grandmother Grandma Lilly (Doris Roberts "Everybody Loves Raymond"). She wakes her up on the 6th day and works on her and soon she's going to work and so the new video game queue may not work out. <br /> <br /> Like most people, Alex is also frustrating and losing boredom playing video games or playing high or both. His friends / associates do the same. Most of them are virgins living in addition to loving video games at home. They are all uncomfortable and not all, except Nick Swardson and Joel Moore (only occasionally), are not funny characters. Funny if you blazed ... surely, but I can't tell from the experience. <br /> <br /> Perhaps all we lose, like the higher ones, play video games and uncomfortable women who have a particular focus on their breasts, but this should not be the driving force behind the film. Likewise, old women should not be involved in accidents (seeing that they come) or jokes about non-families - but this happens when the film is nothing. There is no conflict until the last 20 minutes outside of the easy problems associated with the problems with the exit of the pots, Alex is trying to get a hot girl (Linda Cardellini) to her and the boys are scrambling to finish their levels for video games. Characters can be a sustainable love for those curving stoners, but aside from the beloved Doris Roberts, the above-mentioned Swardson as a virgin friend who lives with his parents and invites them to his roommates and Joel Moore's skill in robotic noise, there's a little character ingenuity. Hidden is a main player with no comic dimensions, his dealer friend Dante is an improper actor and a waste of screen time, and Jonah Hill and Kevin Nealon are written to such a far-flung periphery that it doesn't matter. br /> <br /> If you don't like movies and watch them in the mental state and in the body that increase something, "grandmother boy" is probably what you are looking for. Those who need a bit more comedy boarding remain unchanged. The most I can say to my "grandmother's son" is that it is irresistible despite its pointlessness. It does not feel like a waste of time, but you want to make drugs so you have at least one and a half hours. <br /> <br /> Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my website at www.moviemusereviews.com
