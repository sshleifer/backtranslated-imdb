In this sense, I don't make the effort to make such a movie, and then throw history out of my window. There was no exact detail in this movie except that Richtofen died, which I was finally grateful for, so I didn't have to watch. Such films are offensive to anyone who knows something about WWI's aerial history. <br /> <br /> I obviously missed Fokker DVIIs in 1916 because Blue Max did it or 209 lanes flew into SE-5 and attacked other parts. First, they call the old Albatross at the beginning of Pfalz D-III. Second, they are Voss, Goring and Wolff all in Jasta Boelcke. The only one who was Jast was Voss and he joined after the death of Boelcke. Richtofen was not blamed for Boelcke's death ... Erwin Boehme, who collided with Boelcke, had tried to avoid the British plane Richtofen was driving. When Richtofen got a head wound, he attacked the two-sided FE-2d, and he didn't fall into the trenches and won the soldiers, and NO .. Werner Voss didn't die that day. He died on September 28 in one of the first epic battles of World War I. <br /> <br /> Manfred was short, disliked by an actor who rushed over all the others. His brother Lothar had never been Jasta Boelcke, he joined the team when Manfred led Jasta 11. <br /> <br /> There are so many other striking mistakes in the historical fact that I let them go, except perhaps the worst, death scene. Manfred has been maneuvered by Brown and then shot down, making a perfect landing. Brown got off at Richtofen, while Richtofen won in May and the facts gathered over the years show that Richtofen was killed on the ground, not on Brown. <br /> <br /> The only value in this movie was the ability to see flying scenes that were as good as "blue Max", except that I no longer watch it and I paid $ 30 for the tape!
