Now I've seen it. Just when I thought it wouldn't get pathetic and cheesy like "Woodchipper Massacre," just when I thought that dialogue and acting didn't get worse than "Nail Gun Massacre," just when I thought: " Don't Go In Woods "Maintain Your Headline As The Lousiest Slasher Film Ever, Including" The LAST SLUMBER PARTY! "Somehow, this cheap, evil manure manages to avoid lewdness, but it remains awful! I couldn't believe my eyes because if I can't shoot the nudity of the complaint (or in such a case), I was still embarrassed to rent it. Never before have I seen such terrible action, dialect, direction, writing. Here's a quick press: <br /> <br /> A mental patient escapes from a natural trash bin, dresses like a surgeon, but somehow discovers where his doctor lives, and breaks when a doctor's daughter is overnight with friends. Then the most foolish killing begins (ripped off from other films like "Slumber Party Massacre" and Halloween) on this side of the universe. The characters have negative IQs, suggesting they're not human. Cut in case of Aid bleeding, because slasher likes to use it when he keeps his box in the camera in too many scenes, just 80 minutes ... how many times should we watch that garlic before he uses the whole movie? ... what i think it wouldn't be such a bad idea! make it interesting (another killer was added) but unfortunately it wasn't! And then, to insult even more, the stupid end of the universe and even the final conclusion of the stupider. a lot of sense, but I wouldn't like to give away the worst scenes in movie history to those two or four. should be egi life I can ask my hands and knees to think about renting it: PLEASE, PLEASE, DON'T! This is a fan of the genre to be spoken; I know what's good for you! The only real victims in this wheeled asinin nonsense are the poor mors who have been sitting in the toilet! Zanatos score ... because there is no negative point scale, I have to give it 1 but less than 1 mean. Avoid it at all costs .... please !!!!
