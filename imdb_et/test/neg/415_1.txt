First, I loved the book, more than the most popular Da Vinci code, and although the DVC movie wasn't well received, I liked it and bought the DVD. However, there is no chance that I will ever see corners and demons still. <br /> <br /> The film is almost like a book, but actually the story is a general assumption. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, I was disappointed with the speech and fax from CERN Director Maximilian Kohler in Robert Langdon. Who finds the Father's body (does not remember the name) and then asks Langdon using an ultra-fast plane ... There were those in the book who knew about this technology that the Father and the Daughter Team had created a video camera ... But there was a huge team involved in the film. so the tension never existed ... how did they find out about it etc. <br /> <br /> Leaving it or changing it all the way was a huge mistake and it was, in my opinion, what made it a bad movie .. it changed everything that ever happened when Camerlingo stood in the locked room of the pope, he should have been Maximilian Kohler, who shot the video from his wheelchair, the commander invaded to get camerling, but was beaten by Oliver, in a movie that was the room's chief and Olivetti was shot ... (bug, I think I got that right, but I got that right, but I was bored and can't really remember the movie events) ... <br /> <br /> There was no love for Vittoria and Robert and the book he did not reach CE RN when he arrived and indeed flew from his research. All four preferences were killed in the book, but the film lived in four fountains. Vittoria was kidnapped in the book, and Robert was supposed to save her, and it was the killer of the Illuminati Church who did not blow like a Camerlingo movie. A little bit where Robert was under the rock ear was not where his Mickey mouse clock was stored. The book thinks we believe Langdon saved out of the helicopter, fairly to say it was a bit far stretched, but it was important in the movie because he had to go back to the movie ... there was no mention of how Vittoria and his adoptive child participated , it was also important to learn about Vittoria's character. <br /> <br /> In all the worst films I've seen, I would have left early, but my brain went numb and I lost my legs temporarily. Really really reeeeeeaaaaaaalllly bad test and not one of Ron Howards best, in fact, how he can work again is beyond me! I want my money back !!!
