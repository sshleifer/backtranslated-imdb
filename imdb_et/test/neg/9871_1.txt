Was this Marvel comic book customized or not? and shelves? so that its manufacturing company can maintain the copyright of the characters, it does not change the fact that it is a perfect garbage. Dr Doom and (especially) Thing costumes are surprisingly good, but everything else bears a shortage of money or talent. Director Oley Sassone is unable to put the camera in things without adding such catchers as a blind woman's POV, dialogue is totally bad, team suits are not right and the consequences are terrible: The human flashlight seems to have been pulled into the film with a felt-tip pen while Mr Fantastic is able to live by using a blue cap at the top with a glove. Joseph Culp compensates for having to wear a mask, throwing his hand wildly, Jay Underwood is incredibly annoying, the rest cast on various terrible levels, and although it's hard not to know all the men who thought this film should be a release, it's as hard imagine that none of them believes it was really good.
