I found this movie tremendously interesting, but a little bit, it talks about violence and what's going on there, I still don't see terrorists as terrorists. We have similar people in the United States and other countries that justify the use of violence and tactics of war because they think they are right. Think of Puritans and Christian Crusades against the Islamic people in the Middle Ages. Many blood and deaths that go far beyond today's violence have had a negative impact on religion in the Western world. I do not justify my actions, but in the past Western culture has had some negative effects. But I still remember that most Islamic people are PEACEFUL! The people of every nation know some patriotism, but start war because I'm right and your lie must be reviewed. Again I repeat that you cannot stop the terrorists by becoming like them.
