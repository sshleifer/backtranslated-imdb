I can't believe I even wasted renting this full CRAP with NetFlix. How long did it take to make this movie? 15 minutes? What is a budget? Fifteen bucks? I can spend a couple of hours with my Sony Camcorder and come up with something better than this deceptive bile, and it's even available on DVD !? !! It is a very sad idea to think that classics like the Father have not been published on the DVD, but this piece of steaming words changes it to format. Here's the hope that ONE ONE ONE ONE will rate 2.5 overall (already) bad ratings.
