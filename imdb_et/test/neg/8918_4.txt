I just saw you today. It's bad, almost very bad. <br /> <br /> 1) Direction and editing are terrible, just terrible. Almost I've turned off the movie, Fauntleroy (director) has no idea what he's doing, he seems to be filming things randomly and some scenes aren't at all reasonable. I also hate to use the same scene again in the same movie, using some scenes 3 or 4 times in this movie. Pretty bad. <br /> <br /> 2) Dialogue is sometimes good, sometimes terrible. I like that they wanted the character of Seagale and the character of Treach to be similar to the characters of Lethal Weapon, but it didn't work just because some dialogue DID NOT MAKE SENSE, and I speak English very well, it's not that I don't understand these words but that jokes and dialogue lines had no meaning. <br /> <br /> 3) The script is pretty bad. Why do they always try to make the DTV movies more difficult? Seagal woman in the film has psychic abilities, why? Is it useful for the film? NO. Seagal eliminates a whole host of people working for the man who betrayed him, and he knows these people without ever meeting the film. STUPID. Sometimes the story goes off and jumps back without reason. The story is sometimes dirty and meaningless. They should have kept it simple and it would have worked. <br /> <br /> 4) In some scenes, this is not Seagal, it's his stunt double. You can say, because they only shoot him from behind and never show his face. He also wins the film with martial arts, not real boys like Aikido Steven. Double stunt uses cheeses and shocks. <br /> <br /> 5) Steven is good at the movie. 90-95% of the lines are said with his real voice. The rest is dubbing, but it's not that bad. That was good. It also seems that Steven enjoys himself in the film and is more involved in the activities he had subordinated to. She likes Treach as a partner; at least it doesn't seem to like him. He also seems to have been in better shape than some of his recent films. I hate to wear clothes to hide her body, but in the same dress she carries on the DVD cover she sees more than OK and she should have worn these clothes for most of the movie, not a stupid long leather cover. br /> <br /> I think Seagal was ready to make a good movie. The fact that he came late and prematurely took out the two films led by Fauntleroy does not seem to me by chance. I think he realized that the team was amateurs or just to be quick to tow, and he didn't give up any more fucking. action movie for Seagal. Something like justice or law. I believe it honestly. However, the people who made the film are not very good at their workplace or have not had enough work to do the job properly. Too bad because I liked Steven in the movie and also Treach was cool (Ice Cool), but the rest was bad. Hey, at least it gives me hope for Black Dawn and Shadows of the past. I think the mercenary can be as badly handled. But hey, Steven seemed to be back in the same mood he was doing with his better films, and at least that's enough reason to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> I liked it, but it could have been a lot better for SO. 4/10
