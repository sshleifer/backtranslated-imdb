I lived next to the author in 1980 when he first moved from Downland Grove, Ill. He seemed normal enough for a guy, although he had many artistic complaints. In a few years, he jumped into the Portland post-punk music scene with friend Phil and some others, and a band that certainly didn't go anywhere, even though he got a lot of action, including meeting with Courtney Love in him at Portland Group Days. He seemed to think his musical prospects were good enough to move to San Francisco, then to N.Y.C. <br /> <br /> I was surprised when he got a deal on '95 after the band crashed and burned. Courtney Love's name seemed to be a scammer. I have no idea how the movie came, especially with that pain, but I doubt Gus Van Sant was involved. In any case, the observers here seem to be sure whether the lack of narrative focus is deliberate or not, so I would just say that it is a work of an intelligent man who wants to be a writer or an artist or something but does not. I have nothing to say. Like Kerouac without Benzedrine.
