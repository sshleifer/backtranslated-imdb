For weeks I had waited to see this movie only when I was very disappointed with the wards. In my opinion, the only good thing the Queen Queen thought was the amazing landscape that was used as a backdrop. The story was all over the place, Samantha's character Sarah was very difficult to understand and what on earth were all her close-ups? It didn't bring the story absolutely if it had been! A better actor could also have been chosen for the boy, it seemed to me that he was reading his scenes directly while browsing his scenes. a real shame because it could have been such a good film.
