A lot of praise has been given to Farscape, but I don't think it is so good. It certainly has a special look, but it has almost nothing else: story, purpose, direction, excitement; you call it. I'm a big sci-fi fan and I'll do that to see all the sci-fi shows. I've finished almost four Farscape seasons and I'm not very happy right now. The show has some good things - especially Claudia Black (who has unfortunately disappeared from the first episodes of the fourth season), but they are very little and far away. As a whole, the example has been corrupted by many very stupid things (such as fantasy elements, not SF ditto), and many many episodes. the fourth season is messy and very poorly structured. And one just feels that it doesn't go anywhere. It is usually just unpaved adventures with thin, long running plot lines that are slowly developing slowly. Well, sometimes it's a bit tougher, but it only takes very few episodes at once. <br /> <br /> Effect-way, here and there are some impressive things (especially in the room, from time to time), but it seems to be in the same style style that, frankly, gets older quickly. Outlandish and non-persuasive doll aliens mar a lot, and I've come to prefer (far) episodes where regular human activity characters are in focus. <br /> <br /> I think peacekeepers are by far the most stylish and intriguing and interesting indicators; they manage to have a convincing foreign culture, despite their human appearance. They have some very cool episodes. in the first season (IIRC), where Crichton masquerades as a peacekeeper captain and ultimately destroys one of his secret bases. Such episodes can range from 8 to 10, but I can't show it as a total of more than 4 digits. <br /> <br /> Apart from the peacekeepers (which are somewhat too unanimous) themselves, totalitarian and militaristic, to be truly nuanced, it just doesn't show anything important or important that you need to know or see. OTOH, it contains some good ideas and is not a complete loss. <br /> <br /> This is my opinion, of course, but as a flavored sci-fi fan, I think it's something and can be helpful to others. There are not many good sci-fi; but Star Trek (any series) and especially the new Battlestar Galactica are definitely better than Farscape. But if you are a big fan of mediocre sci-fi fans, you may also like Farscape. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 4 out of 10.
