If you want a truly traumatic experience, if this scary movie (if you think you name it) is for you. The film is worse than the postman, sizzle Beach USA, Batman and Robin, Kazaam, fair game ... well you get your point. This movie, directed by French TV Patrick Sebastien (Jerry Springer with IQ 25), can really be considered The worst movie ever made. I hope that Troma or someone in America will spread it, so u.s.a can smell worth it.
