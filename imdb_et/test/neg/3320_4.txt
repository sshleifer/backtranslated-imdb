'' The Queen of Fucking '' is one of the worst adaptations in the book to the film I've already seen. The only thing I like about this movie is the soundtrack, something else. (Because I'm a Cornney, Marilyn Manson, Chester Bennington Linkin Park, and Wayne's static Static-X) There are so many mistakes and so many bad choices that I don't even know how to get started. So many stories were cut, like the twin legend (one of my favorite), the relationship between Armand and Daniel, and even Louis is not there to mention some. (The plot was dead) First, they should have made the movie "The Vampire Lestat" because it is the second book after "Vampire Interview" and not the "Queen of Fucking". They tried to squeeze in one movie so much information that you could almost do nothing if you didn't see the vampire chronicle. <br /> <br /> So many meaningful characters in this movie don't really matter. This is, for example, the case of Pandora. <br /> <br /> Actors who want to play all the characters are incompatible with many of Anne Rice's specifications, especially with Marius, which is probably beautiful, tall like a blue-eyed blonde guy like Lestat. (Stuart Towsend is not nearly like Lestat) I didn't understand why they changed Lestat's creators to Mariusx Magnus. <br /> <br /> 'Vampire Interview' was a fantastic movie I loved actors and Tom Cruise because Lestat was PERFECT and much better than Stuart Townsend (I'm sad Tom Cruise gave up playing Lestat again) Only Antonio Bandeiras as Armand did not respond to the appearance of Armand, but anyway, far from this fucking movie, called the "King of the Devil". "Anne Rice was so funny about the interview that I didn't get how she was selling the rights of this terrible production.
