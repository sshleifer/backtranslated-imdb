This is a godly Norris film, which has one of the most annoying productions at Calvin level and a weak script. The characters were terrible, and hardly anything, and even Chuck Norris stinks in it! Christopher Neame is the main villain very weak and the story was not very interesting and Norris seemed bored, and I don't blame him because I was too!. Calvin levels provide one of the most annoying items in a movie, I couldn't stand because I was tempted to pull the tape out of my video recorder and Norris and Levels didn't have chemistry together! If you are looking for some great martial arts from Norway, it will not come close, but if you want a movie with an uninteresting story, hardly anything bad and bad! This is a godly Norris film, one of the most annoying performances on Calvin, avoid it like a plague! The direction is incredibly bad. Aaron Norris is doing an incredibly bad job here without creating tension or excitement in camera work and keeps the movie at a pace! There's little blood and violence. We get 2 gory impaling's, ripped out of the heart, exploding the body and some shooting wounds. Operation is really bad. Chuck Norris is not AMAZING because he is usually here and it seemed very boring, his one liner is flat and his acting wasn't so big and I'm a big Norris Fan, it's his absolute worst! (Norris still rules!). Calvin levels are NOTICE, his flawless flawless performance tells me seriously, I was so hopeful he would do that! Christopher Neame is pretty weak as the main villain, his voice was cool, but he did a great time! Sheree J. Wilson is beautiful and did what she was supposed to do. The rest is terrible. In general, please be careful that this is not worth the torture, even if you are a big Norris fan (like me). BOMB 5
