One of the worst films I saw in the 90s. I often use it as a benchmark for watching other movies; "At least it wasn't as bad as Caro Diario." Three absolutely meaningless segments, all of which have been played by the director himself - and he's not that interesting. The whole segment of this hypochondria is going to the doctor. The second, which characterizes him riding on the terrain on his scooter. For three interesting minutes and fifteen more distressing people. <br /> <br /> The only redemption factor was that the scooter scene was set to Keith Jarrett's 'Coln concert'. Offered me to go home and rediscover this wonderful album. The best thing you can say about a director / actor / egotist is that he has a great music taste.
