Let's see: there is a civil war, a lost city, a gorilla talked about, some regular gorillas, a previously unknown killer albino gorilla, the most powerful laser that man has ever known, * lots of * diamonds that have been mined and loose. sand, attack hippos, active volcano and hot air balloon packed in a suitcase-lowered plane. It's not too much, right? I have had more consistent dreams of fever ("... and then the Romanian guy pulled a lot of diamonds because it was a lost city he was looking for or something, but then the average gorillas we saw earlier came out somewhere and ate him, but now he talked back to the gorilla about visiting the usual gorillas, and like an earthquake or volcano, a female industrialist / doctor started to build a laser and the big diamond she had just found in her dead groom ... "). This is a blast if you are looking for more ammunition for the detrimental effect of Michael Crichton on American entertainment (and therefore for world entertainment), and if you have a firm eye on how much this cynical and half-brute attempt fell on his face in the box. But unfortunately, the responsible men - Crichton, writer John Patrick Shanley, director Frank Marshall - would probably never have a dime. Shame on them and I mean it. 1/10
