As others have said, this is a ridiculously terrible film (NOT A FILM!). It's not a funny way to be bad, just painful to try to tolerate. Don't waste your time. <br /> <br /> Erika Eleniak is pretty hot, but there is one scene where she is in the bath and you see me covering the breasts under the bubbles. He's also greasy. <br /> <br /> Fighting scenes are so bad that they can't be seen if you know or care about martial arts or even decent choreography, and editing / effects are sad. /> <br /> There is no profitability, it goes somewhere and sucks there.
