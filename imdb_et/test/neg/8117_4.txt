Almost everything that Stephen King has ever written seems to have become a film or television series; In fact, I am surprised that no one has tried to make a mini-series of baby foods. Let's face it, if they did, it couldn't be less interesting than the corn children. <br /> <br /> Based on the many short stories of this king, the 1984 horror strike sees Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton playing a couple of long rides, struggling to drive the dreamy city of Gatlin in Nebraska, where all adults have murdered children, who worship the ancient evil that lies on corn fields. > <br /> Although the director Fritz Kiersch is able to build a fairly large atmosphere at first (after Hamilton's stupid song and dance, but before we can meet the deadly leader of Isaac), he blows completely with the infinite, where Hamilton and Horton are the city's terrifying half-faces . Courtney Gains, like the violent redhead Malachai, is truly threatening, but the rest of the children are not the least dangerous; as a result, many "frightening" moments of the film cannot work. At the end of the movie, when we finally get to see the malicious force that lives in the area surrounding Gatlin, the film falls into the slippage of the 80s visual effects of the film, which apparently seemed to be pretty hard for nearly 25 years. back, but nowadays seem to be ridiculously ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Corn's children may be interested in King's fans who want to see how the writer's work has been translated on the big screen, but your average horror fan may be the most impressive.
