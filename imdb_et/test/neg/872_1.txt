We thought it was one of the worst films. I had to watch the volunteer. Romance was not believable; characters were not developed; the love affair hardly made sense; it was a failure; and the terrain was absolutely stupid because it was either (my opinion) like ADAMS in the FAMILY, WILL BE VACATION ... just scary, gypsy and cheesy; and OUTERBANKS doesn't usually look like houses like surf; and who would spend the night in a hurricane when it was not theirs. Nor was it realistic. Hurricanes give you a lot of warnings to lower the hatches. <br /> <br /> A friend was also superfluous; and what did not correspond to what the Civil War is related to foreign banks? I also have to mention a wardrobe ... does D. Lane have a scarf / pashmina / towel in every score? It was superfluous. He seemed good enough not to hide anything; without obvious patches. <br /> <br /> Finally, I'm concerned about the impact on our landfills if everyone has to fool it, and I mean the STUPID movie !! Don't fall for this leap !!!!!! We did. Not even traceable.
