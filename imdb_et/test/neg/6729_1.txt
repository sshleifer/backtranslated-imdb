Steven Seagal's late films have not been very good, but it is by far the worst thing than a patriot. The plot has no sense whatsoever; it is never clear what the characters are about working for who or who is double-crossed. The film is completely separated, every scene seems to be confusing rather than passing on the story. Even sequences of action are effortless and difficult to track. Most of the guilty must be on the director's feet, not even understanding the basics of making a film, but Seagal can't easily get to one of the film's producers, so he must blame. Oh, and I haven't even mentioned how terrible it is to Seagall standards. Even if it's directly on videos, it's not worth the Seagal fans too. Give her a big place!
