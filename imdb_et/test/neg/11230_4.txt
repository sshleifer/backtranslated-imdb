Ken Russell led this strange (not very) erotic thriller and if I hadn't known I would have put my life in, the director was Brian DePalma. Absolutely everything about PASSION BREACH is punished by DePalma, which is a bit illuminated, from terrible cinematic art to a domestic line that changes with a stem and a slash, even to the title of the hairs "Depalma, DePalma, Depalma" Russell should have tried his own style. Certainly, the erotic thriller TOMMY or BILLION DOLLAR BRAIN would have been odd for the capital B, but at least it would have been a unique cinematographic experience. In the 1980s, the video market had tales about living with dangerous duplicates and stories hidden in religious mania. Oh and Anthony Perkins play the same role he played in almost every film made in the 1980s. Yawn <br /> <br /> The only thing that PASSION has for real comments is the dispute it caused. I think the most lucky people in the studio were listening to it because no publicity is bad for the public, but also for controversial sexual scenes ... What are the controversial sex scenes? There is no one and only dispute I think that the Chinese blue dominates the service with a policeman who has a trap. Needless to say, he didn't come quietly HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
