My wife and I watched this movie because we were going to visit Sicily and Stromboli soon. Fortunately (or unfortunately) the only believing members are the landscape and the sea (with tuna). We were expecting a reasonable, well-written and well-acted movie, but we were disappointed. Its only redemptive grace is an expanded and remarkable fishing regime full of authenticity: tuna, nets, long-boats, wooden boats and passionate, as superstitious, fishermen. <br /> <br /> Film sequencing is stagy, dialogue has shifted and acting ranges from rigid to completely "overflow". One scene where Bergman emphasizes his maso, native and naive husband's "innocent" (but probably dead) rabbit would be perfect for the Monty Python skit. <br /> <br /> When the volcano blew, we hoped for the merciless ending of suffering (us and our emissions). Unfortunately, the film continues to glow and ultimately melodramatic and absurd. If you're not really tuna fishing, do this horse effort.
