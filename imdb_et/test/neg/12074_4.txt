This film follows the life of a great guitarist who wants to make it big, but acts irresponsibly almost to self-destruction. <br /> <br /> I was waiting for the usual Woody Allen spiritual dialogues, sarcasm and humor, but "Sweet and Lowdown" couldn't offer anything. The main character, Emmet Ray, is an egocentric, rude, irresponsible, and faulty person. She's so unlikely that I don't want her now or care. I don't know why he has to make a movie. The story is slow, making the movie terrible. Even Sean Penni's great actor does not liven up the film to the level it is watching. <br /> <br /> I like many Woody Allen movies, but "Sweet and Lowdown" is a big disappointment.
