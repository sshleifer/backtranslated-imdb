Frankly, this movie is hard to do without your vomiting. Dirty animation doesn't help because it turns it out as a decades old video that you can find in Morrison's 99-carp. However, it is better than a debilitating scenario that consumes about a third of its lengthy excesses, such as Belle's contemporary problems, stuff for Scrooge's father, and a lot of charming fans - choke - two regrettable mice. These bizarre extras eat the time of the screen at the expense of the elements you think they are quite important, such as the Dickens Dialogue and the main pieces of his plot - for example, twenty questions play the game and sometimes the scenes do not make the right order. Absolutely hopeless.
