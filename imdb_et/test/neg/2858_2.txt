I was really disappointed to see Pinocchio's revenge on the second night. I had a good tendency to be bad, but I didn't think it was as bad as it turned out. The killed boy's wooden doll belongs to the lawyer's eight-year-old daughter. From there it is a murderous way for anyone who is a doll and a little girl. We have seen such films as before, i.e. a child's play set, which is much better. However, it was good to see actors like James W. Quinn and Todd Allen. Both have previously worked under Kevin Tenney. In any case, I encourage viewers to look through the "Demons Night" and the original "Witchboard". These are headlines that tend to highlight Kevin S. Tenney's best.
