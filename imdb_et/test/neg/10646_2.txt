In the XXII century, architect Merchant (Bruce Ramsay) gives the architect the name of the space station he personally designed. As predicted, the expensive station will be sent back and sent to the merchant for custody. On arrival, they find themselves participating in a strange ritual using a mysterious cube. During the interrogation it turns out that they have to let him finish what he has started or else he will bathe in his blood ... To convince the officers who detained him, his legacy, who is the builder's box and its reasons why he is in this room ... <br /> <br /> The movie that is essentially the same Hellraiser that The Quickening was for Highlander. Something must be ignored and forgotten so that it does not affect much of Hellraiser's legacy. Far from being the most inconvenient franchise with a much lower quality feel than its predecessors (who seem to be class B or C). <br /> <br /> Sometimes it seems that from time to time the medium-budget porn-flick with wood's incredible performances works, what are you really thinking: So when are they going to get rid of it and get started? Surprisingly, there is no sex in the movie, although the introduction of the note-demon Angelique (a totally superfluous figure that unnecessarily interferes with the world of Hellraiser) offers many ways to make love. <br /> <br Basically, the movie consists of three stunningly stitched short short stories (one in the future, one in the present and one in the past) with no focus and rushed to amateur. The end result is extremely bad, basically emphasizing the fact that you have no interest in what happens to some movie characters. .
