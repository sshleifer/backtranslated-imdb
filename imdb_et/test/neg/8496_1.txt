Mr. Kennedy should stop exPeRiMeNtIng with bad movie scripts. What did he mean? This is a movie that shouldn't have gone through "hey, I have an idea, we'll do the next" stage. If there was a zero rating, I'd give it, but I think I'll satisfy generous 1. These days it seems that when it comes to towing, the movies start to hit the old stroke and start the authors and see what appears. (Hey, I said "hit and crash"! Kinda describes how I felt when this movie ended!) It's full of unpleasant humor, strange animation, and jokes that aren't confusing to you. If you drag this movie and someone pays for you ... fine .... but he'll be even more painful than brick brick. However, if you are planning to pay your hard earned money, look for a better alternative.
