The remnants of the surrounding army remain in the group of cowboys to fight through their Indians. It looks like it can be an exciting western, but it's boring, boring, boring. It moves like molasses, action scenes are forced, actress is pedestrian, writing is flat, even photography is not very good. Eastwood plays a very early role as a former Confederate who does not like the idea of ​​fighting on the same side as the Yankees. This is the only remotely interesting situation in the whole movie, but Eastwood did not experience enough actors to pull it out, and his character is rather tough, not angry or withered. Very plain west. In fact, it is a very ordinary Western. You should check out if you are an Eastwood fan and want to see him at the beginning of his career. Otherwise, don't worry.
