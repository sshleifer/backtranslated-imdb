Well, I only got the end of the tail of this movie in HBO, just the last 10 minutes, but I have to say that it probably contains the most ridiculous image showing how far EVER runs! I'm a serious distance runner and a dedicated fan and I've been sitting through many painful demonstrations in movies. But nothing could ever prepare me for this movie for the last 10 minutes shown on the screen, it literally does not believe! The depiction of runners is even more ironic, given that African runners dominate in sport and are elegant and graceful. A female protagonist interferes as an overweight pregnant woman and her "highly educated" male supporters are no better. Well in the competition, this alleged world-class runner is surrounded by pudding, overweight people, many of whom are WALKING! I find it interesting that the director decided to lead a female contest, but in the end she has shown that they are going to people who look like they are amazing with two broken legs! Should we believe that this amazing star athlete is only exhausted at the end of the race? Perhaps the director thinks that female runners will not be able to go faster than 12 minutes and he has never heard of athletes like Paula Radcliffe or Tirunesh Dibaba. <br /> <br /> Even if you are not a running fan you will be surprised by the inaccurate inaccurate presentation, and this movie can only be tracked as an involuntary comedy. Here's a guide for the director: The next time you decide to make a movie about sports, it may be worthwhile to hire at least one person who has actually watched this sport.
