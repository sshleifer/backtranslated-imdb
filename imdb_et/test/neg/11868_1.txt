At first glance, I have to say, look at the contractor, 2007. Wesley Snipes. Better action movie and a more dramatic plot. The detonator has a terrible plot that focuses on an atom bomb set in Romania and a terrifying action film - no exciting moments and the action movie is turned on for boredom. <br /> <br /> Really, what do you expect from Wesley Snipes when he gets terrible scenarios like this? Don't blame him, he needs money. <br /> <br /> It was my first impression when I saw the movie 3 years ago. But I don't see it anymore, somehow. Ah the forest. It sucks. There. I said that. <br /> <br /> PS: I don't think I'd ever say "this movie sucks" in the IMDb review. Thank you, detonator!
