I saw it in Toronto Interis. Film Festival in September 2005 The description seemed interesting - how wrong I was! It can easily be the worst film I've ever seen - in 50 years! I see that the director is my age (b. 1948) and I lived with Velvet Underground Nico, which takes us to Andy Warhol, which is randomly what I was thinking about watching - Warhol's 24-hour movies with nothing other than something happens. It's not art, it's boredom. <br /> <br /> Specifically: Black and White. Maybe ... but what's here? Certainly they were color in 1968! And now there is no contrast. And yes, the subtitles were naturally white. I think I didn't miss much, but it made about 20% of them unreadable. <br /> <br /> Next, this is a clean chronological order, but with seemingly random events. old man at dinner table? It adds something to the film. There were many similar scenes - almost like someone taking a camcorder and filming random people and creating them together to shoot. <br /> <br /> Plot? Missing. "Rebellion" consists of some distances that occasionally tilt the stone field. For the most part, this is an embarrassing time for watching people (at a distance!). Repetitive opium smoking is just as boring. When the protagonist became a cute girlfriend, then I went up, but she was bored! This is probably the only French film I've ever seen, where no one is wearing their clothes. Obviously they were too boring to disturb. Romance? Missing. The girl seems to be completely indifferent - maybe her sculpture has some interest, but if it is, it will not be shown. We are completely indifferent to the nature of the characters because they are all unpleasant. Maybe this is all this point?
