This is another remake of the Hollywood movie. Hitch ... If I'm right. <br /> <br /> The film has some great moments that laugh out loud, which, frankly, comes only from Govinda, who has become a legend of Indian cinema, and which always brings its Game to comedy. Another bonus is Rajpal Yadav; who is fun like a gangster who imitates the "Don", Indian cinema icon. Lara Dutta is a plus ... I know I hear it low, but mainly because I have a soft place for her, she's trying to be funny, but she seems to be forced. His behavior is weak ... but he still looks. Salman Khan is cruel, trying to bring cool, charming depths, but he can't fail, he acts and screams for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> "It doesn't work for mate, called spiritually challenging" <br /> <br /> Katrina Kaif is just bad ... nothing good. No charisma, no talent ... and I don't see why people think she's beautiful ... The plot was far removed and I had a hard time believing Katrina's character was attracted to Govinda. The only good thing about music is ... "You are my love" was the best on the soundtrack.
