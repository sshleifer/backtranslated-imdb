I went to watch this movie today, hoping it would include at least half of the intelligent story. I was extremely disappointed as he didn't. The plot and the main character decisions were so far drawn. I was hoping for a "Dog Day Afternoon" movie, but instead got something totally unacceptable. In fact, I was completely hoping that the "hero" would hit, and I almost went out of the theater if it had to happen, but not. Heist films are not considered to be sensitive tendencies, and they tried to be just that. Every few minutes in the second half of the movie I found myself "in some way". Without giving the whole story, it turned around the armored car guard, who was financially down and out and whose house was closing. He was summoned and accepted only when the action began. Weak.
