The movie "Cave" must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. There were no plots, no story, and the lighting was terrible. For most movies, I couldn't understand the landscape because it was highlighted with flashlights. The permanent "gray" spaces in the whole movie were unpleasant. The only scene that really came out clearly was the cave illuminated by the bad simulation of the conditions in Hell. All in all, the movie wasn't really worth it. If manufacturers are unable to do something better, they should find another occupation. The underwater scenes were particularly horrible, mainly consisting of bubbles and flashlights, despite occasional participants. All in all, it is a terrible movie with bad lighting, strangers blink.
