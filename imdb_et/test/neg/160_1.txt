My God ... I've not seen such a long movie ... for a long time ... I saw it last night and wanted to leave after 20 minutes ... the kitty knightley is really trying really hard but he can't handle it. canceled his accent every time and he did not have the charisma to fulfill his role ... sienna millers will act for you at the point where you will ask yourself: has he ever had a story? Evaluating the edge of love, he has never been in the classroom, but should consider going in the near future ... they both look really beautiful ... maybe they should focus on their future career .. if they can be actors everybody can!
