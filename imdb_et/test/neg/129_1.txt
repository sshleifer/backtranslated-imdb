I can't explain what this garbage load is. As I really can't. its just so bad. <br /> <br /> plot = nonsense = nonsense budget = so low ridiculous <br /> <br /> Jesus, his only good thing in this movie, is the main character was quite hot. <br /> <br /> Only the people I feel are good at this movie are those who participated in the movie. I'm sure they're not the ones who funded it, because no money was put into it. (HAHAhaha a little where you have to shave) <br /> <br /> This movie has already wasted much of its life, so I'm not going to write my magazine anymore.
