Okay, here's a really brief overview: this movie blew. I wish I could easily review this simple principle, but I have to wear you more badly reviewed words, such as "terrible" "clich√©" and "irrelevant". This is the type of movie you look at when you're drunk or you're in an desert island where there's nothing else to do. Here's a prerequisite: The vice president is a terrorist group during a hockey game and only Van Damm can stop the madness. Really, really terrible, but then again I didn't pay for it for the first time and only my father felt after the wallet after the movie. I hate being a Republican and everything, but then he released me the horror of paying for this cavity. Okay, now there is plenty of room to recognize it for review, so I'm doing adieu.
