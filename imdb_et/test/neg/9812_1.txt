Hilariously inept - as "He wore a yellow ribbon" by the remade of five-year-olds. <br /> <br /> Spoilers Front: Despite its title and large amount, "killing trail" is actually the Injun music battles instead of the dance numbers. <br /> <br /> If you've ever wondered what Ed Wood would have done with the B-film budget, this movie should answer your question. Some decisions may be modest only retrospectively, such as filming in the short-term Cinecolor process, resulting in a change of face within the same color. But the film's basic set, the cavalry fortress, which seems to be part of Norman's castle, apparently was definitely a bad suggestive skimping. <br /> <br /> Terry Gilkyson, who later wrote The Bare Necessities for Disney. Jungle Book, "scores full of original ditties, which would have been a great comic, but suitable for Western action like a fuzzy slipper that is stuck. One song tells how" horse hooves and their melody sounds like horse-drawn serenade "... cavalry patrol dead songs during a serious scene, other songs literally tell the story of the impact, showing signs, describing their moods and gestures - as they appear on the screen - and even stop Cinecolor's advertising for the advertisement (!) <br /> <br /> warpath to apologize for killing two of his bands with a forbidden trio, and at the end of the movie, it seems like hundreds of Navajs and cavalry have bitten dust (thanks to repeated shots of the same characters that die over and over.) But the driver is pleased when he sees the badguiste trio is As the singer informs those who are not helpful, those who have not paid attention, the Navai ride, their battle called out. a surrounded by his fallen comrades, joyfully rejoice in his appreciation. <br /> <br /> The direction could best be called wood or more on Wood. In Navaji, their horses are consistently paired - never one. Almost every walking red man dies, throwing his hands in the air and threading over. The film also features Hollywood's most cautious stuntmen who burn before the fall of a one-storey roof (and still cannot land) or turn to look behind them when they slip, "dead", rocky slope. <br /> <br /> The star is Brian Donlevy, who definitely deserves the Oscar that it is not dying. After an endless final battle scene - the "climax" is hardly a word - he scans the list of dozens of his soldiers, and robs: "It could have been worse." Trooper Andy Devine can sing and kidnapper / murderer Gig Young laughs at Andy antics ... leading a character hidden by masked bandits for rat Gig: "I know you laugh everywhere!" <br /> <br /> And for no one to forget exactly what disgusting work Howard Hughes might have, remember that as RKO leader, Hughes was first in line with the original letter of Howard Da Silva black when HUAC condemned. Hughes would take another six years to finish this ever-celebrated studio on the ground, but it didn't help when she demanded that Da Silva play every scene in this movie, replacing Donlev. <br /> <br /> It was almost ten years before Da Silva was able to work again in Hollywood. But all the things he thought he would have to get out of the "slaughter route" should have sent Hughes a grateful note.
