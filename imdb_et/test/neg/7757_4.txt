What I understand, Mr Bava gave up on this project before graduation ... AND EFFECTIVE SO! If I were him, I would definitely be convinced that ANY copy was burned and if someone in the future ever asked me for this movie ... NEVER AND NEVER HAVE ... the story ended. <br /> <br /> Despite some big sets and good photography, this is a terrible movie ... should it be scary? (not less) should it be funny? (Pure Lees) A ​​complete waste of time ... and I really don't want to say that!
