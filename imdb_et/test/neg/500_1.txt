I looked at the latter with an open mind. I'm sorry to say it's still bad. First, the film is too noisy and you can't hear what people are saying. The emphasis is bad, especially on Richard Masur. What does the French chick do in this movie? Disturbance at worst. Walken's makeup is strange. Harvard scene is useless and not necessary. Christopher's character is unlikely and I wanted him to kill and go. In the meantime, the Walken sign dies too early and easily (regardless of makeup). Residents are all stupid. SEND ORGANIZED you have a bunch of hicks, people are coming to kill you !!!!! The character of John Hurt gives something to some humor. <br /> <br /> I have nothing like this nonsense. The only good thing is that it destroyed the director's career and killed United Artists.
