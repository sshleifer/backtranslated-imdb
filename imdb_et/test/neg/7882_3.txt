Although it is true that the film is somewhat interesting, the performance leaves much to be desired (like the skin of the girls' blood orgy, I spit on your grave and born in flames, all bosses). I don't think it's porn, but porn is in the eyes of the viewer: if it works like someone for porn, who am I saying he is wrong? I was quite puzzled by the statement of Winkimation's general thoughtful view ("Such Shame") that "when we actually see men's faces when they come." A few years ago, I occasionally made freelance comments about the adult mind and I remember that when they came, I saw a lot of men's faces. I think this is probably more common if the film has few male "stars" (and especially if this man is a director). Although I am not surprisingly able to refer to any particular title, I know that there are some instances of Ron Jeremy. I also do not know that I agree that a man will appear in the face of a vulnerability in the future.
