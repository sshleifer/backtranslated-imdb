One look at the rating should tell you that the film has been voted by the votes, trying to artificially increase the ratings of that movie. <br /> <br /> This movie does not give the zombie genre something new. In fact, it is ridiculously bad (acting and cinematic) and derivative on its plot. Make-up looks terrible and zombies are even worse when shooting. The lines are rigidly delivered and poorly timed, except for the female bounty hunter who is the only good actor in this movie. The worst criminals are the Italian guy (Hans), the main character Ryn and the leading bad guy. I've seen better delivery of a pizza truck with a flat tire. <br /> <br /> It's self-proclaimed "zombie western" but the only thing that makes this "zombie west" is that people wear cowboy hats and the real name of the leading actor is Clint. The protagonist is not cool and mysterious like a traditional Eastwood hero, and as a hero, he does not have a cleverly split attitude to pull it out. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by fake glowing comments. It's just another class B zombie film that is competent for a budget that has had proper lighting, but it's low budget, first-time management, and bad behavior. There are a lot of really stupid scenes that make this look truly amateur.
