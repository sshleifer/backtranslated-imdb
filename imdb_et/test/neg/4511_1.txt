It really is a re-do, which would never have been received continuously. It has two lies that work in completely different layers. At the top of the game are Joan Plowright and Maximillian Schell. The nuance of each franc is striking. at the bottom are Melissa Gilbert and Doris Roberts. I can't imagine how Schell and Plowright manage to play as well as Gilbert and Roberts are working on their magic struggle. Gilbert destroys any scene where he is. It's like the Father, who knows the ghetto best. He's the light of Ann Frank. Her running at Helen Keller was thin but not terrible. It's holiness. Doris Roberts is just annoying to Mr Van Damm. He is a totally inappropriate choice to play a sexually hungry woman whose flirtatious, dissatisfied presence caused so much trouble in Acherhuis. It had to be played by a woman who could convince us she would at least remember what she was sensual. His weight is not a problem. Joan Plowright could have played this part beautifully. Roberts was in a career when it was done, receiving a lot of journalism and many opportunities. His performance here shows his weakness as an actor shamefully. <br /> <br /> James Coco and Clive Reville own most of their scenes with Gilbert and Roberts, and they are strong, although they are perfectly capable of eliminating damage from partners. Reville is a witty actor who is able to present an iconic presentation of Ed Wynne in the original film. He doesn't get support from Gilbert. He empties the color from each scene. <br /> <br /> I have read worrying about your comments, who grew up watching this version, full of these presentations. It's a lesson about how you see the version first for you. It makes me over again to confirm some of the worst products I loved in my childhood. I encourage you to look at the original. It has very few weak points and its head and shoulders.
