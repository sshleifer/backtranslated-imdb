I chose this movie and was scared to find out that the movie is based on a little girl rape, which her parents knowingly take her daughter to. My first thoughts were that I was never ashamed of both Indian and Hindu. I found this movie terrible. Please don't waste your time. There are no more than 2 terrible songs about music and the used film is cheap. Beautiful scenes are not known in India. I just hope I have illuminated this movie. Yes, it can highlight how maybe the evil people in power, especially when it comes to religion, may be, but sit and watch for almost 2 hours this movie gets almost everyone's gag. If your good Indian film looks at something from director Mira Nair.
