I am a person who will never look at animated films, but I will exceptionally make Thumbelina and Swan Princess. I bought this series with full first-hand love and I sat down to watch it with a very bold mind, being sure to love it because I spent that money buying it. I finished the movie and all I think is HORROR !!! I wanted to like it, really. I tried very, very hard to like it. But I couldn't enjoy this tough movie the second time. The songs made me feel my ears out of my ears. The dialogue was so flat that I felt beating and irritating every time someone opened my mouth. The villain was ridiculous and I felt that I wanted Derek and Odette to die by the end ... and I was totally in love with their first film. <br /> <br /> I try to repress the memory of this movie because it destroyed me for almost the first. There is one song in the movie that has several setbacks for the first film. The difference between animation between the two is very obvious and I started to miss the first half and I would not see the third eye. </p> <p> </p> Time.
