With other comments I can say that NOBODY could really enjoy this empty joke, it's the same way I felt. <br /> <br /> All the time I watched it, I was scared that someone could make this movie stupid! What is the World? I think it's my fault to sit through the movie (ugh!), But it was like a bad car wreck, I couldn't look at it. <br /> <br /> If you are a child under the age of 8, you will like this movie. Otherwise, stay away from it at all costs. It's a stupian movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Everything is stupid - story, script and especially actor, all! When watching a movie, you turn off the TV and think of "how the movie can be so sad," or continue to look at curiosity to see if things can get more stupid about it (they can't). br /> <br /> These filmmakers (if you can call them) have to return seriously to their day-to-day projects, not one of them has an ounce of talent, and I doubt you can take such a living away from the terrible useless rubbish that anyone in their right in the sense of never want to see! <br /> <br /> Just Drawn BS ​​Don't waste your time.
