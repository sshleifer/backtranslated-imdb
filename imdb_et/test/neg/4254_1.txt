It was one of the worst films I've ever seen. Why should someone kill a movie to kill? Mr. Allen plays the only kind of character he can, sexually struck by a man who doesn't get a girl. Get a guess, Allen, there's a reason that is the only sign you can successfully portray. Remove this movie! This is a waste of time if you don't want to know how to kill someone successfully. I'm sorry for the participants who say "yes" to Woody Allen. Look at your lie and tell me how many of these people are still working. My respect for all the participants working for him falls immediately because they decided to participate in the film.
