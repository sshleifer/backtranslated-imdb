this movie is a bunch of garbage and, in order to try it, the first is just a farce, the main thing that lets me put down, was the use of one liner from the first, which once said by classic actors when Sam Elliot can't be played in any way, I mean when the Dalton phones first run, and it stops calling while cool, but when the chump ring from DEA agent home and stops calling the cool cool it is not the same ring now really do it, there are others, but i cant bother post em up but i hope u own a drift, they should be named this Roadhouse wannabe ....... ...
