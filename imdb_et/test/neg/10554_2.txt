Wow, the kiss the bride wasn't so bad, but it wasn't that good. It wasn't sure that "Later in the day". In the middle of the movie, it splits ... maybe a 30-minute cut would have made a more enjoyable movie. However, the movie is again and again hit by annoying sub-blocks and throw scenes - the entire gold outlay comes to mind. <br /> <br /> Although the "kiss" is designed to release the theater, it seems more like a TV movie. Each scene is lit like a department store. There are so many signs to throw away. <br /> <br /> And Tori is really a pleasant surprise. He steals any scene he appears on. It was a repertoire dinner in this larger room with many tables - all decorated. But only 5 or 6 people in 250 rooms! Where all went. <br /> <br /> Gay cinema has sunk to a new low ... but not as low as the terrible movie produced and shown here! Channel.
