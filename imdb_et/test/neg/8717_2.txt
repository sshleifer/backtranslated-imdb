Certainly one of those shores that have ever been shown on these shores and that says something. Even many leading actors did not stay for the duration. The fact that it lasted eight years is a sad accusation of Aussie's average intelligence and the rise of culture. He went round, with recurring gags and badly drawn characters. Arthur MacArthur, for God's sake. did they really pay the authors of this exhibition? I don't know if anyone checked their qualifications. There were tired gags of the situation of the rural population and the second-level farce, which was a bad imitation of thousands of English and US moves. I think I hate it so much that it seems that no one wanted to make it memorable, original, or wise, but always chose the lowest common denominator.
