Shwaas can have a good story, but the director is completely talented. He doesn't know when to stop. If the story requires people to be confused, there are ten minute scenes of people who are confusing. If the story requires little background history, Konkan's green is ten minutes. If the story requires throwing a child, you get that idea. Not to mention extreme neighborhoods, so you can read the hair of people's nose. There are movies to be seen on the big screen, this movie should be seen on a 13-inch TV. Amavuta Subhash, who plays Asavari, is also the worst actor I've seen for a long time. practice too many years to achieve what it does without effort. <br /> <br /> I give him 4/10 just because the subject is different and the story is not bad. Whether Indian entry into the Oscar is about the volume of Indian cinema, but about the status of Indian judiciary commissions, because the film is not only good because its subject is artistic.
