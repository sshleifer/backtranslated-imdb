Gene Hackman is a former Marine Corps Colonel who collects a handful of private Vietnamese animal teachers to go back to Laos and rescue some Americans who are listed as missing. Hackman suspects that, in practice, one and a half noise in a secret camp is secretly held in a camp to be tortured and to work more. Hackman is paid by wealthy Robert Stack, whose son, like Hackman's son, is thought to be among the MIAs. But the situations are such that Hackman can only buy old and outdated weapons if he succeeds in quickly receiving the help of the stubborn Communist Loatian and his two girls. <br /> <br /> I don't think this film would be deliberately suitable to affirm the myth of Vietnamese who keep our MIA for propaganda purposes. Myth was real enough. When someone remembers, there were many bumper stickers in 1982 and 1983. I think instead of making the movie partly to sell money. It was absurd. Why would our former enemy refuse to return MIAs? Propaganda? Where is the value of propaganda something that is secret? To add labor? Do they need hundreds of additional staff in Vietnam and Laos? The motifs of this film - along with their triumphant music and high body mass - were dirty. <br /> <br /> What about the film itself? This is a routine paramilitary who is no better and no worse than dozens of others who appeared in the 1980s. Gene Hackman's performance is the only one capable of keeping his head on the water. He is almost always reliable. <br /> <br /> For others who are a formative plot derived from The Dirty Dozen, I was trying to guess which gang would sacrifice for the mission. From the three communist Asians I thought one or more dead meat. That is why Asian helpers appear in such films. (I was right two times out of three.) I also thought that Patrick Swayzie is a novice ex-officer, the youngest of the group who would never have "earned respect" from others because he would never have seen a struggle; Wrong. He will become a hero, true, but will survive. I thought Hackman should have fifty-fifty options, but he does it well. The formula does not lose originality. Charles Bronson's claustrophobic rape in "The Great Escape" is here in Fred Ward's former tunnel race, a claustrophobic who is forced to go through a drain pipe and a snake inside. <br /> <br /> The title "Uncommon Valor" is the tribute that Admiral Nimitz made to Iwo Jima's men - "From time to time, Valor was common." Nimitz was sure of that. The fact that the men who fought in Vietnam were all equally brave is far from the point. Anyone who saw the struggle or even near it, putting his life in a row next to them, was heroic. This film and the way it uses our bitterness for the Vietnam War does not do them fairly.
