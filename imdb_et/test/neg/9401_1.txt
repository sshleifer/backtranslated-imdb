Well, to make American divorce more money than the brains are bought by Tuscany's worsened villa. (Much more money, but at the same time the price has to go over, he can then prepare a rich breakfast for his workers and walk endlessly in Italy without work or obvious aids.) Endless boredom and inevitable Italian lover; it is the most pejorative sense of chick flick. Lane acts like an unqualified husband with a teen ingenue collection - which dynamically clashes with his serious fading appearance - along the way breaking various (mostly Italian) cardboard stereotypes, ditches, duets, senile contessas, and gigolos. Burned with unnecessary scenes, the most ridiculous is the uncomfortable and meaningless resting scene of the La Dolce Vita fountain. (A similar understanding was used in an effective and appropriate narrative context "Only You", Norman Jewison's great higher way to Italy and romance). The "Tuscan Sun" may be the freest cinema of the last ten years, despite the fact that Italy is obviously an objective panorama. Bonus is a negative point for a foreign lover who fell at the last minute to deliver the necessary Hollywood, ending with his target audience of Oprah-brainwashed housewife. Avoid at all costs, unless of course you see Oprah and Dr. Philit as the boundaries of intelligent discourses.
