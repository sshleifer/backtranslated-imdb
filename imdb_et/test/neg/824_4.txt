When you compare two movies with Sacha Cohen, Borat and Ali G, Ali G is immeasurably better. I'm not a captain, but it's at least a movie. Borat is a complete garbage and I don't understand how it is better than Ali G. <br /> <br /> I can't put it on my finger, something wrong with Ali G script: half jokes are like 15 years old, not adult screenwriter. And a lot of jokes, including Mr Cohen's lower body, are quite tasteless. <br /> <br /> But the movie actually collects comedy and there are also some funny jokes: how Ali G becomes a member of the government to make the public scandalous and stupid (unfortunately true) in today's Western society: people get a career to make stupid things publicly), as well as Ali's advice on immigration policy and some others. <br /> <br /> Ali G is still a sympathetic character, although he is mentally ill for his era. But it's OK to look, it's pretty funny. But never once does Borat look terrible and makes all intelligent motion devices sick.
