"Jefferson in Paris" is a really confusing film. It gives Thomas Jefferson (Nick Nolte) the light as wide as possible, painting him as a liar, a racist and a pedophile, but does not condemn these sins. It was as it was, the film seems to have said. End of sentence, end of film, behind the door. <br /> <br /> After her daughter Patsy (Gwenyth Paltrow) arrives in Paris, Jefferson continues with Maria Cosway (Greta Scacchi), a female homosexual English painter (non-criminal Simon Callow). But the course of events sends Maria to England, and Jefferson leaves her forgetful to forget a man who only asked him to live with America in just a few minutes before the screen. <br /> <br /> Sally Hemmings (Thandie Newton) sees she has been one of her slaves from America. Just because he's surprised, it's hard to say - although Sally is undoubtedly beautiful, he acts as a simple-minded child to Jefferson. If he does not talk about the "dark" speech images exaggerated by the ghost stories, he slips around his bedroom, practically dropping the lust for his own distinctive mass. not working. Jefferson continues to complain when Maria, her tired of waiting for her letters, travels from England to see her. I have not changed to you, he insists on providing weak excuses to not write. In her vision, Maria immediately sees her fatigue. When Sally appears, and he and Jefferson flirt openly in the presence of Maria (and cruelly, in my opinion), the illusion is completely broken. <br /> <br /> Today, no one believes that Jefferson, Washington, and the rest were all famous sections of virtue and morality. But should we believe that learned, distinguished Jefferson would be attracted to Sally, the woman whose most intelligent conversation is about "mass french friends" not chewing "corn" and who rubs herself when she goes, even before Maria's eyes? <br /> <br /> Even if we let this slide, this terrible revelation follows that Sally was only 15 years old when this thing happened (Jefferson was 41). Strangely enough, this fact only comes to an end when Sally's brother James is reasonably furious about his announcements that he's carrying Jefferson's baby. <br /> <br /> Jefferson is equally split when he said Sally wears his baby and patronizingly tells him to be much better under his protection than free and living in France with his brother. But he promises me to release him when I die, and our kids (including more that come, Jefferson says Sally as * his *) chilling when they reach 21. Oh thank you, mass, you feel like saying on the screen. Great deal. <br /> <br /> The worst scene is still ahead, however, with the involvement of Jefferson's daughter Patsy. He is already angry with him, first by breaking his prize made to his mother in his dead chamber to not get married again. (Obviously, she was not just talking about marriage.) Jefferson has also refused to allow Patsy to become a nun if she wishes, despite the earlier moralization of religious freedom (which seems to be the freedom to accept her). <Br /> <br /> Having allowed Sally and his brother to freedom, Jefferson calls Patsys a witness to the deal and allow him to do it if something happens to him. Sally's brother drives the baby's upcoming birth and Jefferson asks, "Do you swear?" Paltrow's performance in this scene is great, although he has almost nothing to say. His face almost argues with pain in this revelation, but he controls his grief and whispers. <br /> <br /> If something and filmmakers could have done something more to emphasize this point, "Paris is a reference to the status of a woman at the end of the 18th century, even attractive to Jefferson-like men, pleasing, but without true intellect or soul. We see Jefferson throwing a tear against Maria's letter, obviously telling him where to go, but he will soon laugh at Sally's wild dance full of hair and chewing. <br /> <br /> I don't know if this is Jefferson's exact portrait or not. I don't care to watch it, but for the sake of watching it. This Jefferson is not a hero or even a hero. He is a selfish, recumbent child molestor - and one who escapes with it - is not such a person, whom I want to see.
