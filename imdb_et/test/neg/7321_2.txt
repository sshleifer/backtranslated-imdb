I saw this movie with a couple of friends who were part of a triple header for teen comedy, with Dorm Daze and Going Greek. Obviously, we did not go for quality, but for the air to entertain and for gross packages. Generally we got what we came from, but the Wild Roomies really looked like: terribly. <br /> <br /> First, the first impression, cover: The Norwegian release cover showed breasts covered and a number of seemingly "crazy" background spaces; Brings up pictures of drunken teenagers who do funny things that aren't? - The "crazy" spaces in Cana were not even in the picture. And the funny things you expect them to do? - also missing. <br /> <br /> This movie was labeled with comedy, which is a bit strange because it is not even far away. Relative drama would be more accurate. <br /> <br /> In short, the film is about a young couple who inherits a devastating house in LA and is forced to get into the room to get the ends together. These roommates finally put on the patience and relationship test of the young couple because they are so "wild". The problem is they're not. And here's the problem with this movie: the main character's pair is so analogous and neurotic that they can create zero compassion. You'll find yourself rooting on antagonist rooms in the middle of the movie. Add mediocre action, a flat dialogue and a boring direction, and you get a movie that is best invisible. <br /> <br /> Look at something else.
