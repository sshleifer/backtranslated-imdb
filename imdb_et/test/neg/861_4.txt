Sylvester, the cat who was on the ship, said Tweety's bird happened with his owner Granny. Oh, I don't even have enough words to convey how much I have both Tweety and Granny characters. They just aren't funny to me and made it a short, fairly clean up to really sit. Sylvester is a big character in itself, but he can only do so much when faced with the fears of this hungry offer and the grandmother's old witch. This animated short can be found on Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 4, Disc 4, which has an optional commentary on Micheal Barrier. <br /> <br /> My degree: D +
