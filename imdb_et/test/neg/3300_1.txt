There's an exhibition and movies I've seen, and then I read the IMDb.com comments that I disagreed with, and I was happy to have the difference of opinions. <br /> <br /> Positive reading of this generation's reviews just reminds me of an unfortunate conspiracy involving TV network workers who have been ordered to browse the Internet, posting convincingly positive comments about programs for which they are responsible. <br /> <br /> How else would you look to see that this exhibition has "definitely become a phenomenon" all year after it has become clear that it is not something like this? <br /> <br /> I do not waste words that describe this confusion, but enough to say that if you enjoy wives who motherculate your husbands, wives who mumculate their sons, children who are disrespectful of jackasses of their parents and absolutely no other threads behavior or subtext to legalize characters that are basically just forgetting one liner spewing vending machines, then check it sh <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I have some seinfeld-dvd -d that pass. <br /> <br /> Futurama - Canceled. TItus - canceled. Arrested Development - Canceled. War at home - Updated. <br /> <br /> There is no justice.
