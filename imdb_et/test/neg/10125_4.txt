I liked prequels, and I found a relationship between Tucker and Chani in the past. However, RH3 was the first two hash, without charm or humor. I think I could ever laugh - and it was during NGs. Tucker was extremely annoying in this film and his character didn't seem to be for any purpose other than the most irritating. Chan is always pleasant, but she seemed tired in the movie. I was able to predict everything - who was a villain who was a girl (SPOILER ALERT) who was a good-boy-turn-bad guy, and so on. I hope to see more films from Tucker and Chan in their quest, but no longer in Rush Hour. It's just too tired. I recommend renting, but not buying.
