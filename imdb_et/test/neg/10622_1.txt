This movie made me look for my head against the wall. It is difficult to compare this kind of badness with something like this, but some say that watching this movie is similar to bleeding under your nails. And this comment comes from the writer's cousin. This movie was so bad that "Hulk" (the second worst movie) looks like "The Departed" (one of the biggest films in film). If you like a boring family movie with a predictable plot line, you will love this movie. If you have the brain, certainly not. When I rented this movie, I actually fell asleep while watching it. The next day I finished it from where I left, and that was the worst decision in my life.
