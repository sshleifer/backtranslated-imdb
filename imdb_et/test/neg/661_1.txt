OK, start with the best. building. Although it is hard to believe that it had 35 years of electricity and running water and fire, terrible walls and unusual items were interesting. besides that it is not worth it. <br /> <br /> As bad as it was, WWE movies made it. WTF? should it be able to see it? if anything, stay away. terrible, terrible idea of ​​making movies and allowing Gregory Dark to steer it. bad choice. previews were more interesting and entertaining. <br /> <br /> I can't even start discussing how bad this movie is. uninvited participants and disappointment, vague story. apparently, many of the actors in this show are "all holidays". it's a wonder why I've never heard of them or heard their show. besides, the bus driver, which you will never see, just at closing his door, has had more activities to almost all together. at least he does some tricks on some decent movies. <br /> <br /> I like to see scary movies. but it blew so much, the whole audience laughed at it and rejoiced the characters halfway through. very annoying. The child behind me was more tempted by other horror films. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie to see, even less than you have to pay for it.
