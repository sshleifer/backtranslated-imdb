Carmen is a prostitute who lives seducing and steals soldiers from the Spanish army; he is undoubtedly the best femme fatale right now. When a man stands against his charming attitude, he decides to do everything to destroy him. Finally, he falls on his web and is forced to do whatever he hated to be with Carmen. Regardless of the beauty of Paz Vega, she does not seem like a Gypsy (like Carmen) and her acting neither Sbaraglia is good. The story is very boring, and at most moments it is very absurd, while it is going to be true. likewise, there are scenarios and special effects, although they are not, but they are not acceptable, and too artificial for the historical film, as it is. All in all, boring and bad, with very absurd development, is much better to look at.
