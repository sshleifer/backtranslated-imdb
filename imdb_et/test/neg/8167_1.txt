It's hard to make a bad movie "underdog finally succeed" in the sporting theme, but this movie succeeds perfectly. My mind seems to be pointless and boring for this film. <br /> <br /> I think the director couldn't decide if it was a runner or a trainer. It doesn't come to either side. Finally, who cares? Neither character has a pleasant personality. There's nothing in the movie that would interest you. Even a "bad man" is not really bad. (I think she is in two scenes and seems to be in some sort of barbitade.) I think she asks her to politely leave and train her trainer. Later he asks sorta to move with him. that's it. Conflict! Stress! What is he doing? !! <br /> <br /> -And what's running? Has the director ever seen a real marathon? The form of Christine is so wrong that it is absurd, as is the supposed "champion" form she competes with (without a line. - Maybe they could have hired, you know, the actual RUNNER?) <br /> <br / > -And the speed that is running is not clear. Did they run or walk? It's actually ridiculous. I can literally move faster when they ran in a big race. Maybe it was too hard to move the cameras at real speed? <br /> <br /> Another absurd: (spoiler, I think) time. What they fell is a mystery. Maybe they both just ran out and fell? - And then they get up, but don't start again for 30 seconds. Oh yes, very realistic. This ridiculous event does not even cause any tension, because the other runners are not close and besides, you are now covered with catatonia. <br /> <br /> - I particularly liked how all four of her male teammates, all well-educated athletes, left the big race because of Charlie's horses or pulled the tendon or something so unlikely. But who cares? This film has almost no tension, no resolution, nothing. Some women who have absolutely no personality will discover an old, boring trainer with a past that has barely hinted. They train a lot. He's not happy. They're training even more. She wins da big competitions. Woopie. <br /> <br /> My description is actually more interesting than the actual movie. I just saved you for 90 minutes. Avoid this as a plague.
