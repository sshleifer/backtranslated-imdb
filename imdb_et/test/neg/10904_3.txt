If only he hadn't bowed to the clich√©s, Mr. Shiban would have been a good movie of that story. It was just different to interest you, so that the same amount of time, energy and money that was spent on this stinker could have been a good thing to do with eye rolling. <br /> <br /> Production - Reasonable, it is as good as one could really expect from the camera so he gets there. It really is a script that is to blame, because it wasn't so bad considering what the actors had to do. <br /> <br /> I thought the days had long gone, if anyone saw, finding the radio transceiver they desperately want to work on, first turn the knob of each thing from end to end, place it 6 or 7 times and wait for it would work. This story has destroyed the movements of a number of fools by all the characters except the bad boy. It's as probably too low to grab all of the plot equipment so they're all fed to us to make sure we get them. <br /> <br /> I don't know about you, but it doesn't work with me. My attention ends with the holes and over-dramatization of the plot, not the story. <br /> <br /> So, as I found it not so bad in technical terms, I think Mr. Shiban should try again, just in case of a proper script; then he can give us something worth seeing.
