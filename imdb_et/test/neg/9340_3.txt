I found the movie a bit predictable and boring, but I'm 14 years old. <br /> <br /> I was really annoyed about my little cousin because he was very hyper that day, so I saw the movie on the Disney channel and put it on and told him to watch it. <br /> <br /> She is 6 years old and she loved the movie, some bits she didn't get to end with, but I didn't get that any y was Eddie's video star I thought it was Jordan video ?! but he enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> I noticed mistakes like Jordan did not really play the guitar, but he never did. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a movie if you're seriously bored or 10 and down. <br /> <br /> It soothes my cousin well. <br /> <br /> Although everything then sang the rest of the day.
