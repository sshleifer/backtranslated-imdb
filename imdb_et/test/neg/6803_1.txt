What did they mean when they made this really sharp movie? <br /> <br /> Arbus, one of the most important photographers and women of the twentieth century, was exciting and dramatic. What did anyone do to make a film that explains his unique artistic vision as the result of a grotesque but charismatic hairy (imaginary Downey played) affair? <br /> <br /> In real life, Arbus broke out of traditional marriage and the role of a woman. In this film, Arbus is extremely nervous with Nicole Kidman, whose inspiration is attributed to "Beauty and the Beast", dedicated to an interesting person. <br /> <br /> For this transformation, the film is truly disgraceful. Regardless, it is just buggy and boring.
