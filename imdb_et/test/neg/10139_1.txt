Reba is undoubtedly one of the worst comedy magazines. I don't know how there are people who write good comments about "Reba" ... You look at "Friends", "Married Children", "Fraizer" when you laugh, you can never laugh at a stupid joke and a ridiculous accent singer who tries to come to his comedy and obviously has no chance. The actors / actors next to Reba are OK, so I feel they feel bad at the so-called comedy show, where the least funnies are in the world (Reba). In conclusion, I suggest you see this TV show how low comedy gets and appreciate those who can make you laugh
