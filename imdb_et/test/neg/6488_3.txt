This film is related to a group of women (perhaps not with the highest reputation) who are moving to a small fortress to take over the property of a recently left uncle where they intend to shop. When they arrive in the nearby city, they can't find anyone there (although it's only 15 miles away) so they walk. When they get there, they won't find any soldiers, but a number of people who have taken over the use of the fortress and built a small town. They will soon find that nothing is here and Fort McMillan (Ft. Doom as locals call it) is in some serious trouble. <br /> <br /> Instead of going to the plot, I give some comments on what I noticed about the movie. First, the actor is very flat, but few people seem to be real enough to believe. My first thing was bad action, but at the end I watched some things and the same people lived. So my only remaining idea is how the director wanted it. In addition to bad action, I have a big problem where people do not respond properly to certain conditions. Take, for example, nobody takes them to Ft McMillan at any cost, although it's only 15 miles away. But when we arrive at Fortun, we find that it is well served by a dignified population, all of whom need to get equipment from another, not to mention the letter, and so on. This should happen in 1867, but we can see it on a rail vehicle with electric lights (they are not at least) and a locomotive that is at least 30 years later, not one of the general nature of locomotives so popular at that time. There are also places where you can see a paved blackboard (and maybe a car at one point, not wanting to go back and watch) and other anachronistic objects. Had they followed the "world" rules and acted as actresses, she could have 4 of me 2 instead of what I gave, and they wrote it about 4 times, which could have made it even better.
