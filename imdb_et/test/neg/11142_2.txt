I like underground movies if they have something to say or show. I tried hard like a "trash." I tried to see some artistic achievements or some interesting representation of New York life in the early 70s. Or at least its entertainment? But the movie stinks and cannot be called art or entertainment. <br /> <br /> "Trash" is basically an excuse for Joe Dallesandro's naked body within 2 hours when he meets other uninteresting, annoying figures (I agree, it's a great body, but there's no excuse for this movie, right? ). Holly Woodlawn, like Joe's girlfriend, gives a few good laughs at the end, but it's too late to save a few hours of wasted people. Lou Reed's classic song "Walk on the Wild Side" is a better portrayal of these people, and it's time, even if it's more exciting than actually. 1.5 / 10.
