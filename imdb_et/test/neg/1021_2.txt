Southern Cross, written and directed by James Beck, is a waste of good cellulose and actor efforts. The formula film may not be bad if it pays for that promise that this film does not make. It's a tiring movie clich√© that can be traced to thousands of past movies. It is full of random and empty plot twists that add nothing more than purposeful action, like a protagonist's trip to a ghost town where these (inexplicably) crooks follow. It was obviously a pretext for a shooting and escaping location that limited the inconvenience of people opening into and out of door openings and running past windows to burn pistols. It believes that someone told Becket that there is a ghost town at the foot of Chile, and he said, "Oh, good, let's shoot it there." <br /> <br /> Don't waste your rental money on it. This is a bunch of random bits and pieces of a hundred different movies that have been thrown together to call action drama.
