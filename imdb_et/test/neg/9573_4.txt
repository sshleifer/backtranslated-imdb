When I write it in November 2005, I found out that the big British cinema boom has ended and when people say that much of it is still for the British government, which doesn't give the filmmakers tax incentives. simpler - the lack of producer diversity in recent years.

It summarizes one of the main drawbacks of the film - irony prevails over probable situations, you can evaluate the final irony of the sub-blocks, but is it likely? Perhaps the biggest irony is the title of the movie. It is called BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, but it was definitely a member of the audience that they were clich√© stereotyped people I couldn't believe as three-dimensional symbols
