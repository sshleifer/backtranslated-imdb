This movie is embarrassing. Nothing works at any level. Direction, scenario, operation, and editing work together to keep your eyes out of the screen. Everything is inappropriate and inconsistent. First of all, you can sit and rush there, win and laugh, but very soon the whole look will just become too embarrassing.
