It's a celluloid CRAP. You can say when you watch "I want to be" a mafia movie .... and that's it. It made NO SENSE at all, did not start at the beginning of his life, the symbolists were all over the place ... and TERM "GODFATHER" did not get lost until PUZO wrote the book ... ... if a real mafia borrowed PHRASE and did it itself after the movie ..... This piece of claptrap would be one to think that the phrase (which represents the mafia don) was used back in the 20's ... if these people were only called "DON" .... outside the original godfather movie if you want to see another decent mobile, see Puzo The Last Don (part 1) part 2, which is sucked.
