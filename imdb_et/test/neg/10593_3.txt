I wasn't old enough to really understand the original Mod Squad, but I knew everyone thought it was cool. I have some "books" written on the series of my series-print collection, and they are pretty light, so I didn't expect much from the movie. This is a good thing because this movie was bad on a long strap. <br /> <br /> I admire the danger of creating a movie that is so true to the 1960 hit. The film's audience, however, has been experienced for 30 years. At least I think so. I would expect something more than one and a half hours from the original Mod Squad concept, where (now old) car drivers, (now considered bad) camera (sound) soundtrack and (bad) script, and all on the big screen. In the 1960s we didn't care so much because we had minimal expectations. An integrated police team for young people who suited suits was also sufficient. It was another exciting episode of "Ironsides" or "Password". <br /> <br /> Rate this "episode" against ordinary theater releases, the story was ... well, I'm not sure if I should even say, because I'm not sure there was one. Drugs are bad? What ever. The script was stupid. When the characters exchange the dialogue and promote the plot on the line "I hear her by phone," and "I think I have a plan", we are really in trouble. No wonder action was terrible: no one knew how to say such idiotic traits. <br /> <br /> If I were Claire Danes, I would immediately go to my agent with a flame maker. (Actually, I think all the people on the film and watching it have the right to turn.) <br /> <br /> And where was this group Mod? I understand that these kids got out of the juvenile hall, but no one got a velvet suit? "Mod" meant only young and integrated? What happened to the white go-boots? Maybe the costume department was sparse, but everything they got was dirty and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Since the film was absolutely true to the original series and demanded the special behavior of actors, cameramen, stunt men, etc., we should appreciate it more. Unfortunately, it still doesn't like it. If I wanted to look at the 60th criminal drama, I would buy DVDs. No thank you.
