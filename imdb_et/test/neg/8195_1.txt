I remember watching this movie on TV a few years ago. It was so bad, I only remember scenes that died just as I laughed. The only summary of the schemes I give you (without a spoiler) is a home film made by high quality college children. </p> </p> Running what "Demon Cop" pursues when a man in Halloween costume was wrong. The car jumps out somewhere, strikes a running man. He sends him over the top of the plane and what does the driver do? See how a man falls, goes back to his car and drives off. What kind of hairdo would this do? I would at least have asked if the boy was okay. <br /> <br /> Then a black boy will straighten the face of Demon Cop, then tell the journalists later: "I didn't get a good look at him." <br /> <br /> Then some scenes are honest where this girl with afro pulls the machine gun out with a small purse. It couldn't be FIT! I can't remember certain scenes. Maybe it's because they were just so bad. <br /> <br /> The movie caves can't even jump in the garden and the actress is so wooden, it makes the boards better. All in all, this film brings shame to Hollywood, more than any other flop. You must see it to believe in your delicate cheese that it does not have as much as possible.
