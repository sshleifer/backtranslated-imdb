One of them is the 14-year-old girl's circumcision with a leather swimsuit. I would like to ask the fans of this movie: would you allow your daughter to go to the resort dressed like this? And could your 14-year-old man handle the reaction from men? If so, I would like to know why for both reasons. Such a suit is a clear invitation to men; it's hypocritical to assume not. <br /> <br /> And at the second moment that a teenage girl ever said to her father, was her lover without serious excuses for serious mental problems? It's almost as disgusting as a swimsuit. Simply put, some things aren't just funny or fit, and they're never.
