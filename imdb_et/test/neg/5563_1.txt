What should I say? I saw this curiosity only for curiosity, and it is really a shame ... I grew up in Brittany with the stories of Celtic legends and spent 5 years in Rennes, the city where this film takes place ... Shame that no actor or camera from this flick never came to Rennes. They could at least have chosen a likely city or likely forest, but not any SEEMs like Brittany or Rennes. In addition to these details, it could have been a good movie, but it is nonsense. Stupid scenario, stupid characters and originality. Be sure to avoid.
