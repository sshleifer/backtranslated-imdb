It looks so good on paper - Matt Damon, Lawrence Fishbourne, Jean Reno, nice right? And a $ 42 million spirit - sounds like a kick-ass criminal movie. <br /> <br /> Great disappointment - I think the stars got all the money because its product values ​​are bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> More than this pseudo reservoir Dogs are in the atmosphere as a simple crime goes wrong. This is very much for television. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is very disappointing - it gives points for what it is - but loses them tremendously, so it is not at all interesting at all.
