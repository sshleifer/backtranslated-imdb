Most are deadly boring, Naach talks about the dancer / choreographer (Antara Mali), who keeps himself as an author, except for the small commercial compromises that his surrounding people, including his actor (Abhishek Bachchan), are building their careers. A nice idea, it only turns out that he has the most insecure bad concepts about costumes and dance movement, things that are rotting enough to make even those very cheap South Indian potboilers with great embarrassment. <br /> <br /> The story follows an amusing, predictable pattern ... the dancer and the beau meet and have an affair (yes, sex is involved) ... the beau gets success but he tries to help him ... beau throws his attitude and they go on top of each other ... the dancer meets the most unlikely director who wants him to "do what he wants" ... unreasonable tightening bags even more inconsistently popular ... beau's attempts to get back until the peak where he breaks how he can't live without him ... D-uh end. <br /> <br /> In fact, I didn't expect this movie to be very good. Why did I watch it? Because I have a fetish of Antara Mali. He is an actor with an IMO who has enough talent to reach high heights when he has the opportunity. Unfortunately, his role in the film is much better on paper than in the actual embodiment, ironic on the film, which should be uncompromising in nature. To give her credit, she puts her effort into play, looks good for a couple of scenes that really demand her as actors. I just want the film to be worth it. Abhishek Bachchan also casts some good shocks, the last scene that is somewhat rescued by the simmering gear that pleasantly reminds his father. <br /> <br /> It is recommended only if you can sit in the humongous caves between some good grains of sharp leading players.
