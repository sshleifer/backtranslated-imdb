What a stupid waste of money! 30,000 square meters of rebuilt ancient Rome, 2 million cubic meters of 50 meters high building, 10,000 costumes, 2 years of work, international ancient history committee (sic!), Some first-rate actors and actors. The end result? Blank TV movie for one IQ participation.
