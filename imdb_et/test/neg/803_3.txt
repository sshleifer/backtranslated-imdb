Without ever being the worst film of science fiction, or the worst I've seen, Time Under Fire is still far below average. The rooms and the first 10-15 minutes are not so bad, it starts with the story of X-Files, which connects Bermuda's triangular strokes with a time trip. Pretty soon, the elements of other genres (too many) will mix, but the story will never miss the interest of TV series. Soon, Time Under Fire will quickly degenerate into clich√©s, not only mixing too many genres, but will not be able to create something memorable in a mid-term or special effect that will help viewers remember the movie tomorrow. Action is bad and the rhetoric of the script does not help at all.
