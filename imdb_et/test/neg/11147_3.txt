Under this plot is Ah-nuld versus Satan, and what I remember most about the film is a lot of explosions, fire, blood, noise, and don't forget that flammable satanic urine. The story is pointless, completely predictable and so full of holes that I couldn't take it seriously. Try "Rosemary Baby" or "Exorcist" if you want to see a really good fucking movie and .... um, well, I can't think of good "Action" movies right now (probably because they are so far and to a small extent), so you are in this category yourself. This flick doesn't get 3 out of 10 ratings for my camp value and Gabriel Byrne's pretty good result when old Satan!
