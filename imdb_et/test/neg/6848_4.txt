Three young cinema theater workers are given the task of reopening a long closed old house theater, where several years ago a shocking scary murders occurred. It seems that many more murders have occurred since then, but all three of them are unknown, hoping that it will eventually become big. As they approach the great nights of reopening, things become more and more strange and uncomfortable when they suddenly start to move without seeing the helpless and terrible old man who saw the rooms terribly haunting. <br /> <br /> Oh, it's really terrible. In fact, if Mary Woronov's secretary wasn't so violently independent tuned for a young woman who steals virtually every scene she appears on, and an incredibly hot chick who played an incredibly buggy but completely sexy Selina, it would be a complete loss. The only other good thing I have to say about this movie is some movie theater murders that are done in a truly ingenious, though not too gory (preference for me, but not necessarily for others). The rest just stops constantly (so extreme that rare few can actually find humor) and undergo a predictable striker who kills annoying signs after another routine.
