"Scientists in a distant laboratory test (enter a scaling creature) and creating control monsters. In the meantime, the crack military team / researcher daughter / bank robbers will find their way to a distant location and be threatened by giant critters. They will eat it all at one time in an" exciting "race that is not captured by these forces who originally created the monsters ... "The sad thing is that it sounds about a dozen movies that have appeared on the Sci-Fi channel. I have to think about what's going on? Of course ... I like bimbos and hollywood-hunk wannabes to eat CGI critters as much as the next person ... but where is the plot or originality? In this case, the Sci-Fi channel is shining in time. Battlestar Galactica, if a little dark, can be very good. Writers are still pumping into the various Stargate offers and the latest BBC imports, which are surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> Even in the various "giant" movies of Sci-Fi, animation seems to be improving all the time. Compare the comedy of this movie with a tricky version of the first giant comedy movie Sci-Fi. <br /> <br /> But goodness ... how about another plot? Maybe there is a somewhat different giant critic? I'm starting to look around the internet. Among the litter I found some interesting stories that could immediately repeat the work of SF fans and Russian CGI animators. I suggest that http://www.macrophile.com/~arilin/archive/metamorphosis-day suggest that they contact the author of the copyright. (The story contains violent images that are generally similar to different Sci-Fi channels offerings). <br /> <br /> The story includes a subplot, an ethical and moral commentary on the nature of mankind, and one of them ends with a terrible "did they really kill all the monsters?" moments, but leaves you completely and completely different from your mindset. <br /> <br /> What is generally what science literature should do, isn't it?
