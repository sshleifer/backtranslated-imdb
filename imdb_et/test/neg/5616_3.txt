I was the one who really assumed this movie was pretty good, maybe my expectations were a bit high, but I really love Judd Nelson. In fact, he is the only reason why this film is being viewed and his role is not really that great. The main highlights of this movie are dirty sex scenes and boring dialogue. If they are highlighted, I'm sure you get a pretty good idea of ​​what kind of movie it is. This is certainly the reason why it was made for television. See it only if you don't have anything better to do on Friday night or just rent money. Save time and rent a breakfast club!
