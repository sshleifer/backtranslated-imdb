I didn't expect much from this movie, but I was eager to try something that I originally thought it would be a horror in the early 1980s. Although the three teenagers are a somewhat critical plot, it is by no means a teenage horror movie. <br /> <br /> "Power" is the little Aztec idol that exchanges many hands as its possessor (who must be an adult and thus, "corrupted" gets a ship that frees all the idols from evil and often fatal effects not only to the victim's victims After making several shifts to control over it, the three teenagers ended up finding it and can't figure out what it is except that they found it a weird and dangerous thing. offer an explanation of the situation to a news reporter who does not buy a mental bologna, although his producer wants to investigate further, especially if it means he is under the control of an idol (I assume that teenagers have not yet been violated enough to feel the ideals favored by the idol). This is a story that was spoken a thousand times, especially in the horror and scientific literature of the 1950s and 60s. <br /> <br /> It was at least a bit of interest to me, although the budget was low, it wasn't obviously cheap or bad As many of the past decades had a low budget and future horror (nowadays they have the same but bigger budgets). We have enough margin to at least allow ourselves to be absorbed at least a little in a frightening atmosphere and so on, despite the story of the clich√©s. And though not terrifying, the special effects did well. <br /> <br /> Again, this is a routine horror story, especially with the ending (which from today's standards has become a nuisance to a useless device), but one that is not so embarrassing. This can be useful even if you laugh.
