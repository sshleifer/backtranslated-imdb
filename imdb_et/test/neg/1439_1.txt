Oh, where the hell am I supposed to start? Give a story short? No, have you heard it or not. In both cases, it sucks. Like the movie. I have a half-big horror film enthusiast, and I have to say it's one of the most stupid and terribly fulfilling movies I've ever seen. The script is amazingly stupid. The story begins too fast, but in no way any relationship or even the slightest. All of these scenes of torture would have been more effective for LOT than even giving the characters the smallest nonsense. Because the first scene of the movie is when teenage girls meet Capt. Howdy, how do we hell with them? First of all, they seem stupid to go to a party where they don't even know, and secondly, we don't even know their fucking names! Why should I take care of hell when they live or die? Not to mention that they really have the courage to try and feel Capt. Howdy regards compassion when he is "reformed"? PLEASE! I was glad when he just got his deserts! He deserves them! Hell, he deserves worse! We are also forced to sit with a useless false sequence that is directly raised from "The Silence of Lambs" (and here it is made by HORRIBLY! Of course, it gives them the wrong address! should wait and not beat some of Johnson's upper floors? RETARDS!) <br /> <br /> Then there is a dialog. All Captain Howdy says either ridiculous or just stupid. "The dead are so terribly dead when they're dead"? What the hell is that ?! At one point, Dee Snider says "knowledge is power". Well, if that is true, this film has no power. <br /> <br /> Then there are holes in the plot. Yeah, I know it's a horror movie (well, horror movie), but fucking! These holes can be driven with a semi-trailer! First of all, they must be DUMBEST policemen I've ever seen! EVER !! I mean, God, these guys are morals! Call Backup, Idiots! Second, how the heck of this humungous partition ring fell from Captain Howdy's nose?! Evidencely says that this piercing expert man says, "This is the biggest I've ever seen", but if it's so damn big, how would hell have it so easily fallen? Did Captain Howdy just FOLLOW IT in a crime position because he wanted to catch? They're not sure it seems to be. They would never release Capt. Howdy and I know about the fucking facts. He would have been imprisoned for the rest of his life and not going around. Much less let him return to his old house, where he killed / tortured everyone. POSSIBLE AND POSSIBLE. <br /> <br /> And now it works. Dear God, these people were sucking. Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this movie. She's ready and amazing. Too bad he hardly gets a good chance to act in this mess. Amy Smart appears for about 10 minutes and then goes out. Even the most entertaining Robert Englund is underestimated and ineffective here. Dee Snider plays a crazy man without talent. I never felt threatened, intimidated, or intimidated. I'd rather have seen Dee Snider in Alexis Arquette's role as "Chucky Bride". It would have been so much more fun to see this talent-less hack on this beloved psycho doll. <br /> <br /> Dee Snider just sucks. She can't act (one of the least frightening crooks I've ever seen) she can't write (did she write this unique movie in her bedroom?), And she's obviously unpleasant as Jessica Simpson! This movie is just a way for Dee Snider to show off all the strange mess he knows about self-harm and modern primitives and blah-blah-blah. Is it already done or not needed. I was bored of every thing. <br /> <br /> Functional sucking, music sucks, script sucks, pace sucks, special FX sucks, director sucks ... basically this movie sucks. This movie tries to be a serious and complex thriller / horror flick and it fails. It does not intimidate, shock or interfere with any form, form or form. This is probably one of the least effective and completely unigenous movies I've ever seen in my life. A piece of cinematic films captured by cellulose. <br /> <br /> "Strangeland" gets from 0 to 10. Avoid any costs. No less pleasant.
