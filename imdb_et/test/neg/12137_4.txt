Bored as hell and such a chick flick. <br /> <br /> This is a story of a neurotic woman struggling with the concept of marriage as a business arrangement, a romantic nature of one night condition, and insecurity and pitfalls of true love. <br /> <br /> Many of the story's motifs resemble other recent KST movies (such as the English patient), but they have much less complaints. <br /> <br /> After the first half -hour I started to check my watch, wondering if I'll get it home for a while to catch Leno on TV. <br /> <br /> I went over the "Gladiator" to see it!
