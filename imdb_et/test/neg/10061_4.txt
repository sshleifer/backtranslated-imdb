It is indeed one of the weakest films based on Agatha Christie's work, an inanimate, confusing mystery that clearly lacks the love (and budget!) Of her predecessors ("Death at Nile", "Evil Under The Sun") and Donald. Sutherland is Peter Ustinov's pale shadow on the screen detectives (of course he plays much less interesting character than Poirot). The film can only be reached on the coast to the strength of Christie's plot (all of its plots have a certain interest), but the direction is hopelessly flat. (* 1/2)
