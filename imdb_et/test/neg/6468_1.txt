I'm really at a loss as to how someone could give this movie 10 (or even more than 2!). It's full of bad lines, bad behavior, bad strokes, and so on. I've never thought I could see worse action than the UHF's deliberately malfunctioning scenes, but that was the case. And just when you think it can't get worse, then! Still again and again! You really watched it in the theater? It wasn't for free on TV! My four-year-old and 1-year-old loved it, but they wanted to see the cat more and the cat was almost absent.
