Gamera vs Viras were made lazy and as a result a large part of it. <br /> <br /> Space Aliens are trying to take over the Earth and stop Gamera. So they send another ship that can rob two young boys. Aliens control Gamer and get him to attack humanity. <br /> <br /> First of all, I really enjoyed Monster's fight between Gamera and Viras. Viras looks like a big squid with a beak. He has no energy and he does not shoot any radiation, but he can close the appendages on his head to make a sharp witty paw. This is usually not a bad monster so Gamera can fight and be decent. Gamer really gets hurt in Vira when she grabs the bottom of her cube with her shift head, and I'm surprised that Gamera was able to survive. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Gamera vs Viras decided to use the previous Gamera movies to make time for this movie. They show battles between Gamera and Barugon and Gamera and Gaose when foreigners watch Gameras' previous battles. But when they show Gamera battles with Gaos, they first show the battle between Gamera and Gaose, then they show the last battle between the two. After they show again that the last battle between Gamera and Gaose was used, they show the first battle between Gamera and Gaose !!! Talk about showing battles not in chronological order. Soon it was not necessary to show the first battle they should have just ended between the last two battles. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that they decide to display a video of a city attacking Gamer when aliens tell him to attack Tokyo. So they show the "Gamera vs Barugon" scene, where he destroys the dam. After the exhibition scenes "Gamera The Invincible", which is a big problem for me. Mainly due to the fact that "Gamera The Invincible" was BLACK AND WHITE !!!! Using Film with Black and White Film in a COLOR movie is really lazy and it's not good. <br /> <br /> Copying is also bad again. Two little kids are not so annoying, but it would be nice to see a Gamera movie that didn't involve a little child. The final battle is awesome, so basically I recommend skipping ten minutes and watching this movie. The rest has been seen before.
