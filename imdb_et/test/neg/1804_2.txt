If you are looking for a movie that makes you fall asleep, you will have a darkness movie for you. The book was not what I expected, and the film made me even farther. The cast list was pathetic and the whole surroundings were pathetic and not like a book except for some scenes. I understand that everyone has their own point of view when they read the heart of the Dark, and they create their own movie with their head, but they play important scenes and add meaningless scenes. If someone in the film had to have a certain culture, they would have had to use an actor with such a culture. There are participants from every place, and I'm sure they would have found better roles. Joseph Conrad was a respectable man and created a book that attracts you when that is what you are looking for, but the film was cheap and pointless, and someone who could make the film so respectful if the book had to do it. If you want a movie that draws you into the darkness, it's the Heart of Darkness for you.
