Having avoided seeing the movie in the cinema, but bought a DVD for his wife at Xmas, I had to watch it. I didn't expect much, which usually means I get more than I wanted. But "Mamma Mia" - say, hello cr **. I like ABBA, I like songs, I have old LPs. But this movie is just terrible. The show looks like a musical, but the competition with songs that hurry each other is not characterized, the dance numbers (which were heavily choreographed according to the DVDs) are thrown by only half of the bodies. and numerous numbers would have disproved Cliff Richard's music in the sixties! Meryl (see me I act) Streep can't even make your normal looting effective from top to top music! His great work - "The Winner Takes It All" - is Meryl Met! Note to the director - it should have been shot in silence when the camera gradually shows the distance between Streep and Brosnan! Part of singing is a terrible karaoke amateur night. The camera can't move like a bad MTV. You can never start and just enjoy music, enthusiasm and signs. But worse, how has this botched piece cut into **** has become Britain's highest threshold film and best selling DVD? Blair, Campbell and the new workforce have really reduced the United Kingdom to zombies - critical faculties?
