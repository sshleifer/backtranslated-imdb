the worst sequel I've ever seen. really terrible songs that bother how awesome the first movie and story! as well, that destroys the film for me, is that John Clees is not that Jean bob is not even in it and the new villains are terrible. it is really annoying how this old woman writes things that draws a simple sentence together without repeating her words over and over again. but fair that Uberta won't close, is a little funny. but it was his 50th birthday: why do they draw him at the age of 80? I was going to give it 1, but now I think ... I could give it 2. but still the story is not as close as the first film. it is similar to some characters without humor. In general, this film did not like the completely disappointing music, the lack of voice talents: having changed the voices of Prince Derek and Jean-Bob, the new villains, the frustrating traits of some of the stars' annoying habits and very simple animation.
