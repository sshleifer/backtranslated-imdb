I watched this movie so you don't have to! I have a great respect for Kris Kristofferson, but what did he think? Did he do it on a scale? <br /> <br /> At least, the title of the movie is true in advertising because people and objects usually disappear throughout the movie, adding confusion. In his comment, Kristofferson mentions that even if he was not sure whether the reality of Genevieve Bujold really existed. It does not support the viewer's ability to follow the story! <br /> <br /> "Making" was much more interesting than the movie itself. It looks at the difficulties that cause indie funding, even when the film is made. <br /> <br /> For this credit, this movie is visually pleasing and in no way looks just over 1M. Too bad money is not spent on a better project.
