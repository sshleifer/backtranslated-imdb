The charming combination of men and romantic relationships with melodrama does not give it a poorly-made film with a true taste of reality. As the action opens, Reno (AJ Buckley) enters his apartment, discovering his girlfriend with his girlfriend, who speaks to Reno, "Well, at least this is your known person", which led Reno to never be another roommate. this decision speaks to the viewers with the abandoned voice command. Then the story goes on for ten months when we find that Reno is really concerned with avoiding roommates, although it seems to raise a question because he has lived with the lover Holly (Holly Fields) with whom he has created family plans. The plot shifts briefly to the stupid Hollywood striptease club, where Reno's uncle Charley, who is in love with the "dancer" whom he considers highly desirable, pushes the club over to the club bar after seeing the fake charms of his affection. It is obvious that Charley was aware of the wrong state of his heart because he created a video tape during which his comment came from his large (and mortgage-related) residence in Hollywood, and we see that the latter decides, contrary to his promise, to interview applicants in two roommates as tenants. with whom he and Holly share the selection process in an organized way. After an ugly sequence of strange landlords, all of whom Reno and Holly are not surprisingly unattractive to live with them in their house, they are unaware that they are choosing the opposite sex, with lovers of choice being probably cool about their partner. The newcomers (Chad and Nicole) seem to have little presence except for the very wide phonetic range with many partners, and it is not long before the jealousy of Reno and Holly's harmonious relationship. Reno is bent on patenting and selling a commercial bag type, and if he has given Holly an engagement ring, the potential success of this entrepreneurial adventure is very financial when he plans to further develop his family plan. Unfortunately, Chad and Nicole are annoyed by a messy team whose activities are obviously fascinated and likely to break Reno's future weddings. The direction is loosely, clearly far from meeting the basic needs of players, although the incorrectly compiled script provides little material for the participants to work on, and ad slipping is embarrassingly flat. As a result, the performances have failed, not spotty editing, while the camera-working mode changes as sharply and often as firefly tail lights. Low budget and location-based shooting only requires skills for design processes, but tasteless D.J. background music, usually blurry and almost always invasive. Many discussions have been stimulated by the latest sequences of the film, which the viewer has apparently waited before it has come, but in fact they are probably only the only thought-out part of the poorly egg-shaped scenario and the bids are right to make the work almost traceable despite the collapse of production as a whole .
