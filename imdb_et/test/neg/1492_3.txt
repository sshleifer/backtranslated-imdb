I am very disappointed with this work. It is quiet low, continues to recur, mostly not accurate and sometimes on the wrong edge. I think it's done for primary school, especially because it repeats itself over and over again, leaving big gaps. A young boy can actually enjoy it and learn from it, but a better way to value the child's theoretical physics is books like "Time in History" or "Physics Tao". If you know the topic at a very ordinary level, you will not receive new data or views on this series. Don't waste your time with it. Nice eye candy though.
