Due to the mixing of many repeated and derivative sitcoms, the line falls in autumn, summer, winter and spring, it is nice to see an exhibition that sets itself in more than one region. <br /> <br /> 'Earl' is an unusual approach. It does not mean "everyday motives of an eccentric family" (zzzz ..), nor any other boring things you see everywhere in sitcomides. The exhibition is about the tiny white trash can of the time (Earl) that scratches the lottery card and appreciates the great time. It was at that moment that "Karma" took her away. Overtime, she learns that this unusual case was probably due to all the bad things she has done, so she leaves the mission to the wrong lie she ever did, and she got all her actions on paper. /> This is the assumption of a tyrant. Fortunately, it landed in the right hands. Conducting the exhibition gives very satisfactory results: you get an innovative comedy that is really funny and in many cases really touching. You can't help but fall in love with Earl's sincerity and persistence, Randy's simple spirit, good heart and observations of life, Joy's nature, terrible personality and Darnell's soft, chillinic behavior that really attracts him very easily. > <br /> When you combine the exhibition with true humor, good heart, interesting letters and well-written dialogue, you really are a possessor. With such exhibitions (and incomparable "The Office"), NBC is clearly something. Did they finally get a suitcase or two free space for quality assurance? Hope. And we hope more quality shows how they occupy the line; shows that I put both our TV viewers and NBC leaders to stop joking over a long time from NBC's golden days (Frasier, Seinfeld, Friends)
