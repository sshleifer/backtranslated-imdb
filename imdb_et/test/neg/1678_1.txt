Okay, I can sit through almost every movie, and I'm trying to really capture the Sci Fi Originals, but there was a big mistake in this movie that turned me off in half an hour. > <br /> Having served in the US Army, the film, including the military, has certain expectations. At least somewhat attentive to the right military rank, uniform and terminology is necessary if you expect the viewer to really enjoy the experience. "Bats: Human Harvest" was in characters bearing characters that were in the wrong direction and later in the movie was 11:00, but it was dark outside. Even if the script was perfectly made and the dialogue was outstanding and with a good Oscar value, if the filmmakers did not care enough about the movie to effortlessly display the appropriate way to display the military time, why wouldn't anyone want to watch it?
