Another terrible movie about ice hockey. If I didn't stay in the hockey and I saw the Hollywood version, I hate the game. This film does not make Canada so big. I can laugh at it and not take it too seriously. All this movie is terrible, every thing you can put into an 80's movie. Finally, don't even look at the TV. 4/10
