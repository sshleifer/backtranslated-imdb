I thought this little fantasy tour would be a little fun. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Good performance (Roy Scheider as president) didn't help at all. The story was the worst possible scenario that could happen in the nuclear disaster of terrorism. And none of them could recommend! True, the robbery of the president can only be done with the internal help of a secret service (one of the area's air force), but everything they portrayed on the FOOTBALL and our assisting state, if he were to fall into the hands of enemies, is ridiculous N. Seriously, not even the president can not get us Missile missile control. The case is only used for ordering. In this situation, our system would have completely erased the codes and the whole thing would be nowhere. The destruction of Beijing could not happen - missile-firing would not have happened because the silo crews would have been instructed (the communication also includes a wired system). There are just too many security measures to prevent such a thing from happening. Indeed, a film such as FAIL-SAFE and STRANGELOVE gave us some credibility that we lose control of the SYSTEM. But this film goes too far and cannot stop its incredible concept. And this makes the experience a waste of time for the viewer. This movie is a failure.
