Not only have I read this book and watched the movie, but I was placed in the USS John F Kennedy when they filmed it. Needless to say, film teams and actors can try out people who are trying to do their job. Now, about the movie. As a career naval man, I was quite disturbed by the way they showed up on board an aircraft. I can choose inaccuracies in the movie (anyone who has lived with the carrier), but it takes the pages. One particularly eye-catching scene was when they were in the CIC (Combat Information Center) information system and they watched the RADAR contact move across the screen. Each time the contact was moved, it beeps. Unfortunately, this device is not a beep (I was a technician for this equipment). The book was based on the fact that the film was not. Watching TV shows was just as bad and the Navy finally realized that supporting this series would just make them bad. If you are a naval person, look at how Hollywood's sight can see the film carrier's life. If you are not a naval person, look at Midway or Top Gun, at least these movies are entertaining and based on fact.
