This is the third movie of the month that I watched, which didn't go the way I expected. The first two are The Black Dahlia and Hollywoodland, neither of which gave new ideas about the perpetrators. <br /> <br /> I have always been fascinated by UFOs and was so excited to see a new UFO film research topic that was not comedy. But after about 30 minutes it all went horribly wrong. <br /> <br /> I could have acted on camera corners, stereotypes, if only there was a good story behind UFOs, but not here. I'm not saying that there was something wrong with this topic, but Netflix pushed this movie as a UFO skeptic and a UFO believer who studied multiple seats. <br /> <br /> I stopped for about half way. Can't believe I wasted so much time with that time. Please do not make the same mistake.
