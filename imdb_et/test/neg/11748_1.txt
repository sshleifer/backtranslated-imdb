First of all, the whole idea of ​​rewriting a classic, such as "Psycho", is not unpleasant. A lot of time and effort was wasted here. I'm sure they're smart enough to find out they couldn't fix the original, so they have to respect Alfred Hitchcock in their minds. But the idea that began with well-intentioned respects results in horror for a masterful face. This film has been poorly produced, badly behaved and unnecessary At first, the classic stands well on its own, even after 40 years. The Hitch events that return from the grave and come from the people responsible for this trash are unlikely, but if I were them, I would sleep one eye open only. Don't waste your time.
