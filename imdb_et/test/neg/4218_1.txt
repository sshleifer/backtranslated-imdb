... But not that! I always wanted to know what happened. We never know what happened because GWTW was Margaret's child. I am a fan of Fone With the Wind and I couldn't reject this movie any more. I compared "Scarlett" with the original GWTW because every movie that followed GWTW had to be of the same quality as the first. Rhett was beautifully cast, although NO ONE can never be compared to Mr. Gable. I am also a tight fan of Vivien Leigh! He was Scarlett. He fits the bill. No other actor in this life or any other time will ever fit the same shoes, but "Scarlett" could have done the job better. Not enough thought to find the right Scarlett, it was obvious. <br /> <br /> In general, something to look at, but if you want to know what happened to Scarlett and Rhett, I suggest you write it yourself or find a fan of fiction. This movie is not worth the time.
