Everything that made the original so fun seems to be missing here. It's just a "destructive destruction of the mill's demons," but without a passion that embellished the original. <br /> <br /> The story is nothing new, in fact they seem to ignore the first at all. Here, demons run in high security apartment buildings and naturally kill most of the population. Makeup effects seem less convincing here than the first time. Although the actors were not perfect in demons, in demons 2 they are actually much worse. You don't care about these characters, AT ALL. The plot is non-existent, music is poor (besides one Simon Boswell's song), it's not the least scary; it's not that good. <br /> <br /> The worst movie Dario Argento has been involved in and also Lamberto Bava (Bava is a movie that's not very funny). <br /> <br /> Maybe there are 3 too high ratings, but at least I could see it all and didn't have to stop halfway. My advice; Stay with the original.
