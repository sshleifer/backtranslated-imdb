"Thunderbolt" is probably Jackie Chan's worst film since "Protector" in 1985. Yes, I know nobody is watching their movies for their stories, but drawing them is unusually flat, even according to its standards, and the fighting choreography IS is in line with its standards, fighting scenes (all two) are destroyed, as others have mentioned, foolish , with interfering camera work. Even the most serious Jackie Chan fans should not really worry about this offensive accidental, stunt and plug-in waste. Anita Yuen's lovely and supernatural power is one of the few redeeming virtues. For a good "serious Jackie" movie I recommend "Crime Story". (* 1/2)
