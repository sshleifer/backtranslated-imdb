I saw it coming out in theaters in 1996. I remember that I was already familiar with Elijah Wood's work (that's right, he did things before "Lord of the Rings!") And the movie's trade cuts were pretty rich ("Flipper" waterproof guns were even circulating). <br /> <br /> For adults, old films and TV shows were reminded, and after nostalgia, their children saw it as excited as it was a movie dolphin and a stupid boy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, nobody was waiting or floping. You know the movie's struggle when the boy swims in the middle of the ocean with the Hammerhead shark, and the dolphins in the pack scare off the shark and the boy - instead of watering out the water - floats in the water for five minutes, thanking his dolphin for rescuing him ... obviously he's not remembered that the shark is still there, maybe even under him. Another problem is Paul Hogan. She looks old, harsh and tired of reusing her Croc Dundee shtick. No one even remembered "Crocodile Dundee" much less than Hogan by now, and I do not know that he is suddenly pretending he did not know what the hair dryer was to laugh on behalf of the water / social satire. which is amateur and occasionally hard to see. I hated it when I saw it back in '96 and I hate it more.
