PDQ Bach did it better. A large part of "Bach" speaks is letters written to various patrons who complain about the size and speed of his payment. Anna Magdalena's diary, mostly about child death and various other family issues, is more interesting. Music is puzzled: 17th century chapels and choirs producing the sound of the 20th century concert hall. The overall quality of production reminded me of a younger slideshow. J S Bach was a great man whose music speaks for himself. This movie adds nothing. Netflix sent me 2 discs that didn't play so I played the movie. It is clear that Netflix tried to tell me something.
