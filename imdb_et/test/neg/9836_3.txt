One young man named Danny is away from home and meets a drifter named Bix who agrees to mark with Danny and watch him ... and his money. They reach a small town where they meet Carrie - a shy, naive girl who works in her father's canteen. Bix starts Carrie's vision, but he plans to leave soon (because he's drifting, look? He's not good! Understand?). Meanwhile, Jesse, the cityâ€™s eatery (played by Jack Elam perfectly cast), is in the dining area and disturbs Carrie. Danny involuntarily keeps whores left and right (since he's loaded with money, he has almost one hundred dollars!), Who Bix has to keep away from (there are a lot of vague gays between Danick and Bix in this flick). Finally, Bix and Danny decide to leave the city, but the trouble is brewing, thanks to Jesse. <br /> <br /> My own film review: A terrible, dated "Troubled Youth" flick from '50s <br /> <br /> Reviewing the MST3K version of my movie: I have to say that this is one of the best episodes of MST3K. Riffing is dead all the time. Except for the somewhat endless end, this film is a simple material for Joel and Bot, especially Danny's constant screwing, which Bix must save him. The host segments are also pretty good, especially in the segment with the Train Song. Hopefully Rhino will release this episode for one day of home video.
