It is a shame that high-quality actors such as Baldwin and Booth have to leave for peaceful stories and scripts. But hey, this is a cruel world ... <br /> <br /> This is another long-term assassin thriller that uses all the usual narrative turns to try to make it more attractive than it is. Of course, it has some nice places, it's slippery production, good camera work and editing, and it's pretty fast, general. <br /> <br /> What is the real problem? Simply, the whole assumption is just totally unbelievable. But instead of spoiling the closed story for you, I'll let you know what it's all about, that is, when you can get it through. I succeeded, but only because I like Baldwin and I hoped it would improve. <br /> <br /> It wasn't. And it was one of the anti-climactic endings that I've seen for a long time. Actually, maybe never ... <br /> <br /> But it's harmless fun, I think if you have nothing better to do.
