Hollywood does not allow anything to make money on the film, even when they have to drag stereotypes and put them in the most impossible and stupid situations. This effort is a clear example of this and I really believe in my heart that such a film is racially irresponsible. The story relates to a divorced lawyer named Peter Sanderson (Steve Martin) who has talked to a woman with his computer and when he finally meets, he seems to be the opposite of what he was expecting. Charlene Morton (Queen Latifah) is a close black woman who does not intend to get to know Peter, but wants to see her case where she was convicted of robbery. He wants him to leave for good, but he keeps opening up in inappropriate times, and he conserves himself to look at the facts of his case to save his work. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT *** ** <br /> <br /> Peter is his children with him and Charlene proves useful in raising them, but suddenly the newsletter says he has escaped with the name of the convicted Charlene Morton has left the prison. Peter tells him to leave when the FBI goes around, but he thinks he's really innocent when his old boy looks up and threatens him. <br /> <br /> This movie is directed by Adam Shankman, who keeps things moving at a nice pace and is a technically good looking movie, but the script is just as unlikely and every character is a stereotype point that the 1970's "Landlord" is Obviously more inconsistent with race relationships than this confusion. I've always been a big fan of Martin and I think he's one of the most talented people, but he always loves to work and sometimes he seems to choose the manuscript given to him. On the other hand, I have always had a problem with Latifah and the way his barriers go to Martin's life is so upright that he immediately starts to pamper. The basic assumption that Hollywood loves to use is a hipster person who shows a little white to relax and then pass on some street logic that helps them live their lives. Basically, this is a story here, but of course they have to stick to Martin and stay over as slowed Eminem, because Hollywood knows it's what the viewers want. Well, I was pretty much offended by everything in this movie and that's not because I don't have a sense of humor, but unfortunately (for Hollywood) I use logic and common sense when watching a movie. Yes, I enjoyed talking to Eugene Levy, but do we think we would love Latifah right now? I think things have happened and how many times does the main actor hit only to save something from his pocket? Does the mobile phone break when the ball hits? Even if your hardest Martin and Latifah fan, I wouldn't recommend it. I know I've said it before, but it's not an attempt to make a good movie, it's an excuse to make money!
