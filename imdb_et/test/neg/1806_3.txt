If you have ever heard this statement, "the book is always better than a movie," the heart of darkness is no exception to the rule. I believe it was much easier for me to understand the novel's details about the film because I read the book incorrectly in my English class. We discussed each paragraph in great detail so that I understood the concept quite quickly. When watching the movie, I couldn't really understand. This may be because there were no discussions in the classroom, but I think that is because I could not paint my own pictures of the novel in my own sense. If you are a person who believes in this well-known statement, leave your list of tasks despite the Heart of Darkness movie.
