Technically I'm a fan of van Damme or I was. this movie is so bad that I hated them for 90 minutes. Don't let the name of Isaac Florentine (Undisputed II) fool you, I had a great hope for it, depending on what I saw (Undisputed II), man. all the fans of the action wanted a great return to the classic hero, but I think we can't see it soon because our hero continues with them (cross-border-far-city-and-chill) - the bad guys-as-return home) I mean for God, we are in 2008 and they demand that these frustrating movies do at every level. Why ?? Do it for your own benefit, leave it seriously.
