** May contain spoiler ** <br /> <br /> The main character, the noble named Fallon, is stranded on an island with both harsh and lethal characters. Count Lorente de Sade (pronounced "dee-SAY") speaks of his hallucinations and sees all intruders as an intruder on the island. He usually kills the mute servant Anne and tortures her unwanted guest to the cave. The giant "nubia" slave, Mantis, laughs at the incident and laughs deeply and helps de Sade scare the victims in the most dangerous game style. De Sade's gentle woman, who has been destroyed by leprosy, offers some truly frightening moments when she comforts the prison cell and includes an helplessly linked prisoner. (This scene was watched in late evening on television by many children who remembered adulthood.) One almost normal person is Cassandra, who has the science of suppression. ("I used to be a sister, now I have nothing.") She and Fallon are planning their escape and eventually the enemy will experience more frightening than de Sade and Mantis. <br /> <br /> This movie was shot in San Antonio and led by a man who was competent in drawing horror comics as horror movies. (I say this to Mr Boyette - he shows his fixation here as he did in his comic strips.) It's rather like Andy Milligan's melodrama, which cuts off the meat cutters. A period of wardrobe, library music, abuse of the disabled and a comprehensive misanthropy make one wonder whether Andy is not a consultant. But Milligan made better suits and wrote a better dialogue. The technical gaffs are too big here, but you know that this flick is in trouble when you see an opening shipwreck that looks like it is caught in the fish's density. Also, a movie made in Texas should have more real spiders and snakes than rubber. Glorious Eastmancolor gives this melodrama, which is so worthy of this spicy look. Fallon's initial meeting with the leprosy is really terrible, as is the way the movie leaves. If the rest had been half-harassing, HARROW DUNGEON would have been a terrorist class. Instead, this is a funny piece that litter bins love for all the wrong reasons.
