The first 10 minutes of the movie will entertain the sequels and pg-13 movies. These are two reasons why the film is so bad. They constantly refer to the film "Get Leo", which is a movie-in-a-movie version to get short. Every time they do, you are very angry. Travolta is not very cool nor anyone in Keitel. But Rock and Vince Vaughn are fun. They are not funny to see in Elmore Leonard's movie. If you don't see that it's short, you're probably pleasant. If you liked it, you leave the theater who wants to kill the director and the screenwriter. Wait for the DVD.
