This movie is terrible and does not blame Jesus Franco because it is not his fault. <br /> <br /> This film was silent over the years at Welles when he got the money to bring the team and the actors together to shoot. How much the Welles movie was actually shot is not clear, although not all films or all sequences are here, as several "key" sequences, such as a movie theater in a movie theater, are in the hands of collectors or supporters who would not give them up. The film is just under two hours and I would be very hard to imagine it would really work with any length. I think many of the remarks made by Welles before his death that he never plans to release a movie but put it together as a personal toy. <br /> <br /> What's here? for the most part, it is beautifully captured but dramatically dead. In the first hour, when Quixotel and Sanchol tend to land, there is very little. Bored would be an integral description of the material. In the second hour, Quixote arrives in modern Spain, and in many very good sequences, it deals with everyday life. This does not mean that there are not some nice moments, the windmill and the canoes are pretty good, but mostly it is a big waste of movies and time. <br /> <br /> "Finished" Jesus Franco, who was the Welles assistant director on average at night, had a bunch of movie fragments assembled as well as possible. Many people are crucified by Franco because the film smells, but to be honest, no good movie can be made of the gift material. One critic in the 1970s has gone through a different section of the film, which meant that Franco made this version independently and destroyed it. Although this may be true, I have gone through Welles' story and cut the film many years ago because he never got it right. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible, no matter how you finally left it. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, I asked how good was the filmmaker Welles. In addition to citizen Kane, almost all of his films have plagued or disrupted the budget, so we are sorry that many of his films "would have been better than just ...". How do we know? How do we know? Perhaps Welles was a man with fewer talents than we thought, and many of his films were not so good and would never have been. Although this is not the place to claim that Welles is in film history, Don Quixote is a surviving material, assuming it converges to what Welles predicted (I think it works), is a good way to think about how we man and we see her work. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 good sequences (though 2 out of 10 are probably closer to reality)
