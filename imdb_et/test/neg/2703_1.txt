The image was Spytroops Film pretty bad. It's just 44 minutes long, with several more battles ending with the destruction of COBRA headquarters. One drop was the beginning of the film. The animated battle, which was better than the rest of the movie, has proved to be a simulation of a battle. This right was a big shutdown and the rest of the movie was not reliable. Then there was the question of a shipwreck related to his parrots and a room where no one had been checking for several days. What happened to the camera? <br /> <br /> Based on COBRA, there were only a handful of characters and the rest were BAT robots. In addition to many corridors, it seemed that COBRA had no weapons, tanks, trucks or other equipment. Then it was a silly understanding that 100 complex android could be created overnight. The plot was silly, even if it was meant for small children. Spongebob, Powerpuff Girls and even Barney Dinosaurus are paying more attention to their plots. <br /> <br /> The characters were not bad, except that I never understood what Destro said, and the Cobra commander was stupid and not much of a villain. In fact, with the exception of Storm Shadow and Xartan, the rest of the COBRA characters were comic and hardly impressive. GI Joe's characters were pretty good. Scarlett, Agent Faces, Road Block and Snake Eyes were my favorites here. The worst was the shipwreck and the beach head. The shipwreck has been written so that chewing gum and Beach Head sounded like some 1990s surfer guy. I think the writer Larry Hama tried to earn a memorable sign for teenagers, but he was out of the mark for a decade. Just listening to Beach Head's Spicol surfer-talk (Fast Times at Ridgemont High), I wondered if the new GI Joes would be smoking dube before the big mission. <br /> <br /> CGI was pretty good, except that Cobra Commander had a jerky spastic walk and the vehicles didn't seem realistic at all. The airship and explosions were not very impressive. The old style animation would have been much better. Because Hasbro likes to do cheap things, they got what they paid for. I had trouble viewing the whole thing, it was just bored and lacked the soul or the spirit of GI Joe. Even the old GI Joe ads would have been better. In fact, DVDs included four or five GI Joe Spy's current advertisements, and these ads were much more interesting than the movie. Advertisements had more fun and spirit for children. The ads were alive when the film was boring.
