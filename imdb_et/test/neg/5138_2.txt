Forgettable pilot who never explains why Nostradamus really matters to the plot, but Rob Estes plays a hunky policeman who, for some reason, is in Nostradamus and who fights with the occasional medieval monks who run with weapons and bring people in to start apocalypse. Oh yes, there is also a sexy FBI agent who happens to be pidchic and tries Robi to believe everything before it's too late. Too bad could not predict a better plot. Yawn. <br /> <br />
