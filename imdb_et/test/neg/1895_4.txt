Since the film was beautifully photographed and worked well, the script was boring. and nothing we haven't seen before. Never in the movie could I ever feel that these people were really in danger. There is no noticeable climax and very standard resolution. I believe such films have been overrun and should be given leave. After all, does EVERYONE have no Schindler list?
