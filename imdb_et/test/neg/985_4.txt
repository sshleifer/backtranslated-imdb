The most common, surface level biography you might hope for. The embodiment of Busey's Holly is accurate - but who wants to hear Gary Busey sing "Maybe Baby"? Usually, members of Hollies are used instead of people or even characters instead of comics and melodrama (Smith and Stroud, respectively). When Holly uses the string, the old Jewish-looking men say to him that he uses the same techniques as Mozart. It is such a funny statement that makes such (and "Amadeus", above Mozart) such film biographies so worthless. Some entertainment can be derived from Holly's great style and B-variation songs.
