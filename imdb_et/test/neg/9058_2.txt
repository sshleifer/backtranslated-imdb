ARM AND DANGERO is not one of John Candy's biggest awards. This film, fired by a policeman who comes to work on a small security system, is very weak and not very comedy. I have a few moments that I enjoyed, like looking at Candy in a pilot trouser, but it doesn't seem important. ARMES AND DANGERO is still a dangerously frustrating noise brought to us by the director of the equally stupid actor COMMANDO. What a sad excuse for comedy! <br /> <br /> 1 out of five
