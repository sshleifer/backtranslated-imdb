I saw this movie with very low expectations. I didn't know much about it, so I wasn't sure if it was worth it. The Holy continues when the lands appear and force them to remain ruins. <br /> <br /> Then the film becomes somewhat tense meaningless. The amount of gore found in this film did not counterbalance whether it was really necessary or more used for shock. . They had a fire and they did not try to burn it and did not try to cut it to see if they could destroy it. They quickly jumped on the role of the victim and their helpless attitude was not real. It reminded me of old horror movies, where people just scream and scream and don't have half the brain to try to come back.
