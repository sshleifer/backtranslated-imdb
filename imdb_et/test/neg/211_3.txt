After watching it for 15 minutes, I knew how it would end. This is a clich√© movie with a stupid setup. I'm a big fan of the movie, but it doesn't give anything new. It's about insider hoop gone bad because "hot head-bad man" lets hell, and of course "not good bad guy" goes for a moral trip. The reason it is stupid and not credible. If you've gone so far as to kill the dust, why not just kill one man between you and 43 million. They got 45 minutes to kidnap the money and the stage that nobody wants to go there. fast forward to the center, but I gave it out and the boy I regret
