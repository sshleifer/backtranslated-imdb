Oh Judas. I would never have thought that I would soon be able to see a local thriller thriller, but here it is. Armed with a rotting plot, terrible editing, stylish action and "style" headache (sorry, I have no other words), Sanctimony is a movie that forces you to reassess almost the entire genre; that is, this movie is so bad that even those thrillers that I condemned as a complete failure now seem a little better. <br /> <br /> Now, not only is Sanctimony a terrible film in itself, it also succeeds in ripping the better films and doing pathetic work in the difficult task. From the main headlines - something other than a blatant attempt to reproduce Se7en - I had the impression that nothing smelled quite right. As soon as the movie started with the fast-paced carriage of foolish, tiring hips full of pictures and bomb colors, I knew where that smell came from. <br /> <br /> It turns out that two police officers, or rather police officer Jim Renart (Michael Par√©) and Dorothy Smith (Jennifer Rubin), are investigating the murder in Vancouver. Serum killer, known as "Monkey Killer" (what a threatening, chilling nickname, uh?), Has killed quite a few people for its working methods. You see, this nut seems to appear after the proverb, "don't see any evil, don't listen to evil, doesn't speak evil" and cuts eyes, ears, and tongues out of your victims. So far there are six eyes, six ears and three languages. Renart and Smith are very brilliantly aware that Monkey Killer is likely to kill three more ... well, because he probably wants to finish number 666. So suddenly the film focuses on Tom Gerrick (Casper Van Dien), a young, successful, handsome businessman, awfully. And this is where American Psycho attacks. <br /> <br /> So we follow the lives of two police officers and a young psychopath, none of which is the least interesting until they finally meet. Nonetheless, the discotheque where Renart is in dire need of Gerrick threatens one of the more recent memories of a more fun scene: Renart goes behind the disco because ... just because the script tells us it's a suspicious place; when one hits the stomach, Renard is released from a big guard who blocks the path, and the guard has never heard again? Does this scene hit anyone else unrealistically? <br /> <br /> Anyway, after the second murder, Gerrick turns to witness, but Smith, and especially Renart, immediately doubts that he might be a killer. In a typical basic instinctive way, Smith gets a date with a young businessman, assuming he can discover his true identity. <br /> <br /> I'm not breaking the end, it's just embarrassing; there are contradictions, some plot holes, problems that have never been solved, and especially one last scene where a cruel mass murder, which should be shocking and sad, comes just as ridiculously over and makes sense that, frankly, one cannot imagine how someone couldn't laugh at it. <br /> <br /> After 87 minutes, Sanctimony really does. You never care about a single label because they are all so flat (not to mention boring) that you know exactly who is the one who met you for the first time. You have never pulled in the story because the scenes are connected to the equipment of a weak plot if they are not unnecessary and inappropriate. Functioning range from average (Van Dien) to cruel (Rubin and most supportive pains); Music is a common generic techno and photography is one of the worst I've ever seen. Of course, like every genre of fiasco, we have a little free nudity. <br /> <br /> 3/10
