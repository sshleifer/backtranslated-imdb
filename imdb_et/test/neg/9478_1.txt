Just what the world needs - another superficial cookie-cutter Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen's film. This movie gives girls terrible messages everywhere, with a stereotypical "junior high" experience. They are doing something completely taboo. I can't stand the counterfeit French accents or the mopeds who compete in a circle that eventually falls for the twins. Why do I put everything in parentheses? Because he's all stereotyped. Twins even complain that they do not have a stereotypical grandfather. They should be happy that they even have a grandfather at all. How does it fit for Mary-Kate / Ashley mold? There are those who affirm one of the boys who (NOT!) NOT THEM !!!!! Yes, people, they actually have a mother who appears for all five seconds. I'm not even thirty minutes away from it and I can already tell you how it ends. This movie is so pathetic that Miss USA seems to be an academic bowl. Really.
