I think Category 6: The Day of Destruction was very unrealistic. Digital effects like a child's cartoon. <br /> <br /> The actors didn't act realistically, for example, when he was shooting, he acted like his tomato sauce. <br /> <br /> The film was boring but I watched it because it was turned on. The only interesting sign was Tornado Tommy, he was funny! <br /> <br /> Please keep the special effects real. <br /> <br /> I liked the comment: "What did we do to interrupt the mother's nature?" What else can I say is that the film is so boring, I think my comment is so boring.
