Just a sci-fi UK, July 5, it was ****. Shame on JRD! Maybe he was weekly! He can't slip after LOTR. I don't think he was guilty. Mr. Sheppird was. I turned it off after 50 minutes, couldn't wear it. The Cgi ship was bad and the creature looked like a big 5-legged bat. Who funded this project? I think the whole thing has to cost $ 250. Avoid buying at all costs, don't think about buying DVDs when they release one, I can't imagine they spend dollars on producing it. We hope that someone will make a decent Chupra movie and a decent BIGFOOT movie. Sasquatch was fine, bad Lance. With this embarrassment great studio and direct habit of risking it, no more super hero movies please!
