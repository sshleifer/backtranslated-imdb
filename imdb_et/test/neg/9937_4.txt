The first thing you should know about "Zipperface" is that it is video-cut so it has a peculiar look that is terribly annoying and severely complicates it as a "real" movie. And "Zipperface" really looks like a bunch of amateurs come together to try the "real" series-killer thriller. It's not quite so, but it's not as bad as it looks. If a woman is one of two detectives, she puts a spin on the channel. Dona Adams gives her an amateur-like presentation in her role - her obvious inexperience in the camera somehow works for her. In addition, he finally struggles against the killer. Red herring seems to be ridiculous first, but ultimately they work - I thought the killer was wrong. And you have to think about whether Tarantino would have seen a Zipperface man when he came up with the idea of ​​"The Gimp" for "Pulp Fiction". (* 1/2)
