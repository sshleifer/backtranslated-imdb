I decided to watch this movie because I didn't see Carol Lombard before the movie. I'm sorry it was because honestly this is a dog? and even Jimmy Stewart and Charles Coburn, both of which were great actors. <br /> <br /> The film's problem is simple: he's trying too much, too quickly, over the story of a young lawyer (John Manson, played by Stewart) who marries Jane (played by Lombard) within one hour of the meeting. What is this cliché? Help in haste, relieve entertainment ... <br /> <br /> In short, this story is a series of episodes showing the deteriorating financial situation of couples, their concerns with John's living mother, their efforts to pay bills, John's decline in office, their child's son John Jnr (unexpected and unexpected and mysterious at the mother), couples' anger with their marriage, a child's illness that worsens, so a heroic flight of a single pilot (acute storm) is needed to bring the child a special serum, and finally when John is accepted as a junior partner . <br /> <br /> How many more cliché situations could writers include? Maybe my mother will soon die? There wasn't much comedy; the drama was at best weak; the dialogue was painful. Only the four main players had enough action. <br /> <br /> This was the time of the end of the great depression when the US came out of its long decline? during which many people experienced all the events in the film. <br /> <br /> So, Selznick had a good idea of ​​affirming American values ​​of family, relationships, heroism, perseverance and initiative from a good ol-home? ? all in the background of the average American family. Who better to use than Jimmy Stewart and Carol Lombard? <br /> <br /> It should be noted that the film appeared in early 1939; so was it planned in 1938? soon after the US began producing the coming World War II. So such a film was a great journalist to the public at that time, many of them soon joining England with war. Like many here, Hollywood and Washington formed a troubled union before, during and after the war. <br /> <br /> But I'm glad I saw it? as part of a hidden socio-political propaganda. But I have to see other Lombard movies to get more recognition from my class. <br /> <br /> As the other observer pointed out, look at it to say you've seen all of Stewart's movies; otherwise, don't worry.
