The man of Bogart's Face makes himself look at the nostalgia of the spectators in the late 1930s for the era of 40's films. It fails for several reasons. First of all, there is no Sacchi, while being reasonably similar to Bogart, and even if he sometimes succeeds and uses his motives, he is full of Bogart's charisma or ability to act. It's really obvious when Sacchi doesn't clearly mimic the scene of Bogart's movies. Secondly, the film does not have first-rate actors with whom Bogart was able to work. There's no Peter Lorre or Sydney Greenstreet in it. Of course, we are treated with performances by Victor Buaeno, Olivia Hussey and George Raft, but they are not just the same caliber (or they don't get enough screen time or are wrong). Third, all "modern" humor attempts fall. All the underwear jokes that have Marlowe almost * never * remove it from the fucking hat and ditch (though Bogartil would) etc. are not just funny and really pull this film. Fourth, I've never heard of a nicer topic, which is Mitchell's side. In the end, the false respect for the film is truly irritating to Bogart (and other classical actors). Bogart almost * ever * played a straight hero, in those cases he was a hero. He played tricky characters. This film makes Bogart a loser to be happy, moral. While this may be true for some movie characters, Bogart characters rarely fit into this account. Films that make people past the past think that it's all hacked, "a good boy wins bad guys and gets a girl with a low production value."
