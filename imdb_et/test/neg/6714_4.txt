"Alien" is a story of a foreign intrigue that focuses on Seagal as a deep cover with a package that everyone wants and is ready to kill. Flick is no longer involved with the usual activities that set Seagang's film card (fires, fighting by hand, pyrotechnics, stunts, etc.) and more of a story that is complicated, uninteresting, and full of meaningless filler. What kind of activity seems symbolic and free, while Seagal looks more and more like pork, crutches through this insipid, expressing meaninglessness and boredom without revealing the improvement of operational ability. Somewhere under "Glimmer Man" or "Fire Down", Seagal flicks nose diving and "The Foreigner" is just a continuation of this trend. Nothing here is worth watching, except for the toughest Seagal fans.
