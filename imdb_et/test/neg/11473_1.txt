I had heard that this movie was stylish and intriguing, but I found it just annoying. It has been a while since I've seen it (and hopefully I don't think all memories are wrong and I understand this movie unfairly), but my memory is that filmmakers tried to depict Leopold and Loeb as a victim of an anti-gay society and that it somehow caused your terrible crime. I do not fully agree with this view and I think it is unfair to both homosexuals and the actual victim Bobby Frank. I can't imagine why anyone would like to claim these two martyrs. I also thought L & Li was a bit more complicated than they really were - after all, they were teenagers who lived at home. The film places them in a fantasy world that seems like it should be Morrissey. <br /> <br /> I just read an interview with a filmmaker who referred to the anachronisms of the movie, such as the button-based phones designed to add Brechtia distance. They definitely do it, but I happened to be very unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Probably many people found this movie interesting, but I would have preferred a less "stylish" and more realistic study of homosexuality in the Leopold & Loeb case.
