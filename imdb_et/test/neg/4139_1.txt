Complete zero from four. One of the worst is Ajooba: terrible. In fact, more words come to mind: ridiculous, tertiary and terrible. This is one of Amitabh's worst films, which she decorates in a cheap leather jacket and equally cheap golden Zorro-style masks that appear to be wings on the sides. <br /> <br /> The film is placed in ancient Persian or Arabic and is typically irregular in Indian film. As stated above, K-Mart's leather jacket with velcro straps was not 400 years ago unless all my history teachers were wrong. <br /> <br /> Rishi also makes his own patented crossover film. Far from being funny, it's very embarrassing to look. What could be the son of the legendary Raj Kapoor to show the memory of his house in such a way? <br /> <br /> On the plus side, if you want a real laugh, go ahead and watch this movie. Dazzling contradictions in the plot and costumes are not suited to terrible dialogues and poor actions.
