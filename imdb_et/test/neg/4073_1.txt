I should have gone to see the movie after reading the review. I saw the whole movie fast and ended in 25 minutes. although it is a low budget movie that could have been made better. <br /> <br /> The movie starts over a thriller and after a few minutes it says you need to switch off immediately. And why was the film called "crash landing" when it had landed so badly in such a bad climate. <br /> <br /> Without any action, all the characters who just move or make children. <br /> <br /> And you should not forget to comment on the joker - the main attacker who would have been more comfortable than this movie was a full-time comedy.
