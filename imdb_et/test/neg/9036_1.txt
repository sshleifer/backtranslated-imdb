I love beach boys and their music. So, being a filmmaker, I thought the Beach Boys Movie sounded good. Well! I just turned off HDNET, the channel the movie played, because it was so bad. Someone mentioned above ... well, they should have at least looked at the monitors when they filmed. I don't know if someone else was trying to get off the brother because of a boy's face when he kissed his wife and then smoothed back with his hands. Never heard of the scene again! Action was terrible. The direction was terrible. Make-up was TERRIBLE !!! Maybe the worst make-up job I've ever seen. Brian Wilson's "fat" cheek looked like pl-ado. <br /> <br /> It's the first time I've ever commented on IMDb, and I know it's really not going to change ... but come on, what the hell manufacturers thought?!?! !
