So many fans, so little to show. I know, I know, these words find a big minority for me. Many people really liked goodwill. But seriously, please, make great movies, not even close, and put the guilt where it belongs into writing. <br /> <br /> Now, I know they won an oscar for it and the boy did they see good emotions on the screen. But the goodwill hunting is a post-school special, with lots of passions, and a slightly higher budget. <br /> <br /> What this movie shows is the shine of Harvey Weinstein and Miramax. Mr. Weinstein could take the manure, feed it to you and make you believe in your own bonus. And that's what the studio did with the movie. They struck a high stroke around that people believed and wanted to believe so much - that they saw the shine where nothing was. <br /> <br /> Now I know some people think this is a great movie, I don't think it's a terribly bad movie, I'd like to compare it more with movie movies and some great Made for TV movies ( although not HBO movies, HBO movies are unusually better than good will hunting would ever have been. itch for a while. And, of course, Miramax's public relations machine secured Ben and Matt's manuscript oscars ... but there are some people coming ... there are better movies in GWH.
