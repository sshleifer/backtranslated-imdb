Rabbit fever is one of those strange films. It is enjoyable for 90 minutes, requires a little viewer and offers so much, and on every terrestrial TV channel, even in a prime time slot, I think rabbit fever would be quite well received. This makes me wonder why it has been pushed into cinemas. <br /> <br /> The film is filmed with a television documentary and introduces us to 6 women with addictive relationships with Rabbit Vibrator. The film mainly focuses on researching the supposed addictive quality of famous sex aids. Narrative is 100% linguistic throughout the language. <br /> <br /> The story is strong, an introduction to some circular and pleasant characters, some enjoyable stories, peripheral characters, and situations that will become an interesting story and pleasing conclusions. Unfortunately, there is nothing that seems smart or new. <br /> <br /> Rabbit fever has some sharp moments, a couple of switches suggesting what writers are capable of, and all the credits given to them are not just 90-minute-long buttons and innuendo, I could watch it for my mother. But there's some laziness for some scenes that keep it back, those moments went to you if you wanted it to be terrible, and all you got was a sit-com doll. <br /> <br /> I smiled, left the theater with empathy, but I also missed the bitter mindset that had taken a 90-minute roll of television, light entertainment, and tried to put it on the cinema. I think Rabbit Fever will achieve some of what he intended, this is a peculiar theme, round lines, well-cast cast and a good deviation for 90 minutes. But there's nothing that can justify the extravagance of the movie center. On the contrary, some commercial breaks would have allowed the viewer to live a life that the rabbit fever seems to be deficient.
