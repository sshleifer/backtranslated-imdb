I think I've finally seen the worst movie ever made, and it hurts when I say it. Indie cinema, gay or otherwise big fan, I had great hopes. But several minutes of the film appeared on the sheriff and he voted for the worst actor of this or another century. His performance and the dialogue he was forced to perform caused me an unusual step to stop the DVD on my track. Hours later, when I was a little bold to play again, it wasn't better. <br /> <br /> Apart from the sheriff and his drawing-racist deputy, the film is attractive to whom I felt real compassion because they had such an unhappy script. The idea of ​​the film is good - using the "New South" gays men were used in the same way in black men in the old south, leaving "strange fruits" hanging from the tree. <br /> <br /> With the accomplished writer and director, we could be a movie. Instead, we get a fake detective, homosexuality loyalty, and a cliché with one good white man trying to save the day. <br /> <br /> I have no doubt that racism is still booming. Currently, the FBI White School bus driver is studying on the back of Louisana, who forced the black children to go on the bus ride. But this city is a comic, and it's hard to believe anything you see or hear. <br /> <br /> Here are some subpages in a weak attempt to make the main owner more three-dimensional, but most of them have failed. <br /> <br /> True masochistic DVDs have some deleted scenes that leave you in the cover. <br /> <br /> It's probably the first movie that makes me believe that the writer / director must pass a test and license before making a movie. Although I would expect to see that many of the majority members are under better films, I would have something else from this director.
