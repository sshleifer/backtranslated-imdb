I was very interested in watching this movie despite the article I read about the director of Tattler Magazine. I don't understand movies by what a director may or may not have done. This debut feature was very difficult to see. I found that shared screens have drawn attention to the drama of the movie, some supportive characters gave bad performances, and the movie has been a copy of many others. There was really nothing fresh about it
