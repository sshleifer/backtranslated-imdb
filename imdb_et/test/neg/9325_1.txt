Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The "start" wasn't the biggest, but better than that. This is not a good way to take the original movie. It's just terrible! The CGI hyenas were as fake as in both movies! Why not use real animals? I liked the old Sinbad movies the better. I was royally disappointed! The only good thing I can say about the waste of this movie is cinematography and clothes that really hit this era. I understand why this movie was "the beginning". This is, in my opinion, just as bad. where does the money from such waste come from? Give me a multi-million dollar budget and I'll show you how to do it!
