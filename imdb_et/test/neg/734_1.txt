Now and again, the film comes up purely randomly, which makes you question your peace of mind. We graduated from the school with a new novel, "Norther's Monastery," and we decided to refresh our memory of this incredible humorous garbage by adapting the BBC. <br /> <br /> The funny thing about Norther's monastery is that it actually kills you. The film is not like a book, for example, it seems that fine evil characters have become transparent stereotypes. John Thorpe sees the bodice in acid, Isabella plays the role of a bitch. The main character Catherine is the most embarrassing and nervous actor on the divine ground (she looks like a coffee addict, her eyes are like basketball), while Mr Tilney looks and acts like a retired porn stunt double. The plot goes completely off the rails in certain parts of the film, I don't know what the devil director was, if not at all, a seven-year-old black boy whom we've never met before in the monastery and will run in front of him. Yeah, that's right, cart. Such nonsense is sometimes interrupted by the "fantasies" of Catherines, where he is transported by the ogre of the cathedral. <br /> <br /> The Northanger Monastery is basically a visual euthanasia, so if you want to kill your boss or something that the BBC has basically discovered a new way to kill. Northanger is hardly a ridiculously bad film. Don't look at it unless you are in a cushioned cell.
