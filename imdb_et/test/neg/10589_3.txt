It's a bad attempt to turn the old "minus turn good" yarn we've seen so many times before. It reminded me of the American series "Players", though not nearly as good. Omar Epps is absolutely incredible as a bunch of hard guys like Ribisi, who is trying to be a funny guy to get lost along the way. The performance of the Danes was decent and this performance shows why he was cast in Terminator 4. <br /> <br /> The MOD team is a film between a gray area and a serious thriller and comedy. Sometimes it takes it seriously, but at other times it tries to be humorous, but it can't fail. The film has a semi-finished feeling - as if it was stretched to the 90-minute mark. <br /> <br /> You are disappointed.
