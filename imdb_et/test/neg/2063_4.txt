There are those who seize it is not an opera, but then they won't take the CABARET movie, which wasn't the original show. All musical / opera films are and must be "adjustments" or they don't work. CABARET took more liberties with original publications than PORGY AND BESS, but still retained its original integrity when it was recycled and evaluated for artistic success. The same goes for PORGY AND BESS - it turned the opera into a libretto as the audience's celebrities loved musicals, but stayed away from some of the filmed operas. Preminger would have had an economic suicide to produce an opera movie - it would have lost the fortune of Goldwyn Studios. <br /> <br /> That means it's a good adaptation. The actor is great, Andre Previn's Oscar winning score is great, as is the choral song, and the individual vocal achievements are incredible. Robert McFerrin (popular musician's father Bobby McFerrin) is called Porgy and Adele Addison, called Bess. Sammy Davis Jr. He sang his songs in the movie, but his recording contract did not allow his voice to be heard in the soundtrack album, so Cab Calloway recorded that number (remarkably) for that release. Brock Peters's bass / baritone is extraordinary and Pearl Bailey is his unique. Diahann Carroll, though, has a small role in the dime singer Clara, which demanded a high soprano so that the old trusted Marni Nixon duplicated her song. <br /> <br /> Gershwin Manor hates the film and refuses musical rights, although dramatic rights are in the public domain. This kind of hatred set the release of CAROUSEL's video for almost fifteen years (although in this case, it was just dramatic rights in litigation) and currently prevents both PORGY AND BESS and ANNIE GUN from being released from the video. <br /> <br /> All of the productions featuring movie versions have the last two videos. Only a message sent to NY Gershwin Manor can release the reserve.
