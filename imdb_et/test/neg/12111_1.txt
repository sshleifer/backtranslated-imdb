This thing, led by the French feeling of Patrick Sebastien, is the worst thing that all the turkeys you have seen. Forget Independence Day, Kazama, Patriot, etc. You get the picture, it's mines. Sebastien is France's fame in France (if you need the same, say he's Jerry Springer with I.Q), it's his first film, we hope it's the last one. I hope that Troma or someone else will share it in the countries of the film so that you don't get the French smell out there. Let's cut it short, it's a masterpiece of S ** t.
