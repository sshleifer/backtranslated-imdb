It's just one of those movies that doesn't justify much of what happens. These people are on track: a young girl wants to take pictures of animals. Piranhas do not really exist, but I think the psychotic hunter is a real piranha. Anyway, there are lots of animals and there are plenty of rides. There's a significant anti-gun talk, but we all know where it goes. After all, there are many activities and rape that anyone has to pay for, and they do it. It would have been nice to have a few pirans to do this. There were many monkeys. If you move fast on unsuccessful parts, you will have a tight five minutes.
