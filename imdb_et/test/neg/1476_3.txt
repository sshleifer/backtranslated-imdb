The concept of this film is unique, but its execution is less than special. When I reached the cinema and realized that there were only about 15 people at the crowd, I thought I made a mistake. But the real mistake was made in the shocking detail when the movie was over and I knew I had wasted my life for two hours. <br /> <br /> Without an old man's cruel recordings and a stupidly funny friend, this movie would have rated 1 out of ten. <br /> <br /> This movie is special, special, because it is probably the worst film that is usually released to the public. <br /> <br /> Also, would you say you could call it a movie or just an advertising likely to be lean on Northwestern. <br /> <br /> If you think of watching this movie on a plot, humor, filming, then don't. On the other hand, if you want to experience both ends of the film production spectrum, just take a book or a small game or just a new news.
