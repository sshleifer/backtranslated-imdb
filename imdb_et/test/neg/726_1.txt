I decided to look at this example and go, but I found it to be boring, and more importantly, boring ..... Empty. <br /> <br /> There are too many sarcasm and all the characters are boring. there is too much talk and character Lorelai ... just talks and on and on .... Another look seemed to stifle the characters, the catcher didn't work and all the love and romance are just ruins that are already a mess ... I can't believe this exhibition is over the pilot .... It seems to be an exhibition that is forcing "Listen to your parents' line .... There's no real drama" .... <br /> <br /> Peaks be a pilot ... and a pilot alone ...
