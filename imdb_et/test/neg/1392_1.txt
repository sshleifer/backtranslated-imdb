What is the day-to-day that the minority comedians feel their okay that they are devastating and waiting for their minority? <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia is not George Lopez. There is a difference. When I look at comedian Carlos Mencia, I think he hates his people. And more than that, I think he was forced to design his exhibition as a version of his exhibition "Hispanic / Latino / Spanish" by Dave Chappelle. What a terrible mistake. (Note to Mencia: Do not make a "Block Party" movie. As much as I would like to see the reunion of Santana, Tierra, El Chicano, Christina Agullaria, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira and "Xica da Silva" in one stage, not.) <br /> < br /> Carlos Mencia likes to use the word "beaners" as much as Dave Chappelle liked the word "n". Nor is it funny or both acceptable, even if it comes from "your people". Carols Mencia also wants to say, "If you're offended, it's too bad." It is not an insult, it is protection because of what is said and asked to be accepted. <br /> <br /> Carols Mencia goes further - he ignores everything he expects comedy. It's not comedy, it's not funny. There is a flair for you to look at others and laugh at comedy and not laugh at enforcing stereotypes that other races initially believed. <br /> <br /> Mencia's mind needs polishing because Carlos Mencia needs polishing. Find out what is funny and not what makes more bias and then - do it. So far, the exhibition, Mencia's mind, pass.
