First, let me stress that I am not a big fan of political correctness. In fact, I like satire or dark humor, even if it makes minority jokes. The reason Im quite sure that this racist work is not worth it is that it does not make fun of minorities to show their living conditions, their social situation or their treatment in society. In addition, he uses xenophobic feelings and reservations for every stupid stereotype and prejudice. It's really a pity, but no surprise that other comments didn't get that point because we all had a cheap laugh. Congratulations.
