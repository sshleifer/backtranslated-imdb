I never read this book. Now I don't want to. I had no idea what the movie was when I walked to the theater. I still don't know what point he was supposed to overcome, but I know two hours of my life was wasted. Two valuable hours I never get back. <br /> <br /> The story was so predictable, ridiculous. Werewolves ... or something ... a very Roman and Juliet plot. I predicted the movie in five minutes. And I was right. <br /> <br /> Operation is not terrible. The only two cool characters of the movie were the British cousin and the Rambo-graphic novel. Other characters are too ... dialogue is very sharp and predictable. <br /> <br /> The absolute part of the movie is the change between "people" and "wolves". If you want something like Van Helsings, you're really upset. Imagine a ballerina, a bright light, then a wolf. Yeah ... it's about that. <br /> <br /> Just avoid this movie. Period. Especially when you read the book because you just want to hit the babies.
