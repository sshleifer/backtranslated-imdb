It should be the story of a person named Wirey Spindle from ages 8 to 36 spoken by narrative at every age of his life. For example, if he is eight, this is an eight-year-old voice that makes a story; if he is younger, it is what makes the story, etc. It's just an interesting thing about this movie. Every actor playing with Wirey seems to have a separate character. Not only do they see similar, their life experiences don't seem to fit. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as a bad cold.
