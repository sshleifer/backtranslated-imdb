As a fan of this series, what did I think about how bad a movie can be? Well, I got my answer. Some movies should never be done. Why name it in the series if the only similarity is that there are three main characters. The Pete character in the series was not a little baby in the movie. The only good thing about this movie, besides music, is that Clare Danes is beautiful that it was short. What's with this dance picture? The only reason I didn't go out of this movie was that it was so bad that it was funny. Maybe this was the plan! It's really bad when a cheap 60's TV show is better than a 90's $ 20 million movie. El Mariachi only costs $ 7,000 and is a much better film. Don't even waste your money on a tape, it's not even worth renting.
