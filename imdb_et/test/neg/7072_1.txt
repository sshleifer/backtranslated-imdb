OK, fans, it's on DVD. But the only reason to watch it is 1) say you did (because of your fame) or 2) if you're a hardcore Bill Paxton fan. I'm not a hardcore BP fan, but it was fun to watch and it was the only thing that kept me from boredom. It is a shame because it could have been a good movie with some scripting work and if it was done by someone with some intelligence (and somebody led cast by completely twilight and talented Judd Nelson). Of course it's gross, but it's BAD and not good. If you are still interested in reading all the comments about how this film is abnormally contradictory and insecure, take your preference and see some good-looking dystopic slag instead. Recall all the films by John Water, David Lynch, Peter Jackson's "Braindead", Henenlotter's "Basket Case", etc. There's a lot better.
