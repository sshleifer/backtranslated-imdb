Wow ... as a big fan of Larry McMurtry's Western story and especially the Lonesome Dove series, I was s-o-o-o-o waiting for Comanche Moon. What a huge drop. Maybe my expectations were too high because Lonesome Dove's top level was ... story, characters, cinematography, music ... it all worked. <br /> <br /> Comanche Moon is coming in comparison as a bad Saturday night live skit. The characters are completely colored, the dialogue is slippery and the plot is pointless all over the place. The actors seem to read TelePrompTers. I couldn't associate any character, good boys, bad guys, not even random characters. David Midthunder's performance is particularly different. It seemed to be out of the results of the eighth grade high school. Sorry, I would like to find something positive about Comanche Moon, but I just can't do that. There's nothing.
