Eugene O'Neilli recognizes some of America's leading playwright, but things like The Iceman Comet, Long Day's Into Night, Emperor Jones. Strange Interlude was an experiment he created, where the characters in the performance looked aside from the audience and say what they really think and then continue the conversation. It was a nine-hour production with the Broadway South Break, so you can safely assume there's a lot of sacrifice here. <br /> <br /> Thoughts are used for all characters on the screen. This is probably the most appropriate method for the screen. Sir Laurence Olivier did this very well in the Hamlet version. But Bill Shakespeare gave Olivier a much better story when O'Neill gave his players in this case. <br /> <br /> Players like Clark Gable, Norma Shearer, Ralph Morgan, May Robson, etc. are much more animated with most of their movies than Strange Interlude. The story goes on for 20 years. Norma Shearer is a young woman whose goal is to die in World War I. He starts playing quite a bit, although this part is not shown in this version. He introduces Alexander Kirkland and his friend Clark Gable. He is also a multi-year smoker, friend of Ralph Morgan, his father Henry B. Walthall. <br /> <br /> He marries Kirkland, but then his mother May Robson warns that the crazy gals in this family will quote another literature. Because Kirkland wants children and Shearer and Robson think that the Kirkland train slips along the track, if he can't, Gable is recruited. Of course you will see all the complications that this can cause, and O'Neill will investigate all of them. <br /> <br /> Gable is so daunting in O'Neill's production, but she was MGM and did what they told her. Shearer does what he can to raise a very clumsy story, but he seems to be defeated at first. The best Robson in the film is making a real bite in his dialogue. <br /> <br /> A strange interlude ran at 4228 on Broadway in 1928-1929 and celebrated Glenn Anders and Lynn Fontanne in Gable and Shearer. Perhaps no one could actually record the movie, because two years earlier Groucho Marx would hit his animal crackers. After seeing what he did, I don't think the film is going too seriously to the public. <br /> <br /> And since it's not the best of O'Neill, I didn't get it either.
