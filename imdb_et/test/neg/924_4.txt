When they announced this movie to TNT, I was excited. Travesty Donald Westlake's "Enough" was one of my favorite music of all time. After I watched it, I wasn't all excited. Recently I had the opportunity to watch this aunt for a second time and again I was disappointed (she didn't like her, and she had never read a book). In this film, they managed to hold the book's magic and make it dull. A big part of the problem was William H. Macy. I like to punish her for other movies, but she played (Terry / Carey) Thorpe as a puzzling, incompetent yutz. In the book, Thorpe takes a lot of valium to his nerves, but he is still gathered almost always as part of the fun. SPOILERS follow: They also left out a large part of the story (except for a 2-second look at the embassy), where Thorpe did not solve the police for 1, but 4 kills. This is important not only because it is funny, but because it helps to establish a relationship between Fred and Thorpe. In the film, Fred's betrayal is ultimately not as powerful as he doesn't seem so close. They become pretty good friends of the book, especially on Fred's side, making it even more ironic that he is the one who organizes the fall of Thorpe. Fred also suffered a little bit of pain, I love Adam Arkin, but he was not cheerful, happy that he was a laborious detective in life, the characteristic traits that Fred has, which makes it obviously inaccurate to confuse and thus more shocking. Patricia and Edgarson were close to the book and James Cromwell was great, despite Martin Balsam. The bored cottage scene added to every movie was much less interesting than the police, who found Edgarson's body after Thorpe was sent to Seattle and accused him of dying on the mobile. The set was okay, although it was mostly rewritten, and it would have been nice to see her death because she got a little annoying. I don't like the movies being changed to change books, I know they are necessary because of their length and difficulty, but it would have been nice if some of the changes in this film had been funny or funny.
