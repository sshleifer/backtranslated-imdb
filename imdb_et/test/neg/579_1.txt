I'm a big fan of Robert Taylor and I've been trying to find all of his films. That's one I didn't have, but I looked at it recently in Fox Movie Channel and was very disappointed. I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but acting as bad as the script. Victor McLaglen was even bad and Brian DonLevy was almost unknown. Given the relationship between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry between the two was. But the film's premise was so ridiculous: that the US president would order the Navy Union to leave the service secret to hunt for bank robbers, and only inform the president that it had done something of a different value to the film. The death scenes were completely immobile. The only thing worse than Taylor's behavior was Stanwyck's song. He later got to the right of the ball of fire.
