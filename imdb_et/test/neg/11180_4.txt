There are so few movies where the title just tells you everything you need to know about the movie. Such a film I was a communist FBI. For example, I would be married to a monster outdoors. <br /> <br /> For this movie, is it really interesting how in the name of the sky this name was named Oscar in the documentary category? It's not a documentary in any sense, it's not even in this hybrid document category. It is just a fairly exploitative film about FBI's secret representative, Matt Cvetic, who invaded the Communist Party in Pittsburgh and actively tried to take over the Steelworker for the Communists of the Union and reported these activities to his handlers in the FBI. <br /> <br /> The documentary of this work may have been interesting, but what we had was a film suitable for the paranoid period. I found it interesting that when Cvetic finally broke his cover, it was a non-American action committee, not a trial of the Communist Party leaders in New York. The film had a moment when Communist Prime Minister James Millican told his followers that they would spread the word that the House Un American Action Committee consisted of the right yahoos who wanted to get their names in front of the camera. What could have given her that idea? Anyway, just connect the points and undoubtedly the word they came from J. Edgar Hoover, trying to give HUAC any confidence by making an effective secret rather than a real trial there. A little thing called cross-examination. Warner Brothers, who made me a Communist FBI, later made Big Jim McLain, who played John Wayne on a HUAC investigator in Hawaii. HUAC acknowledged that Honolulu PD worked to break the communist spy ring among docks. But at least on John Wayne's film, no one said it was a documentary. <br /> <br /> Frank Lovejoy is in the title as Cvetic and his FBI handlers are Richard Webb and Philip Carey. Dorothy Hart plays a schoolteacher in Pittsburgh who says there are 30 or so young people in this school system, including Ron Hagerthy, son of Lovejoy. He has transformed the heart of the communists, and Lovejoy must save him from the planets destined for his superiors. Ironically, Hart left the films and went to work in all places, the United Nations, as we know, is often accused of being a communist nest in the United States. <br /> <br /> Over half a century later, we really have very little objective work on film or print on the US Communist Party. In fact, they were very active in the movement of labor. The actual heroes in their halt were the work organizations like Walter Reuther at UAW or David Dubinsky at ILGWU. But because they were left-wing people, they have no right to be a suitable propaganda material. <br /> <br /> In any case, I was a Communist FBI, a real-life exploitative work character and testimony of their paranoid times.
