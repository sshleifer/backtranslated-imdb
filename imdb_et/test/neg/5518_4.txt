This movie can't really be called "well" when it is agreed on recycled film material, music and ideas. But for me, when I looked at it as a teenager, it was quite fun. (I didn't know that BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS had been in the past.) In hindsight, she got something nostalgic about the early eighties and the special effects of that time. The old-fashioned look of this trashy and its naivety offer some appeal. To enjoy this movie, I recommend focusing on father's relationship between Vince Edwards and David Mendenhall characters. In addition, I liked the idea that a number of bunches discover their heroic qualities after inadvertently responding to the challenge of caring for the child.
