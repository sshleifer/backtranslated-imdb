I wish I could find some good things to say about this animated stage (but not really a sequel) to "Atlantis: the lost empire", but that would be a very short comment. The magic that the first one was not found anywhere is the animation pretty poor, the characters themselves are not very well drawn. The backgrounds and the foreground are not good either. is boring and doesn't make much sense. I swear that even those symbols, as they were boring, were somewhere else. Do you say that the voice participants were bored and wanted to be elsewhere, at least this is the impression that many of the same participant will return for this shameful effort, but inseparable from the first performance part was by Michael J.Fox as the main hero, Milo Thatch.i get a clear impression that this movie was just thrown to take advantage of the first success, including tons of thought or care. But at least Cree Summer returns to "Kida" voice. This is probably the only good thing in this movie, and even he doesn't seem to be completely in his heart. you could not blame anyone for casting, because they didn't give everything, considering what they had to work with. Or rather not working. It is a direct video film (and I use the term loosely) that should have gone straight to the nearest landfill. Station, shame Disney.consumers deserve much better than this. This one gets 0/10 and well deserved one, that.pu
