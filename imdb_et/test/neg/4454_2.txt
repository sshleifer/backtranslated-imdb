Many of Alistair MacLean's books have made this big screen. Some of them (Navarone weapons, fear is the key where Eagles Dare) are translated quite well; some (Breakheart Pass, Ice Station Zebra, The Secret Ways) have been enough; some (death river, carousel, road to dust death) have been pretty rotten. Caravan to Vaccares is another movie based on one of MacLean's most popular bestsellers, but unfortunately it's another one that deserves to be added to the "rotten" list. Caravan To Vaccares has been in uncomfortable situations and in exciting situations, but with absolute thriller and entertainment. Its only semi-redeeming feature is: a) it has been filmed in very attractive Provence places and: b) Charlotte Rampling sees the female as the main woman in a totally striking (completely naked scene). <br /> <br /> Frustrated American stripe Neil Bowman (David Birney) is determined to travel through France when he meets British photographer Lila (Charlotte Rampling). They decide to go with each other and, during their trips, are familiar with the mysterious nobleman Duc De Croyter (Michel Lonsdale). Duc persuades a couple to assist him in defending and sending the Hungarian scientist Zuger (Michael Bryant), who is being searched by various parties in the shadows because he is in his head. The secret of Bowman and Lila is that Zuger has discovered a secret formula for the use of solar energy as cheap, economical. Hungary desperately needs its formula in New York, but hired weapons have put him on the track to grab him? probably so that he can be taken back to some ruthless criminal master and tortured to reveal his invaluable secret that they can then sell to the highest bidder. Bowman and Lila find themselves and their frightened escape from their deadly opponents in the French countryside. <br /> <br /> The film looks terribly cheap and amateur, almost like a low-budget independent film made by a non-professional cast and team. At the same time, a fair amount of money was thrown at the film and everybody involved in the career has done a lot better work. It must therefore be assumed that the film is bad simply because it is written, behaved and clearly directed towards lack of care and interest. Stimulation is lethal and the plot points become so laborious that the viewer has to pay too much effort to keep up with this story. Birney's play is endless and Rampling only creates confusion about her naked scenes? The character himself is an absolute symbol and the actor sees it as dull. For those who can stick with the film, there is an unusual scene with some deadly rodeo clowns and fierce bull (!), Which is not very exciting or well executed, but is at least different from the norm. The Vaccares caravan is a very disappointing film on most sides, and once again, the productive author's strong novel has suffered from the transition to its screen.
