Director / Screenwriter Allan Burns seems to have had two different scripts before this little break: comedy about infidelity and melodrama about loss and sabotage. This results in an amazingly failed film. Christine Lahti plays crass, a cynical TV news reporter who makes friends with her friends, aerobics teacher Mary Tyler Moore, and will soon be having dinner with Moore and her family - only Mary's husband (Ted Danson) has a loose secret! Burns has a strange, stop-and-start rhythm for his dialogue that is neither realistic nor effective (just more and more annoying because he never said anything important). Railway-thin Moore, who looks alarmingly weak in his leotard, is a radiant smile, but does not convince Danson's husband and Danson of a disappointed, ungrateful role (he's just for the frame). The film attempts to cover all the basics of a classical redundant case (the role of a woman in the workplace, TV news, cheating a family member, a working woman and a mother who wants more, a woman's need for female friends, etc.), but these ideas are not important because Burns is only looking these issues. As a writer, he is surprisingly free from punchlines, but there is no goal, and heavy drawing just bounces. * 1/2 from ****
