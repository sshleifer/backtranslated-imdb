I'm giving six to the show because the show was actually Damon Wayans' platform, because the Cosby Show was for Bill Cosby, it dealt with a lot of questions about humor and felt that it was actually adjusted to laugh, not to let jokes. <br /> <br /> Michael Kyle An interesting patriarch and a smart person. He is in PHENOMENAL, but at the show he was for wisecrack and although I loved it, I felt that laughter was more important than believable. <br /> <br /> Jay Kyle, which I have loved for House Party and enjoyed her at Dazes and Martinis, was a great role for her and she made a great choice for this sitcom to celebrate together. I also think that Jay and Michael were more equal in the show, but Jay was more of a woman who fed her mad spouses, and went with her unusual discipline, because she could feel it worked <br /> <br /> Just stupid, his character should have been well developed and, although he has his grand moments, we will return to stupidity as he did not learn anything about me nuts !!!!!!!! Not to mention that most of the situations (the visions I've seen) seem to be surrounded by him. <br /> <br /> Clair Attractive sister, who dated a Christian, found her boy's character more interesting than she was (She would be better off, writers should have done more to show their intelligence, but that's not enough stereotyped) < br /> <br /> Kady Lovable and the youngest daughter. I think writers created their character the most at exhibitions by parents and Franklin. <br /> <br /> Franklin I LOVE this character and I think they got it from Smart Guy (T.J. Mowry), which lasted only one season. They did a great job of casting this small gene (efforts would have been made if Jr had been smart but would also show down) <br /> <br /> All in all, this sitcom is a great thing and its respect for the Cosby Show is well done, I love this example and wanted it to stay longer. I can't wait to see the series finals
