recently I went to a free soap girl where filmmakers were present. before the movie they would shoot, laughing, taking pictures. I was glad to see them dressed in real life and couldn't wait to see the movie on the big screen. <br /> <br /> During the movie, the audience stopped laughing. then it was clear to me that they did not laugh with the picture, but in the picture. it is a purely class B movie with no logic. throw nudity, blood and lie! You have a movie! <br /> <br /> After the movie I went to the cinema filmmakers and asked them why they wanted to make this movie. they all worked as seriously as they were serious filmmakers. they all told me something else: make a controversial movie, a funny movie, an uplifting film, a socially responsible movie. everyone mentioned something else. it was clear to me that no filmmaker knew what kind of film they were doing, and they were now trying to get their money back by disclosing it in any way that people would see. <br /> <br /> Let me warn you: don't buy a leap! if you have nothing else to do, the film student's time may be worth exploring how to make a movie. Otherwise, you will have a better life for two hours in your life.
