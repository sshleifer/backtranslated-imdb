Korine established herself as a talented and impressive image maker. Mister Lonely's advertising posters contain the most impressive compositions of the film (although there is one more thing I can see from the promo material: a blue-blunt nun that bullies with the dog, surrounded by a green forest and a rain forest). Pictures of this movie, with Michael Jackson's appearance (Diego Luna), riding a small motorcycle around the ring, are stunningly delightful and beautiful: Roy's Orbison's "Mister Lonely" plays on the soundtrack and the pictures open slowly. There's also a funny and terrible queue where the same character dances, without music (although the radio sits like a quiet dog next to him) in the middle of Paris Street; The chorus breaks in sound effects and jumps that create a sense of meaninglessness and a liberated release in a character's dance routine. <br /> <br /> The first tier of nuns is also strange; Father Umbrillo (Werner Herzog) is an autocratic priest who travels with a few nuns and drops food to nearby impoverished areas. In both light and influential scenes, Herzog must stubbornly deal with an enthusiastic local who wants to travel by plane to see his wife in San Francisco. When the exchange evolves, Herzog pulls the confession out of the man: he has sinned and his frequent infidelity is the first reason his wife left. This short and lovely scene, which has a special weight in learning from its improvised origins, is a sinner played by a non-actress who was in Korine and during her composition. were filming - and his adulterous ways gave him a permanent, overwhelming guilt in real life. <br /> <br /> From now on the film has hit and lost; moments that are intrinsically interesting, adding a frivolous, confusing narrative. When Gummo and Julien Donkey-Boy retain their aesthetic and emotional weight through uniform structural frameworks, Mister Lonely feels like a victim of the editorial room's mercilessness. A couple of scenes were cut from the film that would otherwise have painted more perfect characters from certain characters due to consistency errors in costume - this is undoubtedly due to the absence of a firing script and the tendency of Korine's improvisation. Especially one deleted scene - where "Charlie Chaplin" (Denis Lavant) and "Madonna" (Melita Morgan) are having sex - would have added much more emotional conflict to the later scene (I don't violate it, but there are all feelings about heat or party, and as it is, only half succeed). <br /> <br /> The two directions of the narrative, which are not literally connected, are the best of two completely different stories with the same allegorical meaning; one compliments the other and vice versa. (This has something to do with the conflict between his ambitions and the current situation.) But Herzog's scenes aren't enough to deserve their place in the film, and so the link between the two allegorally connected yarns is inevitably tense - and engagement is annoying. <br /> <br /> This is an ambitious step forward from Julien Donkey-Boy, who often suffers, at least in the direct segment, from too many signs of running time, a mistake that would have been worse than the big stars all played (like originally planned). <br /> <br /> Sounds of the independent beauty of many images and real, real-life moments in the soundtrack, it seems to fit much more in art installation or photo exhibition. Because of the nature of mime research and personalization, it would not lose any power - indeed, it would be more impressive for me. The loneliness associated with iconic performativity (such as icons and those who want to be similar) is well captured in pictures such as where Marilyn Monroe (proud Samantha Morton) seduces the camera with seven years of itching in the middle of the forest or "Sammy Davis, Jr. . (Jason Pennycooke) lives back after his dance lessons with his camera, overlooking an incredible, calm lake. <br /> <br /> As of now, such moments and all those occasionally selected Michael Jackson songs climbing across the scene are married to one another in the narrative of the film, which is far less influential than it should be. <br /> <br /> (For those who see it, I lost all faith in the egg singing scene You know what scene I mean, because it looks like a painful thumb, like a crooked experiment for a new movie language for which Korine is previously received.)
