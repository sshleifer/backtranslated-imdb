For the first time in June 2000, I saw a poster on the street in Helsinki Street. Attention was given to this proud proclamation that made all readers aware that although the film was French, it was "banned in France". Upon returning to New York City, I discovered that one of the cinemas in the "House of Art" has screened the film, and so (together with my Finnish groom) decided to see what all the noise was. Boy, are we ever. <br /> <br /> Read here about the comments and reviews I knew the film was violent and sexual. Not necessarily any of these two conditions came to pass, I went openly to see what disturbed our Gallic cousin's feelings. Probably, as anyone who reads it, there is a story of two women who start crime and murder in France (the movie has English subtitles). However, the similarity between "Thelma and Louise" is similar; Gender is unusually graphic (and abundant in supply), as is violence (plurality of deaths and many blasting blood and other organic substances). <br /> <br /> At the Intellectual Level It may be that the nature of the movie is the relationship between sex and violence (which is apparent from the only sex that these women know: one is a prostitute of a small time and the other has earned money from time to time for pornographic films if they have the upper hand in their sexual situations during crime and murder, they will only react to the same violence and brutality they know and understand, not only the horrible men who are interested in creepy sex (of which there are); also innocent passers-by, such as a woman at ATM. violent spasm. crude and crude and equally unpleasant. From one point of view, the life of the French subclasses is considered and it is rather grim; The travel book for France is definitely not - maybe that's why the French language was forbidden. <br /> <br />
