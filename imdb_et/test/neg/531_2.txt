Cybrog 2: Glass Shadow in Elias Kotea as Colton Hicks (Rhymes with a Beat!) Karate Instructor, who helps to escape money (Jolie) from Pinwheel, his creators who want to explode him and destroy the rival. Billy Drago and Karen Shepherd are on their way to crowd the duo, while Jack Palance is on the way to give the duo the guidance. One of the things that is quite shocking about the Cyborg franchise is how the series has managed to have quite a lot of fruitful and amazing actors. The original was Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dayle Haddon (don't know him? Well, he was 70's pornos), with Jack Palance, Elias Koteas, Billy Drago and Angelina Jolie. The third is William Katt, Zach Galligan and Malcom McDowell. (Okay, Cyborg 3's cast isn't so impressive.) I've never seen Cyborg 3, but I saw it on a Sci-Fi channel and must admit that I wasn't impressed. In fact, the fact that Cyborg 2 is often a beautiful movie, is a great style, and the visual detail makes it easy for the eye. But Cyborg 1 was in the same way, indeed, the movie was directed to a number of styles, slow motion and music that made it all easy for the eye. Unfortunately, as in the first, it does not have any new ideas or something similar to a plot or texture. Most of the ideas are taken from Blade Runner and Max Headroom, so the film doesn't have much to offer for various reasons. Another aspect is terrible action. Karen Shepherd and Billy Drago are absolutely terrible and Angelina Jolie is not much better. Elias Koteas and Jack Palance come out fine, but seriously Palance plays a cyber soldier and Kotate is a karate instructor. I think the positive side cannot blame Michael Schroeder for not being ambitious in casting. Still the movie is boring and me for fifteen minutes for a lost interest. Why did they associate it with Cyborg? It has nothing to do with the predecessor that it can be worse than. <br /> <br /> * 4 (bad)
