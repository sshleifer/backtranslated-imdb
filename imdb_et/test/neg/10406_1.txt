And of course I didn't see it! <br /> <br /> But while looking and seeing that Doug Masters has come back from the dead, I know now to avoid it like a plague! I hate Hollywood, manufacturers, writers, directors, or all of the above, that the audience is stupid that they are not trying to make mistakes. Supposedly dead Doug masters who are returning are a big giant, don't you say? > <br /> Did Jason Gedrick really disagree? Well, I do not want to say this, but even if he took this role again, he would have had the same continuity error. I bet (if he really turned down), he must be incredible, seeing that his character died in another movie. , but I'm not going to rent it or buy a DVD!
