I do not believe that mistakes in this turkey militarily and strategically can be beaten. All this confusion was made by cheap and made soldiers really stupid. Examples: Initially, a 2-star general is given strategic advice by a lieutenant and will undoubtedly accept it. The map used by the city shows the positions of the enemy, but they probably have only one narrow valley used to advance the battalion (although the map showed another ten). The rear protective layer replaces the position that the enemy has clearly seen and opened. They laugh at their heroes from the ground, but this good fire makes little difference. One enemy tank is progressing to the end (called the armored unit at the beginning), which is continued by a single infantry point (!), Who moves very slowly without covering the area, then abandons the tank if it needs to continue to save it. - The most strange scene. The soldiers cover the cave. There is ice and deep snow around them, but in the cave there is no deep gap in the entrance, through which they all repeat - their feet stay just a few minutes before freezing. Later, the survivors were disgracefully slow to return to their unit through the high river. Remember that it is a deep winter and the land is frozen. Yes, right! <br /> <br /> And on and on. They scream the orders in the higher areas, they put the mines close to their position and warn each other that they would not hold them (!) At first, the credit is given to some soldiers who have been awarded the Congress Prize. Was he blind or did Director Fuller just ignore it? One of them bounces with his wounded leg with a bayonet and finally pulls out a piece of shrapnel without being twisted or exhausted. He says he should qualify him as a surgeon. It was funny now.
