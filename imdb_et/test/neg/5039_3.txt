Until now, Malcolm McLaren says little to anyone to believe that Sex Pistols was his idea and that the band members were his dolls to make money for him. It has a good reason that he is a liar. <br /> <br /> Here are some real facts. , not the other way around. <br /> <br /> * Guns were the right organic band, not created by McLaren or anyone else. Jones and Cook were childhood friends. Rotten and Vicious went back a long time. This has caused Pistol's unfair criticism over the years, as they have been compared to produced boys' bands. <br /> <br /> * The band and anyone else wrote them, saved, played, created an ad and gave interviews. <br /> <br /> * McLaren didn't initiate Bill Grundy's case. The pistols only appeared on the program because the queen was pulled out. According to the band, McLaren was in the back when the arrests were ready. <br /> <br /> * Johnny Rotten walked out of the band. He wasn't broken. <br /> <br /> * John Lydon (Rotten) was actually able to blame him outside of the Sex Pistols in the 1980s for control and considerable money. Some of the evidence used by Lydon's lawyers came from McLaren's "The Great Rock & Roll Swindle". This suggests that McLaren is not too bright despite his actions. <br /> <br /> * McLaren is proud of the band's money. Had he been competent, he could have done much more. He doesn't seem to have organized anyone properly either. <br /> <br /> * McLaren's claim at the beginning of the movie that he invented punk rock can be banned for about ten seconds. The pistols were not the first punk band, but the highest profile. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible movie. The only part worth seeing is the band's original film, which was later used much better by The Filth And The Fury.
