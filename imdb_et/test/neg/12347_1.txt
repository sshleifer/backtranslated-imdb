Friend and I went to watch this movie. We have opposite opinions about Fujimori, but after watching the movie, we agree with the following: The easiest way to get inaccurate documentaries is to do it from a foreign country where you were not present at the events, no matter how talented or how talented you invest in the movie. If you really want to learn about the history of other countries, look at something that the natives of that country have done, otherwise you will not be able to step away from your bubble. And those who seek their views and opinions about what they do not belong to actually abuse their power. Worse still, the director decided not to talk about the embarrassing participation of the CIA in the Fujimor regime. He decides to set aside the only witch that his country has much to explain to the potatoes. But it is not surprising, as both the Director and the CIA violate the sovereignty of Peru, trying to influence democratic processes at very different levels. <br /> <br /> If the director was really interested in Peru he would have funded his mother tongue for documentary. In any case, a number of films, films and books have been documented on this subject. Such are "Ojos Que No Ven", "Dias de Santiago", "Montesinos-Fujimori: Las Dos Caras de la Misma Moneda", "Montesinos: Poderoso Caballero", etc. to analyze the numerous problems of your country or at least to involve its country in other countries.
