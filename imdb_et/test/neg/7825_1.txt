The trailer is so deceptive ... I thought it was a good movie ... What was the point of bringing Hong Kong women to kill? They could have done it in Paris. And a fist for half an hour: <br /> <br /> -You love me! <br /> <br /> - Not! -You love Me! <br /> <br /> - Not! -You love Me! : D So here's why movie piracy is good! Imagine if I had even given money for torture! I'm sorry for the time I lost it because filmmakers should pay me.
