"The scientist has developed a serum that distorts the victim's hand and head." The scientist decides to use his serum for a concert pianist to treat him, as well as for a man's daughter to be a woman. "Summary of DVD sleeves. J. Carrol Naish (Dr. Igor Markoff) plays" Monster Maker "in low budget at Bela Lugos mode. <br /> < Mr. Naish's Serum Causes a Real Disorder, "Acromegaly", Defined by American Heritage: "Chronic Adult Disease, Characterized by Enlargement of Limbs, Faces and Jaws Caused by Pituitary Hyperactivity." Pretty blonde Wanda McKay (like Patricia "Pat" Lawrence) is the daughter of a crazy scientist Naish; in early scenes, Mrs McKay and Naish are imitating fun. <br /> <br /> Watch Tala Birelli (like Maxine) with surprisingly good supportive performance; He plays Naishi somewhat of Garbo-like and long-suffering. ‚ÄùBirell steals the movie for sure, and you have to ask Dr. Markoff's peace of mind to cast him away. Glenn Strange (like Steve) and the crazy gorilla (Ray Corrigan) add fun. Monster makeup (Maurice Seiderman) is very good. <br /> <br /> **** Monster Maker (1944) Sam Newfield ~ J. Carrol Naish, Ralph Morgan, Tala Birell
