The plot here is simple. The earth boy, Lem (Farrell), goes to the city to sell wheat harvest, falls in love with the waitress, Kate (Duncan), and marries her, bringing her home to a group of hostile father and woman-hungry cleaners. There are the colors they wanted and MICE AND MEN here. The two long-term treatment at the restaurant consumes the first half and is deadly. Lem is so weak that he allows his father to treat his wife badly, a Mac (Richard Alexander), one of the cleaners, to leave with him. Duncan and Alexander are the only good things in this annoying potboiler that lacks the knowledge and cinema that we expect from Murnau. Farrell's character doesn't have a backbone, so we're gonna end up with the "real man" (Mac) to get Kate out of it. If the audience falsely fools, the film loses its narrative progression. The transformation of the father at the end of the film is unrealistic and unbelievable, creating a viable decline. This movie is for star fans and only for the director - the general audience doesn't have to worry.
