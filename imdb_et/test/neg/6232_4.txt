As in so many past films, you would think Hollywood would learn it now, make a very disappointing movie, let alone make sure that the kidnapped victim is alive before paying the ransom. <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie wants to remind you of these basic facts when it ever happens to us. Why don't a long walk in the woods and a city guy really go through the forest without being lost? Just a chance for some sentimental dialogue, which was finally pointless. <br /> <br /> I had to listen to some of the director's comments on the special features, the big moves that Redford has done before, (Sneakers for one) surprised that he agreed to celebrate in such a movie. The director's comments and reasons were weak. <br /> <br /> The best parts of this movie were landscapes, can't wait in the spring.
