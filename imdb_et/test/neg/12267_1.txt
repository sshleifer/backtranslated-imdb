Everything about this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> In the first five minutes you can say that this movie is terrible. However, you can't measure how bad it goes. <br /> <br /> We start with a seemingly endless intro scene supported by gay music and dialogue. Moving the camera up and down for the big boys who are trying to look too hard does not create the slightest emotion. <br /> <br /> What then begins seems to be one of two separate stories. The first part of the film consists of competitions that are moving around in competing, midwives fighting with other ethnic groups. Of course, the winners wear because they obviously raise their weight and have "respect". It is in these scenes that we first see the level of bad behavior, editing, scripting and hatred of people who funded this film. <br /> <br /> Finally, the main character and his companion are sent to prison. The entire prison part of the movie is not related to what I assume is a plot and consists of a bunch of struggles. <br /> <br /> Once out of prison (3 years for murder?) The main character and his companion are reunited with neighbors. They then go to "another city" and try to humiliate, because everybody wants to kill them. <br /> <br /> Soon the boys will rape another gang member's girls and run around the city fighting the hordes of different gangs. This movie point can be compared to an arcade game because boys run around and fight against enemies who seem to be getting worse and worse when the movie goes on. <br /> <br /> In any case, the movie ends with some massive climate struggle where the rest of the bogs (the two main characters) take on every gang they have fought so far. Obviously, other gangs are not a problem that still connects the remaining frogs (skinheads are not Asians). After nearly one million people beaten invincible brothers, the film ends with the main characters who move home. They do not, however, do it at home because they are burned by thousands of angry movie critics who rush into the set and leave hateful messages everywhere. <br /> <br /> This movie may be a computer game rather than a movie, because it would explain how two men get from a million different people, who are twice as big as most of the time, face to face with about a million strokes. <br /> <br /> Unexplained events in this movie, such as Asian struggle against his own gang and taking a katana head to let the boys get away. <br /> <br /> As someone else mentioned, this movie is not so bad for this funny one, it's just so bad.
