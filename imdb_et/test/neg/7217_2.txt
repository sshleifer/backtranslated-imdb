If I have never seen the first journey, I think this movie can get another star, but even then it will make a 3-star movie. That's why I was surprised that it is currently relatively high rated. <br /> <br /> In fact, I couldn't finish this movie because it was painful. If it went wrong (at least the most obvious way), it is equal to the original even when the original plot has been referred to. It doesn't really make sense and doesn't work. It's also weak ... I never felt like I was in the movie, but I felt like I was watching people act. Even good actors like Busey will not work, probably due to scenario or perhaps uncomfortable editing. The strange thing is that the film looks like a B-film in the mid-1990s, but it was made in 06. I am not sure why, but then again it seems that this happens for some reason with the aftermath. Music, appearance and overall feeling reminds me of movies I saw 10 years ago at Cinemax late at night. The strangest thing is that I also hope that Ja Rule will come at some point ... often reminds me of running movies with rapper than actors. <br /> <br /> The most irritating thing is the interest of love The girl who is character seems like the character of Lois Lane in Smallville, which is also quite annoying. And do not forget that "South Accents" sounds like the faxes I've heard from Walk the Line. I understand that this is the usual place in movies, but no accent would work better if you were trying to hear you are on this universal hick on television, where any southern country (or KY and WV) sounds exactly the same. Of course, people in AZ desert cities like people in Southeast American countries 2000+ miles away. It was thin 10 years ago in the B movies where the technique came. Why are such writers / directors making such decisions? Bottom line: I really wouldn't recommend you if you're a Road House fan or if you like good movies. If you haven't seen it yet, don't ruin it by looking at this version first. The original Road House was one of those casual classics that people love and pursue. It was an unexpected success like American Graffiti, Dazed and Confused, and recently Office Space, Fast and Furious (only the first!) And Napolean Dynamite. Why did they break it !!! ??? Of course, you can never get original (eg Bad News Bears, Longest Yard, etc.), but at least when you do it right, it's as representative as the examples mentioned. But to make a small budget, offline, Road House's self-production is a criminal procedure.
