Recently I borrowed a copy of this movie that took three sessions of three days to get through. This is another comment in the making. <br /> <br /> But what I wanted to comment on first was the carelessness of DVD-specific features. It contained a memory game that asks the player / viewer to match a couple of animals so that they can enter the ship. But every time he discovers the selected animal, the screen suggests that the player find (or congratulates the player) "it's a companion." This is a spelling mistake, as it should be "his companion" as the prevailing noun, not "it's". It is a tedious mistake to continue 16 or more times to end the game. Of course, this is a child's action, but it teaches children the wrong spelling. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, the game never changes. It is the same game with the same places of the same animals every time. Plus it doesn't lose the score, as the number of moves to solve games. Thus, it has no permanent value or challenge. This is just a feature that is readable on the packaging. <br /> <br /> Simply put, there could have been more thought and care that this "special" feature, as you might have thought and cared for, is possible. crazy movie.
