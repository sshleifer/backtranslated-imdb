This movie is an absolute shame! I enjoyed the original airport thoroughly and I can't believe how the same people could produce it for a couple of nine years. First, it's bad. The original had previously been made by actors who made high quality (not catastrophic) films, but it already uses actors who have already made a catastrophic film (Blakely, Kennedy, Wagner). It also seems that George Kennedy's character, Patron, is moving very fast. He is now the film's lead, but his character is not strong enough to take it off: he has lost the charm and humor of the airport (1970) and the character is now bored. Have I mentioned a plot of land? Is it at all believable that someone will send a rocket after Concorde? NO !!! There are also too many open ends; scenes that are of no importance to the plot. The scene where the hot balloon lands on the runway is two such scenes to steal Charles De Gaulle airport theft. Both would be interesting - if only they had a real story to do with it. There are also many unanswered questions: Why does Patron open a window and fire another plane? Why is Robert Wagner's character killing? (He must have another stupid and costly way Why is there no investigation after the rocket almost knocks out Concorde? Why are backward projects so bad? (Concorde seems to be followed by a cartoon missile, although it works well as a plane in Paris) Why does Patron think he is in a flight simulator? (when he turns around Concorde) Why does he get a salon welcome to the cabin after the plane, ending up as poor as it can be called the end result? a blessing given to a young couple by a girl's trainer is a shmaltzy, a man playing a saxophone and a woman with a bladder problem is just foolish, scenes where Susan Blakely lies on the roof of her conservatory and tells Wagner that she still loves her this movie should have been the top of Ous's three airport films: instead it is devilish, submoronic, complete and wasting time, money, energy, celluloid and "talent" !!!!!!! Remember when Patroni asks the French pilot whether he has "ever landed his stomach?" This film will definitely make a stomach flop and will land on your sharp nose.
