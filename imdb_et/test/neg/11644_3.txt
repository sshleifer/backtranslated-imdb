Jim Brown celebrates and produces in the Philippines just after the Japanese invasion. The story has been taken by several naval prisoners in Japan, including some of the divers they use to get biased gold in MacArthur's Manila Bay. <br /> <br /> This is a filthy film designed to reveal war and racism (the film uses Edwin McCain's war in less fine assembly). Performances are, at best, sufficient. Jim Brown is okay, but he does not really show any range in the performance that just stops him who is annoyed. Sets are usable but look pretty cheap. From the outset, the film bears a large number of stock footage, including many Japanese attacks on Tora! Tora! Tora! Using such a large budget series makes the rest of the film a positive anemic; It also recalls that there are better movies that you could watch. It seems to me that the film has half the actual plot, the silver extract and half the plot that is just to fill the time. None of them are particularly exciting even in the event of an explosive final. <br /> <br /> Given the choice I take.
