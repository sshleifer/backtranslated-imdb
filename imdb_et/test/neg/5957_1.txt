SPOILERS <br /> <br /> This movie was a rented joke and what a joke it was. The film is based on a dog catcher looking for El Chupacab. The equipment of the dog catchers is so ridiculous. She seems to have sewed a plate on her hat and for some reason she shows her "muscles" by pulling up her sleeves. Throughout the film, mostly at night, you can see how bad the lighting was. They are in a car that is brightly lit and they're driving in the dark. Often you see a camera man's shadow on the ground. Costumes are terrible, lighting is terrible and action is terrible. It's a good movie to laugh ... maybe.
