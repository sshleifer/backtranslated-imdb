The film starts well enough. This is a really scary scene, because a few refugees who have left the law will blow up an innocent family living in a country house, killing mother and father. A young daughter is able to escape with a mysterious spectrum that kills two aggressors when she covers the locker. Then, after a 15-year period, we arrive at a supernatural drug addict who lives with his promising aunt and was cared for by a mysterious redhead. He has no real friends, he has been raped almost on the party and has strange visions that no one else can see. So yes, life is great. Things become much more pleasing when he falls out of his mother's sister, who is later found dead in a suspicious bath, where 11 ends are etched. Hmm, I don't know who is the main suspect of the police? This is followed by more deaths, all of which are related to their relationship with our heroine, who were in bad conditions before they passed. Could he be a culprit or maybe the explanation can be something of an ethereal nature? Tip: If you think the former, you have chosen the wrong movie from Blockbuster. Go back and get the right, short-sighted gimp. <br /> <br /> As I said, I was all ready to move fast to the good parts, being aware that I was nothing but a mediocre stop. But the first ten minutes took me and decided to give him a chance. I was quite pleasantly surprised: it was definitely not a masterpiece, but the action was good enough and the script held intriguing situations that I expected to find. Unfortunately, for 45 minutes, I realized that my attention would start to circulate in a long sequence when the main character was not doing the library while walking around. Then we get cheap intimidation, followed by a quarter of a goddess about paranormal between her and her new boy's boy. Things only got worse from there, because a promising start is thrown out of the window when we can turn one convincing plot after another, followed by an end that is anti-climate. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> If it were always bad, it would be much easier to swallow it. The fact that it starts in the box and barely ends is not just disappointing, it is heartbreaking. How does something so promisingly begin, so formal? I don't know, and I don't care. The next time I give the publisher and the director some advice: don't spend 5 weeks writing your first part of the script, then 5 minutes, ending with the rest. You can see these things in the final product significantly when you meet your project in a sloppy way as here ... 3/10
