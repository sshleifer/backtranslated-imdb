The mission to see the movie "The Cave" was a dream of my friend after witnessing a very dramatic trailer full of cave-hidden creatures, some young caves, and much more. It's too bad that the movie didn't change much more than a trailer. <br /> <br /> The direct temptation of such a film is a creature. What does she look like? Why does he live in a cave? How should this be different from other beings we have shown in films like Alien and Predator and Relic? The cave "demons" does not look far from the alien skeleton: resurrection and even the sight of Predator. Shame this is a full ripoff ... <br /> <br /> Well, let's look at the plot: very confusing and jumping more and more to unlikely twists, because the cave mill team sends the cave and its inhabitants to the Carpathian Mountains. Casting was very clear that we want young, clean chicks, harsh chicks, familiar boys and the brain also girls to be hot. We also need to have one of every racial background when the audience thinks the filmmakers are biased to a certain angle. Totally done and I'm totally tired of it. The second main problem was the end, as if to say that there may be a sequel. Let me, if it exists. The graduate was annoyed by me. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 3/10 stars. The points he got were more or less welcome for the creators of those creatures for the high quality work that took on the costume and design of their colleagues living inside, even when they saw it completely ripped. And the DVD has an interesting (yet worked) documentary about diving underwater caves. Go check it out only if you love new monsters and creatures, but warn that you have probably seen this movie and it was better for the first time.
