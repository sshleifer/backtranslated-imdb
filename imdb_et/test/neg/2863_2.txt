I bought this movie, hoping it would be another big movie of killings. I am a big fan of the child's play series and hoped to see it here. Boy, I was wrong. Most of the film was not the least scary, plus the only time Pinocchio's "life" was the last scenes of the movie. The little girl in the movie, her actor is so bad that it's almost ridiculous. In addition, the end did not show the end of what happened to the doll or what made them a little girl shelter or where she was at the end of the movie. So, in my opinion, this movie is the worst of the "killer toy" genre. If you want a good series of killer toys, stay with the child's franchise. Pinocchio revenge is a waste of money and time.
