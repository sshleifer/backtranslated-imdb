A widespread bad film, which allegedly concerns a croupier who wants to be a writer and incident that make up casino gambling. Moves at a snail's pace. Bored, boring, boring! Almost everything about this movie is amateurish and convincing - with a very remarkable exception: Clive Owen, who is like Rolls Royce, hits a slum. The advice about casino sequences was allegedly given by a professional, but deciding how to handle them left the director completely ignoring them. Although casino workers can be very different breeds to the rest of the world, they are almost the same and worshiped as the characters in the script. The odds and ends are thrown into the script, trying to convince them of a convincing background, but it seems to have been left in the list on the cocktail tray. For anyone living in a casino business (like this writer has been in the past forty years!), This is the poverty-stricken image of his world, which even in the most distant and most confused England has never wanted it! Amazing, offensive mess from the movie that plods and plods and plods along the idiotic and convincing end. American critics loved it.
