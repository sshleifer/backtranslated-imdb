Hey. I mean, who. I was wondering who saw this movie, waaay back when I was eight in 1996. Then the CGI films were rare; even more good and good. We also listened to CD players. But I ground. I liked this movie a lot, so far back and I look back at it, I really remembered it. Hey, this is Don Bluth! Anyone who hates "All dogs to heaven" is clearly a robot. But again, I'm going. <br /> <br /> Then I saw it again. It's not really one of his best, I can say now 11 years later. I've seen a lot more movies and I've got a little more knowledge. Now it is certain that the voice is good, I will give it. The story is ... okay. I mean, we see it all the time. LOTS. But it works. Musical numbers are poison for me. It would have been more home in the eighties with musical numbers of this type. In the 96s, most children's films had epic numbers, such as the Lion King (which appeared a year or both, but whatever) or such things. Here you can see Vaudeville style in the exhibition. <br /> <br /> Animation is also painful. Sometimes it is inconvenient and in another way to change the style and form if the change in the image is really hard to miss. <br /> <br /> I still like "All dogs go to heaven but it could have been better than waaay. <br /> <br /> 4/10
