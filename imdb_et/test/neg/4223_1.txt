The "Danish bladerunner" is boldly marked on the box. Are you kidding ?! This movie is a complete drag. When I'm thirsty and soda in the kitchen, I usually stop vcr, so I'm not leaving anything behind. Not this time. I found myself in the refrigerator for a long time and hard, so I shouldn't go back. Why doesn't hell have any scriptwriter who has the most vague idea how computers work? It's amazing. One of the spaces in the movie is that our hero (who is a hacker) has a little helper to help him (the Microsoft Office clamp is finally caught). If he loses the assistant in the movie, he's helpless and can't get to any computer. He's a hacker! It's like saying that you can't drive your car unless you have your happy "driving protection". I'm not even going to have a flash effect when it gets an electric shock ...
