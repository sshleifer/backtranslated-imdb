This movie is a copy-cat, a cliché-ridden, clumsy, and cumbersome, I find it surprising that no one can feel the experience of sitting through it. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of idiotic clichés, ridiculous psychological and simply impossible storytelling in this high school "hard hit": a tough guy jock is really homosexual. A student is unhappy because her father pushes her and it causes her incest somehow. A teacher means a student who moisturizes his pants in the classroom. A girl who goes outside the above-mentioned jockey is really in love with her and "just wants a family". <br /> <br /> Perhaps the only salvation grace is the scenes of student advisors that are vaguely interesting, but most of the equipment in this film is so leading that it is believing. <br /> <br /> This movie does not show me any picture of teenagers and I'm not surprised if it's bombs, especially for teenagers. People who like this film seem to be parents who are worried about their teenagers, and the boy grabs the wrong tree when they think this film helps in understanding teenage issues. I mean, what's the moral of this movie? "Hey guys, let's look at each other and hug each other" NEVER USE. Anyone who thinks you're getting such a message at the age of 14 must think. In the 1980s, we looked at Kentucky Fried Movie, Xtro, Porky, Evil Dead, Terminator, and so on. This film falls on deaf ears. <br /> <br /> 2:37 there is another Australian "indepedent" movie, "One Perfect Day", which was as bad as this movie's full turkey. God does not spend money on this taxpayer. <br /> <br /> AVOID !!!!
