This is an excellent concept for a film that was set aside, but a large number of clich√© areas, creepy and unrealistic images and performances, and some honestly unreliable (and very random and, not to mention, comfortable plots) point out that the story moves into its deceptive finish). <br /> <br /> There is nothing that highlighted lead, when in reality gay, with the exception of some random references to Crow Bar or that he is gay, was worrying. In fact, he wouldn't have actually shown him anything, even if it was just a meeting with friends. <br /> <br /> It's worth looking at and having it. Not much, even now a couple of years after the film appeared, both movies that are homosexual as well as remarkable gay plot lines, and it's African-Americans. This is worth a look. I wouldn't look too hard for that and I won't waste my time to own it. This is a rental, not an additional rent.
