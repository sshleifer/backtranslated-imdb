1st Review 8/7/2004 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Brett Thompson): Foolish, juvenile-focused film about three children who are their favorite experiment with their parents' experiment. The script remained so much wanted in this Hanna-Barbara, like the hanging of a Saturday morning "live action with people in dinosaur costumes", where some funny soldiers hang. There is nothing to admire about it and something to say. I'm just surprised when I found this blockbuster video shop as bad as it was and how stores are getting out of old VHS movies. I think they couldn't even sell it, so they went back to the rental table.
