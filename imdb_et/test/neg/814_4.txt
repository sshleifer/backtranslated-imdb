"Jaded" offers potential because it looks at rape of two other women and asks "if rape is not rape?". Unfortunately, it seems that the flick seems to be a bad direction, as it slips through legitimate ministries, trying to tell a story about a handful of unpleasant mouths and badly depicted characters that end sharply. "Jaded" is a flat stuff for potatoes with dark eyes only in some dark drama mood.
