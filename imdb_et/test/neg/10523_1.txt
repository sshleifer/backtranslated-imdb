OK, we went along with the stereotypical experience of a poor orphanage and explained to our son from Russia that it was overwhelming and dramatic, so we can play football (as he plays football). But the last scene where the dog goes back to his original owner put my son over the edge and shouted for 15-20 minutes, "he's replaced !!!!" This is an elementary child. I do not recommend this film to any family with a adopted child; it shows adoption, orphanage and adults badly - and finally, even if they win the game - the dog to whom the boy is related - and that is too much. Be careful if you have adopted children, and beware of families with biological children, because the children you have received are not positive and color the unhealthy and unpleasant stereotype. (The dog is cute but not enough to save our family's reaction to this movie.)
