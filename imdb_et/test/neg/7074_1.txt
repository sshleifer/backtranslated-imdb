"Tamara" felt just like the other teenage orientation "I know what you did last summer" and is painfully numb. Summoning a high school who is heavily in witchcraft and black magic is accidentally killed during a cruel walk by a group of harassers who secretly hide him in the forest, and who have no one. The next day, supposedly "dead" Tamara arrives at the school with a brand new image and seduces her future killers and she has little revenge ... It's basically a combination of "Carrie", "Craft" and every other straight video, nice bopper. turkey that hits the shelves these days. The actors are absolutely cruel and look too old for about ten years to go to college. There is some gore that is really interesting because the film is so boring and I couldn't wait until it ends. If you like modern rubbish, if I demand, you look for it, otherwise you won't bother ...
