Jeremy Irons and Forrest Whitaker are good actors. But this movie was badly written. First, during the hijacking scene, Irons sit too comfortably on his chair ... it looks like READING is something and quite calm! Maybe the director shot the director? There was also a major backlog of violence during the hijacking. Slow-mo, bullets fly - how his wife and daughter's death is not just that interesting and the tension disappears. His exhausting later wasted another 10 minutes. Then he decided to "get revenge" and talk to all his friends and ambassadors of industrial journalists (he's a journalist tired of a business worker towel) and see and see, they actually give him advice on where to find the bad guys! How do they know? But what really made the movie halfway off was when Irons found the way to the warehouse where the baddies are hanging - BUT NOT BADDIES WHO WIFE - and they're still blowing them away. so he's just a murderer. he goes away and well ... I shut it down. I mean, I couldn't figure out how his friends knew anything, and I thought he was after the other 2 men in custody who were the original hijackers. Instead, he goes after his friends, I think, or someone who spreads and holds automatic weapons. The intercourse was just plain normal and the dialogue was flat ("this is OK son, crying helps," he says to his son. The son says, "No, it's not" and the father says, "You're right ..." take on the roles - like the one dragon movie he did. He was a brilliant Brideshead Revisited, a totally different animal than this lukewarm thriller.
