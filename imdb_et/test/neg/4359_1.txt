Suburban children meet in the woods. Killjoy is better than that. He's also worse and stronger. However, most of the actions are also bad, as in the first. Sometimes the characters tell each other things that are not reasonable and not convincing. I made the mistake of viewing this flawlessly. You probably enjoy it more than you are ;-). If you haven't finished clowns after the first movie, be sure to follow the second movie ..... ;-) <br /> <br /> Children and their observers are on their way to the forest camp. And what a coincidence, their car broke right in the middle of the forest and ... at night? It's just their happiness. They find the house and one was shot, one observer is left behind (why I don't know) and the rest finally find another house. This house is home to a voodoo priest, but he is not responsible for Killjoy's resurrection. Who is this? Well, you look at the movie better and find out for yourself.
