This movie was not very well targeted. they almost completely ignored the book. I think they were trying to save 2 time. the only upside down 2 for me was that the finny played actress was cute. Some dialogue between the main characters showed a little homosexuality that was not in the book. The main parts of the book were cut again. You lost all the effect that was not as strange as the book and left me seriously. A strong language, even though it was short, was very unnecessary. I was also surprised (not pleasantly) with a new character that was not in this book. One of my favorite characters (leper) was badly interpreted and depicted. He seemed more embarrassed in the film than the true ally in this book. All over the frustration.
