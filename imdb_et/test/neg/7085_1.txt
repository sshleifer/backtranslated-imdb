This is probably one of the worst films ever made. All that is - action, management, script, cinematography - is terrible. An alien (a person sparkly suit) claims to be near the universe; it is assumed that the scriptwriter meant "galaxy" but did not put his dictionary in check for his words. A better title for the film would be "It came from the Plot Contrivances planet". The plot is too silly and almost non-existent. People are given all the magical MacGuffins that correspond to a tiny series of unlikely restrictions to move only naked parcels. The idea of ​​passing time is ignored. Now a few days after the alien's meeting, BAM! maybe just a couple of hours to zero. Make yourself a favor and leave this movie. You're doing it for tracking. The end is especially stupid and should have been accompanied by someone who goes to "Ta-Da !!!!" just like a scriptwriter just pulls something out of his ass at random. I think the real alien plot is that this movie sucks so bad that you can look at it. If you can watch the last 10 minutes without getting scared ("freedom enemies" - honestly), you laugh, then you're slow.
