I didn't like this movie ~ !!!! it was boring and didn't interest me at all. I am more action girl and it was NOT NO. I went and rented this movie because the second comment was left. But it was completely misleading! can't get this movie if you don't like dessert and lots of boredom. I just didn't like the movie. it wasn't my style but it could be yours .. you just have to look at the previews or something, but this is my recommendation if you are a girl .. can't get this movie! This Scandinavian production is based on some of Godfrey Reggio Koyaanisqats' observation strategy, which allows us to reflect on the patterns and phenomena of human and natural existence from both intimate and sweeping perspectives. it's just not for me!
