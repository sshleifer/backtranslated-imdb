I still remember when Frog Baseball first appeared on MTV. In a strange, surreal sense, the stupid action I think is that every boy in America is in. I mean, now, how I burned a strainer with a magnifying glass, but it was interesting at that time for some reason. In the 1980s, we all grew up to know "stoners". These were the kids who wore Iron Maiden's t-shirts to school, grew their hair long, were immature mustache and were at least two inches taller than everyone else because they were screaming at grade or two. We laughed at them because they were so stupid, even if they were not stoned. Thus, understanding Beavis & Co was easy because we already know them, some of us were even. To the extent that GenXers, like me, would create a surplus of the 1980s and embrace the 1990s' grunge movement, Beavis & Co was a unique postmodern anthem. Strangely enough, like Beavis & Co, we don't care that we have an anthem. It was just an internal joke that we all got right now, even if it was terrible.
