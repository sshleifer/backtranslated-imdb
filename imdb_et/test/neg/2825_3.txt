Well the movie starts well, but after half an hour it becomes boring and stupid when the whole plot is from Karen (this is the name of the girl?) Pregnancy. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is really a runny nose and the characters are really stupid. <br /> <br /> I don't know who is more stupid than a girl because she came back to her old boy or boy as he used to. Anyway, my conclusion is this: certainly not the best of the eighties comedy, just one movie, like many others who don't have anything special, they could do it better, but they destroyed it if only the plot had another way, but they keep it pregnancy and they definitely destroyed, so the final conclusion: I do not like.
