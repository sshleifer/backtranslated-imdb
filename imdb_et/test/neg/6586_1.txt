"Polar Express" was a terrible movie. What makes this film the worst is hypocrisy to show itself to the innocent, sweet and harmless story of the "forceful" meaning of children. I never read Chris Van Allsburg's book inspired, but the most disappointing thing was that it was directed by Robert Zemeck, who made an excellent film "Who's in the frame of Roger Rabbi?" Animations can be equally appreciated by children and adults, while in this movie it seems that he was a victim of his ambitions and he is too important to create an impressive level of detail as an interesting story. I'm sorry to say, but Polar Express has as much artistic level as a video game or a toy advertising campaign. Everything in this movie seems to be so inanimate: characters may seem like humans, but they have nothing to live with, and they have a malicious touch in their eyes. <br /> <br /> But the worst ... is the "message" of this movie. You would see this movie in some parts and believe me, it was a whistle. Take, for example, one scene where one child refuses to enter Polar Express. Note that the character that looks like Tom Hanks does a gesture saying, "You are stupid to not accept my offer." Secondly, if the girl says that the toys are so "warm" and such things. All the fucking movies that the kids say about how big the gifts Santa would give them. There is even a song about gifts, vagabond is irrelevant and weak character. And in the last scene, the character seems to mean the true meaning of Christmas and what would it be? what do you think ? presents! Many Christmas movies are close to saying something, but "Polar Express" is materialism and greed. Seriously, I refuse to call it "children's film" because if that is what the children would learn, I don't want to think about how our future would be.
