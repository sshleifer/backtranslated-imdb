I gave this presentation 4 stars. All of these are for the script that is recognized in places. What can you say? They took one of the best games written in the last century and robbed it methodically of heart, humor and humankind. I do not blame those actors who apparently do their best if they are dirty and incomplete (because the very precise characters of the production are out of their inner - and perceptions). I blame the director very, who seems to be struggling to find ways to undermine the script. In this television movie there are so many awkward breaks, cumbersome moments and awkwardly redesigned lines that sometimes I forgot to love playing. I'm not one of those people who thinks that genius games are automatically lower on the film (on the contrary), but this particular genius game has tremendously succumbed to this outing. Now I hope they make a * real * movie about this game. The world deserves it.
