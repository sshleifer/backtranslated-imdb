The German regional radio station WDR has shown both "General" and "ODC". On Saturday I have seen "General" and I thought it wasn't very bad, but not too good. But yesterday I have seen ODC and I turned it off after about an hour. Although Kevin Spacey was the main actor, the film was completely confusing and seems restless. "The General" told the story straight and brick, but ODC just wanted to be cool. There is a reference to Guy Ritchie's films "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "Snatch", but they don't have the coolness of these films. <br /> <br /> So I would finally appreciate it in 3 out of 10!
