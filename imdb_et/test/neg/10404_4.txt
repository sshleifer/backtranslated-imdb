This sick sweet and laborious 5-reel is definitely not one of Harold Lloyd's better films. Gags are rare and mostly uninspired. The saccharin melodrama is abundant. The setting will take forever, like Lloyd, unusual, but impossible to make, the doctor will make his round, bringing a little sun to the children, the elderly and the puppies. It's like the 1922 version of Patch Adams. Ugh. 4/10.
