Grounding begins with three times more murders. No plot, no signs, no motivation; The second murder works under the screen, and this victim's isolated head is actually accustomed to condemning the third victim! This is a high point. But Lewis is obviously smart enough to reach; they will soon cover the botched dialogue with the scenes of the detective and capture the endless cunning repertoire of the ugly wide picture. To date, this terrible atmosphere of Betacam's production has quickly given way to an insurance label, where the monumental (and rather loving) simplicity of the leaders twists things in that direction. Shlub's policeman examines that the meat-cutter kills, repeats, hides, and remembers early, memorable, isolated finger-salads. Just how the hell's fingers got to salad? And was Blood Culti intended to collect the collected impurities? When GORE stops thinking, you know you're in trouble. And without breaking the great, pointless twist, just take my word: the exciting incompetence of the first scene provides a deep bursting pulse of the cathode tube. The main reaction is to try to make it behind you and go on with your life.
