This movie was so bad that it was funny! After a while I thought I was actually watching a bad movie parody (la "for your consideration"). Ultimately, "Cliffhanger" created a scene until I was hurt. The script was terrible, but with Sean Young's terrible example - especially when he explains the whole plot in great detail (with setbacks), while it is rocky - makes it a truly classic bad movie! In fact, in this scene, fake images were reminiscent of Ed Wood's film. I still can't believe how it got. First of all, how bad a script came from a green light? How did the stars get? Were they at the low points of their careers? Questions, questions.
