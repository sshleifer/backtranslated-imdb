I happened to see a promo for this movie on the Spike channel last night, it was grouped with Patrick's swazy, which he did again, and thought it was a sequel ..... boy was wrong .... I see the screen writer also celebrated this, and I think the budget was a bit tense. I'm surprised when I see Will Patton, who has much better credit for his name, to play it in "c". Bussey jr tried so hard to imagine his father's image (one of the best bad actors ever) who failed the only salvation qualities in the movie were chicks ,,,,, good looking and not only worth the time or his hard earned dollars to rent it
