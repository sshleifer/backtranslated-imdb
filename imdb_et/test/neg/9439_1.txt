This movie was absolutely terrible. A stupid assumption and terrible action by everyone. Who wrote this trash must be hung. Reminds me of BUT WORSE. Who ever produced it should now give up. I know the opinions are subjective and all, and some may think that this "fantastic", as some think, "Dune (1984)" was fantastic, lost his horse and watch some real movies. OK, the operation was acceptable and could have been much better in the right direction, but it wasn't. I don't know how much more I can say about wasting this movie, except that it is completely trashed. Anyway, it was terrible and I recommend avoiding it like a plague if you come somewhere near "dreams", rent a movie next to it.
