The stupid I do is the anticipated comedy that makes a serious misunderstanding, including (but not limited to) the whore that is confused with beating a foreign student, a girlfriend, a girl who loves a gay man, and a straight boy who loves him, and bitchy gossipers. None of the following are funny or even fun. Nation Lampoon uses the day for fun. Now the name is unfortunately synonymous. And this is no exception. I think Topenga was pretty cute in "Boy Meets World", but she seems to let her go (and yes, I know she has a name, but she's doing something worthwhile, she's like Topenga) > <br /> My Class: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kati Lohmann gets topless; Boti Bliss is based on a double body (BOOOOO !!!)
