As a sci-fi fan I am, I was always curious about this movie. So I was glad to see that on the far side of Sun finally end up on an affordable DVD (the previous edition was nearly $ 100 for eBay - I'm sure these people want them to have money back, but more of that one ). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the premise of this movie (like the Twilight Zone's "Parallel") is that "on the other side of the sun" is the undiscovered undiscovered planet of the Earth. This planet is, of course, exactly like us, except that it is inverted. This basically means that their stars are reversed and people are driving on the wrong side of the road. <br /> <br /> Sounds intriguing? Well this is basically all this movie. The first lesson is dedicated to preparing for this planet. It's just annoying scenes when you press switches, banal dialogs, and so on. There's no point in that. In the history of cinema, Gerry Anderson was able to find the most boring British actors to play most roles. I mean, they're so moody that I'm surprised the team was able to stop the movie awake. <br /> <br /> Anyway, when the CLOSED team lands on the planet (after the astronaut session ends) literally asleep in the cockpit, Roy Thinnes notes that the copy is all back on the Cologne bottle and hops back to another ship to tell people what he discovered. Sorry he can't do it when he lands and dies. End! Wait, there's one bonus in space for drivers who will eventually hit their wheelchair mirror. I think he also wanted this movie. <br /> <br /> I am really surprised to find a movie like it could get back in the 1960s. Rent if you need. DO NOT BUY.
