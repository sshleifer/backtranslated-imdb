Oh dear gods, it's terrible. Stay away, just stay away. If you think you've seen bad movies, think again. Never before has my brain hurt as much as after watching the movie. Effective, if it can be called, is sufficient to cause internal bleeding inside your head. The story is so thin that it's hardly there ... don't wait, scratch it. There is no complete story there, but once there are some thin lines that are out of all the frighteningness, and believe me, these few lines should have been hit. The best way to enjoy this movie is to fall into the napalm and watch the cozy fire from afar. <br /> <br /> Some may call sarcastic in this review, but I will only try to save some other serious headaches. But if you had to, then I like to call a visual masoch (like me), go right now and watch this monster.
