The sound is terrible, the picture is worse, the worse, the actor is terrible, the female actor is chubby and the story is ... wait ... ... no story ...! The plot is really bad and the title of the movie is misleading. If you think you can see Piranhas, you may be disappointed. This film has nothing to do with Piranha's films in 1978 and 1981. In fact, I can only think of one scene related to Piranhas. it only takes about 85 minutes, there is a song at the end. It has been written and sung by Jim Stein and is called "I love all the things that love the sun". <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie. It's so bad that it's not even funny to look at. I was swimming for the first 20 minutes and I am a person who looks at something.
