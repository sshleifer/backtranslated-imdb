Yumiko (Wakana Sakai), a pretty parent of a recently deceased Japanese businessman, is holding back his father's business control; his uncle Kazuo (Shun Sugata) miffed that he had not left the business. When the Jug-eared chef Kensuke (Takashi Okamura) mistakenly enters the hotel room and hits the "Invincible" (Jung Yuen), he is mistaken for a murderer and sent to Yumiko to kill. Instead, he falls to the heir and comes to his defense. However, he kidnaps Kazuo by the men, while Kensuke is engaged in a feature film with Daniel (Sam Lee). <br /> <br /> Uncle Kazuo keeps Yumiko in hypnotic transmission and takes control of the company, but runs into trouble if his gangster heads threaten to publish their illegal activities unless he allows them to gain full control. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Kensuke is making two martial arts experts, Lam Kau (Yuen Baio) and Lam Doi (Candy Lo), who hunt Invincible. She is studying Kung Fu and trying to release Yumiko. <br /> <br /> Blend with a wide range of humor, spoofery and fight scenes, No Problem 2 is a disappointing movie, given the talent involved: 80s kung fu superstar Yuen Baio manages a few fighting scenes, but these days there is little old for acrobatics; director Kar Lok Chin offers a stupid parody about what I expect from Scary Movie; Jung Yuen is resting on Scorpio for mocking his character; and Sam Lee? Well, Sam Lee is as annoying as always! <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Collin Chou, like the gangster Ben, impressed me; he probably has a strong screen presence that hasn't gone unnoticed by Hollywood? He has been playing in two Matrix films ever since, and will soon appear in D.O.A, directed by Corey Yuen. I was also impressed by Wakana Sakai, but for a completely different reason: this beauty is simple and should go much further in the film industry. which movies will be shown, but in 104 minutes I found this movie for real decorations to sit on. If people who draw funny faces with foolish sound effects are laughing at your parties, then problem 2 may not turn to you. Otherwise, I would leave it alone.
