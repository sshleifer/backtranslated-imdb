Attention, possible spoilers <br /> <br /> This film is so weak that it is really funny. The director has put all the clichés that have ever bothered the B-series. The foolish boys, the top villain laughing and again revealing the foolish bimbo (nice rack) and revealing their plots before they happen to be destroyed and who of course teased / killed the hero's father in the unclear past, side-to-side police person - small, bald and whose only preparation for the last battle (the second cliché) returns the edge of his baseball side, etc. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie really does. After they die in the main prison, as the hero of Paralis Stoneface Jack, or whatever he's ten times higher on the roof of the building, they cast them out of the building. What exterior looks like only three high-level stories and resembles your usual town hall. <br /> <br /> When they leave the building, side-kicking can't go because his right leg seems to be wounded. How nobody can say: Ten minutes earlier he fell off his shoulder and his legs were fine. There is no explanation for the curious mind of the viewer who would be curious about such trivial things as "Where is the villainous body that should be near the building?" and "Why hasn't this body gathered police or even curious people?". <br /> <br /> I could go on the list forever. Why does another bad guy say he's inventing martial arts when he doesn't hit his ass? Why do bad guys make stupid moves in attack? Why does the hero look so harsh? Does anyone really think "yes, these characters and this plot makes this movie memorable"? And the actors suck. The hero and savior of our day bears the same expression on his face. The whole movie. This nasty person who tries to be a dirty smile must be protected by copyright. <br /> <br /> I also thought that up to now 12% of people who rated this movie gave me 10, they were full of fear. They may have been serious and then we are doomed.
