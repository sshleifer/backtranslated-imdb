Eddy Murphy and Robert De Niro should be a combination that brings great comedy. High expectations often lead to breakage and this is a case. <br /> <br /> When Eddy's police officer violates the detective Robert's drugs, they put it so badly that they finally make a live action reality TV police show. Logic is not a major component of this film. The super-weapon they spend on the other side of the movie, the downturn confirms this. Twelve laptops that leave large holes in sheet metal and three will destroy the house for about a minute (without reloading) the same fantasy as scientific literature. A five-pound weapon that burns hundreds of shots per minute without rebound is definitely a weapon of the future using the technology of the past. <br /> <br /> It is clear that this movie was not meant for adults or children, so if you're somewhere in between, it's a movie for you.
