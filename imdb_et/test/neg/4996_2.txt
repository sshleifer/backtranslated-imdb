Don't be misled. It's not a zombie movie. Take this guy who loves zombie movies and who rents them all: good and terrible. Yes, this film is an expanded zombie sequence, but it is basically an artistic-fartsy exercise with existential fear that is a long way to say it's boring. If you have worked all day and want to spend a few hours of entertainment, rent something else. <br /> <br /> "Undead Rise" is a cheap special effect, mediocre action and crumbling dialogue. All this is understandable in indie, low budget movies and I can forgive such mistakes until the film has an entertaining story. Unfortunately, "Undead Rise" is hardly a story. Moreover, acting ridiculously is not as bad as nonexistent. It seems that all actors have learned Buster Keaton's wooden face. Would it have killed these emotions? (And no, shouting is not equal to emotion). One sign that was actually a pessimist was killed first. In this case, there was another character who briefly held his interests. He looked and acted like Kyle McLachlan, who led Norman Bates, but it was too little, too late. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers seemed to have forgotten a little detail: film is VISUAL media. This means that your scenes are illuminated enough to allow the viewer to actually see what is happening. And all these artistic jumps and shortcuts could look cool at that time, but all they did was watch the movie and see the confusion. There is nothing wrong with telling a story in a simple and clear fashion - just look at George Romero's low budget "Living Night of the Dead" to see how it's done perfectly. And I know that these people had a small budget, but if you can't hire the equipment and technicians needed to make the dialogue heard, just go ahead and make a quiet movie (then these Buster Keaton wooden faces actually work). <br /> <br /> I say this for the movie: The zombies were horrible. Unlike most zombie films, which show that they are all their decaying glory, the better, the better zombies are just blending with bloody faces. He actually worked to make them more like us and therefore more frightening. That's why I gave it to 1 star instead of 1 star. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that, despite all its drawbacks, "Undead Rise" does not violate your intelligence. The filmmakers seemed to want to make an intelligent, frightening and original film, and it is a disgrace that they failed. If they could just give up too fancy editing, buy some extra lighting pumps, raise the dialogue and come up with a real story that really goes somewhere, then I think they have the talent to do something really good. > <br /> Trust me: don't waste your time on "Undead Rise".
