Mexico's "classic" was the third bait in the Aztec mommy series. As you will know soon, this film is nothing more than a classic, but rather a film that deliberately tries to bring you. <br /> <br /> Some scientists want to steal the treasure of the Aztec from the grave, but to watch this tomb is that the walking toilet paper is commercial: The Aztec Mummy. Knowing that he can't win a mummy, he builds a robot and is very bad. We see Mr.Robot only in the last roll when he turns over, and fights against the Aztec mommy. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of bad Sci-Fi movies, the hell's most Sci-Fi Fi movies I see are bad, but this is the worst movie I've seen with Fubar for the whole 64 years second .... <br /> <br /> To sum up: Don't waste your time.
