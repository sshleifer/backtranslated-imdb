It was the biggest disappointment of the movie ... :( Sucks, cos I was really waiting for it. <br /> <br /> All the twists were crap. They were all setbacks !!! <br /> What makes good movie, job credibility Yes Yes, it must be surprising, so the audience is stunned, but when you walk and go, it is bulls! /> <br /> Besides, the main defendant was still a bag. who acted with this complete deceptive and brilliant potential. There was no good thing about this movie, they were all garbage, including this French idiot dance dance to get through the lasers ... it's easy to do it if they're later compiled! Plus that such a thing has already been done in at least one other movie .. and it was also foolish ... <br /> <br /> There is no reason to even have 12 or 11 HALFs in this movie! What's the difference between half that light and what really makes this movie come true? SCENES doesn't even have to be there! <br /> > The first was stylish. It was CHEAP! And it makes the whole team credible. Especially to capture the ocean itself Bennett.
