This is the worst movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, characters are unrealistic stereotypes that never see them as they believe. Are white people such monsters that they will continue to call two white children rapists in their 20's "good boys" and they must be persuaded that it can be a provocation? Do black people inspire in general? Does Ku Klux Klan really stand outside the courtrooms where lawyers are being fired, with no one interfering? Do the judges really think that a fair trial can happen when the jury hears the outside of the cell, shouting "Kill him"? Do black people really stand on the shoulder when Klan is waiting for the verdict? Do women really realize for several months that their husband can protect a man from unfair hanging because he knew he could have done the same? Do the jury really know people for murder because they feel sorry for them? Do lawyers really use peace of mind to persuade people that their client was temporarily insane? The worst thing is that all the sensible principles of this film completely lost their full exploitation and free use of sexual crime to listen to the audience. Was the subject of rape, not to mention the rape of a child's gang, really in the hands of the competent? Is this really a Hollywood subject? And if so, why is Sandra Bullock's totally free robbery and removal? And a totally pointless legal rape against a witness? It seems that the director did not notice the criminals at all. Shame on them.
