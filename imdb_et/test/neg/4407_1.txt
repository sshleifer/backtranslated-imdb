This is not a plot management, OK; it is not a characteristic study; no action, well; It makes no sense, hmmm ... <br /> <br /> Maybe it should represent the boredom and absurdity of living these days in Palistine and Israel, minor disagreements, deep-rooted hostility, and so on. But most of the time, this is a long, long scene where nothing happens - or things that look like they drip with meaning (a landing point tower, Arafat balloon floating in Jerusalem, a swarming tiger-female casting halo balls) but when you try to derive some meaning, there's nothing there. <br /> <br /> Bonus: You can watch this movie fast and it makes no difference, except that it may be a little less boring.
