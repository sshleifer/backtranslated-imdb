Except for the glossy look, this exhibition was a little recommended. Writing was patronizing and complicated. Without exceptions, the characters were low and atypical. The female characters were the worst ... reduced spoiled, selfish breaths whose purpose was to run in slippery clothing and stilettos, and try to bring the man out. This aspect of the show is even more curious because two women were brought to the series! Most of the action was boring and humorous, with the majority playing one-dimensional symbols that attacked all the same comments. It is not entirely the fault of the participants. If they had spent more time developing characters and stories, adding a little style and humor injection, the MVP might have been hit. What we have left is something flat and uncomfortable.
