As an example, it is shown that the Exhibition Attack (AOTS) is still a major decline in the G4 TV; it is an exhibition (and a station) that has fallen so far that parades have sex to cover their outstanding mistakes. Its predecessor, The Screen Savers, was a technology for troubleshooting problems and researching the latest and greatest technology. It was a nice show with nice staff and it was fun to see some moderation and other experiments that the team could put together. <br /> <br /> Acquisition of Tech4 by G4 disturbed some of the station's long-term fans, but the early return was actually promising. Emphasizing the game was a nice addition and I really enjoyed a lot of E3 and other great entertainment events. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, AOTS now stands as a former self-cover. Those who follow the channel have shifted the focus of the channel away from technology and games, and towards what might cause the fear of young adult men. The result is that AOTS spends as much time on Olivia Munn or on the adult film industry as it includes games. It is so bad that it is virtually invisible. <br /> <br /> While some may get joyful of such a thing, those who truly enjoy playing may ask where good coverage went. Equally worrying is that young players who can tune into the G4, considering that gaming is an active gaming group between the ages of 10 and 15, are fed on things that are directed towards a more mature audience. Such things are expected on a channel like HBO or Cinemax. The G4 is tragic. <br /> <br /> At least SpikeTV, another man-based channel, has good programming like CSI. AOTS and G4 are very little offered. <br /> <br /> Too bad, really.
