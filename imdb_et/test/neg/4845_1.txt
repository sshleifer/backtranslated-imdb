I wish I had read more reviews and more opinions about this movie before I rented it. Waste of money. Waste of time. Very small dialog. The dialogue was quite understandable. The story and the plots were both weak. The only thing that was nice at all was cinematography. <br /> <br /> Characters were interesting. At the same time, you spend so much time trying to figure things out due to a lack of dialogue to often turn around the movie. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. It was a mess and leaves you feeling like a mess. <br /> <br /> You say what the hell was that when the movie ended?
