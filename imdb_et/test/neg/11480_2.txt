It should be renamed "All Love Sebastian". A 1983 rural middle school younger (or older?), Which showed that the flop has this strange hair and "Leo-like" look good, is a big plate full of questions. His step-father announces certain plans for a sex change operation to which his mother's marriage ends; Sebastian call everyone and their mother "f" the word "everywhere" who "kisses" with different girls, getting a lot of readiness in the supermarket and storing the "strawberry" prostitute by his merciless clutches. <br /> <br /> Sebastian's "mates" turn Eddie Haskali out as a chorus boy; a bad connection will not get much worse. Sebastian seems to be going to a "Harold" record of suicide attempts (although he does not recognize the suicidal tendency). For no apparent reason, the evaluation of the genius SAT must be completed by Sebastian a year earlier, although he has no idea of ​​the future, nor does he want to attend college (which makes it meaningless?). <br /> <br /> The movie is a few weeks' appearance for someone who is PRETTY MESSED UP. The final scene indicates that things are fine, even though the HOW is completely left to the observer. <br /> <br /> The makers of this film seem to be the undeniably appealing appeal of the bank's very attractive male leadership. "Story" leaves much to be desired. Looking for "what does this gorgeous child do next ...?" does not match exactly. Lighter product values ​​don't just measure other movies that are independent or otherwise. A low budget and a weak story need more than a pretty face to carry it out. The "results" of this project are forgotten and offensive intelligent movie fans.
