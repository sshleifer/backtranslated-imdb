If I was still 5, it could be scary. This is (I think) a low budget movie. Operation is not good, but it can be worse - filming and special effects are terrible. The story is thin and it is not necessary to live. Too much time is used for boring scenes. Running or fighting with aliens reminds me of children fighting with scary masks. Some blood and body parts have scared a 5-year-old boy. Probably scare some of the people in the movie. <br /> <br /> This is far from being the Tremors movie. <br /> <br /> It turns out to be an "incident", and we see nearby ships on the ground. It makes you wonder if any of the others will continue ...
