This movie is stupid. It doesn't go around it. But so are Dumb and Dumber. Me, Dumb and Dumber are much more fun about it. But I love one love to see stupid movies (Tail Sting) and laugh at the good friends of the group, how bad it is. Call me nervous, but watch this movie and find that the only way to laugh at it is when you laugh instead.
