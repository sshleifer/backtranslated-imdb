The American boy goes to Paris after his mother commits suicide, changes and becomes an artist, and then discovers himself and returns to the countries so he can make things with his former friends. <br /> <br /> I have to think that people who appreciate this movie are all fans of X-Files, even though they don't have any aliens or serial numbers. Don't be fooled, this movie blows hunks. <br /> <br /> The story is inconsistent, little or no to explain what people do or why. If you get an explanation, it won't fit the story before. It's in your hand. It's not just interesting for all the talents in the movie. I spent the whole movie, thinking that if sex addict Duchovny is going to beat someone. Maybe he did it behind the scenes; they should have filmed instead. <br /> <br /> What is happening is the story of a self-contained artist who worries about his life for small incidents and wants to do it right - though they didn't seem to start wrong. There are no particularly interesting or shocking revelations, even though a great secret has been mentioned in the first few minutes. It's just a man who thinks his life is so interesting to you as he is. I didn't see Duchovny claiming that he wrote the script within a week, which is quite plausible. Man can act, no doubt, but writing and leadership are clearly beyond his talents. <br /> <br /> Why Hollywood keeps these self-defeating stories in me. I find myself in the shower every morning, but I'm not worried about making a movie. I would probably be better than that; at least there would be nudity.
