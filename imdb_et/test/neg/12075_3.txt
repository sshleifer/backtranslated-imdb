Wow, did this episode begin with the assumption of STOOOOOPID! The company chugging along when all of a sudden, Abraham Lincoln swims around the room and welcomes Enterprise !!!!!!! Is it just me or is it really a flat-murdered idea?! Lincoln comes on board and they greet them. Abe recommends that they throw themselves at some screaming planet where they meet other famous dead people - as good as evil. It seems that the really cheesy-looking rockmonster has brought together a team of good and bad people to fight for superiority. The whole thing really looks outrageous and inherently unfair, because the good side of Surak is exhausted - Vulcan, who makes Gandhi seems Rambo! Despite the fact that it is a completely astonishing assumption, it is pretty good and it is nice to see the airy shots of obvious doubles that fight it. But don't do it with high art or deep sci-fi. The bottom line is that the series was the first series on its last legs and it seemed like it was turkey dusted and filmed, regardless of the absurdity of the room.
