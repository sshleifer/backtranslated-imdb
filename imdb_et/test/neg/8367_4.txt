At least when you are a Disney fanatic (well, a variety who loves your live movies and animations), if you are a child, if you are a child from the heart almost so much that you hardly realize that you are an adult, if you love absolutely all movies, that characterize the animals, especially when they do tricks, or if you're just not too demanding, the Air Bud: World Pup is a bit enjoyable to watch. I'm a Disney fanatic. I enjoyed this movie enough and I look at it again with joy. <br /> <br /> But the boy does a lot. The main mistake is the combination of too many characters, too many plots of plot, and not enough time to take care of them all. In 82 minutes we have adults to marry, teenagers fall in love and try not to be uncomfortable, teenage contest against love and jealousy, preteens playing spy games, love dogs, dogs playing football, dogs with puppies, manipulating parents who do something kids win to have their children teach lessons, housekeeper dilemmas, and bake and develop complex plots. I probably forget something, but this is a 10 big plot issue that needs to be dealt with in less than 10 minutes with one thread to deal with them, and probably knit them into a single whole that's not too complicated - it's for kids After all - and it is also humorous and warm-hearted. Not surprisingly, the director Bill Bannerman, in his first turn, is entirely responsible (he has a lot of previous experience from another unit), it wasn't quite a task. I am sure that this did not contribute to the involvement of at least three scriptwriters and probably to dictators. <br /> <br /> The end result is that Air Bud: World Pup is extremely dirty. The events take place with little justification and worse, often with little explanation. People think and do things mainly because they need - and quickly - so that everything arrives where it has to reach in less than 90 minutes. It may be time to jump six months or more from one cut to another. We have both adults who seem to be mentally handicapped and children who simply think intuitively what the dog thinks and hurts some unexpected action. Some threads should have just been removed because it is too hard to participate in the movie, once you've introduced the idea, it's already gone. <br /> <br /> It is also not a fact that one of the yarns is in principle breaking one hundred one Dalmatians (1961), less the character of Cruella De Vil. And the other problem is that, given the way the movie was edited, I have to assume that the dog, Air Bud, probably couldn't do much with football. Unlike the first two films, the sports-playing dog is almost yet another, and when we see him, it is very quick to look at; each time it appears that these extracts are even helpful for computer animation. <br /> <br /> At the same time, like Buddy, Air Bud is a delight to World Pup. The scenario and performances are often ridiculous, between hokey and kinda clich√©d. I like this combination. This makes the film a bit predictable and convincing. And sometimes, as it ends, when the film completely abandons its continuity, and basically it becomes the venue for a US women's football team, the Air Bud: World Pup is so plainly sticky that you can't help but love it.
