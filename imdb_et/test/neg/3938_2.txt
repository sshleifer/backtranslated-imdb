Good idea .... shame with the real movie. Would you have liked it to be a little more scary and explain more about the characters and who exactly was the evil woman? If she tortures these children, why did they help her kill and not help others kill her? His little has come down in the middle of Malcolm. <br /> <br /> I think it would be helpful if it was a little longer and more detailed with characters, though after about an hour I was wondering when it would have ended !! <br /> <br /> It would have been better if the real characters who killed them were not computer-based, they made them beat. And what happened to Frankie Munitz? He fell into the bed of natural roses, so it should be safe, but the computer game showed him the game, ie dead. The next thing he seems to be is that an irritating blonde girl rescues a fire who I noticed he had no effect with a lighter flash when the demon lady was after her !! <br /> <br /> Too much controversy in this movie really enjoy it, but you may think twice about playing this new computer game !!
