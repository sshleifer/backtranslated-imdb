The evil never seemed so bad. They meant it. <br /> <br /> When my friend picked this DVD in a half-price bookstore, I didn't know what to expect. I think I knew from the title that it would be worth laughing, but I didn't know how ridiculous it really would be. if you could call it) because we were too busy when we were having fun on the film plot. It seemed to have been filmed in less than a week, and they had no budget to go back and fix some minor errors. Wait, did I say "little"? I was thinking exactly the opposite. The main character is, for example, "Ken", but several times he is called "John" throughout the film. <br /> <br /> If the plot holes are not fun enough for you, check out the procedure. Nobody seems to be too concerned about their country's zombie raids, including the mother of a key character who has disappeared in the days when she is sitting in front of a fireplace in front of a book. <br /> <br /> Budget constraints make the movie fun. Maybe they did not have the permission of the film, where they were, because while the BIG MOTORCYCLES WORK, the signs fulfill all traffic rules. The zombies that killed just twenty people actually stop at the stop sign coming out of the parking space. I don't even do that, but then I'm not a biker zombie. Ending the movie looks like they just ran out of money. It ends so suddenly that it leaves you more behind ... According to another thought, it just ends fast enough. This is a great involuntary comedy.
