After the NIGHT BLACK FALL turning point, Robert Montgomery (the most time) came to his best films and performances: HERE COMES MR. JORDAN, HAS BEEN USED, LADIK LAKES, MORE HAM, SAXON GROUP, JUNE BRIDE. Even some of the shortcomings he had were interesting enough to remain traceable (RAGE IN HEAVEN, MR. AND MRS. SMITH). But Montgomery wanted to do more and more work. In 1949 he performed his last film - he played the egoistic film star Collier Lang, who pulls the authorities to help the young girl's boy. this film is a minority view. Most of the views expressed are favorable. I thought it was a boring, pointless script where the heroine of the Ann Blyth group is not very characteristic. He admires Montgomery as a star, and "helps" when he is called to help the authorities, but after a while I found there were no chemistry between them. The script was also not fun, though Montgomery and Roland Winters tried. The only thing I remember today as a joke is that Taylor Holmes is Blyth's wealthy father and he is a fan of Winston Churchill. So she always dresses like Churchill, and we see her wearing a floppy-wide hat, smoking a big cig and painting (Holmes bald head hides). It was the most memorable joke in this movie - not a big real memory. Montgomery went to television early and eventually won the attention and respect he had always respected. His latest film exposure was his GALLANT HOURS direction from Admiral William "Bull" Halsey, who saw his friend Jimmy Cagney. This is a much better film. For my overall film and television career, I give this mediocre film "4". It strikes me as generous.
