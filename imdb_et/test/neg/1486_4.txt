The whole mid-term review was good. Given this minimal budget, cinematography was surprisingly good. We occasionally see good actors, but it is quickly emptied by pretty fun lines. It is understandable that there would not be much intellectual conversation while sitting on the trees, while the crocodile pursues you. Silence would be golden here. Maybe there was a bigger game than, to say the least, "I was sitting in the closet for fear of my brother ..." Something tells me that beating your brother is a bit different than the powerful 15s. . You decide. Throughout the film, I don't seem to connect or sympathize with the symbols, maybe just because they don't develop it in the whole movie, what that character is. There are sometimes some good fears when the crocodile pulls up the characters, again obscuring some questionable scenes. In one case, we should be frightened by the water-floating ear, but later we sit next to the split, limbit body, and worry only about the broken finger. Of course, the film is a roller-skate.
