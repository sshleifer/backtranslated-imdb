Stone has tried another type of film. Each given Sunday falls below the average of the last ladybird and below the average of all odds. The stone can be fantastic, see The Doors, Natural Born Killers, or Plato, but he can also repeat himself on Nixon or his fourth born July. His real shine is realized in the fullness of Michael Caine, The Hand.
