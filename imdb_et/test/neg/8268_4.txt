You just have to see it as a poorly enforceable abortion propaganda and you understand how bad it really is. The main message of this movie is that even sick people can't make an abortion. If you ask, it is not far from the blow-off of abortion clinics. So this man wants to kill some poor girl, but he has to convince him to do an abortion before. What is the burden of nonsense. And the worst part is that he has a convincing argument (bringing the child into an unattractive environment), but it should be fired because he is a freak anyway. And the part where the Bible pusher ... first throws this girl out just because she explains that someone stole her money (this rule must be somehow in the Bible) and eventually they're an angel like the deus ex machina killer evil, harassing him in his front yard. Come on. Other points are a very confusing scenario (and I don't understand it in a good way) ... so this guy is just a psycho, why? Because his mother fed the liver once? And I don't know about others, but he seemed the most pleasant person in the world! although she was wearing girli clothes, stole money and killed girls in her car. If you forget the story of the idiots, this film has a very large cinematic art, and Bob Hoskins was really great and he has one of those funny little English cars. If this were actually for some psycho-killer, I'd give it to at least 7.
