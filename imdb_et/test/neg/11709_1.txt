This movie was added to the six women of the Henry VIII BBC Mini Series DVD. I loved these six movies. They were well-functioning, well-written and historically accurate. I actually read Gregory's book and liked it well enough, despite being a huge historical inaccuracy (I mean the whole fake homosexual corner especially with George Boleyn), but that movie didn't even mention it. This angle was one of the main points of the book. <br /> <br /> In particular, it asks me to "WHY?" Why do we see how someone else skillfully put "Real World: Tudor England"? Why are camera corners generally so bad? <br /> <br /> Why is the script so bad? I know I know it was better, but come on! The actors are terrible and occasionally hit their rows and it is obvious that they do them the way they go. <br /> <br /> Why are sex scenes so inconvenient? The way they were done in the book made them at least somewhat interesting. In the film, they're just bad, completely fun. At one point, Mary Boleyn was an actor with sex with Henry VIII players. He pulls it off and has this face on his face, saying, "Hm .... I have to go to the store. Has he done it yet? Maybe when he finishes, I can get the cheese really fast ..." just bad . <br /> <br /> Why is Aragon's Catherine's role in this film so small? His refusal to divorce was one of the main causes of Christianity. He's the reason why Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn couldn't get married right away. Why isn't he here? All this, this movie is just bad.
