The filmmakers probably had enough money to allow proper make-up effects, but not enough for the creature to move and attack convincingly. We will never be able to see the "monster" move from one place to another - if it happens (supposedly), the camera will focus on the "frightened" reactions of close people. And when a man attacks it, he just seems to have kept the inanimate objects against him so that it doesn't fall on the ground. It is still not the worst "alien" burst (two "Xtro" movies are even worse); it is actually fun enough if you have 68 minutes to save. (* 1/2)
