I have vague memories of this movie that is funny. <br /> <br /> Having seen it again, I've changed or thought about another movie. <br /> <br /> It seems that we should be compassionate about Jackie Mason's character, but nothing in the film really makes this emotion. It is remarkable that he is really the only person who has been offered a dialogue with loved ones. No one else can even rise indefinitely to human status. <br /> <br /> I don't even like golf, but when the movie went, I really found the roots of Robart Stack and the club boys. , really hoping they will repel Mason and Chevy Chase.
