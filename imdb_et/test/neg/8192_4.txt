It's schmaltzy, but what else to expect? The heroine is the younger sister of Cinderella, full of evil mother, sister and brother; hero (if you can name it) is an ineffective putz; and rival loving interests are full of melodramatic grass. <br /> <br /> Cast, settings, and wardrobe were all very attractive, and I thought the actors did a great job considering the weak material. The film was filmed beautifully and praised for the sound that was carefully designed to let the viewer see what emotions he should have. Megon McDonough sang sweetly and gave the film some of the best moments. <br /> <br /> If you love Danielle Steel, you love this movie. If you love archetypal romance, you love this movie. I didn't. I could sit through it but it was close.
