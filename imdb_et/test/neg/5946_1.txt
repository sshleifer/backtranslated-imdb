People! is a "comedy" about a man whose parents are asking him to kill him because they go out and want to get out of their misery. Many times he tries to kill them and then change his mind, saving the last minutes of his death-traps and losing his body parts every time. The film seems to be angry with its main character, which makes it even more painful. There is also a common beloved interest and a predictable end. <br /> <br /> This movie was also the first time Tom Selleck saw a mustache, and I remember his shaved upper lip that looks strange and makes me feel a little slippery. But it could have been just because of the terrible assumption and the flat performance of the film.
