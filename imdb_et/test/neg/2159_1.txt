Yes, my summary says it almost everyone. <br /> <br /> If you haven't watched it, try it. But not joy. One of the worst examples of trying to be politically correct, family and "cool" at the same time. <br /> <br /> Men always think they know everything, are stupid and ultimately lose great women. Etc. It is particularly offensive when all characters are just as terrible and stereotypical. I mean, ok, "Cody" was one or the other funny, but unlike other "fools (tm)" like Woody Cheers or Joey's friends, he doesn't get good features. His stupidity is poured in the "dude" way, which after a while becomes quite annoying. <br /> <br /> Family morals are terrible. All for the family. Mother and Dad are the highest dictators who have consistently said between the heavy punishment and the old-fashioned parents that they love their children, and eventually the children will love them back * barf *. <br /> <br /> And: There's always a "gentle on-the-spot" squeezed into "action" where American (c) (tm) morale is forced to viewers, sex (mature, you can't have sex before you're 18 (!!)! !), some tea) or drugs. Even the habits of the church are described in detail here. The whole concept is directly ill, everything is done as a heartfelt way to make money. If there are people like Karen and Frank, lock them up and disintegrate the key. my theme ...
