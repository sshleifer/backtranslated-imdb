It's unique in the Hitchcock movies I've seen since I didn't really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> In fact, I found it quite predictable and annoying. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine are newly married couple. She is a kind of "lovable rogue" that you have seen in many movies without ever being pleasing to me. <br /> <br /> In fact, at best, it was hardly a plausible relationship, and sometimes it seemed particularly wrong and unreliable. <br /> <br /> If Grant can't keep the job and try to live the ultimate lifestyle, Grant borrows money he can't repay. <br /> <br /> Fontaine is convinced that she is trying to kill her to get her money; and probably what his late father was worth. <br /> <br /> Medium and quite uninteresting all around, but as usual, you will see the effects of movies that have come later.
