I got this movie a couple of years ago one night and it was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. But since it should be an action movie, I can't celebrate it anymore because humor was involuntary. Chuck Norris plays a truck driver who comes from his home to see his family, and in the first five minutes there will be a conflict leading Chuck to retaliation for the rest of the movie. It is also good if the sub-parameters of all the participants started to grow very fast. In fact, the judge was pretty good, but I can't really describe what makes him work. You have to check it yourself. <br /> <br /> And the custom van Chuck Norris drives are amazingly classic!
