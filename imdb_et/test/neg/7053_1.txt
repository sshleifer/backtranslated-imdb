This film should end as soon as the Bebe children joke was opened. I liked Robin Harris and most of his comedy, but the really funny routine wasn't meant to make the whole family see. Like Jerry Seinfeld's joke and trying to joke as long as possible, to make it a movie. This movie was supposed to be self-serving because I can't find anyone who found the settings or familiar. The most cinematic of this film is the use of writers and producers to value it. 1/10 stars because there are no half stars.
