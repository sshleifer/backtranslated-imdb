Obviously, the newly cut episodes of Gangbusters TV show on the big screen. Although this was often done in the '50s and' 60s because people did not have a television or color television, and manufacturers wanted higher returns on their investments (big ticket sales or when it went to a small screen reseller that is not in syndication), the results were usually smaller than their shares amount. The only time I ever saw it was where I put together multiplayer tracks (Ala Rocky Jones or Man From Uncle) or horror anthology (Veil and 13 Demon Street). Here's the effect that in the 20s and 30s (Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, Bonnie, and Clyde, etc.) the story of American criminals comes into contact when the narrator tells them how the FBI shot them. This is a strange finish that doesn't work quite well, because it's obvious that there are things that don't belong together. More than once I watched the TV strangely, because things didn't look right. In honesty, I do not describe the cheapness of production because it was what the early television (and series) was. He's not bad, but it's not very good either. To be completely honest, the episodes of this series I've seen have worked better for one episode where we don't expect so much. Considering the choice I would like to rent a DVD instead of this movie.
