NBC had the opportunity to make a powerful religious epic "Ten Commandments" and "The Biggest Story Ever Said", and instead decided to make some semi-voiced copies that were more like "Waterworld" than anything else. I do not remember the Bible passage where Lot becomes a pirate and attacks a ship, nor does it remember where Noah's son develops a serious relationship with orange and does not remember that Noah is a crazy old man who suddenly behaves as he drives a navy and runs around, calling at sea conditions such as "lift height!" This was probably the worst marketing decision in history. Obviously, most people who watch it are parents of Jews and Christians with their children, so why make the film offensive to these people? If they deliberately tried to offend, why not advertise it and at least reel the right public? I hope they will make a real Noah's movie one day, one seriously and thoughtfully, one that really likes people and makes money. So far, don't waste your time with this trash.
