This movie is a disaster from start to finish. 75 percent of the film is made from the scenes from HERCULES & HAUNTED WORLD and HERCULES & CAPTIVE WOMEN, which have been hardly modified with original scenes that add nothing but a full rip-off. I am a big fan of these two films and I see scenes taken from them, edited and renamed with a meaningless dialogue on my head. Such cheap producer tactics that give more money to unsuspecting audiences mainly killed Sword & Sandal in the 1960s. with bad Hercules. The fight is cool and Giovanni Cianfriglia, who plays Antaius, is definitely in the eye. She makes a memorable noble Hercule. But the rest is a finite embarrassment that was likely to have hit during the day. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs!
