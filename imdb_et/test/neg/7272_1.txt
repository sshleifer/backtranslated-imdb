Finally, I can connect points between Jedi Return and Phantom Menace. We see here where Lucas lost the connection that made the original Star Wars movie big and began to descend into a plot that was less stunted to destroy episodes 1-3. This film is rather one of those cheesy films of 80-year-old swords and witches, something that is worth the Star Wars saga. Like the Jar-Jar, it seems to be aimed at children (and the toy market). Battle scenes are especially bad. It was frustrating to see Sian Phillips' incredible talent for such waste, after his classic performance I, Claudius.
