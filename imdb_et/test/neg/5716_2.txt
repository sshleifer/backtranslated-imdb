You know that this film is a tough one when BEST's work is a supporting role for Arnold Schwarzenegger. Although it was still relatively early in his career and was not the best actor compared to Brigitte Nielsen, he is Sir John Gielgud. In fact, this film proves that the only reason he paid much attention was his chest and because he was associated with the incredibly self-destructive football player Mark Gastineau. So, instead of being his "break movie", this and the Beverly Hills Cop movie mark are about as high as he did during a one-time career. It was also obvious that the funding wizards also gave up on this film because the supporting cast (other than Arnold) is pretty flat and the script is boring, boring, boring. Fans looking for another CONAN movie are undoubtedly very disappointed in this slow and enthralling film.
