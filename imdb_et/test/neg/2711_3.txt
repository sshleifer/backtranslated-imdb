********** POSSIBLE SPOILER ********** Madonna plays ex-con, which must restore valuable information that can make her aware of the murder. years ago. Griffin Dunne is a tax advisor who marries his boss. They have to come together in a world where chaos keeps you from getting on the bus ... <br /> <br /> When you get to it, it's a stupid movie. Without trying to give up the plot **** POSSIBLE SPOILER ****, the bad guys in the movie are trying to protect their boss by obtaining information that would blame them for the murder that Madonna was sent for. What bad guys don't kill, trying to hide the original murder?!?!?! <br /> <br /> Then there are police officers left behind by Madonna who follow the bad guys in the limousines, where they let all the bride-servants shut! Let us not forget those same bride-servants who fought from the front gate to the front door, but all were involved! And I hate to say this, but this patagonous cat looks like a cougar! There may be only four of them in the New York area, so they may be in danger, but I know there are a lot of them in the Rocky Mountains (see "Charlie Lonesome Cougar" if you really want to see a big "cat") in the movie. And look at the old man who sleeps on his feet ... NAW! <br /> <br /> The plot is there, but that's all this movie. I was barely my teenager when this movie originally came out and I was a Madonna fan, but that was the only reason I liked the movie, but since then she has dropped out of my popularity and I am facing the fact that she is just a terrible actor (the good thing that he keeps this song career back). It then rated "5", but it fell "barely 2" over the years.
