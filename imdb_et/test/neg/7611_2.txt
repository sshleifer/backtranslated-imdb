I haven't reviewed IMDb before, but this documentary is so overrated that I felt forced to ventilate. I wouldn't even look at if I had been a guest with someone. The film was bad on many levels: the first - Treadwell video was created. The more I looked, the more he seemed to be the person who was desperate to be famous instead of acting on conviction. <br /> <br /> The second - the others in the movie, except Treadwell's parents and the airline pilot, were just as fun and funny as he was. God, they seemed artificial. <br /> <br /> Third, Treadwell's mission to protect bears doesn't even make sense, because it did more harm than good, making bears unfamiliar with the presence of people. I believe Treadwell really loved bears, but there are many studies showing that his efforts were wrong. Sometimes we have to sacrifice our wildlife to really help. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the movie's entertainment value was not half of other natural movies, such as "Penguin March" and "Winged Migration". In my opinion, filmmakers did a poor job of sequencing and gave little incentive to continue watching. <br /> <br /> Like Alaska, a bear and other wildlife lover, I would like to see more people dedicated to preserving our forest land. Hopefully their efforts are less focused on people.
