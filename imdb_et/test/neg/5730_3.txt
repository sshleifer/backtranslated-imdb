Red Sonja is the extra-curricular direction of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Having made a few swords of "n" witchcraft (such as Conan), he had moved somewhat more serious acting roles in films such as "Terminator" and "Commando" to perform in 1985. It's hard to figure out why he's struggling because it's weaker than both Conan movies in every conceivable department. Supposedly, this was the third film of Conan, but for one reason or another, the emphasis was placed on the leading female character, the redhead, leaving the poor old Arnold playing an incredibly dull supporting role. Also take a mindset for Director Richard Fleischer, who had given the world classics like 20,000 leagues under the sea, a fantastic trip, the Boston Strangler and the 10th Rillington place. In this - in his penultimate film - Fleischer has also taken a huge career upside down. <br /> <br /> Evil Queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergman) wants to rule the world and she needs this priceless and powerful talisman. He and his brutal army rush to steal the stolen and stolen talisman of the priests by depressing the helpless priests as they go. One of the dead priests is a sister named Sonja (Brigitte Nielsen), a warrior with a fiery red head, who swears revenge on evil Gedren when his sister dies. Sonja travels across the land looking for Gedren's nest. Along his way, he drives his companions in the form of a boy's prince, Ernie Reyes Jr. and his bodyguard Falkon (Paul Smith). He also meets a muscle soldier with Conan - sorry, I mean Kalidor (!) - who offers him in his quest. Originally, Sonja Kalidor does not want to help (Arnold Schwarzenegger), preferring to prove that she can resist and defeat her enemies alone, but eventually she warms her up and agrees with her help. <br /> <br /> The Red Sonja is an amazingly bad movie, more than a blemish that was made in 1985, when the sword 'n' witch genre was near its end. It seems so easy and amateur that it can be easily flawed in the early example. The performances are generally bad, ranging from Bergman's embarrassment to OTT's horrible up to Reyes' incredibly irritating bratine Schwarzenegger's wood and the uniquely heroic hero. Nielsen is somewhat better than the heroine - probably full of enthusiasm for the idea that he is in his first star - but the foolishness of the Clive Exton and George MacDonald Fraser script is that he is very ill. The film is looted with goofs, including a scene where Schwarzenegger's sight is in the form of hacking bad boys, but there is no visible body in long queues. Technically, it also has inaccurate special effects and terribly mechanical monsters. There are some benefits like Ennio Morricone's enjoyable music (Morricone spent much of the 80s offering great music for terrible movies like the island, four crowns and Hundra). Another benefit is the placement of Giuseppe Rotunno lenses - in fact, much of the time is much more hell-like to look at the beautiful landscape than the actors in the foreground! After the Red Sonja, there were very few swords 'n' witchcraft, so in some ways it may fall into history as a film that destroyed its genre.
