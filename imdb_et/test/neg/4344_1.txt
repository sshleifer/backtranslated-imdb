Normally, I wouldn't even have tended to look at such a trash, but since the role play is an expensive hobby for me and it was a movie theme, I did. It was garbage in so many ways that I didn't know where to start. I'd rather sit through the marathon "Space Plan 9" when I look at another one minute of vomiting. At least plan 9 was not on the agenda. How the media could capitulate and irresponsibly represent an extreme agenda because it is next to me. It is a frightening time for a whole group of people to be unaware of the truth and the facts. I know this comment was more social, but it couldn't help because this film asked. Imagine an out-of-the-box film that is strictly reviewed for the merits of the film. It won't happen. Because this film is, the people who made this film are the fascists themselves and should perhaps move into communist enclaves where propaganda is allowed.
