This movie is terrible, I'm SORRY. I bought it to get Star Worms, and I expected it to be better after I was disappointed with Star Worms. Oh, just joking, it turns out it's the worst movie I've ever seen. Action is garbage, not that it is really there, and the main character is a big stupid box attacked by similar, things or something. I can't really say. The special effects are so bad that you don't even see warring dinosaurs, which by the way do not war, but stand and move your mouth, or whatever these things are. The film is a headache. It is very clear that the director is trying to create a universe. Hahahahahahahahaha ... This movie is really terrible, even according to Troma standards. The only good thing I can say is that he got Lloyd Kaufman's intro because he again looks at something that is not suitable for consumption.
