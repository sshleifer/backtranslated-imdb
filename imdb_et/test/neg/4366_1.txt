Killjoy is a fantastic song that tells how clowns are really nice and fun, but Killjoy is a killer. I can't remember the song in the first movie, but when singer Olimpia Fernandez sings "Killjoy, yeah Killjoy 2", it sounds like 2 can be added to this terrible stage. The film is much worse than the first film and it was really bad. This time, which is usually great Debbie Rochon, who gave up the event and director Tammi Sutton, does not create tension and is just a dull and lasting film. The images of the full moon gave it in the "Urban" phase, none of which was very good, but none as bad as here.
