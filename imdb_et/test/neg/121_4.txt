Isaac Florentine has made some of the best Western martial arts feature films. In particular, the United States seals 2, cold harvest, special forces, and undeniable 2 all action classics. You can say that Isaac is a true passion for the genre, and his films are always eventful, creative and sharp. He has especially found a museum with Scott Adkins, as a talented actor and performer, as you might expect. This is also confirmed by the special power and unquestionable 2, but unfortunately the shepherd does not simply live up to his abilities. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that JCVD ​​sees a better fight here than he has done for years, especially in the fight he has (pretty much no reason) in the prison chamber, and in the final showdown with Scott, but look at him in the eyes. JCVD seems dead. There's nothing in her eyes. It's like he just doesn't care anything about the whole movie. And this is the leading person. <br /> <br /> There are other aspects of the villains in the film, script and visual side, but the main problem is that you can't fully understand the movie hero. True shame, as I know, we all wanted this film to be as special as it could have been. There are some good bits, mostly activities. This film was a fantastic director and action choreographer and awesome opponent with JCVD ​​face down. This could have been the one that brought the star of veteran activities from scratch into the stakes of ball game films. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, it didn't happen.
