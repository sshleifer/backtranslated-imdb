I don't go into detail why this film deserves a terrible rating, many other people have already done it. Suffice it to say that more than 400 of the movies on DVD are ONLY the one I got rid of - it was so worthless that I never saw that he'd still watch it. br /> <br /> But I have a comment on a ridiculously high average rating of 2.9 (from 3-15-06). Looking through 4 pages of reviews I didn't see a rating of over 3 stars. Looking at the voting history, 78% of users rated the movie with four stars or less. It seems to me that some people fill in the ballot box to keep it out of the "bottom 100" list of IMDb. It would be interesting to see how many of the 30 users who rated this movie as 10 stars are not real active users. None of them have written movie reviews. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled, this movie is not worth your time.
