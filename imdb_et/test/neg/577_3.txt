I have to be honest, I like romantic comedy, but that wasn't what I was hoping for. I thought Ellen Degeneres had the biggest part that should have been because I didn't like two fighting bed partners. It was terrible. Poor Tom Selleck! He had to act with someone who was so much in the picture if he had to have him and Ellen in most of the movies. They were the only believers. And the only funny parts were played by them, not Kate Capshawit and the man of Everett. <br /> <br /> I'm just glad I saw it on the cable and I didn't pay it for rent.
