I invite you to watch this movie and deny the above statement. This means that if you can't look at your virtually flawless face. He also makes a little fight and a bit of shooting, but not as much as I was hoping for. The film is very slow moving and low in budget, though at least they tried to apologize for the fact that the spacecraft is so little populated; almost the whole team is "paused in animation" and the ship is moving in the car pilot! And the heroine does not save any of them and does not support anything "at home"; It seems that the evil lady to pass through space was the only part of her mission that could not be filled more easily with missiles that finally burst the ship. There are also long but rather annoying soft core scenes and a few "alien" attacks that kill about 2 people. * 1/2 of 4.
