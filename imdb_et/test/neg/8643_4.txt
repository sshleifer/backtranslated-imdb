I rented this movie because I also noticed a video rental store. I saw Nolte, Connely, Madsen, 40s and thought "hmm, can't be too bad." Unfortunately, my impression was that I was "not too good". <br /> <br /> His kind of Chinatown ripoff, but the worst part is except for Nolte, the other team members didn't get enough time. But it's a decent movie to see if I think. And Melanie's role was small enough not to be distracted.
