I really love horror films and I try to give anyone I see so much credit (or sometimes more) than I can, but it really pushes the ticket ... most of the casts were very similar, but hardly anyone could act at all - but think again this confusing writing / dialogue ... some good make-up but totally ridiculous special fx. All in all I give it to 3 out of 10 - and I have another idea !!
