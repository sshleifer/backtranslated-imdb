I've seen quite a few bad movies in my days, many of them are Mike, Tom, Crow and other MST3k companies. That was the case, and even though I found the movie quite funny, it wouldn't have been as fun as MST3k wouldn't comment. <br /> <br /> Film is a great example of really bad films coming out of Europe in the eighties. Terrible music, terrible action, terrible plot (which is little), terrible dialogue and really, really, really, terrible editing. Cripes. <br /> <br /> This can be called turkey if it wasn't that it was in no way unique. It's a pretty much the same movie that almost every Italian director rubs out. <br /> <br /> So, try the MST3k version. It's a pretty fun episode with Mike and the gang in a pretty good shape.
