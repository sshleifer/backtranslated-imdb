This film is absurd. Absolutely terrible. Michael Keaton and Andy Garcia really have to do this movie. The plot is not completely credible! Michael Keaton agrees to donate a bone marrow detective to a dying son, but then flees. He can get the police out of the hospital - he doesn't think he has so much knowledge about the hospital. It takes a very difficult path to get out of the hospital, blowing power generators and a pedestrian bridge (why?). And from above, Andy Garcia (the dead boy's father) and the doctor help criminals get bone marrow. The plot is like that. Maybe the inferior movie I've ever seen.
