This, in itself, confusing b + w "film" looks like a child in a very bad acid journey. It is something that reminds you of a rotten piece of lettuce that was accidentally dropped from the back of a garbage truck: no one cares about touching it, as it is likely to be washed alone in the storm drain. There is no space on the plot if you have a "visceral picture" and "subtle" allegory. It seems to me that the director tries to do the next great artistic life while begging for intellectual respect. I didn't bring my beret. Looking at it, I felt almost offended because "film" does such an effective job of distanceing you.
