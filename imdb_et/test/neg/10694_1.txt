This movie is bad. Not so bad that it's good. Just bad. However, it is a lot of fun. I watched it from some curious curiosity and never intended to watch it or any other Chuck Norris movie. If you have to choose between this movie and death, you should choose this movie joyfully as it is a master class in terrible movies (so fun). <br /> <br /> This is a constant depression when I grind to work at my desk, that some people participate in filmmaking and decided to produce such things. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10. Better than "Starship Troopers" But.
