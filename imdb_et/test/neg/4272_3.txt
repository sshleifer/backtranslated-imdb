I always try not to be harsh, criticizing something that I didn't like, but after watching this small series, I was so disappointed that I couldn't help my irritation. On the one hand, it is true that the series remained true to the novel and, of course, I found it very nice, but on the other hand terrible casting, bad action, especially on key characters? like a funny price, an impression of a playful game, I mean a theatrical way of action that irritates me from start to finish. I am sure that something much better and more valuable could have been done with this budget, even if it was low. watching this series is up to you, but personally I don't recommend that you spend your time with this disappointing screening.
