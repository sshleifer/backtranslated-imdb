Seriously, this movie is not. Steve Guttenburg is constantly pushing his hard dialogue and giving everyone an evil eye all the time. She was simply untrustworthy, it seems she is trying to be bad and she sucks it. I just remember her as a millionaire father with Olsen twins. It's two ... so it's a big change. I rented this movie to Sean Bean and dies (as usual). Only this time he did not get to the anchor of the ship (Patriot Games), which was broken by a giant satellite dish (Goldeneye) and did not cross the cows (Field). He just got a hit, a real quick and civilian life, and that's all I got from this movie that they didn't kill him in a very grotesque and illness. How sad is that? I only looked at it for 3 seconds when Sean was in it, and then the rest was garbage. I was actually trying to see and understand the plot, but there was really no one there. It seems a little like mission Impossible with a hole, "Oooooo! There's a mole! It's a group leader and NO ONE WAITED IT! Let's trap him! Let's frame the underside of a good guy so we can get it off!" This movie was tired and tired.
