Certain filmmakers cannot do anything wrong with national critics, which is one reason why you should never pay attention to them. This movie is a great example. Critics like director Eric Rohmer. <br /> <br /> This movie is a boring soap opera for a woman and a teenager ("Pauline") who takes care of it in the summer and the relationships they have with some men. It's talk, talk, talk and talk more. <br /> <br /> For those who look at the cover and read that they are titled, a couple of quick nude shots and a couple of swearing words will be, but otherwise it's a harmless French moral game. One of my friends lent me this tape. He thought he was getting a sexy French movie and was disappointed. I was just as disappointed as it was so boring. <br /> <br /> How such great comments can be almost incomprehensible.
