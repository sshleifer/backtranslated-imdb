I'm not really sure why people are so free about this strange movie. Having said that, I sat down for 2 hours and couldn't say it wasn't all that fun. <br /> <br /> I think the main problem is that Frank Marshall is not a real director and it is clear in the movie - he is an experienced manufacturer so he has seen a movie that has been made several times and understands what is happening in the process. But I think it is completely different from the ability to really control the film - the direction was competent, but somehow flat and less in the direction. Marshall has more experience as a unit or other leader, and it seemed to be in the final product - it seemed to be a set of groups that couldn't really feel any consistency or character. <br /> <br /> Fun, observable, but good? No.
