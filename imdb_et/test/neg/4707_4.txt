I just stop waiting for Goliath, which I ordered from my library. I remembered it for years and wanted to watch it with my son. Anyway, the time of the movie was less than 2 hours and I thought it was much longer than I first saw. The back of the VHS box indicates that Goliath "imitates a native file whose secrets can destroy the free world forever." The divers were supposedly a hidden mission to get a demonic document. Nothing was said about downloading this document. The box also tells us that "an insatiable boiler in a creative vessel feeds human blood." It would make it a horror film and it didn't show anything in the movie either. I don't remember those details when I watched this TV a year ago, but is the back of this box really true? Maybe the 3-hour movie showed more details ?? <br /> <br /> Just wondering if anyone knows about it.
