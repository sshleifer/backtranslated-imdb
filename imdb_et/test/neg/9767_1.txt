This movie wasn't good at all. I was caught at the film festival and didn't appreciate the content I was forced to watch. This is a well-filmed family that wants to rejoin the family after the death of the family cornerstone (Gabrielle Union). The film is marked by Billy Dee Williams Gabrielle Union Brother. In fact, Gabrielle Union was a woman in her early years, which should help explain why she was Billy Dee Williams's older sister. It must have been the worst result of Billy Dee's career in William. He saw that he didn't remember his lines with a scene. He was unlikely, barely ever, an empathic character who was a father's daughter when he was married to a white woman with whom he had a daughter. The two daughters are now older and when the daughter she was with a white woman (Lucy) tried to contact her, her second daughter didn't want to do anything to her. Billy Dee's character was so pathetic that the only way they started to fly to Paris for their sister's funeral was to tell her that the funeral had already passed and her late sister left her for her paperwork. Why did they have to fool him? Because he didn't like the funeral. I know. You ask, "but did he not want to attend his sister's funeral?" Yes! He says he didn't like being forced to feel the feelings that are shared among those who pay tribute. He didn't want to do anything about it. Now we assume we can sense this ** hole? The rest of the film's performances were smooth and even. The director and editor were not interested in boosting the film. The feedback was painful to look at. It was a bad movie. However, it seems like a black film festival favorite; a film that respects African-American dependence on Caucasians to find the love they can calm down, even if it is a healthy relationship. If this flat love story, like black at film festivals, is the best, it will question me about the black people's assessment of the film. In these same festivals, the only films that have won awards are the educational films Afro-American culture and black films, led by Caucasian directors. I'm not saying that a white person who controls stories for colored people is something wrong. The problem with these films is that they never dispute both views, which are usually films that actually speak to the masses. These films are often one-sided forms of didactics. These films cannot fulfill the power of both sides to argue that the film has been reversed. Writers and leaders never write scenes and sequences that contradict your final statement with as much truth and energy as those that strengthen it. These films always point to an argument. I say whether those people attending the black film festivals appreciate the film's pure content, which for me means management, acting, writing cinematography, editing, etc., or do they value films strictly on the message that is being transmitted about African-American culture? Do we expect a movie like Constellation to hit the world with films like "Million Dollar Baby" and "Sideways?" What happened to movie entertainment? When I think of entertainment, I think of a ritual sitting in the dark, looking at the screen, investing in tremendous concentration and energy in what is hoped for by a satisfying and meaningful emotional experience. Why can't these festivals evaluate movies that receive messages without preaching? Why can't these black film festivals recognize films that are well-talked about honestly truthful works? "I believe that we have no obligation to cure social disturbances or to renew faith in humanity, to raise the spirit of society, or even to express our inner nature. We have only one responsibility: to tell the truth." - Robert McKee. Now I totally agree with it. These same black film festivals put "Hustle and Flo" as if this terrible stereotypical black film. But this is an honest movie with a dream pimp. Pimp Can't Dream? I remember the last time I saw a real pimp. And are these blinds and prostitutes in our society generally a tough reality, not only in the black community, but also in the whole? The powers that are "in black Hollywood" believe that such films make African-Americans bad for others, as if others do not know that the hood is dark. The truth is that as long as the Afro-Americans in the film can accept the truth about themselves and dare to share it with the world, our films never have a chance in the world. This movie was terrible. The best was cinematography and Zoe.
