Enchanted April was one of Harry Beaumont's latest films - he only managed a few afterwards. He had made "Maisie" films in the 1930s and 1940s. He says open credit: "Elizabeth's novel" and leaves the author's full name ... quite strange, but since it was von Armin, they may not want a German connection at this time ... Sad to hear it was a flop when it appeared with those funny names like Frank Morgan (Wizard) and Jessie Ralph, who played the Toilet Fields "Disagree with Motherhood" Bank Dick. Two London gals (Ann Harding & Katharine Alexander) decide to rent a castle to host two of their friends, but things don't go the way they planned. Reginald Owen plays man with several people. In addition to some funny moments, it moves rather slowly. Ralph is the only bright spot because it is an overwhelming key form and the picture is quite blurry and focused on a large part of the movie. Italian views are all obvious backgrounds. The only sustainable arm is here that Turner's classic version is only 66 minutes long. Too bad they didn't give Frank Morgan a bigger role. The BBC changed it in 1992 as a British film.
