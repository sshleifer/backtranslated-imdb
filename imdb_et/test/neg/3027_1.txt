Certainly someone's originality test has been born, but here's the art in its most poisonous, grotesque form, so my respect has been born for it, but it's not something that is abominable to make it realistic, but for record ... <br /> <br /> In the ultimate inconsistent horror, we start with an unknown time, in an unknown place. Immediately after the bats, we got into a psychotic nightmare that was born, God is, seemingly depressed, looting himself with a razor, I mean, really trying to stop it all, it takes time (why not After this ultra-morbid introduction, something happens, something that rises from the body, say hello to Earth, what does it do? Well, he's gonna do that. That thing would probably have preferred to stay in the womb, but that's life. Begotten psychotic nightmare welcomes the only way he knows it. Earth, spoiled by unknown, hoods, by attackers, with evil intentions being the only clarity, from that point on, as they have never dragged in before. Interesting, gloomy images with a perfectly sound track, are the high points of the rest. that I do not recommend this evil because I do, but only once, and only to people who recognize the blind. <br /> <br /> From my description, it may seem like I'm not going to go. Trust me, I get this and yes, the art is born when I've ever seen it. Everything in this movie, no matter how it is related, is important. This is perhaps the only thing that makes Begotten art. That said, most of us need some entertaining value and it comes from someone who enjoyed Chooper. Probably the most interesting first five minutes I see in the movie, but let's be realistic, in the next 7 hours and 55 minutes, we would put one coma, that is, if it's not meant for some psychedelic purpose, then don't forget. But how would such a unique boring masterpiece be? Depending on how much attention you can take, it should be either 1 or 10, no other number would make a statement. It's hurt to do this, but Begotten is not just about entertainment value. 1/1
