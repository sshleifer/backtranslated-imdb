Almost a master class on how to not manage a movie. From an incorrectly rated, often incomprehensible manuscript, Dr. Rey makes many bad decisions that make the film an amazing viewing experience. Unfortunately, the film never goes beyond the old-fashioned, almost miscommunist gay camp, where women are burned, OTT and middle-aged, and men are young, empty and forever sex. The director could not bear the tone of the film or the level of performances. <br /> <br /> There will certainly be a lot of "action". Dianne Wiest slides into her Bullets Over Broadway performance and the poor old Jane Birkins are trying to give the comic. Although you have to get him harmed, because there is very little real comedy here. The whole thing seems like a very low rental version of Merchant Ivory Le Divorce, which, frankly, wasn't very good.
