We waited to see a good girl, a good movie starring Jennifer Aniston, when some women came out with this cheap twenty dollar bill ad MANNA FROM HEAVEN. "Come see this movie!" he said. "You love it!" <br /> <br /> He then introduced the film to the director. Now it should have been our first clue. I mean, how many movie situations does the film director stand out in the lobby, asking people to see it? "Is this a Christian film?" I asked not really caring in one way or another. I love Jesus. There is no shame in this. "No!" he said defensively. What a load is nonsense. <br /> <br /> This movie is BAD. So bad. And this is not only because of the obvious Christian agenda, but also because of the terrible dialogue that works alternately between wood and over-sighting, and the obvious lack of editor. The movie is too long. If it had been an hour and a half, maybe (just maybe) I wouldn't have had to go to the suicide prevention center after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> I actually lie. See, after an hour, we garbage to SWIMFAN. At least with SWIMFAN, we know it's garbage before watching the movie. We know to build ourselves up. SWIMFAN has hot half-defects. The only thing that is half naked in this movie is related to the desperation of the stars, the obvious lack of which is nothing but hidden. And the actress who looked like a nun? It's called a personality. Get one. <br /> <br /> People who disgracefully rose to the ticket sales lobby told me that if I liked MY BAT FAT GREEK WEDDING, I love * (their emphasis, not mine) MANNA FROM HEAVEN. Right. What's more, "If you like GLITTER, you'll love MANNA FROM HEAVEN." And Mariah could actually overcome this flick clown. If this is not an insult, I don't know what it is. Watch indie movies, but don't look bad. This is definitely one of the bad ones. HEADEN MANNA needs some divine intervention.
