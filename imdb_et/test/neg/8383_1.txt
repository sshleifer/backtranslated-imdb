This movie is a nightmare! The feeling you feel when you wake up from the deadlock is the same as I got when I finished watching this movie: "Uff? OK, it ended, what a relief!" I felt this pain so painful that it was bad! It's a B-series cheap price, that's for sure, but I think it's not an excuse to be so bad! I've been watching great cheap movies, nice parcels, nice production, nice action and most of all stuff! It didn't get anything! The plot is fun, it looks almost like an "American guide on how to make old Chinese mythology a ridiculous teen movie, some kids playing hidden"? I don't know if the Chinese story in this movie is real or not, but if that is the case, the "damage" is even worse! Production is just terrible, normal zero (what are these special effects). There's no relationship. Expected "voltage scenes" are a complete failure. Operation is not better; and what are the dialogues? Oh my God! A movie that has multiple dialogues like: "I'll go there later, OK? Is that okay? OK, well. - OK? I'm sure it doesn't deserve more than 1/10 of the score! <br /> < br /> Too bad to be true!
