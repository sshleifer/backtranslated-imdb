This is a pretty bad picture. It doesn't offer anything unique or original or even interesting. <br /> <br /> A medical student finds out that his secret society at the university is engaged in horrific medical tests. Solving strange deaths at school. This movie started with many cool special effects, in which the man is partially cut off and trying to get away after his awakening, but even that tends and the other special effects are quite routine human body plastic patterns and the unrealistic appearance that these second-level horror films always seem to be. <br /> <br /> And if the usual plot and sad action were not enough, this movie had subtitles that many times did not even respond to dubbed English, which you hear, and then add that foot movement that does not correspond to duplication. .. just say that we are trying to coordinate everything that is not worthy of this mediocre value for your head. <br /> <b r /> I had counted at least this film on the skin and, after opening the credit, it didn't give much of it. <br /> <br /> This is a mill boring routine gear horror / gore film --- a short horror and gore.Skip this movie when "Ernest goes Camp" is the only rental left.
