I find it almost touching on how Star Trek fans desperately want to like this movie, despite its incredible number of mistakes. <br /> <br /> First of all, no familiar person in the real world knows it. Scotty is depicted as a bumbling tinkerer instead of a competent engineer he was in the original series. Uhura ... Gods, I can't even think of what they did with their character. His whole dialogue was painful to listen. McCoy seemed to be a neurotic stepfather to Kirk instead of his trusted friend. Spock ... well, let's just say that Leonard Nimoy was terribly wasted. He got a bad dialogue ("I don't think you've understood the difficulty of your situation. Captain." Gravity, get it? "Kirk ... oh man, don't start me. can really drive the disaster we got. <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, giving Brother Spock is a pretty desperate story and unnecessarily soap operaish, but hey, let's go with it. So, assuming that the two above-mentioned plot elements are sound that is a mistake in the script? One thing is reusing too much. For example, Enterprise will not work again. Do we expect Starfleet to send a seriously operational ship? having a skeleton team as a potentially dangerous situation because they want James Kirk to deal with the situation? If so, why not put him on the right ship as an advisor? Adding ... the team is extremely incompetent. Scotty has pieces of the ship (and obviously it is enough to knock the head with the enemy on board!), Someone seems to be deciding about deconstruction of the Klingon ship (despite the fact that the sensors are clearly shown in the ship's arms range) and the team seems too familiar with each other. In other words, there is no discipline. If it is Starfleet's flagship, then it is a wonder that the Klingons had not already overthrown the Federation. <br /> <br /> With regard to personal struggle for pain, it was a mess. Lawrence Luckenbill is a competent actor, but even she couldn't save this turkey. In short, no one can. Of all the people involved, imagine Leonard Nimoy being the most embarrassing. I hope he's anyway.
