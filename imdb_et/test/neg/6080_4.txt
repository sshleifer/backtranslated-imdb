I am always interested in seeing neglected movies that seem to have good credentials, but in that case, the neglect of the film seems justified. Obviously, some of the events that occurred during World War II are based on the fact that the film does not allow the viewer to connect for some reason, because it is not clear to me. One very likely reason is that - in the print I saw in TCM - none of the scenes where the Germans talked to each other got the title. This interesting concept of directors - to allow a non-German-speaking viewer to just think of the "context" that the Germans say to each other - is a complete flop in my book and helps to lock the viewer. It's also how the movie starts - just dropping us very confused, without much setup - it's inconvenient. Brian Keith is pretty good here, but the reputation of "The Great Escape" and "Stalag 17" is not in doubt.
