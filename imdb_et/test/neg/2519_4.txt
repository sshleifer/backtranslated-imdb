OK, this is one strange movie! Ed Wood Jr. fans appreciate the "inventive" technique that George Barry uses, such as film footage and cheesy voice transmissions. He can make the wall break the plot in the device! Here's more humor than horror, but I found this uneven mixture. You laugh and weep, and you probably don't know why you got it. In the introduction, Barry explains that filming began in this film in 1972 and ended in 1977 for $ 10,000. It's 59 months and 9 900 dollars too much! If you like your cheese on the matured side, which is the "gore" of the 1970s, you may find it an irresistible and unpleasant snack.
