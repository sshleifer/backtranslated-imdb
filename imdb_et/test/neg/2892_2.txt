This movie is honestly one of the greatest films of all time ... if you have insomnia. It's a foolproof way to sleep at once. When the film progresses slowly, the state of the public's unconsciousness gradually slips out of any plot that the film may actually contain. This effect is definitely due to the lack of sweet activity / sweet beans. <br /> <br /> Mr Eisenstein was obviously unable to master the art of assembly. Its best example is the Odessa Steps Scene. For no apparent reason, an event that would have taken a few seconds in real life would turn into a seven-minute nightmare for any reasonable viewer. This editing mistake violates any realism in the whole movie. Frankly, I've seen more realistic cartoons. <br /> <br /> Some people who have commented on this title have won the Battleship Potemkin as "One of the Biggest Movies of All Time" and "Really a Masterpiece." Well I am writing this comment to convince readers to avoid watching this movie My best guess is that my companions, Potemkin critics, simply wrote the wrong words in their summaries, certainly what they wanted to say, "One of the biggest storms of all time" and "Truly epic failure." <br /> <br /> Finally, don't waste your time If you are interested in watching a much higher quality movie, go to www.youtube.com and check out Halo 3. When I played the movie "Battleship Potemkin" in the game with a guardian, I'd shoot that face sniper rifle and then taste your dead body.
