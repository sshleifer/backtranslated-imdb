In David Arquette's main role, you think it would be a stupid movie right now. Well, it's a stupid script with a stupid movie. But F / X, namely the eight-legged freaks, makes it look at it. Recognition of the great mutant creatures of the 1950s, though on the stupid side. Arquette and Sheriff Sam (Kari Wuhrer) are calling for help to fight the enormous spiders caused by toxic waste, causing destruction in their small town of Arizona. Doug E. Doug, Rick Overton, Leon Rippy and charming Scarlett Johansson are also cast.
