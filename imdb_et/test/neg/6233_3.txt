I had never heard of "clearing" until I really quarreled with some friends at local Blockbuster one day, and it grabbed our attention. The DVD jacket described our interest, but when we opened it to the DVD player, boredom was just the beginning. <br /> <br /> The story was drawn too long. It seems to follow the same vision as the other robberies. But most of the embarrassing parts were in the beginning of the movie. After that, the contour was followed and it made "The Clearing" unigiginal. Returns were too many and the mourning of the victim's family did not give anything interesting or increased the nature of the film. And I also found that I didn't like the end, so apparently I didn't like the movie at all. <br /> <br /> Operation was not terrible ... it wasn't the biggest. Robert Redford has produced much better results. The tragic nature of Willem Dafoe was the only thing I really saw in the story, and the viewer really saw that it changed in the film in the last ten minutes. The depiction of Helen Mirren when Robert Redford's wife was flat and in a way followed the same generic form as the other films that contain a tragic and heart-breaking event. <br /> <br /> I don't think "The Clearing" has anything to do about it. Are you using your movie rental money for something else ... like "Garden State", maybe?
