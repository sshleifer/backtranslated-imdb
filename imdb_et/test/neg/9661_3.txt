wow, this movie sucked. <br /> <br /> This film was embarrassing to the original sandlot. <br /> <br /> All this movie was terrible. <br /> <br /> The action was terrible. Each part, except for the 'Mexican' sandlot leader, was terrible. <br /> <br /> Luke Perry, though only a few parts were terrible. It was once the worst role. Even a boy actor who plays him as a child was someone you want to hit, even in the end, lol. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me of those children's films that go away to make some fun. funny stage. Humor was for 6-year-olds. <br /> <br /> If you are over 12 years old and want to see if it's worth it, skip this movie and watch sitcom.
