This short Harold Lloyd wasn't much; not one of his funniest efforts. Of course, I never see dirty children as something fun. That's the biggest part of this story, Harold and his wife Mildred Davis, who are the babysitters of their two children. One is a child who is constantly crying and the other is a four-year-old terror who does everything but demolishes the house. Children's children were chipped again and again, this was not interesting to me. <br /> <br /> The best part was the last four or five minutes, when the couple thinks that Noah Young is hiding his house. Half of the time a pet cat has been scaring, but in general, this segment is fun with some good eyesight, reminding me of another Lloyd short, "Haunted Spooks." <br /> <br /> Save the whole picture, which I probably won't look at again. Lloyd has done many other good things to waste in another 25 minutes. It's not that funny.
