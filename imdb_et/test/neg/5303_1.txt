This film was embarrassing. Ulma Thurman seemed to have some illness and John Travolta looked like he was sleeping. I was expecting this to be such a short order for Get Shorty, which is not a remake of exactly the same movie (except that some characters have different names and clothes) <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this to the movie to my worst enemy. It seems to me that I was hanging and Hollywood is again deceiving me to see another terrible sequel (I've also suffered through Alien Vs. Predator). <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is that it's 2005's worst movie!
