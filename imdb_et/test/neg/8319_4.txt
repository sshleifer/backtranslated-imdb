Brave One is New York's radio show called Erica Bain (Jodie Foster). His life is a living dream in the city that he grew up and loves. She has her own great groom David (Naveen Andrews) whom she is going to marry. But one night when Erica and David are walking their dogs, they attack and attack the group degenerate, leaving David dead. Erica is recovering, but is later heartbreaking and traumatized and is no longer able to deal with reality. He buys a gun from a street defender. But one day he buys a shop and a man comes and wins the secretary dead. This is when Erica fires and kills this man and turns into a vigilant. Killing anyone who is trying to harm him or others. At the same time, Detonator Mercer (Terrence Howard) is watching this hard-to-know killer and friends with Erica in this process. Erica will restore her peace of mind, because she kills those violent people, but she is not sure if she is morally right. And when he and Mercer go, he doesn't even realize that an unknown murderous attacker is next to him. He represents this type of violent, morally corrupted character perfectly. Terrence Howard is also great in this movie. Both have excellent chemistry and are reinforced to a certain level. Brave One looks visually clean and transmits some great camera work, but not everything works great. Scenes where Erica is completely traumatized and afraid to walk in front of her front door world. The camera pushed the sides almost forward in a dreamy way and pulled it out instantly. Almost every time Erica killed someone, everyone just had to go and see their facial expressions in a fine detail. Slo-moi was used correctly when Erica made her first murder. But why continue this effect almost every time he made a murder? Camera work creates a great atmosphere in most movies, but here are some scenes that are simply superfluous. <br /> <br /> Brave One is very much about how these murders affect Eric emotionally. His fianc√© kills a group of robbers, and his love for New York is suddenly reversed. He understands that the beloved city has a dark side, and he says so in his radio broadcast. However, I do not fully understand it. Erica works as if she ever realized that the city could be subjected to violence at night and that it was pretty stupid. If he lived there all his life, he must be blind or very attentive. Erica also seems to be for human suffering and murderers. He doesn't even have to look for them, they just come to him as if they were begging for them to be wrong. Brave One first deals with morality and the proper use of violence, and then maybe it respects it. The end is very negative and totally immoral and inhuman. It also denies the purpose of the character of Terrence Howard, which the film spends so much time trying to develop steadily, and suddenly its morale takes the U-turn. Crazy morale becomes very breakable, and at the end the whole place breaks. So violence is fine? Is it a good idea to murder when it's revenge? I have pretty much refused this. You know why? Because I have a conscience that this film definitely lacks. It is not right to take another person's life, no matter how bad they are, or how much you hate them. Eric Bain tries to stop these criminals, but in the end he is no better than the terrible people he kills. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster and Terrence Howard offer a lot of power to this movie. Brave One contains a strong message, but this message is both immoral and wrong. This film may look beautiful, well-functioning and intelligently strong. But in the end it gets quite rotten. I'm giving brave to 1.5 out of 4. The message is very uneven and morally wrong, and the good actors can't really save them.
