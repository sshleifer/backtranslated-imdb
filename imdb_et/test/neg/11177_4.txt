Amazingly beautiful, Charlotte Lewis, as a woman terrorized by a ghost, tortures her by phone. In the face of terrorism, Charlotte is forced to face the mystery of this cooling to save his peace of mind and life. I believe that Ruggero Deodato, Director of "Ultimo Mondo Cannibale", "Cannibal Holocaust" and "Park at the Park" drove this absurd trash. Probably the music of Goblin's foremost man Claudio Simonetti is pretty good, but the story is painfully stupid. Franco Ferrin's script is ridiculous and it doesn't make sense if it's bad and no doubt. The scene where Charlotte Lewis potential rape is killed with coins coming out of the subway phone is more than ridiculous. Don't waste your time with this piece. There are much better Italian horror movies!
