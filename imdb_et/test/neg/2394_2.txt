The premise is interesting and the cast is doing the best, but the script and guiding efforts are so poor that it is not surprising that this movie was buried - which suits the manuscript. Looking at it, I couldn't decide what was worse, a scenario or a management. The actors are up, the artistic direction is in the form of a Disney movie, music is built and sentiment so sweet that it gives the viewers cavities. It's a bad attempt to emulate "FOur Wedding and Funeral". If you want to look at comedy that is the same pancake and if a bad direction can turn the story into a cavity, it's a good look.
