This is probably the worst film I've seen for a long time. Independent or not, solid writing is mandatory. Just for leadership and action. I know these actors can act (I've seen them in Sporan and more ...), but this movie is very bad, very bad. Maybe it's a script, maybe it's a director. Probably a bit so ..... Probably a lot of it! Technically OK, just bad, bad, bad ... I have a theory that supporters of this movie also have poker magazines because I saw a very good overview in one magazine. "Hey, we did it, so it must be good, right?" Not so fast in Bucky. I know it takes a lot of hard work and money to make a movie, much less sold and distributed, and that's why I commend these people. But the final product leaves my mouth in bad taste. <br /> <br /> P.S. I won a free rental and chose this movie from Blockbuster. Tomorrow I'll get my money back.
