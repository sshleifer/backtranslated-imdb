It does not surprise me that those desperate filmmakers could not find a UK distributor and then had to release it as a free DVD with a Sunday newspaper. Distributors clearly saw what filmmakers and the Sunday newspaper could not say that it was a movie that just didn't pay their costs. <br /> <br /> Since this is a thriller of riddles, it would have helped if they had chosen a leading actor who could speak correctly, not Vinnie Jones, who seems to pronounce "riot" as "riell". And it would have helped if the noisy places or scenes that were flooded with disruptive and inappropriate music were not dashed. The plot is ridiculous: the lost story of Charles Dickens allegedly helps our hero solve many modern murders, but so would Herge's Tintin adventure, because the relationship between Dickens and Jones is non-poor. And we have a ridiculous assumption that a prospective investigative journalist, who puts his hands on a previously undiscovered Dickens manuscript, will take several days to read it, so that Dickens can continue to play feedback throughout the film as if they were involved. What they don't do. If you find a new Dickens manuscript, wouldn't you just go anywhere and read it? The film ends with a surprising revelation that has become mandatory since the sixth sense, but in that case you won't be surprised enough to offend your intelligence. If the film becomes supernatural in the twelfth hour, it may be that Vinnie Jones is a robot. It may not seem so complicated if the film was stylish but it is not. And in many places it seems to be an amateur: there is a scene where the table is equipped with a 60's jump technique, but they are not convinced that the actual person in the table is completely out of frame between cuts. As a result, you see things changing around the frame if you really have to look at things that change in the middle of the frame. A good rule for making a movie is: If you don't know how to do this technique, try something else. <br /> <br /> The real reason is why someone thought this movie would be a good idea first.
