Barney and Friends ... Dora of the 1990s. <br /> <br /> OK, I admit it. As a child, Barney was my ultimate hero. I had my barney plush toy and I watched the same barney episodes over and over again on video tape. perhaps the reason was that it was both sugar-coated and meaningless. <br /> <br /> But when I turned 7, I started to hate barney. all at school were Dis barney and I went with it (mainly because it was funny) and that's what the little boys do. but a few years later I discovered something else about Barney that I never forget. <br /> <br /> A person known from IMDb as an Angel_meiru school essay explaining Barney's viewing dangers, and he posted it on bulletin boards. many of these threats were understood. <br /> <br /> Barney is a dinosaur who can magically live in one day at school. he is said to be an education, or says Sheryl Leach (Barney's creator), but really, everything I remember teaching him is that magic can solve something that is not true. <br /> <br /> Comment to finish it, I'd like to tell you a little story. There was one young boy who looked at a certain barney episode. one day he was alone when a stranger attracted him to his car and drove with him. I don't know the outcome (but it's safe to assume that the child died), but why was he kidnapped first? because he looked at Barney and his friends episode titled "A stranger is a friend with whom you have not yet met." <br /> <br /> 0/10
