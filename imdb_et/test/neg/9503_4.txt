I thought it was an incredible boring movie! I heard the director can't speak French and so he left his actors to say what they wanted ... Well, Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi is great, as usual, but I can't say the same about the other participants. They have nothing to say, especially Bruno Todeschini. <br /> <br /> They all seem very tired, it's one plot of the film: tired of being, living abroad, in their lives in general; so they spend half of their time sleeping in the hotel room. After a while I felt drowsy ... <br /> <br /> I gave 4 to very beautiful scenes, including the last one.
