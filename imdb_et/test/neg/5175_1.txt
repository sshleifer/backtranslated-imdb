I'm a big fan of British films in general, but especially gangster movies. Unfortunately, this movie was amazingly bad. I think it's pretty frustrating that this movie gets good customer opinions. The idea that this film is sharp and realistic is ridiculous. I have read and heard quite a bit about the real events shown in this film and they are almost all glorified by supreme violence, etc. The only sharp live event in the movie was the Range Rover murders, where some overcrowded bouncers were rubbed out to interfere with people they couldn't handle. This movie is a shameful British movie! It does not have a plot or a decent activity and is not limited to violent violence (sharp and realistic, as some people want). These types of movies should not be allowed near a budget or film camera, as people from this movie should not be given the opportunity to say this pathetic violent little story with no consequence.
