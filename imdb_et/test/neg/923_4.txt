Recently converting Curb Your Enthusiasm, which prompted my viewing throughout the season's episodes, I expect more, much more Jeff's efforts. <br /> <br /> When I watch a movie that offers a slice of the average "Joe" Life that I need to be interested, take care, feel and believe. And with Jeff Garlin, I also expected that the comedic moments will shine. This movie failed me again and again. <br /> <br /> Jeff is playing with his mother, a sad sad bag that is a social disaster. For many years he has not had any real or even casual relationships. He seems to be mostly unemployed and, as he said, he is more expensive for his mommy. Can things get worse? Of course. In short order, he gets everything around him, including Silverman, Second City (his comedy workshop) and his representative. Everyone strengthens his status as a loser. The Silverman's "fat" test was as cruel as it was absurd. His obsession with the role of "Marty", a tool for rescuing his career, also strikes a great stalemate. <br /> <br /> Though the latest moments of the film look at the better things that come to the cinematographic journey, though occasionally with golden light, it was unfortunately not.
