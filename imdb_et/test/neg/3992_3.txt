Similarly, Lamberto Bava, his father, Mario (who was by far the overestimated director, the submissive facsimile), was Michele Soavi's inadequate director of the Dario Argento. The "Church" has at least one thing to suggest - an incredibly detailed artistic direction - but nothing else. The movie is a long cut, full of one-dimensional characters and almost put me to sleep several times. There is a fine line between "art" and "pretentious mess", and while the "Church" is not entirely worthless, it would be better to look at something else. <br /> <br /> 3/10
