I was very willing to give Rendition the benefit of suspicion when all the negative presses I read about it came. Even about three-quarters of the mileage I thought was confusing and a bit inconsistent, but otherwise it was a powerful story that came to an end. And then the bottom fell out. Not necessarily wanting to destroy everyone's movie, but the conclusion reflects everything you thought was a fact about what and when things happened to your head, but for no other reason, except maybe tell the world, yes I'm cool, and I know it . I love a good twist, I love the good ah-ha moment, but only when it's a handy story. The total failure of filmmakers is not practical for the general story, deadlines should not have been parallel and they did not need to be separated within a week. The whole revelation destroyed all the value I gave to director Gavin Hood and scriptwriter Kelley Sane, which may be a good thing, because looking back, it wasn't really as strong a film as I originally blindly gave it an admirable thing to try to "translate" "The film is in the public consciousness of the current public, but it needed a story that was rather related to the accompanying and involved policies, not to the shine of the issues concerning the loss of a wife from a woman in distress and her daughter's reluctant rebellion against her" interrogator "father. I understand that the bottom-line film crew needs human quality to understand it and that's why I'm not blaming it on the route. My only feature is that we don't get enough of what the title says we should get. Instead, there are numerous plot lines that are all confused at the forefront before they are sent back to the lower regions of our consciousness, never returned. So much you forget that you should take care of a woman? interviewer? CIA Agent? victim? Senator? Middle Eastern daughter and her passionate boy? Finally, I really just gave up and let the movie stay where it was, finally someone was completely different from what he had for the first time. <br /> <br /> All that happens is a bomb explosion. This bomb is at the heart of every thread of the story, and finally it becomes so safe that you can't believe how big the waves were. The old butterfly rides that tend to have been completely affected because one of the boys' revenge missions is destroying the lives of so many people. Is death, destruction, physical and emotional abuse or career suicide; no one really gets unharmed. At the end of the day, however, only the story of who has fled Egypt for torture is very interesting. We believe he is unequivocally innocent from the beginning, but he is a water plate, electric shock, etc. If those in power contain a man who has no compassion or reason to stop until something has flowed out (either true or not), and the observer without intervening to participate or pause, the situation is some intrigue about how it could be the end. All three involved are all the best parts of the film and prove once again that the film should have been a concern for them as a whole. <br /> <br /> I don't want to disdain people, such as Reese Witherspoon, (the victim's spouse) or his senate, which he worked for Peter Sarsgaard, because they are doing the good job they are giving. Even Meryl Streep, his kooky accent and Alan Arkin, won't lose too much. But this is Jake Gyllenhaal's CIA agent, Yigal Naor's interviewer, and Omar Metwally's victim who really seem to be. Naor is brilliant when Egypt tries to stay sharp during working hours, but compassionate and anxious as a father trying to find his daughter. This man is brutal, but he is because it is what his occupation demands and why he relies on it to find answers. Metwally does not give her the wrong seconds when she is wrong and suffering. Regardless of whether he is lying or not really knowing anything about his cell phone terrorist, we are buying our situation completely and desperately waiting for the situation to come to light. As for Gyllenhal, someone who seems to have been recycled repeatedly during his career, but with different success, finds the right part for him. The demons that enter his soul throughout the trial are forced to be part of the wear and tear of their bodies and minds, causing both ambivalence and the need to intervene. Both feelings are wrestling with each other until he makes the final decision, and his stoic, boyfriend is perfect for this battle. <br /> <br /> Too bad that one of the plots' work is never the main thing, even though it's the film's namesake. Reflecting around the edges, we hit too much around the audience, lulling the time and sequence, and then we hit the face because it all talks to us more to laugh, then a, "did not see it come." I felt cheated and unfortunately it is a lasting effect, what I've taken from the movie. If it had been easier, I could have enjoyed myself, but as it is, some positive things can still be taken from the seriously injured.
