Travolta and Thurman deserved a better film. It is very secondary in all aspects, not one fresh idea. But the biggest problem is the ridiculous philosophy of this film. The gang of black rappers after their criminal activity and even the killing of people are becoming almost positive Mickey Mouse-type heroes who perform on stage and give prizes at the ceremony. Maybe it's in real life. But displaying it as a fairly normal "happy" is beyond my imagination. "What's wrong with putting a couple of bad Ukrainians out if they're not politically correct?" - The performance must go on! This makes me think that Hollywood writers have a big problem with good and evil separation, even if the genre should be "black comedy."
