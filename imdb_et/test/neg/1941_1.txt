Anyone remember the first CKY, CKY2K, etc.? Back when it came to crazy things, not to see Bam Margera, as it was a douchebag, violated a 5-year-old, super-rock star wannabe. <br /> <br /> The show, however, was fantastic, but Bam's fame and wealth have led him to believe that we now enjoy him with childish and idiotic acts that are more than real cool things that used to be ex. CKY2K. <br /> <br /> Actions are as repetitive as anything new, except for annoying stupidity and practiced comments ... The only thing we see is Bam Margera, so busy that she shows how much she doesn't care when a lot of money he got or at all. <br /> <br /> I really have nothing to say except to give us CKY2K, cause Bami to suck .. <br /> <br /> I enjoy Steve, Knoxville, etc. a thousand times more.
