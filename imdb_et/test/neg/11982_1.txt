Hardly came across the movie ... Action is bad, dialogues are even worse. I felt firm about st00pid 4 watching it, but it was the same as one of my favorite games, so I plagued the trough. They even took the sound together. In certain parts of the film, the background music is so strong that I had to reduce the volume. It would be nice if it were a competition for someone who could screw more. <br /> <br /> Oh and PS: I don't know what this man "Uwe" can create ... I definitely don't think this movie is bad just because he's a director. I checked the list of my work and this is her first (and probably last) creation I've seen. <br /> <br /> Over and over.
