The only positive thing I think about this perfect trash is that now I have a good answer when someone asks me what called the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It would have made so little effort to make it more attentive ... a lot more effort and it could have been great. <br /> <br /> Why would anyone want to produce such waste? <br /> <br /> I refuse to believe that the director could be so ridiculously unattractive. <br /> <br /> Making a totally intolerable movie must be a point. <br /> <br /> Something else just doesn't make sense.
