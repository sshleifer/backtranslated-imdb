A group of adventurers travel to the "dark continent" to try to find the missing heir, Diana, who disappeared years ago, and who is now probably the living wild tribe who deems her godly. <br /> <br /> Again, as a buggy, European cannibal films have taken me deep into Jess Franco's territory - a seemingly endless movie art in the desert, with sub-parameter writing, railing and dirty camera work. acting terribly (Franco regularly Lina Romay takes this prize this time as a result of her merciful parent's wife). Here's the hellish place where I finally stumbled upon Kilimanjaro, the Abysmal jungle-based exploiter, Diamants, which was so amazingly bad that I watched three consecutive nights to finish watching it. <br /> <br /> Tawdry and relentlessly boring, even according to Franco standards, this tiring trash will fail on almost every level: the story is the terribly boring derivative of Edgar Rice Burrough's Tarzan, though with a feminine twist; the film seems to have been filmed in local botanical gardens, although the grain film has been poorly integrated with the film to convince viewers that the action is actually in Africa; and the scenes of death are virtually untried (Franco can usually rely on some spraying, but despite the initial appearance, it is not a cannibal film and it is not so big). <br /> <br /> The chairman succeeds, his sexy young Katja Bienert cast into the jungle prison of Diana. Because of this nubilized beauty, this nude that runs and jumps through something other than a hostile back, with its curved hair, is only 16 years old. Also, Franco Mari Carmen Nieto complains of some nudity on a treacherous trip to Litak (who gives us a glimpse of her untamed areas) and Aline Mess as a topless warrior woman Noba, avoiding such a tight 1/10 evaluation from me (although I'm sure she will get much more in the future? I still have a lot of movies to see).
