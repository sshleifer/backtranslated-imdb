Hmph. Soul Plane should be a "black comedy" with a much-known movie, airplane. This film is a black comedy that is the worst. Stereotypes can be funny and many times. But this picture is nasty. Okay, you have clubs, sex, drugs, all that people associate with "city" culture today. DL Hughley should never have accepted the script. Kevin Hart makes a poor leader here ... his appearance in this film is likely to grow tedious for many. The appearance of the Man and Snoop method was far from their worst. <br /> <br /> I'm just happy I didn't pay for watching this movie ...
