I always think it would be nice if you could buy some of the old movie that will be re-released on the DVD before you buy it. This way you can save yourself some time, money and some aggression if you feel so completely down. <br /> <br /> "Buddy Holly's Story" is such a movie. <br /> <br /> I do not want to go to film testimonials or gardening, because I've been with them twenty years ago when I first started to see it. <br /> <br /> I had saved this old (monona) beta machine in the early 1980s and liked it so much that it became a regular favorite. In my opinion, the best part was the performance of Gary Busey's young friend and his almost perfect vocal and guitar. <br /> <br /> I waited for a day when I could ... STEREO ... and this is where the disappointment is. <br /> <br /> This version of DVD is (as allegedly) circumcised according to both audio and video, but I'm afraid it left me sad and looked at my watch, wishing to stop it. <br /> <br /> Sound is a dim, unlimited incomprehensible and so unprofessionally mixed that I was longing for crystal clearness in my old Beta tape vocal! <br /> <br /> Whatever you think of pictures or plot or characters, the real pull card here is MUSIC ...... and if you don't hear the lead song because they are drowned by zymbals or back products or other ambient there is not much left there? <br /> <br /> I will convert my old Beta version (Mono) into a DVD for next viewing and put it in the trash! <br /> <br /> "Extinction is the rule, survival is the exception ..."
