I remember this movie vaguely. I remember this as one specific reason that it's the only movie I've ever been out of! and since then I have never seen it available for rent! I can't ruin it for anyone. Thinking, looking cast, it seemed to be a winner under John Landis's leadership, but a good god, they had it all !! It seems to remember that the father is going to disappear and the family is trying to find him, trying to put the actual photo on the computer's disk drive. I went out in about half an hour. However, I must admit that I would like to see if I can get a copy to see if it was really so bad! <br /> <br /> It will not surprise me if it were on every actor's black list! I mean, Christopher Lee was in that? Legend of all the bad guys who had been in Star Wars and Lord of the Rings? As I said - black listed movie, The Stupids!
