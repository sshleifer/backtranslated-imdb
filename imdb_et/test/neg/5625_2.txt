What cruelty. I do not require a complete blood simulation of the film, but the "Killing Zoe" scheme and scenario is so pointless that I found myself worshiping for the entire (gracefully short) ninety minutes. <br /> <br /> Readers of these reviews have now found out that Zoe, who is in love with American safecracker Zed, is also a banker who Zed helps to steal a large stake in Bastille Day. br /> <br /> The film strengthens its credibility. Zed and Zoe's magic are very prosperous at night and Zoe's claims that they have experienced lifetime orgasm reflect the scriptwriter's longer teen fantasies than any real screen-based chemistry. Zedi's total indifference, when his friend Eric throws Zoe out of the hotel, cannot predict the stage for his later strong affirmation. <br /> <br /> In another case, Eric's bohemian band - drug-related losers who lead a marginal life for violent crimes - prepare your big assault with the night in the city. Here, it seems that Roger Avary's main goal is to prove he knows something about drugs. The secondary yarn involves us convincing (endless repetition) that Eric is really pleased to see his old friend Zedi again. Really glad. Eric's devil-caring, overwhelming affection and affection for Zed is not even far from believable - see for example his innocence to discover a dead cat in his apartment house. The development of the characters accompanying us from the rest of the film is an afterthought. <br /> <br /> Heist is a disaster - understandable because the plan is ridiculous and criminals are full of amateurs. This is where Avary continues to recognize his idol Quentin Tarantino, showing that he may be more violent than violent. In fact, he is more boring than boring. There is a safety belt inside the shelter to build the excitement. It was boring in video games and now it's boring. <br /> <br /> Zoe will be taken hostage, but despite our expectation that she will play a central role, she just sits beautiful. Specifically, Avary does nothing to her. In the literal sense of the last five minutes he lives, the hostage breaks down and saves gratitude, but Zedit was still plagued by the consequences of the crime. Why does he not mind his involvement in a crime - or why he gives him a damn at all - is impossible to say. After all, he had no chance to see that he was more human than the rest of the gang. <br /> <br /> The whole dialogue is blunt and fake. Much of this is in French. As a native speaker, I can assure you that it doesn't sound really far away. Eric's sweet, sweet discourse, which alternates quickly with harsh sons, is intended to be alternately charming and frightening, but is just grabbing. Meanwhile, his horrible cat companions are more Scooby-Doo than Thomas Crown. When Eric is surprised by the example of excessive forces, we can all breathe in relief: like the bank's hostages, we will soon release this unfortunate ordeal.
