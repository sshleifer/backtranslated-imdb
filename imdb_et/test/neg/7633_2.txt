Rebecca De Mornay can be an exciting actor, but also for the parts she plays when you can't say anything nice ... <br /> <br /> De Mornay represents a woman with a terrible trauma as a child. Dad can hardly stand now when he has grown up and has of course got a brilliant contraction. He's affiliated with Banderas, with whom we suspect we are (ouch! As original!). Sometimes he reminds Banderas' mother -in-law Tippy Hedren's character "Marnie". Then the manager pulls all stops to make an unexpected thriller, but this end is so far drawn that it is absolutely impossible to buy. In the film, "conversations with the serial influencer" are compulsory "silence" of the tradition, murders (people and man). cats), split personality and open end when the crowd should call no more, and they were right.
