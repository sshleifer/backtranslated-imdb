Ron Hall draws a triple threat when he writes, directs, and marks Vampire Assassins. Derek Washington (Hall) is your clich√©-police-mission that finds some of his nasty vampire action on his neck. Throwing your badge is looking for the last vampire cutter (not Buffy!) To take the streets back and bleed back to the grave. <br /> <br /> Vampire Assassins is a terrible movie. It hangs from so many other movies (do you say Blade?) That he never tries to create his own identity. No script. The activity is terrible. Who says the micro-budget stimulates creativity? There is nothing interesting here. You don't get anything out of it, except for the headache. Stay away from it at all costs.
