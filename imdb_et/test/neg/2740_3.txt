I just looked at the Descent. Gawds, a terrible movie. To the right, they represent the stage geyser and the note says it is miles under the state of Washington. People in this country have no deep geysers of Earth. They thought it looked clean and in a typical Hollywood style it kicked in. He fell on a stone and I heard a splash. Steam would have come out of it before the stage shot hit, if ever. <br /> <br /> The actor was also pretty bad. Micheal Dorn has sunk into new low jobs. <br /> <br /> What is a movie dog. I bet the vote does not exceed 3.5. <br /> <br /> It didn't look too much like the SciFi Channel, except for a real guy to try Perry.
