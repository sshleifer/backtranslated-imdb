In general, you can ask two questions about 80 low budget horror movies. and this "demon wind". 1. Is this a good movie? No. 2. Is this a fun movie? You wish! Demon Wind is a gruesomely filthy and nauseous story that is full of cheese makeup effects and nasty violence. The story is pretty much non-existent and involves a group of young people who reveal the terrible secrets of one group of ancestors. Apparently, his grandparents lived in a worshiping neighborhood, and evil (demons and mist) still live there. But I got this movie. From start to finish, it breathes sickness! The devilish undertones, playful gore, and (relatively) decent action all together make this movie high on the mainstream, uninspired 80 slashers. It shows some creativity and courage (literally) where other productions of this decade are more easily divided into routine and forgetfulness. These creators were inspired by the success of "Evil Dead" and even the "demons" of Lamberto Bava, but what the hell! It's fun and made a lot of enthusiasm. Although this film has a rather high "mis f ***" standard from time to time. Especially near the end, when joyfully blows off the setbacks and laser shows. And what the hell are these two wannabe magicians? Nonetheless, "Demon Wind" will be my recommendation if you are not too high when they are terrible!
