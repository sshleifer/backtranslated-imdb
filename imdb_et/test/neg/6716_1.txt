Mr Seagal has apparently further lowered his (already low) standards and has now crossed over to making bad films. The alien panel has no content that would ever be in the script. It's a director who has done even worse work and the music and score are so funny and bad that you just don't know whether to laugh or cry. For 10 minutes you want to turn off the movie. However, considering Steven Seagal's earlier films, you think, "Hey, maybe at least some cool things that deserve to be seen ..." ... you are BACK! As the movie progresses, it only deepens. Everyone (with some exceptions) seems to kill every person they talk to, good or bad, innocent or not. The only good thing about the film is that it is the end and it has a rather short working time. Making a movie in two words: STAY AWAY!
