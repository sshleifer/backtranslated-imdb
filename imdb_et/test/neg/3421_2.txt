This film illustrates the situation of the Australian film industry and everything that holds it back. <br /> <br /> Awesome talent, outstanding performances (especially by Victoria Mountain) but practically any kind. <br /> <br /> The "customization" of the variety did not bring anything new to Macbeth (no, it is not enough in today's Australia) and, in essence, it could not fully (except) face completely unnecessarily) respecting the original work. When one work is done (done and done and done), it is Shakespeare. So any adaptation, if it is not self-conscious and meaningless, has to bring at least a new interpretation of the work. <br /> <br /> And that is what Macbeth does not do. As it was done, this film has no contemporary importance. This is the same piece we've seen countless (too much!). Except weapons and different equipment. <br /> <br /> In addition to the original Shakespearian Dialogue (not in any other way), one of the finest moments of the film is long-lasting and incredibly boring slow motion strikes to the end during which I completely tuned, even though I looked at the screen. I've never thought I'd have a short attention, but you go. <br /> <br /> I think the film will succeed under very limited conditions. But as Australia continues to produce world-class talent, filmmakers have to stop being successful under limited conditions, and actually set high standards to show that they respect the acting talent they work with. /> <br /> shame. Absolute shame.
