It must not be confused that Samuel L. Jackson is a very fingered rider. COUNTRY BIRTHS are a low budget, have no participants (talk), but some pretty decent visual effects. An attractive young woman (Julia "Rayanne" Ruiz) doesn't want to marry her husband; so he is put under a powerful Mayan curse that has snakes hatching in his body, slowly eating out. His only hope for survival is the shaman who lives across the Texas border. It is time for him; and he will be put on the train from El Paso to Los Angeles. At an early stage, the snakes leave their body afflicted with pain and grow rapidly. The passengers on the train are now trapped and soon there will be snacks for the snakes. Finale is undoubtedly the best 91-minute flick. Alby Castro, Al Galvez, and Giovanni Bejarno are also receiving the letter of credit.
