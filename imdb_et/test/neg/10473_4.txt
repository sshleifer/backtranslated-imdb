I really don't know if it was supposed to be a science fiction or a horror. At least, it was confusing. But what really disturbed me was the story of a lack of development between characters. they don't spend 30 seconds on the screen at the same time. <br /> <br /> The hot secretary (Kristen Honey) will be dead and more operational than the other two. <br /> <br /> A bad developer vs. Indians is an over-exploited story, but I personally like evil developers get their lives like living in Florida. <br /> <br /> The only reason I stayed with it was a creature. It was the original. I've never seen anything like this, and I'm a lover of new creatures.
