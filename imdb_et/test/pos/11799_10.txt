So glad I currently have HBO. I wasn't going to watch the movie today, but when I got home and saw the next movie from HBO was what I decided to (at least) describe at least. I'm so glad I decided to watch this movie! Maybe this film hit me in a vulnerable situation (I was a little stressed, I learned to be a great test), but it gave me a completely friendly perspective, not to mention taught me a valuable lesson on empathy. I am currently one year away from graduating from a pharmacy school and the whole scene with a doctor and nurse was definitely a learning point for me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I just wanted to post, to let the world know it's an amazing movie and it shouldn't be missed. There's definitely something for everyone in this movie!
