This movie was in today's scarface.It was my toes.It's one of those rare epic movies that makes you want a sequel. I especially liked Damian Chapa's performance earned by the Academy Award, which she deserves for her performance in blood blood. The only thing I didn't like was behind the scenes because it didn't show the intensity of the film and I would have liked to see less-spoken scenes. But the movie was great and is one of my top ten most popular films. Plus it worked very well, there was no bad scene in the movie, I loved it, Jennifer Tilly was perfect as well as the whole cast. I don't see anyone being like this movie that was great. Finally, it must look.
