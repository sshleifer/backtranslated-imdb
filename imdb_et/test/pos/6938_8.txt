Do-It-Yourself indie horror auteur Todd Sheets returns with another entertaining nickel'n'dime video game, which is basically just a weak excuse to capture as many watery blood and shiny guts as possible. The evil demonic scarecrow raises the dead to a terrifying rogue zombies so they can live. A bunch of college children, a dangerous escaped convicted trio led by the Slade (Byron Nichodemus, who grabs this horrific level), two equally wild sleazeball hoodlums and a hotto-nurses trio, all have to do to survive this harassing ordeal. It is an unnecessarily confusing and complicated plot, but fortunately this hilariously horrible hoot does not contain narrative coherence (abundance), but it compensates for a pleasant amount of great glorious graphic gore. The reluctant highlights are the woman whose fingers are cut, the deadly shot in the youth galina, the tested necrophilic rape, the removal of the internal organs and, of course, the more repulsive entrail-eating when you can shake the moist intestine. What's more, we also have a harsh, grainy cinematography that alternates between the constantly washed colors and the black and black white, unevenly staged fighting scenes, evenly pathetic non-nicknames (Jerry Angell, ultimate drummer) for his ridiculously sad histrionics, a slippery, innumerable psycho Criminal Joe Bob), a square-headed thrash-metal soundtrack and a general shivery'n'ominous synthesizer score. Let us not forget the ridiculous ending, where many of our survivors stumble over bacteria that eat meat with some vials to use them in the dark hordes of Undead. Of course, this flick is a clean dreck, but it has some terrific amazing quality, which in turn makes it very frightening, it is a fantastic Z-class fun for bad scare.
