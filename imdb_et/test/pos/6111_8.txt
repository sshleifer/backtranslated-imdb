"Pink Flamingos" was revolutionary for its era and today it is still difficult to see. Not that I didn't enjoy the movie, it's fun; but it is very reluctant and Jonh Waters pushes the envelope as far as possible. The story is about Babs Johnson (Devine), she is the poorest living woman. He lives with his son Crackers and daughter Cotton trailer. Not to mention the overweight Edie, who is stuck in the eggs and sleeps in the crib. Then there are Connie and Raymond Marble, two dirty perverts who are jealous of Babi. They have been for a long time to survive because he is the hardest person. This means that their caretaker impregnates abducted women and sells babies to lesbian couples, flashes people openly, and even sends a mail to Babs. Babs fights back to prove he is the most prosperous person. It even includes incest, murder and dog nonsense and other ill sexual acts. This is a movie that is fun for the whole family. (well depending on where you live?) Look at "Pink Flamingos", but don't forget your barf bag. See also "Sweet Movie" for more perverse, strange sex and bodily functions.
