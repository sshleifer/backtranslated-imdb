This is not a film that impresses with a big budget, high-tech footage, fast camera movements or puzzling costumes that are thought of by a lofty and hungry director. But this is a film director who is also a very good photographer with a very good sense of looking at things as a human, not as a demigod, unlike most directors. This is not a movie where actors and actors try to give their best performances with unrealistic or, at best, learned gestures and tricks. Rather, it is a film in which they act as real as possible. In fact, they are not professional actors at all. Dialogues between the main characters, their expressions, their feelings are as real as those in your real life. You say to the same wrong people who are around you with the same regret that you do not want to express themselves in words. You will see the same disturbance for an unwanted guest. This is the same disconnection feeling you get in modern urban life. And this is your chance to see yourself from the outside, characterized by the main characters. I saw all Nuri Bilge's Ceylan films, including. his short film Koza (Cacoon) thanks to those who put it on the DVD. Many would compare him to Tarkovsky, Ozu and perhaps Bresson or Bergman if he is a true author. And he is sincere, saying that his films are not about making money, but about giving meaning to his life. Such sincerity is in Uzakis.
