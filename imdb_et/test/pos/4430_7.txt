I rented this movie because it was a documentary and highly appreciated. This is more of a study of a son's son who is trying to find out who his biological father was, not about architecture. <br /> <br /> More than anything else, the main theme of the movie is that we have an eccentric, highly praised, maybe genius architect who had little attention to anything or someone outside the profession. <br /> <br /> The tragedy of the movie is the broken families he left. His mother-mothers came over as shameful fans as irresponsible women who only have negative children. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel said Nathaniel, a film producer and son of Louis Khan, was relatively stable and curious when he wasn't bitter. The people interviewed were, of course, more interested in talking about Louis Khan's buildings than his personal problems, but I think the mix of themes has made the film interesting. <br /> <br /> For my buildings, I found them as abstract art - strange, non-practical, and usually only rated by critics.
