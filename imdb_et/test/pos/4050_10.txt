When I started watching the 3 episodes of this series in Action Channels, I have to say from all the shows that I've seen ADV released, this is one of the best shows of all time. I had to see it again and that is when I got my chance. I bought the whole box of this series, the Best Buy, for my 20th birthday. And I could enjoy it and see more episodes I made with Channel Channel and the same 3 episodes I've seen. My favorite characters in this show are: Sylvia, Leon and Nigel. The animation of this series was the best and the hard costumes were cool too. But there is an excellent voice at the exhibition: Chris Patton, Jason Douglas, Christine Auten and Hillary The Hague and others. So if you like this exhibition in Action Channel, you have to have it on DVD. That's the best, and you see what I mean.
