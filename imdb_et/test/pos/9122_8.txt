Before that, it was a movie, and indeed Rifif like it had an obvious effect on it, but Red Circle is more than just another entry in an overcrowded genre, and with this film, Jean-Pierre Melville has managed to create something so exciting on the ground and give his audience something to think about . Being cool, it is just as important to have a modern crime movie as a weapon and gangster, and Melville is making this movie droves; the film's tone is too relaxed and Melville allows most of the film to be bubbled under a cool exterior. The story has several angles, but the central character is Corey - a thief who is released from prison. His release coincides with the escape of the notorious murderer Vogel, who slides under the nose of police chief Mattei while on the train. The first thing Corey does during the release is to steal his former boss Rico's money and the other thing he does is recruit Vogel and the boss to help him pull the jewel. But Rico and the police are hot on thieves' tails ... <br /> <br /> The film has been put together with four great central performances. Alain Delon is calm and calculates the film as an anti-hero while Gian Maria Volontè looks like she has escaped a murderer. François Périer is also good as a dubious club owner, while the actual status is André Bourvil as his police chief. The film lasts almost two and a half hours and is not just an exciting journey. At the same time, the director keeps things interesting while keeping the essential elements of the activity. The film contains criminal movie images, such as shootings, but they are kept to a minimum. Indeed, the first two-thirds of the film is just the end of an endless hunt-scene. Rififs was the most famous series of heroes - a sophisticated scene where no one speaks a word. The film's thoughts are similar because it is also speechless and I have to say that I prefer the scene in Rififi; but Melville's skill in the direction and calm and compositional way it plays is for that. The film tends to reach an exciting peak that rounds it nicely. In general, it may not turn to all fans of criminals because it is more than slow; but Red Circle is a great movie and deserves its reputation as a masterpiece.
