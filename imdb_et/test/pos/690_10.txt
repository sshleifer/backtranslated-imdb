I was looking forward to seeing the usual British rigid lips stereotypes and I was surprised to find a dialogue with very natural and black humor. It was more like Eastenders going to sea than what we serve. Approach and attack scenes are remarkably realistic in the images of the battle ship and shipyard (at least based on my service in the 1970s). Some sketch lines are very witty ("I don't connect with Hope Band to please some fatty fishers!) My only complaint is that they didn't show what happened to Irish coxswain and her bride or tattooed PO and her" I Love Arabella "tattoo!
