The opening of the conveyor belt at the bank could be said to be a great film. <br /> <br /> Minimalist touch with the twist of this movie creates style - brilliant camera - working, acting, scripting and the way the protagonist's secret life opens, all complementing each other to make the best Italian movie I've ever seen (from there with La Stanza Del Figlio - though different). <br /> <br /> Shame on people who sit behind me who made it clear that they don't see the importance of slow but painfully beautiful scenes carefully designed by the camera. Don't miss.
