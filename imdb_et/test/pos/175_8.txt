An interesting comic book on the "Cadavra Lost Skeleton" DVD. I especially like how color was used in the background art - it is very artistic for Columbia, whose cartoon department was generally very low (and the results looked great!) <br /> <br /> I don't know, but how sure ... um , finger gesture ... never went past censors. In this case, this gesture was seen much less frequently in 1937 than it is now. You think someone other than the animators would have noticed it, especially since it is viewed three times in the scene! And given the context, I suspect that its involvement was deliberate, something that the animators slipped to see if the censors would mark it!
