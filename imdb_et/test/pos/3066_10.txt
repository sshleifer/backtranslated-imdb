Mel Brooks is really about this movie. No one can deny that the Blazing saddles were a classic and breakthrough in this comedy film style, but Men In Tights has become the peak of his creative gene. This movie is a must-see. If you enjoy this movie, I would also recommend Space Balls and World History. The same is true in the opposite direction. If you have seen any of these movies, Men In Tights should be on your list.
