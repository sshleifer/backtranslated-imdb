The biggest movie ever. <br /> <br /> How is this a dispute? If we look at it only cinematically, it is clear that the three-color red is a masterpiece. That alone is not enough - the three-color red is the masterpiece of world cinema. If you agree that citizen Kane is not enough person if you agree that Star Wars is not really good when you agree that Ozu and Mizoguchi have to step back, the three-color red is the main masterpiece of all time. In the discussion of human morality, the three colors of red intense metaphysical levels, the depth of which does not fit. Blue went almost as far into the human psyche, but stopped because the rabbit pulled out of the hat. White forced us to think about equality for humanity - it was even better retrospectively, but still not quite there. But red is the real thing. What he expresses in this film expresses the nature of man. In fact, what he expresses is, _how_, that it is a human being. It forces us to look into details, the nature of our soul, our ethical self. In red, one can find meaning from one of its multiple levels. At the first level, Red achieves a high level of blood simulations - we didn't have any problems when we called Red's exceptionally fun story. But the film-like coincidences and perceptions make us watch the movie. Kieslowski says, "Ceci n'est pas la réalité". In fact, Kieslowski can challenge reality in achieving a humanistic goal. It is a trick that Kieslowski has tried since Le Double Vie de Véronique, but not only when he got his final movie, he finally managed to get into this divine destiny, philosophy, and circumstance. The actors and actors also seem to have the power of greater power. Valentine (Irène Jacob) is a terribly name because she seems to be almost pure love. Meanwhile, Judge Kern, the judge of Jean-Louis Tritignand, who is the central man who finally becomes an almost universal observer of events - a character who seems to have the power to bring characters together - can make people happy, the power that he can only achieve through Valentine . <br /> <br /> We have the ability to see movies more than just pictures. In fact, films have the potential to have more meaning than literature. Of course, this does not happen, but at least we have the right to watch this movie knowing that it gives us the power to achieve something we cannot define, but everyone has it. In the summary of this movie, it was read: "A movie about a woman running across a dog". Well, that's it. <br /> <br /> Isn't it? <br /> <br /> -Simon Huxtable <br /> <br />
