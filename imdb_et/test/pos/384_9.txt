<br /> <br /> "Allows you to exchange murders - your wife, my father" - a seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers - Bruno Anthony and Guy Haines when they meet on a train trip during lunch. Guy, a solid, respectable tennis player whose problem is that his wife, the flirtatious Miriam, won't leave her so she can marry her senator's daughter Anne, laughs all over the conversation. Next week, he will not laugh anymore. In the classic Hitchcock Arbitration scene, Bruno will stop Miriam through the carnival and stifle her. As he does, his glasses fall off and we see that the murder is reflected twice through his lenses. With a cold heart and immoral Bruno, his part of the deal is ready, approaching the terrible Guy, waiting for pressure to "do his bit." The questions do not help if Anne's predecessor and pronounced younger sister turns to doubt that the Guy of Miriam is a murder. So he is accused of murder, which he did not take and assumes that he will put what the Guy intends to do? The power of this film is in the presentation of human beings, which has a murderous nature - and this is Hitchcock's perfection.
