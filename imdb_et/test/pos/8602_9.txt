I didn't really focus on the story of bigger genocide aspects (although the terrible images are very powerful at first). I was really taken by the humanity of the girl and her family. Imagine living your life without knowing if you have a time bomb inside you. I was really troubled to see that Yasuko was "frustrated" by the bomb. The lasting picture of me is mostly when Yasuko is standing in front of the mirror, yelling at her hair, looking quietly to see it appear on the piece.
