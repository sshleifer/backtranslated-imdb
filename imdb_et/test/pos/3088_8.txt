After that movie, I saw it hard to understand why so many people hate this movie. I'm not saying it's part of the top 250 of all time, but it's a great movie in the genre. I know that many people don't see the fun of seeing the legendary story of "Robin Hood" as comedy. Many people still think some things should not laugh ... they are wrong. <br /> <br /> Mel Brooks has done an excellent job with Robin Hood. I've also seen original Robin Hood movies, but I never had the time I could see them. It's just one of the fun moments and parodies of famous people and movies (Winston Churchil, The Godfather ...). For those who think Robin Hood shouldn't be confused, you're wrong, but better if you don't see it, because it's probably offended. I'll give this movie 8/10.
