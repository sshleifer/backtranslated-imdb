Right there. A good, entertaining and precise era for most scenes. Sufficient personality variations are enough to cover the real people over these days without exceptions. Credits show Peralta Mar Vista, California .. upland from Venice and south of Malibu. I lived there in the days of Heartbreak Hotel, before Beachboys, this surfer's boy, Bob Cooper, at Wasatch Avenue, where sidewalks were used to burn incombustible boards. The old skatekey skatewheels were used for the rolling of pavement waves. Things were different over the next decade, because the cool innocence of the fifties drove into the sun's warm water-free freedom and the joy of the electric sixties, and then surprisingly innovative gameplay and inventive seventies of evolutionary madness. The film gives you a piece of such a magical moment; where the imaginary wave was real .. the source of culturally significant influences. And BTW, there is another movie that is similar to the American street edginess of it, and has the same truly unique goodness, with a backward reality that helps refine that difficult eternal feeling cool .. "Two Lane Blacktop" (one of the best examples of freelance attitude on the west coast of California, Dennis Wilson). As Monte Hellman did, thanks to SP for being with you. GWR
