It is difficult to put the tragic beauty of the cartoon into words, partly because I still understand myself for several hours after the second look. First of all, it must be said that Traffik contains some of the most incomparably and unforgettably haunted scenes I've seen in film or television production. Operation is great, especially against Bill Paterson as a British Minister of Heroin Dependency and a Pakistani Package, which depends on drug issues. The second plot line describes these drug problems on the Pakistani ground and revolves around a struggling opium poppy farmer and his interaction with a successful heroin smuggler. The third main story is the prosecution of the Hamburg drug importer and the controversial efforts of his wife and two German detective during the trial. It is a profound achievement that the interaction of these stories seems natural, going beyond the forced plot harassment often found in Hollywood films. An even greater achievement is that the work shared by the three countries and half a dozen main characters can be so focused and appealing, without the need for simplification. It's devastating - gloomy and brutal, but never apathetic. In short, Traffik is a rare film that deals with challenging issues with unbalanced compassion and clarity.
