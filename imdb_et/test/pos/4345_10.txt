This movie is a truly classic 80s movie! Must be in the 80's movie collection! Guns, bad guys, CREEPS, gangs, CHARLES BRONSON and more CREEPS !!!! <br /> <br /> I think it's the best Death Wish movie. Tones of non-stop action! <br /> <br /> And following the classic 80's "bad men and good men" movie - this movie is nothing but a norm and all about weapons and CREEPS! We see Bronson mowing hell and CREEPS with 30 caliber Korean heavy machine gun! THE HIGHEST HEIGHT TO VISIT! When Charlie ends up with heavy machine gun ammunition, he runs back to his crib and takes over his long-range pistol weapons! This gun can stop the little ELEPHANT and Charlie puts bad guys in the size of the holes in the ring caps! And if that is not enough, Charlie also packs an anti-tank-grenade launcher, which, incidentally, is good only when he gets CREEPS together. <br /> <br /> The action of this movie is "ha ha" big and a lot off the wall actors (mostly playing CREEPS) appear all over the movie! The film has a memorable one liner and scene! Heck, my favorite scene / line is where CREEP leader Broseon is in prison and explains to him calmly, "Tell you what I'm doing ... I'll kill a little old lady ... just for you! ... try this clock Monthly News ". <br /> <br /> Is this movie violent? Heck yes! But you laugh and shine all the time !!!!
