The quiet film masterpiece Battleship Potemkin (1925) was ordered by the Soviet government to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the 1905 uprising and to create an event for the heroic prediction of the October 1917 Revolution. Ironically, the film's director Sergei Eisenstein was one of the first and most influential advocates of the official approach to film art. Then Eisenstein's formality and suspect policy would cause countless conflicts with government agencies that call for "socialist realism". Russian film theoretician Lev Kuleshov and his impulse, influenced by Dw Griffith's intolerance (smuggled into Russia in 1919), built his films quickly in the "collision" of edited images, editing length, motion, content, lighting and camera angle. Undoubtedly, the most memorable example of Eisenstein's stylistic approach - and probably the only mentioned and studied sequence in world cinema history - is the sequence of "Odessa Steps" in Potemkin. <br /> <br /> In the Potemkin structure, "five reelers" are divided into five narrative parts, an organization that is clearly derived from the organization of the five actions of the Western drama. In "Men and Maggots", Eisenstein dramatizes the revolutionary oppression and dissatisfaction of sailors in the battleship's working class, as the situation is inevitably based on rebellion. Even before the visual introduction of the sailor and their superiors / masters, Eisenstein creates revolutionary conditions symbolically when the waves breaking at sea break. On board, we are familiar with crowded, non-sanitary conditions. Eisenstein emphasizes the dehumanization of sailors with arbitrary ties, harsh labor, and, with more memorable, contagious meats for infected breeds. Other officers bring the doctor to the vicinity of the ship that meat is well suited to serving dark soup, boiling like a sailor's rage. According to the Marxist maxims, the Church also fails to meet men and we see that one of them crushes a disc written by the Lord in words from two different corners of the camera (perhaps the first deliberate "jump" in cinema history). br /> <br /> Identify "Drama Quarterdeck" and "The Dead Appeal", where the second and third parts of Potemkin represent the actual rebellion of the leader and the first hero of the revolution and burial on land. , Vakulinchuk. At Vakulinchuk's calls to the Brotherhood, all the original shelters joined the entire team for attack against officers. A destructive scene with violent passion well with Eisenstein's editorial techniques. The officers' premises have been cut and the symbols of these privileges are destroyed. The ship's doctor is thrown overboard, with dramatic cross-sections associated with a tomb chamber with meat and his glasses that are metonymically hanging. Tragically, Vakolinchuk's death is the price paid for the rebellion (no eggs to break without the omelette) and he is dignified on the Odessa mule. Hundreds of ordinary Odessa citizens gather together with a sailor to honor him and allow "oppressive people to die". Fist-fusing and undisturbed images show the birth of a revolutionary consciousness. <br /> <br /> The complex and unforgettable sequence of Odessa steps is the fourth act of the movie. It begins with the rising music and the faces and selected objects (sun umbrellas, glasses, baby trolleys) chosen by many close relatives and various people living near the beach. Suddenly (as the headline in large letters calls), the music stops of rifles and fixed bayonet soldiers at the top of the steps appear. Here, Eisenstein unleashes the full force of collision editing, as a total of nearly a hundred frames have been put together to contrast the panic-induced chaos and the attack of a citizen-victimized soldier who drives citizens down to trampling horses and awaiting coffins. The Caesar scene is shaped by the Caesar statue at the top of the stairs and the church at the bottom, symbolic metonyms for the oppressive institutions of Russia: the Tsarist monarchy and the Orthodox Christian church. The queue is two scenes covering mothers and children. In the first, the mother and the young boy, who were included in the crowd's cheerful faces, were the first victims of killing. The boy is allowed to leave, but the mother continues to drive until the close-ups of his face give his terrifying gaze to the boy's fallen body that the crowd is bouncing. With a much slowed editing rate, the camera follows the mother when she moves her child's lifeless body up the stairs to face the soldiers (shown only on the diagonal shadow line). They're shooting him dead. After this plague, the carnage continues with a dozen more pieces until the second mother is passed through the stomach (mother of the mother of Russia?), When she tries to protect her child with her cargo. In a scene that imitates Untouchables, the carriage slides down the stairs. The frightened faces of astonished citizens are slowly monitoring progress. When a lorry reaches the bottom, a sword-hidden cossack is cut and Kuleshov's classic effect refers to what we really don't see: its pure and symbolic innocent killing. In Odessa, another series of final shots has three stone lions, one in the background, one sitting and one roaring. Editing will enliven them into the visual metaphor of awakened rage. <br /> <br /> In the fifth act, the battleship will return somewhat, as frightening sailors will flee offshore and wait for a fleet with other ships. They and the viewer are waiting for revenge, but when the meeting takes place, no frame is shot and all sailors are flying and throw their hats into the air as a symbol. At this point, Eisenstein wrote about history because the revolution was not launched for another twelve years. But the battleship Potemkin is one of the basic works of the silent film era and retains exceptional cinematic power.
