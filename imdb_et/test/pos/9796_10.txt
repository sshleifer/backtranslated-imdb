Where do I start? I saw this movie for the first time in 1995 and I had no idea what to expect, I was actually looking for the movies Elijah Wood had played and it was highly recommended. I sat and watched the movie once and didn't know what to think. I looked at it a few days later the second time and the doors opened. Never before, when I was watching a movie, I had ever lived, and I was bursting, every high and low film I drove right on an emotional skater. <br /> <br /> It struck such an emotional chord at many levels in me, the intense sadness and elation we see in the film, the miracle of childhood and innocence, the longing for the time that was once, but no longer. More than anything, this film reminded me of my childhood (except abuse) during my life, when I looked at my childhood a few years ago and did not even notice, I gave it and went on to life that it lacks. The radio flyer made me wake up and suddenly realize what I gave up without even noticing. From that day on, I immediately began to change my life and myself, and I did it. <br /> <br /> It starts to sound, but basically I discovered my inner child again, started running the current road for the last 6 years and I've changed so much, so much better that part of this part and lived. I've learned who I really are. I don't think it was just the right movie case in my life at the moment, the radio flyer really did something very special and I still look at it as an incredible work in every respect, an incredible movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, I can't mention music. I'm a big fan of Hans Zimmer and it's one of his best works. The plethora and depth of emotional expression that he has put into this film is a big part of what makes the film for me. Like subtitles for a foreign language movie, his growing music is a crib page for intense emotions that this film takes you through. Find the soundtrack for all the costs, it was unfortunately deleted a long time ago, I never expected it, but it did amazingly when I talked to someone I met in Hans Zimmer's fan scrapbook. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, let yourself live in emotions, don't end up with trivial nitpick, watch this child
