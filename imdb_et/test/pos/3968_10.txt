When I saw this movie, I expected it to be an American film made with cheap terrible actors. I was really surprised that I was totally wrong. Bartely's or B's Cinema Centers, which have been rejected by all of his colleagues - an actor who plays B's, are very natural and make their character real - and decide to set up a pretense school so that his parents stop his harassment. However, many people see their fake website and join. The feeling of these sorrows B cannot change them to the fear of their best companions. College is the perfect place to learn what you want or do nothing. The school is facing the right college opposition, which will put an end to its closure. The movie ends high and I suggest you watch it. It has drawbacks, but it is a good-looking movie with some unpredictable turns.
