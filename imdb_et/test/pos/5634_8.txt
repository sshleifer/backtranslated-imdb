What gives this film its personality is finally the knowledge that it is all true. While this is a convincing and humorous documentary that limits mockumentary in some parts (whether they are staged or really humorous?), It seems to end a bit long. <br /> <br /> The movie is funny in places where it has to be, and flows relatively well. Reminiscent of Christopher Guest's movies, if you liked them or adaptation, I suggest you watch it. <br /> <br /> B +
