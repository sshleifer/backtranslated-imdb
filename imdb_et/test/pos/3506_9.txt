Immediately before dawn, the beginning of the eighties was an undervalued horror film. I haven't seen it over the years, but it had a big impact when I looked at it, it was quite original for my day. The only problem is that it hasn't been published on video or DVD for years. If you like horror, I invite you to check this little legacy !!
