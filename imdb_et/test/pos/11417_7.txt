I liked this movie. I'm not a big horror movie buff so I couldn't comment on the similarities of this and other movies in this genre, but I found this movie quite exciting. The story, though a bit obvious, was some really frightening moments and the acting (especially female female) was not bad anyway. <br /> <br /> Overall, I'm a little surprised at this movie's low. I watch a lot of movies (working with a video store tends to help) and it's not really as bad as people think. I have some criticism. The police's last speech was terrible, almost superfluous, and the girl who died in the bathroom seemed to like to have a little sleep (probably from the taquila she mentioned) and the children's reaction to what was happening inside me. I hope they finally killed <br /> <br /> hope it helps some people
