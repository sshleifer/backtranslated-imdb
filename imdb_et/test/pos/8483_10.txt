Jamie Foxx did an incredible job with Ray Charles. I loved this movie because every time so often there would be a rebound scene and then the current movie. When Ray Charles was little, he went blind and his mother didn't get him. She was a strong woman who didn't meet her differently because she was blind. He made him himself things that really pushed him into a great musician later. His mother also sent him to school. When Ray Charles became a man, he could stand for himself and take care of himself, but a decrease in drugs, sex and betrayal. When I have dared to do something, I just think of this film and it inspires me.
