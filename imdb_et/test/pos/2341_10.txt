A truly accurate and strange look in today's life. It can be assigned to any city in the UK. <br /> <br /> I live in a residential area in Glasgow and can communicate very well with this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, situations and signs are too realistic, but not predictable. <br /> <br /> The actors are incredibly incredible, I felt like I was spying on smiles. It was intimate in the lives of weak and hopeless people. I had very few scenes. <br /> <br /> I loved playing this movie. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie must be black.
