If you are OK, if Italy's main horror leader is extreme work that can absorb his outrageous story and amazing styles? If you don't, it won't. <br /> <br /> Cristina Marsillach plays Betty, a beautiful young opera, who has become famous (in the production of Macbeth's avant-garde) when the star of the show hits the car. Because all those who know the boards know Macbeth's production, which carries a curse, and Betty will soon discover that the exhibition he is currently on is no exception: the killer is systematically absent. theater and poor Betty are forced to look at a sadistic murderer (who strikes the needles under his eyes to prevent him from closing!). <br /> <br /> With a little girl crawling through her air-ordering channels, her manager and agent, and some slaves to see the murderers (!!!), Betty discovers the killer's identity and truth about her mysterious past. <br /> <br /> Let's face it ... Opera is one crazy movie with redundant lines, twisted death scenes and an end that spurs faith. And even though the director Dario Argento has never been, let's say that the usual readers, this particular giallo is so harsh and it has so much of its own brand of stylish touches (all ramped up to the maximum) that it is almost like, with every successive film it sees what he can get away (sometimes almost parodying his previous work). <br /> <br /> That's why I find the movie so fun !!! <br /> <br /> The movements of the Argento camera are absolutely unbelievable: slipping, slipping and in one amazing scene, even around the opera house around the audience; The power of Verdi's music is perfectly combined with Claudio Simonetti's score with the majesty of the event, offering a suitably grandiose addition to the rich visuals; and several outstanding kits (with Sergio Stivalett's nausea gore FX) to prove that no one is doing better than Argento (look at the stunning one character, where the ball passes through the moving door slowly) and directly into the eye!). <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.
