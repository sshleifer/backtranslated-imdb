Nobody will ever doubt that director Leos Carax is a genius, but what we don't know is: is he crazy brilliant? So many people hated this movie! I am usually the first person to blame many French filmmakers for offensive, boring, disgusting and pretentious films (such as the terrible recent film "L'Enfant" and meaningless and offensive "Feux Rouges"). But strangely enough, I think "Pola X" is an amazing film made with great skill and passion for his handicraft master and featuring remarkable performances. The film carries melodrama to more extreme lengths when I believe I've ever seen on the screen. But then, Carax is extreme that we know. The film also includes what I consider to be the general of trotsky or anarchist fantasies and wet dreams, together with a mysterious group of young men who train fire machines in bourgeoisie to play Scott Walker's rather exciting music band, which has recording sessions in an abandoned store full of splashes and fire in old steel barrels. Guillaume Depardieu is played by a rich young man in the church (whose step-mother is Catherine Deneuve and she travels in the bathroom when she is naked in the bath by the way). But he suddenly "clicks" completely when he discovers that his dead father, the famous diplomat, was the father's illegitimate daughter who was effectively eliminated by Deneuve as discomfort. The reason for this is that the nurse suddenly rises as a Romanian refugee with natural unpleasant hair, an unexpressed face and little ability to speak French consistently. Then Depardieu transforms himself into a left-wing "class hero" and wants to kill or destroy his family for hypocrisy and corruption, and lives in quiet and extreme poverty, while a large number of legacies. He then starts blood vessel sexual relations with his half-sister, which is shown in an explicit sex scene that has attacked many people, although I do not oppose it because I think people are too hysterical about sex, especially in America, where it probably won't happen. The intensity of action and filming makes this unlikely scenario a powerful, as depressing, hyper-melodrama experience. The differences between Carax's extreme film and many extreme French films, which I think they are terrible and disgusting, are (1) that Carax is a great filmmaker and (2) he is serious about exploring a mental, as harassing, extreme emotional state where a person breaks down and turns against his background. Many would say that the extreme elements of this movie were free, but I disagree. I believe Carax was real and didn't take a picture of exploitation at all. It is very difficult to protect a man who goes so far and who can be totally crazy for me, but I believe he deserves to be protected from this remarkable cinematographic achievement.
