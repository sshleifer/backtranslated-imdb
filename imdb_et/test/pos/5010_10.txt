After watching the series show with the Talk Show with Spike Feresten, I took the time to really think that besides SNL there are really good shows besides SNL and I was sad to see that it was only 30 minutes long. His great writing skills helped to overcome the money supply and the helping hand at this show. Electronic Lincoln was fun and I really think it's a good Dark Horse Talk Show. <br /> <br /> I was very pleased with how he treated it and gave Andy Richtor a good job of working. As you would have suspected, it was a little trembling, but for this type of time slot it was very good. <br /> <br /> Generally, if you are not a weed or even if you are and you have nothing more important than watching this great piece and having fun.
