This is a stunning movie. Raw and sublimely moves. It seemed very engaging, intelligent playing the stage (but without the excessive theatrical sensation that the person observes on the stage) that plays everyone's white lies with frightening consequences. All major players are mesmerizing. Tom Wilkinson broke at the end of my heart ... and everyone else decided how much hands and hands have grown between men and women. Julian Fellowes has won again. He's a national treasure. Gosford Park, Vanity Fair, Mary Poppins ... and now it's. Can't He Wrong?! Go and see it! This is a movie for real adults.
