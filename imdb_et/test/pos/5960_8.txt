This is probably one of the best French films I've seen for a very long time! This "pastiche" or spy movie parody is very well done and will make you laugh from start to finish. Some references to the modern world are very fine. The entire Moroccan context movie must be understood in the light of today's French culture / environment. This means that all the jokes and - seemingly shocking remarks that could have been understood in this context - are allowed and accepted because it is a parody. I was told that my sisters had already seen this movie, that I should go and assured me that I had a good time and indeed I had! If you liked the old 007 movies with Sean Connery and movies like Airplane or Hot Shots, you are happy. I hope this movie will appear on DVD in the US ... Wait and see.
