One of the finishing touches of this film's ending ends with "Only for big fans of exotic novels / adventure movies ..." by "as if there wasn't enough reason to love them!" Anyone who, after seeing this film, complains about Connery's lack of accent or historical credibility, or the realism of political motivation or some other extra-movie, just doesn't love movies. Take a look at it and don't forget the power of two support, exotic, romantic, photography and music, and the bold adventure of a truly evocative movie. This proves that Hollywood can "do" as they used to be. Solid 8/10.
