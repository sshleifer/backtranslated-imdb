Alfred Hitchcock's Saboteur is not one of his best films; made between two very popular and critically acclaimed images, the shadow of suspicion and suspicion is generally considered to be smaller. I agree that the later film is groundbreaking, pulling Hitchcock for the first time to the American mainstream, but Saboteur is at least as lively on his roads as doubt; its main mistake is less than charismatic star players Bob Cummings and Priscilla Lane. In Saboteur, we find that Hitchcock literally feels around in America because his lead moves in search of California for a New York criminal for whom he was charged. Cummings is very youthful and quite appealing here. His sibling (but not immaturity) fits perfectly into what he represents, and it seems appropriate, because the director, though medieval, was reinventing himself and the older, more created star could throw things away. Priscilla Lane's heroic heroine, which was not a typical type of director, was a very common type in American films; and he and Cummings offer the openness and youth the director needs in his life as well as in his work. I can't imagine older, stronger types, such as Cooper and Stanwycki - doing better than they would, between them, well, too much luggage. <br /> <br /> As it is the norm in Hitchcock movies, there is nothing like it will appear. If Saboteur is different from his better known movies, the audience is at the beginning of the game. Although Cummings is the accused incriminator, we know he is innocent. Roisto appears quite soon; and the film depends more on its plot than its iron. What pleasures are random and here the Master is not disappointing. It's an interesting circus freak between Tod Browningish and Cummings. In the second scene, reminiscent of James Whale's Frankens bride, Cummings will spend some time in a blind man's cottage, which, as it turns out, is Lane's uncle. Maybe the director can study the main American films of the last decade? Regardless of the fact that these and other extraterrestrial and discourse aspects of the film give him playfulness and diversity, which, when the factor of ever-younger leaders adds to the image, seems to be the work of a younger man while still learning his crafts. <br /> <br /> The film's later scenes in New York are finer and more typical for the director, as the picture gradually becomes Hitchockian when it moves. Finally, I find this a satisfactory job; and as neither Cummings nor Lane has the blind side or the film as an actor. It is deliberately light and I suspect a semi-test; Hitchcock's attempt to see if he could pull out a story in the American environment that he had done so well in England. He succeeded perfectly. The next logical step: the shadow of a doubt, a film whose main character drives east to the west and has completely different values ​​and plans. <br /> <br />
