It was a really interesting Halloween movie. I wasn't excited about the whole Thorn theory, but it's still a good movie. I liked seeing Tommy Doyle back, but unfortunately Donald Pleasance died right after the shot. The film really had a very bad director, who didn't give the series, what I heard Donald was bad about, and didn't let Daniel return Haram to Jamie. It's like he was just trying to cut the movie, but I liked it. There were a lot of cuts and changes in music, and if you're lucky, you can cut producers over 40 min. Never before scenes. For these scenes, it becomes a completely new film. Check if you have the opportunity.
