When the movie first started, I thought cheesy. The first ten minutes were really boring. After a slow start and some soap opera, I started to like it. The plot was different from what I have ever seen. Was it horror now? Not quite. It shouldn't have been categorized as horror, or the producers should have done the movie to make it scary. As it were, beings with only a short time. I can only assume that it was for financial reasons. <br /> <br /> The good thing was that the movie was a lot of fun. It was in my interests (after the start) and made me think of beings from another dimension. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that it was the director's first film, but there was a couple of highlights. Finally I was hooked. Too bad Hollywood didn't bring more money for it.
