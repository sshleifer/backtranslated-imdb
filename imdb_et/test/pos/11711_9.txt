According to a tradition of "Neo" film, such as "Chinatown", this film focuses on a criminal who is a grim field with a little understanding of what is mixed. Typical Noir characters, including a cop, to prove yourself, trouble and a bad boy. Sharky's Machine gets its cinematography out first, plus its direction, story, strong character and excellent jazz score. Available on DVD, although the sound is self-printed (but available at some auction). Filmed in a beautiful Atlanta city center (writer Diehl's hometown) and without changing the city, around 1979. The appearance of the old-time Atlanta citizen or visitor would be a long time before the 12-lane alternates between the city, the operator's dream at that time. It was Rachel Ward's first US feature film.
