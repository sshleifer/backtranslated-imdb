To be honest with IMDb reviewers, I enjoyed this example a lot. The reason? Well, he didn't try to be more than that; I mean, with a regular expectation, a sitcom, a well-known and repetitive plot, funny and talented actors and cunning jokes that target the college's post environment. <br /> <br /> This is what Grown Ups is all about: Try Jaleel White is as funny as ever and offers funny and fun sex words. Humor is very 90 years old, without considering the new millennium trends, and this is, in my opinion, the main reason why the exhibition did not succeed. It stuck in the 90s. <br /> <br /> And Mrs Ribisi was really funny and perky. <br /> <br /> My favorite show must be the Karma bite! Not a cult classic, but I'm sure it's part of the regular nostalgia of early 2000.
