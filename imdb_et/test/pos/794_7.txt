This subway film is an episodic but almost continuous series that attempts to escape to the police, be it real or imaginary, as Buster is wrong with the escaped offender. It's constantly inventive and fun. Its greatest value is in documenting what Hollywood saw in the early twenties, because 95% of it is shot outside the streets and exterior of the building. Here is one gem moment and one pearl sequence. <br /> <br /> The great moment is when the train at a great distance approaches the camera quickly and stops short of it - when Buster sits on a cow guard and thus moves with a long shot at close-ups for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> A large number of queues on the phone cab next to the elevator car - one is constantly wrong against the floor, floor to floor - one of the great Keaton gags. <br /> <br /> Cinema print is sharp and clear - almost pristine. There is a violin / piano point broadcast. It's one to look for and enjoy.
