"N - io e Napoleone" screened for the press at the Rome Film Festival is easy to love. First of all, it can count on high production values, because today there are very few Italian movies with great settings and costumes. The cast is also great. Director Virzì constantly talks about young leaders Elio Germano as "young De Niro". Now, of course, he goes too far, but he is sure the boy can act. I loved her action and she did a great job (Tuscan) accent. Daniel Auteuil is a great actor and very well with Bonaparte. It's really nice to see her in Italian, I hope to see her very soon in Italy. Supporting light worked well - people, like Valerio Mastrandrea or Sabrina Impacciatore, may seem unlikely choices, but they all gave great performances. Even Massimo Ceccherini, the best known when he appeared in his moral movies and tricky television reality, fits well and was actually funny. The low point of the pain was "Diva" Monica Bellucci. Of course he was a little better than usual, but he managed to look (and sound) completely unnaturally even in Baronessa Emilia, where he used good weeds with his weed. The sculpture, veteran Furio Scarpelli and Virzì himself, are wise, with lots of laughter and some very emotional moments. Of course, the end ended up confusing me. The message is ambiguous: the whole movie says that political ideals can bring you to hatred of the blind, but when you get closer you will find out that the object of your hatred is, after all, a small person like everyone else, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes pathetic, so sad maybe it's hard to hate her; then in the last few minutes it is said that after that it would have been better to shoot him in the beginning. Personally, I do not like this concept very much. "Io e Napoleone" is still a pleasant film that has been introduced to the festival so far (the second is fur and the devil). My rating is 8/10
