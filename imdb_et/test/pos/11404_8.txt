I was skeptical before I started it because of a terribly put together trailer, which made it look like a terrible movie. I was pretty surprised how much I didn't waste my money. I believe that the success of movies is due to how horrible it really is and how the house environment is. Small things like sensor lights create a real restless feeling. House shadows and cold feelings make it easy to say that no matter how much you know about horror movies, something can happen in the movie. Operation is not perfect or bad. The main character is convincing even by the tedious dramas surrounding him. Finally, I was impressive in most aspects of the film. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a movie I would recommend.
