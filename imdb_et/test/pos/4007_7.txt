I watched the attack attack religiously for about 6 months (maybe longer, but not much). I was very attracted to Olivia and found that Kevin is very witty and the repertoire is very good between them. Lately, when it starts to wear thin due to many factors. First of all, my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called "Around The Net", which shows 5 video clips that you find on a site like Youtube, which is generally funny, or people who find themselves inadvertently (some deliberately). Umm, when I looked 4 to 5 times a week, shows the same things over and over again, I haven't really seen anything good and I can only laugh at people who are likely to break their neck and paralyze so many times. The exhibition is like showing late wanting to be / Colbert Report wants to be with this policy if you don't live in a blue state and are not an automatic liberal, this humor becomes old, McCain is old, yes, yes, whatever. The lions do not have to make themselves entertained because they are not smart enough to realize that they are suffering from a sense of humor, that they can laugh themselves so that it is almost every show of bash McCain or Palin, sheesh. So we get the same old people who get hurt, we should laugh and then some left-wing political humor who never laughs at his own weakness. I watch because I look at work and it's all turned on, hoping to entertain me, but it gets pretty old. I liked filling Chris and Alison's host, they were actually a good pace change; Perhaps this exhibition could make a rotating host. Olivia, whom I sometimes thought of at first, was really funny, has used this constant mutation and it is getting older. 7 out of 10; it keeps you in a young mindset that is good when you're a younger baby boom like me (in the mid-40s). Perhaps the day's comic would be another segment they should do, there are many things they could use.
