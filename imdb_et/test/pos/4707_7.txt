I would give this film a strong strength. 7. Although it is certainly not the biggest movie or even one of the best films it has (Killing Fields is better), it tries to give it at least. <Br /> <br /> I think Laura's introduction to Burma was a bit of a pleasure. First of all, Burma is not the easiest to visit, especially in the late 1980s. Secondly, if you had made it to Birma, your passport would not disappear. A reasonable person would be sure they would know where their passport was always. With that in mind, I'm sure the scriptwriter knew it was weak but needed something. Patricia Arquette's performance was underestimated and I just didn't buy her as a doctor. But at least he did not cross the role that often happens in such films. U Aung Ko was good, but also undervalued. The end result is hard to follow because most of the dialogue is in Burma and people are translating Laura. Laura would have been difficult and difficult for the viewer. Another plus is a strong SE-Asian landscape in a movie that was pleasant to see.
