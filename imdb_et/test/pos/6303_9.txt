Le conseguenze dell'amore (2004) is a beautifully crafted film that takes small, carefully placed steps to its end, to be enjoyed. From contrasting landscapes to a tightly closed world where the hero lives, we take over the director and control it from the moment we enter the hotel. We, as a hero, never get out of the stifling intensity and paradoxical monotony of the mafia world of our offender. Because the film tends to resist the mafia stereotypes while discovering them, it makes it even more successful. The tomb of concrete, the inevitable brutal executions and the overwhelming maleness are exposed and exhibited for what they are. Just brutality and business and no more. Life is part of organized crime, not organized crime, not love or life for oneself, family or others. Our hero is really a hero because he is giving up his life because of a touch of a beautiful assassin, his only neighbors to deal with the suffering suffered by the hotel, and the escape of a decorative prison. The consequences of love are indeed beautiful and cruel. Look at this!!
