The opening image of love love creates this intriguing and absorbing film. The Traveler slowly moves the lonely out towards the camera, preventing him from having a huge suitcase behind him. As the film's central character, we don't know anything about it and our original interpretation of his profession, the contents of the suitcase may be out of the mark. <br /> <br /> The consequences of love are such a movie. The title can be expected to separate Bergmanesq. Instead, we are the leading character, Titta, who lives in emotional exile by choosing from herself. If the film could be categorized in some way, I would call it a mystery because we deal with who is Titta and what she is. What we know from the beginning is 50 years old, cool, intuitive and costly. She has lived in a soft Swiss hotel for the last eight years, always paying her room fee on time, but rarely shows interest in employees or other guests. <br /> <br /> His only real companion is the couple who plays random card games. It turned out that the couple had a hotel, but now they have all played and only have a room where they live on the left. Their love for money, antiques, and each other was their withdrawal, and Titta seems to be in trouble. She was once all but now she lives in a hotel as a virtual prisoner. His brother, a long-haired surfer, falls to see him from time to time, but he sees his visits more than an invasion as a joy. They say that Titta sees her as her best friend, even though she hasn't seen her for 25 years. This long lost friend is now a phone engineer who is improving so many interconnected communications networks. Meanwhile, Tittas' phone calls to her husband and children will end soon if they refuse to talk to her. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the movie, Titta makes an unusual movement and starts to open a young bar at the hotel. With his decision about what emotions are dulling, he sets himself up for actions that ultimately seal his fate for good. <br /> <br /> The slow opening of Tittas under grace is beautifully scripted, shot and kicked. The exciting techno-soundtrack makes a lot of tension as more and more secrets appear, the last half hour becoming a taught thriller when Titta lets her mask slip and cope with the consequences of her actions. The ending, visually with the arrow to Felin, is dramatic, but ambiguous, and leaves the audience once again questioning his motives. <br /> <br /> Patrick Bliss, 01/06/06
