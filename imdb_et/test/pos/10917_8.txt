I looked at it again after I didn't see it for the first time ('97) and it still made me laugh. It's skillfully written, Kevin Kline and Joan Cusack are both perfect in their roles, and if you can watch and not break Bob Newhart in this movie, you're more than a man. <br /> <br /> That means I think the scenes where Tom Selleck kisses Kevin Kline, where Kevin Kline listens to "How to be a man" cassette, and post-(almost) wedding scenes with Joan Cusack There are three more fun scenes in all movies. <br /> <br /> Of course, the last scene is a bit of an excuse for a happy ending, but ... some movies are perfect.
