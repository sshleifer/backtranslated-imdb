My yardstick for measuring film tracking is when I get tired. When I start changing positions and notice that my butt is painful, the film is too long. This movie wasn't even boring. Some are predictable but never boring. They are certainly underestimated until the day your boat sinks. <br /> <br /> The movie was very enjoyable and fun. Kevin Costner is perfect as an aging macho man who doesn't know when to give up. However, I was most impressed with Ashton Kutcher's performance. I've never liked her, never watched her TV shows, and she'd never considered her immature ... well, punk. In this film he does a good job! He is well on the road to leading human status. I think the film shown must be unprocessed or something, because about two-thirds of the roads, the film stock became very grainy, the sound level dropped and the microphones saw the whole place down. Also, at the time of the viewing, the film was sought by the audience - especially the parts of the film that we didn't like. a few lines at the beginning. Kevin Costner comes home to see his wife, Sela Ward, packing her stuff and moving out. He says, "Maybe I should be the one who moves out." And he replied, "No, you don't know where this house is, I should be one." It doesn't make sense: if he knows this scheme so well, Costner is right he must leave.
