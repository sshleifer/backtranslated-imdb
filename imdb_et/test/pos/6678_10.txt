Just watched it and it was amazing. There was serious suspicion of renting a DVD or not. So, if you are ... and as you look after the action movies ... don't be afraid anymore. Don't let the boring cover take you away. The script is one of the best. Intelligent, funny, original, touching and holding you around the seat through the film. I had been watching another movie before that, and I was really sleepy, and I usually miss watching another movie at night, but it really made me wake up and I had no boring moments. It also made me think a lot of things in life and gave me a really good feeling. <br /> <br /> The actor is also great (one of Kevin Spacey's best roles). Visuals are beautiful and the use of music is very well chosen. If I have to say something negative about it .... well .... I can't find anything ...... Enjoy! 10 out of 10
