I was really just watching this movie because it had Rupert Grint (whom I knew from Harry Potter's films Ron). I had never been Rupert as an actor before this movie. I loved the whole movie. Rupert does a wonderful job in this fun, original film. I think the film could have been left without sex, but it worked somehow. I can't wait to see more Rupert movies in the future. Julie Walters did an amazing job. He has a very small role in Harry Potter's films, so I didn't know what to expect from him. But he was as wonderful as Dame Evie. That part of his key was completely fun. In general, it's an amazing movie.
