I saw this movie at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> This is the first Indian film I've seen in Tamil, and although it shares similarities with other Indian films (great music and music). choreography, sacred description), the director tries more than just entertainment. The film speaks of Amudha, a nine-year-old whose parents reveal to him that he has been accepted, starting with the odyssey that leads them to India from war-torn Sri Lanka. A gorgeous vision that interferes with terrible scenes of violence that are clearly expressed, although it is simplified. Amudha plays P.S. Keerthana, and she is one of the few children I have seen, who may be premature and not yet annoying. His charm and beauty kept the movie together.
