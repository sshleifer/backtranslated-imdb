This film surprised me. I saw it for the first time more than 10 years ago and it remains with me. It's just the usual points, and I would have personally finished it differently - it has not made me a little discouraged by looking at it again and recommending it to others. Operation is _fantastic_. Cast and director make the script amazing work and anyone who likes "different" movies who have the patience to sit and say, "What the hell is this?" opportunity. If you want Alan Rickman to be funny or see things explode, it's not a movie for you.
