Shepitko is the wife of Russian filmmaker Elem Klimov, who led the commercially renowned 1984 film COME AND SEE, which is generally considered to be one of the most realistic warfare films that is not remarkable for poetic intensity, but I believe he lacks this even bigger Russian The intrinsic complexity of the film, which not only explores graphic external horrors, but also finds truly inspiring images that focus on individuals or small groups of characters that reflect the absolute madness of those people whose ending is simply awe-inspiring. The balls fly and the bodies die in the arms exchange on the open credit, where the intensity of the film does not allow the entire soldiers who have nothing to eat, the scared population to be occupied, the hungry mothers starving for the whole duration of the duration, all poured into a huge endless white snow landscape. Like CRANES ARE FLYING (1957), it is retreating from the Russian army, a traumatic shock at the beginning of the war when they were almost destroyed. The Russian Nazis, who are terrorizing citizens, stealing what they have, forcing them to get into their informative eyes and ears have crossed the Russian land. What Russian soldiers are considered to be hidden under forests, but they are forced to send food texts to neighboring farms. This movie is followed by two soldiers who are almost impossible on the mission from the start, because there is little food dead in winter. One is healthy and fit, Vladimir Gostyukhin as Rybak, the other, Boris Plotnikov, as Sotnikov, has slowed down the tubercular-like cough and finally the bullet that almost leaves him dead, but his partner rescues him heroically. When they pass through the deep snowstorms of the knee, some points crawl against inadequate protection against harsh elements, such as so many other Russian films, and nature itself becomes their most difficult enemy. <br /> <br /> Spoilers !! Everything decreases as a matter of survival. When they arrive at their destination, the farm is demolished and left in the rubble, pushing the German occupied territory, where the next farm is taken care of by an elderly Soviet companion who is afraid of Nazi punishment. Partisan soldiers think they are cowards, but they move on, where they are finally captured and taken to a neighboring camp in a nearby city and are held in captivity with a proud and protective mother (Lyudmila Polyakova) who helped hide them. Tarkovsky's ambush Anatoly Solonitsyn appears as an interviewer in Portnov, a Russian teacher at a nearby academy changed Nazi supporters. The Russians who torture and execute Russian fellow citizens are in the depth of warfare, and Solonitsyn is brilliant in this despicable role that he fits perfectly. From what we see when Nazi officers talk jovially in close proximity to each other, he has remained outside this group, instead seeing it as a formidable black and white entrepreneur who usually sends men to his graves. The audience is not saved from torture acts by Sotnikov, who offers something other than contempt, while Rybak speaks freely hoping to save his life, but both are dead, although Rybak is offered the opportunity to serve a German Reich police officer. This group includes a mother, an elderly companion and a child who spend the last night together in life where they discuss the benefits of a soldier's mission, patriot, mother, coward, or co-worker. Everybody seems to be led by a desperate need to survive, but Sotnikov offers himself as a self-serving example, trying to confess his guilt for others, where the suitably chosen title reflects his spiritual salvation. <br /> <br /> The next morning Portnov seems to have amused amused to talk about them unexpectedly, but none except Rybak, who is changing his life, retaining his thoughts that when he's alive, he's at least able to escape. But this torment has not escaped. What happens is a subtle delicacy and a poetic grudge when we know the betrayal of war without firing any shootings, because filling with hanging has become a public point of view where the villagers of the armed forces are forced to admit. The pace and intense intensity of this movie is relentless because Vladimir Chukhnov (who died in the same car accident as Shepitko) has never had a moment without effort. it is in the immediate vicinity, using portraits, especially the endless young boy at the end of the boy, who sees condemned men who make a surreal connection with the next generation without words emphasized by Alfred Shnittke's psychologically horrible music, similar to Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY ( 1968) transcendental but fiercely disturbing monolithic music. The sound of this film is very advanced and uniquely modern, where the use of off-tone sound constantly brings out the raw nerves of every moment, the dogs bark, the wind blowing, the balls burning, the Nazi preaching near the German translation, or laughing sadistically with their helplessness that pulls surprisingly tense to the crazy height . In many ways that resemble the Dreyer ARC-JOON PASSION (1928), here is the total insanity, the relentless understanding that you have no choice but you are forced to do so anyway. Finally, worrying internal thoughts are expressed in a word where the nobility of the dead speaks of a volume where the voices continue in the heads of the living people, such as the endless echo explosion, but only silence fills the crisp air with grievous respect and deep damage.
