Back Team A was a special screen on the 4th channel in Britain last year hosted by Head and Comedian Justin Lee Collins. The exhibition attempted to capture and reunite A-team mates for the first time on television. It's something nobody has ever tried before. Well, no one I know is. <br /> <br /> Justin makes an excellent performer and his eccentric personality and humorous torment are bright throughout this program. The tests he has done to keep the cast members are never so funny, but he was also very persistent and eager to perform the task that is a credit for him. Remember that she is always great on television - with such an exhibition, or a Friday night project with her co-host, Alan Carr. <br /> <br /> Appearances and interviews with Dirk Benedict - Faceman himself, Dwight Schultz-aka Howling Mad Murdock, Marla Heasley, who played Tawnia Baker, Jack Ging, General 'Bull' Full Bright, A-Team Creator, Stephen J Cannell and the big man himself, Mr T, BA Baracus. They were just exciting to see and hear what they had to say about a program that was hit by the world in the 1980s, as they recall and revive the good and bad moments of the show: both during and behind the scenes. Unfortunately, there is no George Peppard, but of course he is already in heaven, understandably and strangely not Melinda, who played Amy. <br /> <br /> I just didn't understand why he didn't show this example. Okay, he was tent after 3 years or whatever, but he was the first and original A-Team female who was only replaced with Marla Tawnia, and so it would have been good to see and listen to the story of the A team, in addition to other cast members. <br /> <br /> All in all, bring back the A-team was a great documentary style. Perhaps it could have been more diffusive, with which it would have been a six-part documentary. However, it was a great effort for JLC. Recommended
