This set of two discs is incredible! If you're like me and I never had the chance to see the band in real time, this is the next best thing. Jimmy Page, who, in my opinion, is the second best guitarist who ever walks to the ground (the second only to Slowfinger himself), puts him in an amazing show on every frame of the film. John Paul Jones, though not as up and down, puts the exhibition in hell. Although in a lively atmosphere, his rhythmic bass lines are not as they are in studio recordings, except, of course, in songs such as Dazed and Confused, or What is and should never be), but his wide-ranging talent on DVDs is well featured. John Bonham is John Bonham, what am I saying? Not for comparison, his shots seem to stand out, and this DVD is proof. Last but not least, Robert Plant's clothes don't get anyone else. If you've ever read Hammer of the Gods, you think the same thing as Page was when he first met Robert Plant, why hell isn't that guy already? And so ends my review, apology and spelling or grammar mistakes, the Zeppelin stones.
