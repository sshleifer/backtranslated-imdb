I love dogs and the most interesting character of this movie is the golden retriever. She's smarter, better looking and more interesting than any person. Like many other associates, I haven't read the book, but I doubt it would have changed my opinion of the film. It's predictable in the first five minutes. No surprises. The low scientists are creating a monster that goes away and the teen boy and his miracle dog are working to destroy it. All in all, the movie is a dog. But as I said, I love dogs and I give this movie 7/10. See if it's on a TV, rent it if you're bored and nothing catches your eye, but don't buy it unless it's special.
