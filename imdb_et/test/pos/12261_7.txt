Producer / Writer / Golden Globe named director James L. Brooks (Endearment conditions, as good as it gets) this is really a good satirical comedy film that shows the news reporter / anchor / journalist or producer's life behind the scenes like. Basically, Jane Craig (Oscar and Golden Globe named Holly Hunter) falls to a new reporter Tom Grunick (Oscar and Golden Globe, named William Hurt), but correspondent Aaron Altman (Oscar nominated for Albert Brooks) also has strong feelings for him. The network is preparing for major changes and sparks fly with all the studio members. Jack Nicholson also plays as anchor Bill Rorich, Moonraker Lois Chiles, Jennifer Mack, Mrs. Doubtfire's Robert Prosky as Ernie Merriman, Rock Joan Cusack School like Blair Litton, Peter Hackes as Paul Moore, Christian Clemenson Bobby, Robert Katim Martin Klein, Edward Wheeler like George Wein and Stephen Mendillo Gerald Grunick. Comedy is exquisite but strong, romance is moments and it is definitely a plausible situation in the film. It was named the best cinematography, the best cinematography, the best writings, a script written directly on the screen and the best picture, and it was nominated for the Golden Globe for the best movement - comedy / musical and best scenario - moving picture. 100 years it was 64, laughs 100. Very good!
