Places. <br /> <br /> others who came out and are the best! It deals with Kermit, who is on a Hollywood trip and meets other characters along the way. This movie, together with a good state of mind, has great songs made by Muppets, including Rainbow Connection, Can You Picture ?, Moving Right Along and others. This film, unlike other Muppet clips, carries a strong sentimental value to me. This is such a nice movie. Attention is also drawn to the fact that Steve Martin, Mel Brooks and a dozen of you are accompanying a lot <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. 109 minutes. rated G.
