Looking back at the year 2002, when "Furia" was made, it is easy to recognize the famous new-generation songs in Romania. <br /> <br /> Furia's main features are very specific scripts. an important dramatic core and truly professional development, accompanied by excellent actors. All four leading roles are excellently filled with both depth and coincidence: Dragos Bucur and Andy Vasluianu confirmed that since then, Dorina Chiriac has been the two best performers, and Adrian Tuli, a non-professional (real life) tomb manager!), Gabon, was a real revelation! What's more, Radu Muntean's leadership is skilful and expressive, creating a very convincing style to feel the "fateful night" and the inevitable fate. Some inconvenient and even unsuccessful moments can be easily transferred because the time proved that they are just debilitating insecurities that are not repeated in his later films, "Hârtia va fi albasträ" and "Boogie".
