After repeatedly saying that there are so many Columbo episodes, it's time to respect the episode with maximum points. "Etude In Black" is not 100 percent perfect, but it's definitely over 90 percent ... maybe 96 or 97! <br /> <br /> Last week I watched "Just Married" and compared it to "Meet the Parents". Well here is one of the parents, Blythe Danner, who played a much earlier role in the famous orchestra conductor Alex Benedictu's wife, played by a legend that is John Cassavetes. Alex has dealt with a girl in the orchestra with Jennifer Wells (not her first thing, one suspect). She blackmails Alex to leave her wife, but as her wife's mother keeps the cords of the purses on her orchestra, Alex does not believe that it would be so smart to destroy her career and marriage overnight. Instead, he hatches a plot before taking the show out of the concert hall and murders his younger lover by committing suicide. <br /> <br /> Enter Columbus and guess what? It takes him about two seconds to realize that killing is more likely than suicide. Columbo doesn't take much longer to connect with Alex, and he will soon follow him wherever he goes. Although Columbo is certain that Alex is his man, it actually takes time and a couple of false messages (none of which Columbo pulls) before he has significant evidence. <br /> <br /> There are some top-notch stars that range from Jennifer Wells' uneven young neighbor and English mechanic, who sounds like he would be home at Coronation Street, through a bedraggled-looking brass player who almost finds himself murdered. (She had also seen Jennifer Wells, a busy girl!). And the police academy's Commandant Lassard even has a short court. As with "Lady In Waiting" by Leslie Nielsen, it is not possible to take her seriously (I bet you think about it in a podium, isn't it?!) <br /> <br /> But this is Blythe Danner, John Cassavetes and Peter Falk who steals the show here. Blythe is absolutely divine as Mrs Benedict. From the moment he recalled the number of Jennifer Wells from his memory, Alex is deeply concerned about their relationship. This is a masterful performance because he tries to trust Alex, despite his very intuition telling him something very, very wrong. Columbo does not help when he interrupts his tennis game to ask his striking questions about Alex's relationship with the members of his orchestra. <br /> <br /> For John Cassavets, it is a shame that he did not repeat performances like Columbo's villains, because he could have been there with Jack Cassidy and Patrick McGoohan, one of the greatest prizes ever. But this performance is great! He is another one who falls into the "very upset" category, losing his patience with Columbo instead of welcoming him and allowing him. Regardless of when the game is finally over, it is a terrible acknowledgment for the Columbo gene. Well, it's really a fantastic show. It loses a few very small points to classical music, which many emphasize here, but none of them affect the logic or characterization of the story. And at least music is good, dramatic and exciting! <br /> <br /> Finally, if you have not met it, the amazing clip of John Cassavets and Peter Falck is on Dick Cavett's show. Early 70s. I'm absolutely convinced that Steve Coogan looked at this clip and based on Alan Partridge. All about the clip reminds me that you know it's a remarkable introduction to Cavetti's complete downgrading by his guests. Even the orchestra enters the act of playing circus music, while Falk, Cassavetes and their friend Ben Gazzara fool and laugh at the host. <br /> <br /> This may not be strictly relevant to this review, but the Cavetti show clip provides a good overview of the deep friendship and professional relationship between Peter Falck and John Cassavetes. It is clear from the quality of "Etude In Black" how well this couple worked together!
