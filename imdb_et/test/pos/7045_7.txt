It's important to be "ready for the summer movie." It's stupid, well, and maybe a touch, but my kids saw it and they laughed so hard when I first saw it. The style of all the "little boys and body" movies is yes, the plot is very predictable, but it's warm and funny. And no, it's not Bill Murray's Bill Murrayest, but he's gonna stretch what his first main role was. Strangely enough, however, one can see how few "fresh young faces" in this film did much more.
