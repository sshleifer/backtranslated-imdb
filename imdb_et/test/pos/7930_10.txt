Eisenstein was not only one of the biggest cinema masters in the Soviet, Russian, but one of the greatest cinema masters among Griffith, Murnau, Ford, Hitchcock, Welles and others. One of the greatest things in all of his films was the edition, very personal, and extraordinary in this film. It was his first sound film and the use of music scores by big Russian composer Serge Prokofiev in the battle is the perfect contrast between music and picture. Watching this movie is like in a classroom or a lesson in the cinema, something that many film directors cannot afford. I can never wear such a REAL CLASSICS movie. I hope that in the near future people will feel more great art.
