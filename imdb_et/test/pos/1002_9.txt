I was happy to attend the London premiere of this film. Although I'm not a fan of the British drama at all, I found myself heartbreaking with characters and BAD CHOICES. At the end of the movie I was in tears. Every scene was enchanting. Attention to detail and excellent action was quite impressive. <br /> <br /> I should agree with some other comments that question why all these women threw themselves in such despicable character. > <br /> ******* SPOLIER ALERT ******** I also hoped that William would have killed Dylan if he had a chance! **** END SPOILER ***** <br /> <br /> Keira Knightley did a great job and hastened the screen's beauty and innocence, but it was Sienna Miller's performance, which was truly Oscar worth. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this production will be called other awards.
