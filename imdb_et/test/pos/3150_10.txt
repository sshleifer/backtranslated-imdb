I recently saw a short title "Reader" and found that the film was well planned and executed. I really felt both of the characters that Morgan Hallett and Elizabeth Franz portray in this film. Elizabeth was able to show her an excellent choice with her dark character and to leave me emotionally connected. Morgan was able to sell me that he was fully committed to keeping Sissy or Franz out of the grief of losing a sister in Copenhagen. The big thing about the movie was a short-time budget and only a ten thousand-dollar budget, Duncan Rodgers was able to make a very well-made film that kept the viewer's interests. Rodgers has a great impression of the ability of the actor and the transition of large camera corners to showcase his talent. I always feel like the director can make a big movie with a small budget, which he can do with a much bigger budget. Great job for Duncan !!
