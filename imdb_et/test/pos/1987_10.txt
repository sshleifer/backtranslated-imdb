The producers of this picture are Hungarians. It is not mad at the artistic momentum that X and Z are capitalized in headlines, whereas the word "god" means "god" in Hungarian. - By the way, David, God is the word of God in Hungarian ... - Hum ... Is that so? Let's look at this film as a "History of Violence" science-fiction sister. Both films share the strength of the respective genres; Thriller and Drama in 2005 and "No FX as a science fiction in hell about what we are currently viewing. Everything that matters and is surrounded by details: Teard to Phil K. Dick (who wrote on "Perky Pat" days), creating a "Perky Pat" fast food restaurant. Serving Stanley Kubrick using the 2001 nameplate; When IBM became an HAL (one letter in the alphabet) in the 1968 film, eXistenZ 'becomes the classic lubricant spray WD-40 XE-60 (one letter up) when Allegra cleans the port of Pikuli. Wrapping David Cronenberg with the Videodrome Funny Formula ("Death ..." and "Long Live" ..) and Making Another Medium for the Image (TV in Videodrome, Video Games and Virtual Reality) eXistenZ In 1983 you penetrated the TV. In 1999, you have passed the game. Welcome to Canada!) <br /> <br /> Very tasty as Peter Suschitzky's film, Howard Shore's music and Ronald Sanders' team. For all the super famicom, genesis, or arcade stickers born in the early 80s, this film rings. Suffice it with notes. Content? "Jennifer Jason Leigh stands for a game designer (Allegra) who creates a virtual reality game that touches players' thoughts," as we see on the film's main information page. It's a story in the story. For me, this is a picture of a young couple of reality protesters who are invading a "completely new virtual game" presentation to destroy this programmer. I assume that what we see in the last five minutes is a reality, as a matter of reality. Jennifer Jason Leigh always plays a game designer in the game they are playing, and at the end of the movie IS is a reality, with bows of video games, big furry dogs, "Cronenbergy realistic" plastic (helmets and things) and 9mm handguns. What you see is true. They play transcendens within one hour (in this game the game (eXistenZ) where JJL plays the eXistenZ genius programmer and Jude-Pikul - the law associated with the Allegra game), they play eXistenZ because Allegra is very concerned about his pod's health (thing) what you connect to your nervous system to play), he has to knock himself and Pika then wins the game (Transcendenz) and back in reality, where they kill Yevgeny Nourish, a TranscendenZ programmer. > <br /> eXistenZ and TranscendenZ play in front of your being, face in your subconscious, while it creates a virtual reality that you must overcome in unexpected ways to win the game (playing the game, the girl who plays Allegra, the reality demonstrator becomes "Allegra" , "the goddess of virtuality"). <br /> <br /> What game Heidegger would have played to recognize your abstract da-wall perspective? To be truly engaged in the world? <br /> <br /> And how is Nietschze (Yes, Friedrich, God is dead and you know what? Willem Dafoe stands for him! - God, Mecca -) ??? Yes, we are building a narrative for ourselves and losing the yarn we go from one day to the next, people are breaking into personalities; eXistenZ's tells the fact that reality is that everyone who truly deals with it is perception. And we can sometimes get a clean thing; virtual virtual perception in reality.
