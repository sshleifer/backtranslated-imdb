My ex-wife and I saw this movie with a trailer. We waited for it to come out, but if it didn't, they didn't stay in theaters for long. Several years later I bought this VHS and I forward it to a DVD so I can keep it. <br /> <br /> I found it very moving. This is about actual events in the real country. BURMA got such a bad reputation for political oppression that she changed her name. <br /> <br /> I find women with little make-up very sexy. Patricia Arquette is in this movie. Frances McDormand and Spalding Gray are only brief in this. <br /> <br /> After getting home to find her young son and husband, Laura (Arquette) blood was brutally murdered. Bad badge for a doctor. His sister (McDormand) talks about her vacation to Burma. Although he feels a peaceful demonstration and has stolen a passport. Feeling brave (or stupid), he asks the tourist to show him something on the tourist trail. His guide is damaged by soldiers and he spends the rest of the film trying to make him safe. <br /> <br /> Every time I look at it, I am reminded that we in the United States forget to live with this peasant in a military regime, SOCIALISM, where at least eating is almost guaranteed, seems pretty tough.
