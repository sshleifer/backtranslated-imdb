As a fan of Saint Etienne and the City of London, I was very happy to see this movie at the Vancouver International Film Festival. This film has excellent shots, an absolutely great soundtrack and interesting knowledge of "not so well known" from London. <br /> <br /> The film is kept entirely in "dark" colors, which I personally do not like much. What's more, narration was a bit too british and the comments were sometimes flat. In addition, London has great comments and great shots. FINISTERRE does not praise London by showing all of the city's great attractions, but gives a deep insight into what London really likes. From the eastern end to the lively center and music design and "special small retreats" for London. <br /> <br /> All in all: <br /> <br /> + Great Soundtrack + Nice shots + great perceptions <br /> <br /> -Narration -Watching in time - Very dark image <br /> <br /> Worth checking out! I'll give him 7/10
