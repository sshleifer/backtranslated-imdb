After watching Oldboy, I was a little disappointed with the rest of Park's work, some of them good, but he never approached Oldboy's humor and originality. It's not like the Oldboy plot or style, but the same quality exists. <br /> <br /> The show is a great performance by Kang-ho Song, OK-bin Kim and Ha-kyun Shin. In particular, Kim succeeds in exchanging horrible horror scenes for surreal comedy without the slightest flaw. <br /> <br /> The piece is strange, with many turns and a vampire cluster with great twisting positions. <Br /> <br /> Leadership is where there are tons of pace and humor and some of the most memorable scenes I've ever seen. It's proud, which is probably a strange scene of love you will ever see. <br /> <br /> It's just a great movie.
