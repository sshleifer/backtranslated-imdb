This film had everything I needed for the film: - Women, skateboarding, violence, H.I.Mi and Tony Hawk's music !!! the artwork and camera effects of this movie are amazing. The music in this movie is the best I've heard in another movie. Every track goes well with its scene. I thought it was really good, given that no Bams team had written in the movies before. Although the whole film concept is a story of Ryan Dunn and his girlfriend (Glauren) who sleeps with Hellboy behind, he is a predictable and old age. Because of their perception, they are very unpredictable, such as: Falcone and gas tank, Raab himself, Dunn breaking bottles behind wawa and all Don Vito scenes. This movie must be visible!
