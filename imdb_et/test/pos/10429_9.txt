I do not understand why more people have not commented on this, except that many people may not have seen it. This is an amazing number of characters, one after another, written by a man-written man. If you don't like filmed games, you may not like it (after games don't usually look good on television), but it's a one-man show that gets you all the attention. Highly recommended.
