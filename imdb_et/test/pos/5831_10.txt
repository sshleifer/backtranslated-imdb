OZ is an old television series released by HBO. It shows life in one prison called Oswald, but the main plot is focused on Emerald City, one of the prison levels. <br /> <br /> Ozil has an amazing plot and outstanding cast! There are many signs and almost all of them are very interesting. Basically, they are divided into groups (gangs), Sicilians, Black people, Aryans, Gays, Latinos, and many others who don't have any specific group but deal with many others like Ryan O'Reily (Irish). <br /> <br /> Plot is very well built, there is a lot of conspiracy, a lot to fight for power. But all this is not just in the form of violence, everything is smart and intelligent, nothing happens without reason, everything is united and very interesting to guess! I really love this series and want to see something smart, very well produced and with very good performances, OZ OZ OZ!
