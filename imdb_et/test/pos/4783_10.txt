It was the first Mickey Mouse comic and the first sound comic. It was based on a silent movie "Steamboat Bill, Jr." starring Buster Keaton. Mickey wasn't talking about Mickey early and didn't get gloves. He could just whistle and play music. The song he played was "on the shoulders of Turkey" using several barnyard animals as musical instruments. She plays cows teeth as a xylophone and plays bra milk like an accordion keyboard. Captain Pete, however, is very crazy and makes Mickey's shell potato in the galley. Pete parrot flies to the window and tells the potato to peel. Mickey throws the parrot at half the peeled potatoes and laughs, closing the comic strip. I got this copy on tape and I like it. I think Disney's shorts are much better than feature-length movies.
