I've seen this movie three times. Go back to the VCR, back in the 1980s and again on The Encor Channel last night (February 11, 2010). Based on the true story I remember in the news, I decided in the early 1980s that I was still worried about looking again. But it is difficult to look at a car accident. The most terrifying figure is Joshua John Miller, who plays Keeanu Reeve's brother. <br /> <br /> (The story that this movie was based on can be found anywhere on the Internet - just Google. It's about Anthony Jacques Broussard who killed Marcy Conrad in Milpitas, California in 1981.) The characters represent the X-generation pre-grunge, sociopaths, except Keeanu Reeves, who is growing in conscience. <br /> <br /> The old hippies did a great job for this generation. <br /> <br /> Young boy, I thought Joshua Miller was great because it was a serial breaker. In fact, he went to Yale and has written both scenarios and targeted. His ability to act in this film was amazing. Just as she treats her little sister drowning her doll and tearing her dolls into the grave, I was given shadows. It gave me nightmares. Even if we are in the world today, it is still the most degenerate film in 2010. <br /> <br /> The apathy and malfunction of these families is enough to make one puke. This killing killing makes Manson's murders almost pale. <br /> <br /> Crispon Glover got a bit too much character. He graduated from David Lettermen to discuss his role and would soon be hijacked by the host. Apparently Glover had to look for psychiatric help after depicting his character. Also fight a good fight against Dennis Hopper. You are one of the best!
