One man, called Jerry, arrives at the ancient Aztec doll. But this creepy little figure is by the evil spirit that takes over Jerry's body and pushes blood down ... I've seen two more horror films "The Dorm to Dripped Blood" and "The Kindred" by Stephen Carpenter and Jeffrey Obrow, and I have to say "The Power" doesn't lose frustration. The project is slowly moving, but there are some effective human activities, and a bit of a woman's tabloid reporter being attacked by hanging weapons from the mattress is a hoot. I liked this low budget horror movie and you should, too. if you are in the genre of 80s fears.8.
