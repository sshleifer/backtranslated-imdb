I went to look at the curiosity and argument of this movie. The film is now known as a music film by Sergei Prokofiev, who has come out of his film for random music. The general features of the plot are well known from the sleeves for various recordings. Clerk accidentally creates Lieutenant Lieutenant Kizhe on the list submitted to the Tsar. The Tsar is interested in this person, and instead of telling him that he does not exist, suitcases and officers keep the pretense that he is real. Kizhe is in exile in Siberia, recalled, promoted, married, promoted again, dies, given state orders, emezzler and posthumously reduced to ranks. the official invented Kizhe, which included ink images and sneezing, but I heard the film was gone, so it was not possible to know what was happening. Then the film came to the Prokofiev festival in Barbican, London. The record was that everything that happens is that the secretary interferes with writing two words at a time and makes Kuzhe Kizhe. Since the tsar sees the speed of the order, there is no time to correct the error. <br /> <br /> Having waited for historical curiosity, I was pleasantly surprised. The film is very funny and the audience was always laughing. Although most of them are filmed directly, mostly in the palace, there are some "trick" shots where multiple images are displayed on the screen. For example, the tsar's armies are represented by a small group that is repeated throughout the screen. Four identical protections make perfect drilling perfect for drilling. Two identical servants clean the floor. <br /> <br /> One easy flaw was very difficult to work out who was all. There were two women who would have been Tsar's daughters or daughter and maid or something else. And very few people were named. All in all, there is a pleasant movie and I'm surprised to see it more often.
