I remember this movie about screening C4 a year ago and the whole thing was trying to get me out completely. I thought the film could represent such a variety of genres; supernatural, love story, intrigue of crime and so much more. <br /> <br /> After a minute, I was trying to catch the whole thing and was really worried about these characters. It made me feel terrible for Jimmy and then I smiled at the next gangsters ... and all the time I had baptized my fingers to work for Jimbo! <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger and Rose Bryne are great, Bryan Brown is absolute quality and tried me with David Field, who was both funny and evil. <br /> <br /> Since I saw this movie I managed to order it on a DVD and as a result, every person I show it is much the same way. <br /> <br /> This movie is perfect for Sunday afternoon or for a lazy evening, and it's one that you really appreciate with your companions.
