I'm not a sports fan - but I love sports flike! So, why ... what a great sports arena ... that's it. And the storytelling style is very good. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a fantastic 2 hour entertainment experience, "Greatest Game" qualifies. Here's a movie that is moving. Bill Paxton has gone to the same director school as Ron Howard - Richie Cunningham, "Happy Days". It's not bad. Take a look at the tremendous work that Ron did after moving behind the camera. <br /> <br /> Bill like Ron was a great actor, but is a superstar leader when "Greatest Game Ever" is a sign of things. Follow. <br /> <br /> Great cinematography - fantastic direction - exquisite action, especially Elias Koteas, Shia LeBeouf, Marnie McPhail, Josh Flitter, Stephen Marcus, Justin Ashforth. <br /> <br /> It's a must-see movie not only as a "good feeling" or "sports movie", it's a very good movie.
