Now the original company of the sci-fi channel has made some pretty filthy movies (dead house 2, all souls day, etc.), but if you leave the job to the horror-master-writer and now the director, Bruce Campbell, get one of the best fucking ever made For TV Independent Horror Movies! I usually hate these movies, in my previous review, dead house 2, I couldn't believe how tough the film was! But somehow I liked this movie, very pleasant for this movie. Violence is good and so is the black comedy of the movie, and I recommend getting it, a real Bruce Campbell masterpiece! Well, because there are several more lines I can say about this movie: IJAJKASIF JHJDJ NXD FNEHSD FHNCFNFVHS
