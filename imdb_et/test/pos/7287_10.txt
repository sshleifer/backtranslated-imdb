I really loved this movie! This is my first favorite. Although there were some bugs (which film was missing?), This movie was very well written, staged and produced. The characters in this movie are very real and plausible. They did all the characters for a specific role. I think the most obvious thing about "Earth" was the Triangle of Love and the other emotional situations in the movie. It is not one of those films where you just don't seem to be involved because there are situations where everything has been or has been. There are so many different things in this movie that it's hard not to associate it. I'm only 18 years old and I can even communicate with it. At the same time it was heart warming and twisting. "Here on Earth" makes you laugh, cry and sometimes angry. I give this film an excellent overview and recommend it to anyone who loves romance and passion!
