I've seen the "NSNA" just after I have seen all Roger Moore movies and I have to say that Connery's new knowledge was so good. He proves all the time that he is the one and only bond. <br /> <br /> The film itself is not really a masterpiece, but it is really worth it. The jokes are much better here, the effect is funny and interesting, Connery is Connery and Brandauer is really a good villain. But von Sydow is just wasted and the score is often not good and there are some scenes that seem quite unnecessary. <br /> <br /> 7/10 2.5 / 4 3+ (1+ - 6-)
