One of the many speculations on Y2K was that the world would end at midnight on December 31, 1999. In a human book, writer / director Hal Hartley looks at the possible consequences of the new millennium, starting with the return of Jesus to Earth on New Year's Eve, 99. The story examines the role of the Son of God, who must open the other three of the seven seals contained in the Life Book (now included on the Mac). where is the name of one hundred and a name. forty-four thousand good souls saved the last day. Jesus (Martin Donovan), along with Magdalena (P.J. Harvey), arrives in New York to make the preparations necessary to fulfill his Father's will, but he will think differently; does he have to live and evaluate the dead? Do they deserve what needs to happen to them? It is a cup He wouldn't want to embrace this particular moment, which gives encouragement to Satan (Thomas Jay Ryan) who is afraid that his whole hard work will be washed away at midnight because he can only continue to work as long as there are people who are against your bad hopes and dreams. Artificially rendered, a high-conceptual film, Hartley plays in an intelligent, thoughtlessly provocative form, paying close attention to dealing with a sensitive topic, making it even the most severe fundamentalist impossible. The dialogue between Jesus and Satan is intriguing and stimulating, as well as the impact of their presence on those they treat during their physical stay in the city. It is an amazing meditation on the spiritual side of the fragile existence of Man and contemplation of what is predicted in the revelation of St. John in the Apocalypse, the last book of the New Testament. Hartley's approach to another is logical; it preserves the aesthetics of the modern environment, using the changed film speeds that visually give the film an ethereal quality. Christ carries an inconspicuous suit and tie, effectively mixing with the population, while Satan's clothing is a bit more casual; his appearance is somewhat poor; he sports over the blue left eye. Donovan is well-poured out of Jesus, giving a benevolent mother and a sense of character that is very effective. Of course this is the unique image of the Savior and perhaps the best because Max von Sydow is "The Greatest Story Ever Told." It successfully promotes inner peace and peace, the sense of peace, it is the core of nature. And Ryan is dealing with the prince of darkness thoroughly; she has a special voice and a resonance quality for her voice that makes her look absolutely. His eyes penetrate darkly, a feature he effectively uses with a furtive glance and exciting views. He is the man who can sell you something for your soul before you ever knew what hit you. This is a memorable performance that is so inconsistent with Donovan's depiction of Jesus. Supporting pain is accompanied by Martin Pfeffercorn (Martyr), Miho Nikaido (Edie), Dave Simonds (Dave), D.J. Mendel (lawyer), James Urbaniak (true believer), Katreen Hardt (lawyer assistant) and Anna Kohler (hotel secretary). With its own unique "The Book of Life", Hartley has shaped the perspective of the past few days, which is interesting, fun and truly unique. He has the opportunity to live because it is just out of the center, a method that works particularly well for such a movie. Comparatively short for a feature film (63-minute ride), it is still one of Hartley's best and more than a worthy entrance price. This is a film that will stay with you and maybe make you think of some things that you may have in the corner of your mind later. And this is part of the attractiveness of this film; it makes you realize that "later" is probably now. I appreciate it 9/10.
