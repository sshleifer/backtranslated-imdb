This movie brings me so many memories back! I was very young when I came out, but I remember the first time I saw it! My father and I would always look at "Ernest Films" together. We hadn't seen them for a few years and I found a few of them really cheap. We looked at them and couldn't laugh. I love all "Ernest movies", but this is my favorite. <br /> <br /> Part of the spoiler! <br /> <br /> The part I usually remember is the "magnet" part. My dad still has an electric chair! <br /> <br /> The ultimate spoiler! <br /> <br /> This is a very fun movie ... but great! It is ideal for families (it is not much like a trash), but at the same time you can laugh! If you like physical humor (like facial expressions and the way people move), this is a movie for you!
