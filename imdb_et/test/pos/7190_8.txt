I don't know the English version of this movie, but the Norwegian translation is a more fun movie I've seen for many years. The characters say so many funny things and make so many strange references to the current events that I am surprised to have more options, like an architect who can never say Miraculix correctly. It will become things like Malcom (i) X and "utenriks", which are in Norwegian foreign affairs. <br /> <br /> Like the word "utenriks", many English translations have no meaning, and probably not French, so translators should have done their jokes and do it very well. Of course, they have a very good foundation to build, the movie is just comic from start to finish! <br /> <br /> Recommended in all languages ​​with good translation!
