I've never been sitting in the miniseries for six hours, but Changi changed it. I'm not lying, I know some Aussie valves can be pathetic and boring (actually I like Aussie, but maybe I'm biased), but Changi is on a completely different lane. Although not historically accurate, we are constantly reminded that the exhibition combines excellent action, excellent scripting and humor insertion to give us an entertaining and emotional conception of life in WW II camp. Remember that the show shouldn't have been a documentary, so don't let any factual mistakes disappoint you. <br /> <br /> This series publishes a creative writing by John Doyle (aka Roy Slaven) who knows more about his comedy than anything else, and the great director and actors move that creativity perfectly. If you want to see how much hard work went into this series, visit the official website, it's really interesting, and you'll know a lot about Changi's actual accounts. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen Changi yet, make sure you don't do anything for the whole day because you want to look at this series as a whole.
