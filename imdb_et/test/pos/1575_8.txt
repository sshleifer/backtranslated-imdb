"What Alice Found" was a pleasant discovery. As Dean Belli wrote and directed, it is a combination of a warning film of a theophone and a discovery trip. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen a movie, maybe you should stop reading here. <br /> <br /> Alice is a case study of a young woman who wants to break the unhappy life she is driving in New England. His excuse to leave goes to his best friend who has studied at the University of Miami. Alice is the product of one mother's home, the one who fights with the head, in sharp contrast with the relief that her friend seems to be living. When we return, we see Alice's life before going on the road. <br /> <br /> Alice, like her name "Alice in Wonderland", starts her journey without knowing her life has not been prepared for her. The American highway is full of predators in search of weak and innocent. Alice meets a catastrophe when her car breaks down and a friendly South couple arrives when a strange man approaches the darkness with the excuse she wants to help her. Sandra and Bill persuade her to come to her pleased R.V. Nothing has been prepared by Alice for this couple. After all, he has not dealt with what Sandra and Bill, his new benefactors, are staying at overnight stays in the rest of America at their sheltered lives. His shock is that Sandra is nothing more than a prostitute that combines his trade with the population who meet in these places. <br /> <br /> Alice, perfectly played by Emily Grace, is a study of how a young woman wakes up to a new reality she can't get. In fact, Sandra seems to be so simple that Alice is trying her luck in the oldest profession on earth to raise some money. Judith Ivey gives Sandra a tremendous result. Mrs Ivey is the perfect seemingly normal woman who would have no doubt that she would be disgusting with her clients when she and Bill find the journey they are traveling. Ms. Ivey is astonishing when she discovers the truth about her life to the accusing Alice. Like her husband Bill Raymond is good in his imagination as a husband that is actually a vendor. <br /> <br /> Mr. Dean Bell's excellent direction is not afraid to film the mainstream to place movies do not dare to go. Congratulations to the director who has written a credible story and collected the perfect choice to play it for our benefit.
