As a child, I loved this song "Never smile on a crocodile" and when I found myself in a situation that is truly inspired by real events. I think the smile would be the last thing. Ever since I opened, I have never been so rooted, caught up and finally exhausted, as I was in an independent Australian horror movie while watching this limited budget, about three people in the North Territory, trapped in a mangrove swamp with a very inclusive crocodile in the water below. What really brought the film alive was how realistic it was when transporting fears and the uncertainty of the situation of the characters to the audience. Half-documentary camera work with an alarmingly frightening background and authentic presentations will bring you comfortably out of your comfort zone. What we get is the patient's survival story as just a bloody and all-round creature. Think of "Open Water (2003)" where its budget and time constraint ensured that it stayed low, but this minimal barrier increased the experience. <br /> <br /> Slow grinding can be black and white, but it never seemed to be a disposable or formal pattern. Not very much, and the link between the characters was emotionally linked to an empty, straightforward script. While you may say "less is more", the actions and expressions will enlighten their thoughts that are distressing. The ordeal is absolutely daunting, because the danger is very lively and never seems to be open. It controls the chaotic adrenaline of the film and where it lasts (even if it is buried) to the end. <br /> <br /> Writers / directors Andrew Trauc and David Nerlich's economic guidelines wisely pass the strings through their tight pace and harassing psychological traits. In some patches there is a notch, creating pressure, creating temporary and amazing images. The way the night sequence is performed is extremely cold and pulsating. Dangerous crocodile manipulative toys with fresh meat disturbingly disturbing. Of course, some moments seemed unlikely, but never do and do not disturb. Sound FX is the key and sometimes you just don't eat. Rafeal May's musical score is inconvenient and doesn't really get into the mix, but if it creates organic sounding quality. John Biggins' cinematic art is beautifully designed and quickly aggressive as the mood changes. It was always moving and claustrophobic, but none of its jerky movements. The editing was sharply processed and their effect was satisfied with professionally living crocodile material. <br /> <br /> Any such production should also be hoped to sell in a credible way and they will do so. Diana Glenn, Andy Rodoreda and especially Maeve Dermody are convincingly good. A lot of responsibility falls on Dermody and he gives a firm inspiration. Now, this point can somewhat compare some other killer crocodile "Rogue (2007)", but these two cannot be different in what they want to be and how they finally arrive. However, if I had to choose, I would rely more on this trip to involve you. <br /> <br /> A remarkable effort on all fronts where everyone really does potentially pay attention.
