EXCUSE ME!!! HellOOOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!!! KÃœBA TRADE, Jr. Could have won Oscar for your movie! He was a movie! Although the film may be missing in some areas, Cuba was fantastic ... and for me this is the best role he has ever played! The scene of the movie, where he discovers that his mother is dead, made me break and cry! I think I could really relate to this movie because I saw the same treatment as people in my own school ... what a tragedy! At the end of the movie, seeing the "real" radio and trainer was also very special! If you can watch this movie and not move it to tears, you need heart control! If you liked "Simon Birch" and "The Mighty", you also love "Radio"! I wish they made more of these movies ... Radio is real!
