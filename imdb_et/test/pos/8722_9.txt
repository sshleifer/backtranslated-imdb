What an absolutely charming film. The cast is wonderful and the story is witty and fun. All the nice movie experience. Although the plot is somewhat predictable, this story does not make it less pleasurable, in fact I didn't want to finish it. I've always been a fan of Ingrid Bergman, and I was interested in seeing him in a comedy role. He didn't let me down, Ingrid Bergman as Mr Dickinson's play is fun to watch. I loved her interaction with Toni in the music shop and her dancing and "dentist". It only proved what I already knew was the greatest actor of all time. Goldie Hawn is also a pleasant look. His fun, gentle and lovely Toni is the driving force behind the film. You don't even ask why he would be so worried about his Finacee wife, you just agree that he is the kind of person who wouldn't be happy if he didn't know everyone else was. And Walter Matthau is great as Julian. His actions never create a sense of hostility for the viewer. The bundle was not an unlikable character. This movie is definitely a test of time, I just looked at it last night and I think it's one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen. If you are looking for a fun, light, romantic comedy, don't look at it anymore.
