This is definitely one of the best Mel Brooks movies with Spaceballs (although I publicly admit that I haven't yet seen many others). It is very silly and very funny, for just over two hours there is hardly more than a few minutes where you are not entertained. Almost all gags have a great comic effect, few are flat. I saw this movie immediately after seeing and reviewing Spy Hard and comparing these two junk films, I understand exactly how this movie really is of high quality. It's funny from start to finish, no comedy is superfluous or boring. Music is wonderful, as is the choreography of dance and fighting. The actors are pretty much what to expect from such a movie ... Eled is a great comedian and makes a good Robin. The plot is typical of Robin Hood, more or less everything from the legend fits this film (and is greatly corrupted). If you like Mel Brooks, or you're just a stupid fan of humor, or you're just dying to see the good parody of Robin Hood's legend, it's definitely a movie for you. It is also worth looking at the special picture of HBO First Look, which may also be viewed while viewing the entire credit. I recommend it to all Mel Brooks films and people who enjoy stupid humor. 7/10
