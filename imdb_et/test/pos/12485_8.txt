Is it a mystery of murder? Is this a police procedure? Is it a retrospective look at the French music hall? Quai des Orfevres is all these, but more than anything else is the comedy of post-war post-Paris belief, jealousy and love. Perhaps it is surprising that Henri-Georges Clouzot, the director of harsh films such as Le Corbeau or stubborn nails like the wages of Diabolique and Hirmu, is the director. However, Clouzot was an expensive filmmaker. "The mystery of the murder," he says to us, "is an element of playfulness. It is never quite realistic. In this, I share Hitchcock's opinion, which says:" The murder mystery is a cake containing raisins and candied fruits, and if you deny yourself, you can also film a documentary "Quai des Orfevres is a great movie and it's not a documentary. <br /> <br /> Jenny Martineau (Suzy Delair) is an ambitious singer in music halls and dinner clubs, she's flirting, she doesn't see anything too wrong when using a little bit of sex and talent His staging name is Jenny Latour, and he really loves his man Maurice Martineau (Bernard Blier). Martineau is a sad bag, he is his sender and organizer, he is a bit bald, a little chubby and jealous Then we have our neighbor , photographer Dora Monnier (Simone Renant) She is a blonde, proud (think of Rita Hayworth) and capable. This and Martineau have been friends because they were kids together, just thinking about friendship when she looks All right, George s Brignon (Charles Dullin), a charming, rich and dirty old man who has often taken Dora's photos of his artist from his young woman whom he himself represents. She offers a movie contract with Jenny and recommends dinner at her home to discuss the details. Jenny is more than ready. Maurice is furious and denies it. Jenny shouts back to him, "You are rich!" I want my part of my dough. "You're a father, a worker," Maurice shouts back. "So, what? Under Louis XV, I would have been Madame de Pompadour! <br /> <br /> And when Brignon dies with a broken champagne bottle next to his bleeding skull, Dora is trying to make things safe. But wait. Inspector Antoine gets Antoine (Louis Jouvet) is a tall, tired, middle-aged bachelor with sick feet, she has seen it, she earned her "colonies" alien legion and returned with her child and malaria. The child is now about eight years old and gives him Antoine One of the first things Antoine discovers is not only the brain of the Brignon bottle, but someone who put it in the heart. Who did it? Jenny, Maurice, and Dora have long slept, lying and confessing at one time or another. do we have the chance to see some of the great songs from the music hall that Jenny Latour sang? Everything becomes clear, but only with the persistence of the time and detective Antoine. also lead to all sorts of motifs, from jealousy to hair loss to longing for longing ... and everyone played a nice mix of Gallia amusement. <br /> <br /> Clouzot takes us to Parisian drilling, but not threatening neighborhoods to reduce the number of music publishers playing music on piano buyers, with discreet private dining restaurants. Most of all, he takes us to the music hall where Jenny Latour often performs. We see Jenny as she sings, sitting with couples and single men wearing their coats and hats in a standing room. And everyone smokes. The first third of the film is actually in this milieu. Jenny sang "His little tra-la-la, his sweet tra-la-la", follow him to try out the publisher's song, so Jenny would play horseshoe, corset, gartered stockings and much more. <br /> <br /> Delair, Blier and Renant are doing great jobs, but Louis Jouvet, who holds everything together. He was a wonderful actor who didn't like making movies. The stage was his world and he took the films only when he happened to be a director and made money to fund his productions. Jouvet was tall, with a long face and wide blush. He wasn't normally beautiful, but he needed to dominate the scene. See how skillfully he can play comedy, check out Drole de Drame. He's an exciting actor. At one point he says, "I have loved you, Miss Dora Monnier." "Me?" he asks. "Yes. Because you and I are two types. When it comes to women, we never have a chance." Jouvet brings to this line all kinds of nuances, ranging from rueful regret to gentle amusement.
