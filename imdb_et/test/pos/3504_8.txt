Ali G Indahouse was absolutely brilliant as someone who usually despises Ali G. When I watched it, I was mystical. Yes, it is sexist, rude and extremely raw and I loved it. Since some comedies have only one or two comic scenes, this film was ridiculous. I have never seen comedy that is original like Ali G Indahouse. For Ali G's main comedy, it would be worth 8 to 10. Absolutely brilliant.
