I saw Le Conseguenze Dell'Amore at the 2005 Rotterdam Film Festival. It was the first of the ten movies I saw there. <br /> <br /> Le Conseguenze has left the most impressive impression of ten films. From the first fire you know that the movie is something special. Beautiful cinematography left me frightened with what I can do with the camera. Music is also equal to visual images that complement colorful and stylish architectural-like images. <br /> <br /> Toni Servillo plays Titan's main character. He is a tax expert who has lived in the hotel wrongly. Every week he brings money to the bank for the money, and the story plays it around. <br /> <br /> He is always very controlled and almost shows no emotion to anyone; Seems to be calculated and well dressed. He has a habit of ignoring people who have no importance to him. For example, Sofia (played very nicely by Olivia Magnani), who works as a barmaid in a hotel where she lives. Although she has been in the hotel for two years, she can never greet her, even if she welcomes her. One day he faces him and the next day he sits in a window instead of his usual place instead of the bar. This is where the story really begins and there is a strong story of love, sacrifice and mafia. <br /> <br /> I don't break the rest of the movie. Watch this movie if you love stylish movies like those from David Lynch, The Godfather, etc.
