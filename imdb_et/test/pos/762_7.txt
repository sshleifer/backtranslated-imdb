I thought it was a tough film, frankly, Rupert Grint, RON, acting in a different film than Harry Potter, was really hard to imagine. But when the movie started, it showed that this man is a talent, I think it's the best actor of the HP trio, have you seen Emma Watson's attempt? Or how about Daniel? Both have no experience, even though they have been working on a million Harry Potter films. Ben, his character is a very shy boy who is unable to show his true feelings about everything, his disdain for his over-ruling mother and his outrageous anger against his father, who is unable to confront and confront his incredible woman. Julie Walters was absolutely brilliant! His interpretation of an old retired actor trying to live with his past tones while trying to remember Shakespeare's sonette is absolutely wonderful! It also seems that many young people are wasting religious nonsense.
