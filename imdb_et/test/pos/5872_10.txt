I saw this movie for the first time as a teenager (I am now in my 40s) and for a long time I have considered it as my favorite movie. The story goes tremendously without being sentimental. Operation, especially by March and Loyi, is dead. And the fact that Dana Andrews is too old for her role does not take away her romance with Theresa Wright (whom I believe is the only living film). It could have been another post-war melodrama, but the script and the cast are just too good to happen.
