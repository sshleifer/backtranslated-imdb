About 12 minutes of the song where Daryl Hannah and JFK Jr first embrace, really play the song ... what is this song? And who's singing? This is a song that sounds very romantic and is a female singer, piano game and so on. I've tried everything in the world to search for music on Google and iTunes, etc., but it just doesn't come, not even on Lyrics websites. So, if you hear this, I'd be sure to know enough about it so I can either try to get it with the CD or find it in iTunes. I don't know if my e-mail will start to flatter, I'm new ... but I look back here.
