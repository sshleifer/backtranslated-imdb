This is a fairly fun B-flick in the Universal Horror series with Dracula, Wolfman and Frankenstein Monster. The plot turns to Drakula (John Carradine) and Wolfman (Lon Chaney Jr.) by visiting a separate revolutionary doctor. They both ask her if they can be treated, and the doctor will try to work out for everyone. Under the doctor's castle, they found the mud of the Frankenstein monster (this is probably a reference to the previous film in the Frankenstein series). <br /> <br /> Of course, if things were as planned, the film would have been incredibly boring. Instead, Dracula cannot suppress your appetite and your doctor is finally infected with vampire blood transfusion. As a semi-bicker, the doctor goes crazy and awakens the Frankenstein monster. As with all Universal Horror series, the end is completely unsatisfactory. Particularly frightening is one beautiful woman who is one of the two assistants of the doctor. In addition, you just have to regret a movie about Frankenstein's monster - he's awake for about two minutes, kills one police officer, and then another building (now, now?) Collapses on him and is consumed by flames. It is also unfortunate that there is a great character created here by the great huntmee (1941), Larry Talbot. People underestimate this movie and Chaney's action in it. Here, he is rightly criticized as wood. All in all, it's a pretty fun movie in just 68 minutes. Nice waste. 7/10
