I've seen this movie about four times and every time I have another camera assistant. It seems trivial, but there is something very professional, professional and talented. The film as a whole suffers from other problems, as noted in other comments. Attention that the issues at hand today are just as important as 40 years ago. The actor is a bit tense, but the work of the Second Camera Assistant is a star! This person has to go back to the company - maybe direct? What is this person waiting for? I look and wait and look forward to it! - Bob
