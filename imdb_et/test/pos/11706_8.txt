Crackerjack is a simple, but good-looking movie, where the good guys are very good and the bad guys are very bad and the central temptation of both sides is. <br /> <br /> The combination of the central character played by Mick Malloy and the central stationary local lawn bowls clubs attracted an unusually wide crowd, ranging from a large number of teenagers to a large number of older people - and all laughed at comedy. <br /> <br /> As expected with the movie with Mick Malloy and Judith Lucy, there was quite a bit of swearing, but it wasn't superfluous and the audience I was sitting on was definitely enjoying it! <br /> <br /> Mick Malloy did a good job as a lazy bloc who joined the bowling club (three times) just to get parking (one for himself and two for leasing for a fee) but who has fallen if he is required to play or lose their membership. <br /> <br Judith Lucy does a good job for her local journalist / love and is a fabulous show for Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson, Monica Maughan, Lois Ramsey and many others. <br /> <br /> The role of John Clarke's devil in Halbana is not more fun, but he's giving a solid result. <br /> <br /> Not so subtle swipes in pokies give a little serious comment to this otherwise mild comedy. <br /> <br /> I'm sure those who enjoyed The Castle and Dish would enjoy this movie. .
