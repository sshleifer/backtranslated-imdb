Leno talks through his strokes. It's a joke for those who haven't figured it out. His exhibition is held in a micro-sized studio for a reason or for two reasons - a small amount of laughter increases and few want to see him. Letterman's set is polar opposite - Ed Sullivan would be proud and the balcony is always full. <br /> <br /> NBC, the sticky NBC, will never get it. Founder David Sarnoff's megalomania company is still in cash. At least CBS has a little family feeling. <br /> <br /> Leno collects cars or stamps while Letterman drives cars. The difference is informative. <br /> <br /> When I was talking, I asked elsewhere that Leno _ever_ said something funny. I never received an email. Letterman has a great timing. He can also recycle the most uncomfortable joke so that it becomes one of the most fun this night. <br /> <br /> Letterman has built other quarries. Paul is now well known and respected in his musical right. Even Paul's other members of the band get recognition and career opportunities. Biff Henderson has become America's name. Even companies that are in the same block as Ed Sullivan Theater are gaining momentum. What has Leno done to someone else? Personally, I'm glad Dave moved and Leno got Carson's concert. I've never watched NBC before and had no reason for that. <br /> <br /> The Top Ten list is an American icon. So is Letterman. Leno is a cartoonist dream, nothing more.
