The first time I heard about the last days, I was renting DVDs and I was interested in being a member of the LDS Church. I found this movie very cordial and in many areas it made me cry. The reason for this is that many years ago I knew a young man who went through Aaron (played by Steve Sandvoss) in the last few days, but unlike Aaron, this dear young man had not survived the experiment. He ended his life after his church, his friends, and his family was homosexual. There have been many people who do not think that the things shown on the film really happen on that day and age, but they have a bad and sad thing. For those who are homosexual and young, you have to see this movie and if you are a gay mormon, you really need to see that movie. In addition, if you get a DVD, the DVD will help you. Teen suicide in the gay world is very disturbing and this film is about it, but this part is hidden. Functional and music is great. This movie sold out all the movie houses he showed, but it only showed in major cities and was very limited with the release, so for those who would like to see this movie, I'd recommend a DVD. The only person I know who did not like the film is my own church members and they did not see the subject of the film and the GDK Church. Watch the movie, experience the story and feel the emotions shown in this movie, which I don't feel disappointed with.
