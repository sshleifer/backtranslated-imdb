I think I've read all Junji Ito English manga. I watched Tomie's movie and it was a great steaming heap. ATTENTION Uzumaki actually does justice to the manga. I think those who have read the manga really appreciate this movie, because many screenshots and camera corners are exactly the same as in manga and it is interesting to see how characters are played in the movie. This movie reminds me of eerie indiana. The end is different from the manga I expected. Kirie looks like her manga colleague and her male friend fits very well. Very terrible I have to admit that this film seems like a fever nightmare, what is the baby when you were. Not scary at all, but high when you drift? Another great horror from Japan, get yourself a copy.
