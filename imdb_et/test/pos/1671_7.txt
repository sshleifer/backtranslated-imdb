It seems to me that there were two completely different things in this film, which are intended for the film's twins, which I used to look at: 1 - this is Paris, France; 2 - is a 28-minute scene without dialogue. In fact, the American, Jules Dussain, shot the film so it is not a completely European film. Initially, I was disappointed after watching the first 40 minutes. It's an expensive DVD and I was bored. However, when this quiet segment started - the real thing (you already know what it is), the movie rose significantly and just got better and better. <br /> <br /> In fact, I thought the best part of this story was what happened after the heir. The best aspect of the film was cinematography. This makes the disc valuable. This is a great film noir photography and a real traveler for those who have never seen Paris ... and it is in Paris in the mid-1950s. There are many gloomy-but-interesting rain-dampened Parisian streets and buildings that I looked interesting. In fact, there were many more of these great shots than in London's much better known "Third Man". <br /> <br /> Leading actor here, Jean Servais, I think his name is also interesting to watch. Somebody described her face as a cross between Humphrey Bogart and Harry Dean Stanton, and it summed it up perfectly. Warning for those who don't expect innocence or nudity in a classic movie. It's France, not the United States, so here's a bit of a way. I appreciate a DVD that also offers a selection of subtitles or dubbed versions.
