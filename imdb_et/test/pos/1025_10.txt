There is a great danger of watching a film that had had such a profound effect on you as it was 20 years later that it didn't have the same magic as before. I have to admit that I don't expect it to be as good as I remembered, but it was pleasantly surprised. P'tang Yang Kipperbang is still as fantastic as I remember when I was 12 years old. This film has some kind of shine that is not present in many films. It's tempting, it's brutal, and best of all it makes me a child again, and there's not a lot of things that can do it. John Albasiny and Abigail Cruttenden rolls in this movie are 1st class and I forgot how good they were so far. I invite all teenage parents to sit down and look at them and see if they have the same effect as me. P'TANG YANG KIPPERBANG EEHHH! 10 out of 10
