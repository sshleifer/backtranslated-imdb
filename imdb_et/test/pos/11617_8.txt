"Unconscious cruelty" must be one of the most annoying films I've ever seen. "Salo" and "Cannibal Holocaust" didn't bother me so much, but "Subsonscious Cruelty" is a strange psychological element. This film penetrates your subconscious, catching strikes, surreal visuals, and one of the most amazing film and sound images. Sometimes repulsive; yes, but its visual beauty can be compared to the Avant Gard leaders like Alejandro Jodorowsky, Dario Argento, Dusan Makaveev and David Lynch. Take the most extreme elements of these four directors and throw away the graphic violence of Luico Fulci and you might guess what you are. <br /> <br /> The film is divided into four parts. The first part of the "Ovarian Eye" is real. The narrator tells us about the parts and functions of the brain. Then the naked woman opens her stomach and opens her eyeball. The second part of "Human Larvae" is like "Eraserhead", but incest. It deals with a man's sexual obsession with a pregnant sister. Where's Frued when you need him? The third part is my absolute favorite. It reminds me of "Begotten" and Jame Broughton's 1972 short "Dreamwood". In this segment, people have sex on earth. Men hump bloody holes on the ground, girls masturbating on tree branches. Branches of bleeding break. Look at horror when a man gives a woman out of the vagina. These people really know how to connect with nature. <br /> <br /> The last part of the movie is the most annoying and sometimes it is limited to hardcore pornography. This part of the film made me think of Jodorowski's "Holy Hill", "Sweet Movie" and "Cannibal Holocaust". I've never been more disturbed by what I saw in my life. A businessman can pull his private fish with fish cakes. Yuck and Ouch! Two women urinate on Christ's face and continue to eat cannibalistic bread like a communion bread and sodomize him with a tree branch. The poor. The last part was so extreme that if I ever watch the movie again, I'll close my eyes or a little further. Karim Hussien and Mitch Davis are probably very talented to think that they did it in the early 20s. Hussein led Tarkovski's "Resurrection" (2002), which is a much better film and, with the Nacho Cerda scenario, writes a "abandoned" masterpiece of dark horror. "Unconscious cruelty" is an exciting and disturbing journey; with images from everyday thoughts. Well, sort of.
