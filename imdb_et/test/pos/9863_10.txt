I have to warn you, there are some spoilers. But in order to get started, I got the "Spanish judges" in February. It was mentioned that this was the last copy, but as I see it was not backed up. But no matter, I have it. I thought it was good. I wanted to see it mainly because of the great actor, Matthew Lillard (I'm not surprised that someone appreciates the scar), though it's a small budget, getting enough money to make this movie. A man that is a good actor. <br /> <br /> The story is that the artist is known as Jack (Matthew Lillard) who "claims" to have a merchandis named Spanish judges. If you don't know which Spanish judges have seen a trailer for this, and this is the first reading you've read, I don't even say what they are. I think it would be a big twist nobody knew what it was. She needs protection so she hires a couple who are also scammers, Max and Jamie (Vincent D'Onofrio and Valeria Golino), as well as a piece that goes by the name of Piece (Mark Boone Junior). She has a girlfriend who doesn't tell her name because she is from Mars as she said. So they (mostly Jack) call him "Mars Girl". Everything starts fine, but then it becomes one big game. A game that involves some lust, lies and betrayal. <br /> <br /> There were some surprises (Matt and Valeria, as well as Tamara, one of them). There were some scenes they could have done better and the score could have been a little better. Some scores were really good. The topic they used at the beginning and end (before the credit) was a good choice of songs, this is my opinion. Ultimately, the fight would have been a little longer and a bit more violent, but what can you do? One more comment for Matt: Damn, he's playing a smooth, slippery person. <br /> <br /> I know this is a review, but I have to improve NeCRo, one observer, with Valeria Golino not a newcomer. According to this site, he has been active since 1983. He and I, as well as others, are known as Charlie Sheen's Italian love for "Hot Shots". movies. But good inspection. <br /> <br /> Although I think it's one of the rare movies I've seen and it's really good (that's why I gave it 10 stars above), I'll give what I thought when I first I saw. <br /> <br /> 8/10
