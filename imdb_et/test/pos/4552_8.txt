Well, on the day when Rob Schneider goes into the black hole of the notorious bad films, celebrating absolutely "Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo" (hmmmm ... wasn't a movie called Roadtrip, followed by a sequence called Eurotrip? And now, Deuce Bigalow: Gigolo, followed by Deuce Bigalow: Gigolo of Europe ....... I smell patterns, maybe soon Spiderman: European webs are hotter ..... or not) I write a lot of malicious (during release ) movie. I was one of these malignant tumors, I have to admit. I turned my nose up even though Chris Farley pushed his cocaine into his nose and SNL was in pain during his worst seasons of history '94 -'95, despite the anchoring of Norm McDonald. Movies such as Happy Gilmore, Tommy Boy and Black Sheep appeared a few years after that period and we realized that the caliber of Spade-Farley-Schneider-Sandler films was in the dark in the future. But I watched it on the second day of the movie, ten years later and 8 years after Chris died and couldn't laugh. Yes, it's not that difficult. Farley does what Farley does (not unlike Manny, but his "Van Down By the River" motivational speaker shtick, in which he complains that although he should not "wash enough" or "wear good clothes" or "use" more deodorant than twice a week "translates well here as a self-evident character who understands that he is not the brightest, not the most looks and can lose a few pounds. However, he tries his best to do what he should do. David Spade strikes his slip with a single liner as he did "Spade's Hollywood Minute" and basically refers to Farley's self-esteem, not to say much more - I love one scene when Farley tries to hit Spad on his monkey and then makes a few sting. what is the first, but the other, they are in the hotel bed and Farley tells Spade: "Do you like baseball?" Spade speaks in response to something unheard and Farleys says "New York YANK - in front?" Athaes makes Farley his awkward, painfully sensitive, frat-boy shtick. If you like it, you like it. I couldn't finish laughing.
