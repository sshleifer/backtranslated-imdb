Flipper is a nice warm-up film for the whole family. It's not obviously a great movie, Free Willy looks much better at almost every part of film making. It may be a bit naive sometimes, and writing and scripting aren't the best part of a movie, but it's a fun movie with very good cinematography (including underwater shots) and some important moral messages. Elijah Wood is once again proving to be an incredibly talented and undervalued actor. She can watch a bad movie, a good movie - good, good - a great and great movie all the time becoming a classic. Paul Hogan's performance was also very good and he fits perfectly with his role. As I said, the whole cinema was very good. But underwater shots are definitely the best parts. So Flipper is a great way to see a nice, sweet and fun movie. If you like getting sick and tired of today's Hollywood trash, full of sexual, violent, vulgar, and embarrassing, then you probably would like this movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7.7 out of 10.
