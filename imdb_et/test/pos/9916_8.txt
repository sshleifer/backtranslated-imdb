OPERA is one of the best Argento films. Draw holes and contradictions? Of course, but I don't think they will damage this movie as many other reviewers seem. Many of the elements that are in many Argento films are a kind of "wall", but it's part of drawing his films ... <br /> <br /> A short story: a psycho conceals an opera for a new leading lady. Typical Argento revolutions occur, leading to culmination of decent profitability. Not Argento's best, but I pull it out from time to time. It is definitely worth seeing if you like his other stuff - just don't get it confused with OPERA's disgusting affliction, which Argento made it really terrible ... 8/10
