Yes, 2:37 is in some sense hanging on Gus van Sants Elephant. It is about some of the students who are dealing with these problems that lead to one of them suicide. Yes, it's full of clich√©s, but it's life. You simply cannot deny that horrible nerds, disabled people, or popular students who, despite their popularity, have problems, exist in the real world. <br /> <br /> But that's not what this movie is about. It does not concern life in high school. It does not concern life's own misery. <br /> <br /> If you look under the surface, under the soap-like social relationships shown below, you will find some thrilling, thought-provoking criticism of our society. br /> <br /> Why do people commit suicide? Do we really understand their motives? Or do we just want to understand it too late after that? And why is it always someone you never expected? <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't answer this question, but it raises it. And it works very intensively. All this will keep you off whose blood may be what you see in the beginning. You follow the path of some students, all of whom have a more or less good reason to end their lives, just to be forced to look at the terrible action in the finals. <br /> <br /> Did you know who it was? Or were you surprised, as in real life? <br /> <br /> The message is formulated by one of the ultimate children. We have always been so confident about our problems, we forget to see others. Maybe someone, colleague, friend who doesn't want to live anymore. But if you don't open your eyes, you never know until it's too late. <br /> <br /> This movie is fine. It may have some errors, but they are no longer important than its end. Do you see the reflection of society or you are blind because of reality.
