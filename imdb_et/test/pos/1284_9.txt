Bill, Jeremy Theobald, is an inspiring writer who hasn't published anything yet. Bill also has a strange and strange habit, he loves to follow people. <br /> <br /> Bill chooses strangers on the streets or in the subway, on the subway and follows them as if they were their shadow. Maybe Bill is doing this to help him inspire himself to write a great novel he has dreamed of, or to get an article printed in his magazine for a big newspaper? Perhaps it is because it fulfills Bill's lonely life purpose and even turns her curiosity into a human, crowd with face and content, paying attention to her? Or maybe it will take care of Bill and take care of it and be responsible for it? Bill has a simple rule that he follows religion when he follows someone: after you follow him in your home or workplace where you stop. One day, Bill Cobb, Alex Haw, follows home and instead of following his suspension rule, he continues to follow Cobb. Bill soon realizes how right he was with the rule he set with the following people, and at the same time he was wrong in breaking it. <br /> <br /> An amazingly good low budget movie made by Christopher Noland in 1998 before he hit it in Hollywood with the big and original movie "Momento" about two years later, which has already become a big cult film. <br /> <br /> "Next" is actually a much better movie than "Momento" because it is simple and easy to follow. Compared to "Momento", which was confusing at first, and when you realize what film is talking to you, it is very difficult. What makes "follow" so much better than it is simple, but at the same time it makes sense for those who watch it. The film is much more direct and devastating, and you don't have to see it again and again to get exactly what it was trying to tell them, like "Momento". "Next" is the story of one story that has one of the most surprising and simply manipulated ends when you watch the movie again and notice the clues you will ever see. <br /> <br /> Made with an incredibly low budget of $ 6,000.00, which is less than what most Hollywood films prefer for coffee breaks, with black and white names and a little over one hour, 71 minutes long. Hollywood and non-Hollywood film industries can learn a lot from Chris Noland how someone with nothing but talent and imagination can in most cases be able to achieve millions of dollars; Make an intelligent and at the same time penetrating film that has nothing to do with money and big stars.
