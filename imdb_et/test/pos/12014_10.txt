Film Night Crossing captures the feelings experienced by most eastern Germans in 1961-89. I lived in West Berlin most of the year 1967, and I traveled every week through the wall in East Berlin. Why? Excitement, crossing the border to a Soviet-dominated country, experiencing the scents and feelings of East Germany, so Night Crossing is great, it grabs that feeling and it's exciting. Vopos arrested me at Checkpoint Charlie and the man in his leather cabinet and the dark glasses I believed were Stasi. When I watch a movie, I get the smell of cheap diesel and cooking oil, I see outdated vehicles, drab clothes that the public wore, and a little produced in stores. This brings back memories of how to understand how happy it was to live in a free country. In 1988, I drove from DDR east to west, north to south. East Germany had changed little since 1967. Trabants, who have continually collapsed, were still the main way for private motor vehicles, shops were still not tempted, uniforms were still common, but people, ordinary people were open and nice when you got confidence. Watch the Night Crossing, it's close to the truth, like all the movies you see in Germany, even closer than the two Spy favorites, who came in the cold and funeral in Berlin.
