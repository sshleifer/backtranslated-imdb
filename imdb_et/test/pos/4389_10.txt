They loved her and turned her into a horny toad! God who gets me every time. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie. The memorable lines, "Thanks to God your mum died of childbirth; she saw she died of shame," "I don't understand Big Dan." Big scenes from the train opening (laughing so hard, I cried) with blues. <br /> <br /> Look at it. That's good, it's nice, it's funny and it's based on a famous creature. Take your time, believe me. Don't look at it if you have a weak bladder because you will definitely laugh your pants.
