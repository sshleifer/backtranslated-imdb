I like a full house and step by step. I don't have a favorite episode like a scene. but some of the scenes that I don't like, but I say why I started to look at this example is that it was Suzanne Summers. and my favorite character was Dana. and Karen can sometimes be in a snob, but he was also a good character. I just want to look at family exhibitions instead of a trash that has a lot of drugs and violence. this exhibition is very similar to other family members, where one of the parents is always strictly on course and dates. other than step by step my favorite exhibition is full house, Sabrina teenage witch, gomer pyle usmc, andy griffi show and hazzard dukes.
