Picture Scene: A boring student with an empty day in front of a video shop offering 5 videos a week. This former student usually simply grabbed videos of dubious quality that were for the most arbitrary reasons (The Turning anyone?). Sometimes an odd undiscovered pearl made his video jacket - that was the movie. Everything about the film is good, but much more than what is all the parts that offer something too rarely - it's a good movie. Why it never got a UK movie release, is not next to me, especially if we are considering that we have to go through the week for the week. Although I agree that it is not an Oscar material (but neither was Titanic - schmaltzy cgi-induced bollocks), it is a very enjoyable film. I was trying to think about how to describe how to best evaluate / accept this movie - the perfect movie to watch when it's related to Dad, after the holidays have been over for a great Sunday lunch.
