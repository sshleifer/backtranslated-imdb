It helps the characters that this exhibition is based on to be one of the best Disney. Writing is what really shows it. This is a classic class. Given, you need to appreciate the type of humor you enjoy, and it's hard to explain. Humor is similar to the scenarios of the 40's and 50's Disney's old schools, with modern twists. It never breaks down into funny jokes or something like that. It is also not an adam sandler humor, although I've enjoyed it. This is exactly the same humor of a movie that will only be expanded when the TV show is enabled. So if you don't like this movie, you don't like it, but the new IMO Emperor's groove was the best thing that came out of Disney because of Gargoyles. <br /> <br /> A +
