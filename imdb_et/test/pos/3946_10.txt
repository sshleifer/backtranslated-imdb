Its weakness stems from confusing storytelling, plots that often do not come anywhere. But it really wasn't important because I still enjoyed it in full length. If you really agree that these movies are not taken too seriously, you will enjoy it even more. Basically, it's a love story, confusing at first, but when it evolves, it's really worth it. Of course, it has been done so many times, but its complicated version is quite inspiring and touching. Overall fantasy and cgi were overwhelming, but I still enjoyed the goal. And people gave up how it borrowed from other movies !! Guess what we know! And this is not really important because it was designed to have humor and entertainment. Sometimes people have to stop being so critical and think for a moment before they start around. Comparing it to Hollywood standards is completely stupid and unknown, it's a completely different style and target group. As far as I am concerned, the best films I have enjoyed are the outstanding eastern producers and directors. There's your police story 4, shaolin football, kung fu hustle, dragon tiger gate, legend fist, hero, tiger tiger, etc. I like this movie and shrink from the Philippines, the USA, England, Libya and now Australia. I am always interested in this type of film. Now try and think about your understanding, but I warn you to see things from the point of view of the 5 countries where I have lived. So you better be experienced and open.
