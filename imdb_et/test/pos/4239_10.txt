GREAT MOVIE! Chucky is the most funny character in the movie. Jennifer Tilly (Tiffany) makes this movie even better! Well, before Chucky died, Tiffany and her were together. But like ten years later, Tiffany gets back to Chucky (sleeping) and brings her back to life. That was a great movie! Scary and definitely funny (just because Chucky!) Is 10/10
