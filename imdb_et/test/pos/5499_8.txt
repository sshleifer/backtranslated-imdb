In Fire gives us a big cat and mouse game. Clint Eastwood is afflicted by John Malkovich in this riveting film. Malkovich says he kills the president, and he deliberately calls Eastwood and pushes his buttons. He asks Eastwood's ability to protect someone. Malkovich brings his character to the cold, but very intelligently. All he does is do it for a reason and he is not ashamed of killing. Eastwood must overcome the doubts of his superiors to try to catch Malkovich, but no one wants to listen to him. The result is a movie that splits the tension that rises into the tense scene in the Bonneventure Hotel Ballroom. Wolfgang Peterson is attacking tensions and we feel every time.
