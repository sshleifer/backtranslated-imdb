The name "Lucio Fulci" represents images of graphic death and distortion in the minds of male fans. Thanks to films such as "Zombie 2", "The City of the Living Dead", "The Beyond" and "New York Ripper", Fulc's reputation is one of the greatest directors of history. And while many of his later films definitely justify his reputation until the release of "Zombie 2" in 1979, Fulci's films did not contain anything close to the blood and the intestines he knows, in fact they were mostly free, relying instead on more traditional shocks and distracting images. "Do not torture the duckling" hardly contains any gore, but is his best. <br /> <br /> "Don't torture the duckling" is set in a small town in Sicily, where there are superstition rules instead of logic. The townspeople are not very distrustful of both outsiders and others who tend to call them. After a series of child murders, although many people descend to the city, including Andrea Martelli (Thomas Milan), who is trying to discover the truth about the murders as they continue. <br /> <br /> This is a remarkable movie. It is very well done with the great pain filled with many Italian cinema favorites. It also includes a strong score and a lot of creative camera movement courtesy or Lucio Fulci. However, the actual drawing "Do not torture the duck" is a disturbing character of the film. Toddlers, about twelve years old, have shown blazing slow-moving people who visit prostitutes and are favored by older women. It also contains very biting reviews for the middle class and the Catholic Church. For these reasons, "Do not torture the duckling" was on the black list all over Europe when it was first released and never shown in the United States. Still being a "Do Not Torture Duckling" is a monumental achievement in giallo cinema and Lucio Fulc's best work. I can't really recommend it, check it out.
