Henry Thomas and Robin Tunny are a couple of the most underrated performers in business. It's beyond me why they haven't got more recognition than they have. This film is a perfect example of how unlimited their abilities are. <br /> <br /> The lives of people who could name a little odd seem to be their specialty and if those characters are not strange I'm sorry to find someone who is. <br /> <br /> The story is funny, romantic, dramatic, tricky and tragic. I hated the end, but if I hadn't done that, I would not have loved the story as a whole. So there goes.
