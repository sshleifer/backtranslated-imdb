Hitchcock would be proud of this movie. Even if nothing happens, it's suspicious. Director David Lynch moves here and there with a few cheap excitement, but he mixes them with other cinematographic techniques to keep it unchanged. <br /> <br /> Total is surreal, this movie is like waking up and remembering most, but not enough to make it wise. I still try to figure it out and I must see it again to catch things I miss and understand better. This is a very detailed plot that is very slow together so you have to be patient and pay attention. Get your bathroom trip out before it starts. Yet, the plot's theme, mood, character formation and filming techniques overshadow. <br /> <br /> The main role of the main actor, Naomi Wats, is his enormous talent. That's when I got my eyes out of my co-star. What works for a couple. <br /> <br /> Lynch surprises the entire movie with unusual camera angles, cut length / timing, jumps between scenes back and forth. With the use of smart music and sound, it all helps in our minds, undoubtedly the principal goal of the director. Well, he kept me on the edge of my seat, even when I talked to the actors to be careful here and not so naive. You know what things you want your kids to smell in movies.
