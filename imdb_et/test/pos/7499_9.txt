The best screen performance ever made by George C. Scott. The Chayefsky scenario of the irony tradition is almost perfect ("Where do you train your sister, Dachau?"). Rigg is a wonderful angel who saves Scott's destruction as well as the whole cast. It's a fun and serious movie. This is a timing, 60's film, but it is not dated in any way. What it is, system chaos and irrationality vs. individual peace of mind, is timeless. And "We do not cure anything. We do not cure anything" monologue (edited, yelled, like anyone other than Scott) with a reference to cloning and other "miracles" of modern science could literally be written this morning. > <br />
