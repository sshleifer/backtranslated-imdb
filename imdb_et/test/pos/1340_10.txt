It was one of my favorite shows when I was a kid. It had it all - music, stories, talking squirrel and ridiculous stones. I wanted to be one of those hippie chicks that sang and swung. I am 35 years old and grew up in the South Jersey area, but we have three New York cable channels, and I think it was on the 11th channel. They just don't do such shows anymore (I know it makes me look very old), and it captures my mindset that I only grew up with 9 channels on our TV, but I could always find something to watch. I only talked to one other person who actually listened to this example and watched. She is three years younger than me and she grew up in North Jersey. I would like to see this series on DVD so I can show it to my 5-year-old daughter and she saw what the stupid (but big) stuff her mother looked! I just found some episodes of the VHS tape and the music CD shown on ebay, and I bought them immediately, even though they were a little expensive. I can't wait for them to live the big memories again!
