I think this movie is not your typical Spanish thriller because it is based on a real story that happened abroad. The film is based on the real story of French man Jean-Claude Romand, and the real case is much more frightening and scary than film. He did not escape the actual story of Mr. Romand, and after years of falsehood he decided to stop all, killing his wife, two children, a parent and a dog, and although he tried to kill himself, he seemed not to do so. t try when he survived. I watched the film with people around me to talk about how it could never happen in real life, that all these lies went undetected, I laughed when I read a book about Mr. Romand and knew it happened. I like Jos√© Coronado in this movie, he offered us a good job like the rest of the team.
