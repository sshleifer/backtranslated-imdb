Writing something so wonderful is completely difficult. In fact, it is almost impossible to describe the features of this film. It is a wonderful story about sex and sex, and it's almost incredible that we don't have to deal with sexual scenes. Feeling, this film was made for people who want to feel and just feel the life of their entire complexity in a proud way. We look at it and something is starting to grow in our minds, even in our hearts: it's a pure poem. I watched some "gay" movies and I am almost always happy with unnecessary sex scenes, not because I don't like sex scenes, but in general they are so pornographic that I have to think that a director or script writers think homosexuality means perversion . Nagisa no Shindobaddo is completely different. Three are the main characters. We have Ito, Yoshida and Aihara, two boys and a girl in a peculiar triangle of love. Itoile likes her best friend Yoshida, Yoshida likes Aihara and Aihara likes Ito. Imagine what this might change in unprepared hands? On the contrary, Hashiguchi is doing a great story that goes deep into philosophy of life, adding a question that made me think, surprised, at the end of the movie: Why? And why did they extend their brain inside and in my heart on several issues. Scenes that are sometimes boring are moments of the most pleasing poetry we know, but we cannot write in full with words. And maybe that's why we can't understand the question at the end of the movie. I'm sure this movie wasn't made to discuss every part of it? Some people want to understand a movie that almost splits it. Others are so accustomed to traditional "American gay" films, which are unable to appreciate the true value of this masterpiece. Look at it, close your eyes on credit and feel everything you feel, you feel a wonderful song. All this and more, I give nine. And I just don't give ten, because ten ten is perfection. But I testify that I almost did it.
