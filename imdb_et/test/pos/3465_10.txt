It's an incredible drama and powerful that hits you. I found that the film was big and the two main characters were grabbing the disability, both by Michael and Rory. Whether the story is based on a real story I feel that the story was trying to give the public a message that the general public should respect and understand the needs of people with disabilities and that they should be given the same opportunity as any other person. All in all, this film reaches my soul and also felt that the actors and the director were sending creativity there. The whole picture is that some actors take it beyond their character and only show part of what is credible to the audience, but I feel that these two have certainly benefited greatly from their talented talents to portray a masterpiece. You must not miss it!
