If you are looking for a quick movie and don't suffer from you, this is the place. It's fast paced and funny. I always find it difficult to see Mark Walberg as something other than Marky Mark. This picture will be burned forever in my mind. Actress, though she's pretty good. This movie must be visible to see fans who want to see some turns. I have to pick up and buy this movie one day.
