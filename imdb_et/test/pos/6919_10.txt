First off - What are some of you think? This is the best movie I've ever seen! Secondly, I do not think of it as a British film because it has been in Dublin and has mainly Irish actors - Moran, Gambon, Aisling O Sullivan (Rita), Deirdre O'Kane and so on. Third, I thought Moran was great. He was funny funny. Micheal Caine seemed to be there only to get the Moran context. Every sign he took improved. <br /> <br /> Abigail Iversen, what I thought was better than any other child I have seen. He was believable as a smart child and also a child and an adult (yes, I know it sounds strange but hey ...). He even managed to step on Caine. <br /> <br /> Iversen and Moran worked very well together and were very funny at the preparation stage. <br /> <br /> Barreler (Gambon) was very funny.
