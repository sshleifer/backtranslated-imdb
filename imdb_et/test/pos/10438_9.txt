I loved this movie, tried to buy it and can't find it. must see a movie that can be viewed over and over again, funny but also tears. a very good album for the movie. this is really a good 80's movie, I wish I could find a copy of this movie because its makers were really good. There are many people who are likely to be involved in this movie. movie so good. so go out and try to rent it, you won't regret it. this is an older film, but it's worth watching, I wouldn't be surprised if they did this movie, but I'm sure it wouldn't be the same. anyone who has not seen it, go to rent it.
