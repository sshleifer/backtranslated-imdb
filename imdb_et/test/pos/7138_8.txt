I loved this movie! Markie Post is very big in it. I saw it all my life, and it's in the same entertaining class as movies: "Betty Broderick's Story", "Locked: Mother's Rage" and so on. entertainment movies!} This is the top drama, the single mother who is trying to get her middle class out of the predicted personality. This movie is just pure entertainment! It doesn't have to be a realistic look at heroin addiction. But it shows how any "ordinary" middle-class person gets (and they can!) Get addicted to heroin. Junkies aren't just homeless people on the street. {By the way, when you look at it, see how the boy is your mother's boss! Corrupted!} 8 out of 10.
