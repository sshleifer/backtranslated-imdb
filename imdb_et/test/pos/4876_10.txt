I also participated in the RI International Horror Film Festival and I can easily see why this film looks best. <br /> <br /> SEA OF DUST is a wild romp of fear, comedy and beautiful landscapes. Back in time with strange events. An increasingly widespread disease, accompanied by an anxious side effect of people, leads to a young professor trainee; Stefan to study. During his travels, he decides to take a short detour and asks for his long time in love with marriage, only when he is sent back to his very stubborn father's pack? Along the journey from "out of town", she gets on the way to a sick girl and she is delivered by dr. Maitland (playing great and coming to Vincent Price, like actor: Edward X Young.) Who fills Stefan's evil leg. Only dr was insulted that he had invited a professor and only became a boy in training. Horror icon; Tom Savini represents supreme religious torment; Prester John. Scream Queen; Ingrid Pitt leaves the retirement pension to give the stars a show. Many beautiful and talented supporters kept the story running smoothly and helped to move it effectively to the top. <br /> <br /> Dark Religion and top, but fun and sometimes very original scenes play a big role in this game. Hammer tribute flick. This stylish film goes back to the setbacks, the surreal worlds, the dreams and the reality of the character. <br /> <br /> Fear and Gore aside; It's also a very funny movie! A tiny story, humor of the tongue and cheek, and dark comedy are raising the head in the dark. As others have said; it's really like three big movies in one. Very fun and original.
