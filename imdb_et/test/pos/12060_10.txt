I have understood that many people are racist and homophobic about the nature of this exhibition, but I don't feel it is an exhibition. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is for parents who were not ready for children and are not ready for teenagers now. This exhibition helps to bring humor to a very difficult topic that is sometimes reviewed: being a parent. <br /> <br /> Yes, we've all had family shows like family issues, step by step, family ties, Full House .... but it always has the same old recipe for its episodes. "Steph" cuts off school and gets daddy. They have a heart for the conversation and the music is played and it is through two weeks that after "aww, dad ..." the smile and the show are over. Where is comedy in such a situation? Where is Realism? If there is a war at home, you will get a true father's real situation. Most parents who watch this show hear some of the lines the parents put out, and they either laugh (because they know they have said it!) Or they carry their heads (because they know they have thought about it and are not never been able to do it say it!) home at home are situations that bring out great comedy as a father who thinks his son is gay. No sound funny, most think it makes a father a homophobic, but comedy comes from a ghost father who tries to talk to his son to open. Which parent knows correctly, especially in such a situation? I recommend this to everyone who feels he has a sense of humor, and especially to all who are young parents or who were young when they had children. You are touching such an exhibition if you are either.
