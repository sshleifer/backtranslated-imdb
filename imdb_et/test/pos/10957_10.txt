It should be noted that this film was not "improvised" (as you probably think about it), regardless of what the title suggests. The film was very scripted and practiced - there was not enough money in Cassavete to support the inevitably high cost of producing an "improvisational" film, even if he wanted to produce such a thing. The "improvisation" of the film is included in the performances and emotions of the actors they pull out of the line. <br /> <br /> Allow me to say that this is a stunning job I do. m sure i will come back again and again. The emotional depths that Cassavets can take out of the smallest gestures and interactions are incredible. I have no idea how he managed to direct such amazing performances from the actors, especially in the conditions he worked for. This is a really great movie image that I would recommend to anyone who wants to explore the Hollywood mold.
