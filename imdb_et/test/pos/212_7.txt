There is nothing like this on television at this time and probably never again. The first picture of this police illumination dazzled you and heard the words: "Police Team - Colorful", you were shocked to see that it was not a normal sitcom. kill the "guest star" and then never refer him again to where you saw it before. Then the actual show started and if you didn't pay attention, there would be several jokes in the background. Don't pay too much attention to one thing or you would be sorry. This showed that video recorders were made before they were married to children or the Simpsons. 5 minutes before understanding that it was a joke. the sentences played absolutely death. Only once, I remember, was a segment that played with a foolish laugh - a scene involving a trip to a dentist, sucking and a lot of saliva. Johnny and look with some fame. It was a moment of strictly one joke, but they had to use it in all six episodes. Oh, well. Not everything can be perfect. The important thing is that the rest of the time you were kneeling in laughter tears. also had the Achilles heel. Do you remember seeing something other than a Naked Gun job? And don't read the terrible Mr Magoo, who has worked around to live. He probably made a lot of money.
