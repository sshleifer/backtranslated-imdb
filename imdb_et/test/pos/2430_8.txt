The question is not that the real Anna Anderson was not Princess Anastasia. In addition to the very different physical appearance differences (Anderson's eyes are much larger, lips are thicker, the nose is bigger and at the end upwards ... etc), Anderson is unable to speak Russian was ridiculous to say ...... I complain about Anna Anderson and her confederations much. There are not many fraudsters with 60-year-old scams and endurance with such an obviously unacceptable scheme. <br /> <br /> However, I have some sympathy for Anna Anderson. In these days, the life of a young Polish peasant must be difficult. And for another woman to be 60 years old, it is a difficult task for anyone. He had to keep his muscles constantly in order to mimic Anastasia's thin lips and had to go away from time to time so people would believe that all his chaotic memory was just a mental problem. <br /> <br /> Anna Anderson was a wonderful woman on the wrong journey. If she had made her look good, learned elegance, durability, good working skills, she would have been able to make a first-class actor. <br /> <br /> In side view: some of the main characters in this two-piece look loose on real numbers. Prince Erich may be Gleb Botkin's mixture (believes many potential brains behind the whole scheme), Duke George and Leuchtenberg Dmitry, and several other figures. And Darya Romanoff seems to be based on the great princess Xenia Georgievna Romano. Unlike the actual confederations, Prince Erich was unmotivated in this exhibition and supported Anna's love and sincere conviction for her. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a great show. Fixed a bit, but still remains a reality. Amy Irving's freedom of action is that she has successfully represented Anderson's self-confidence, the embodiment of other people, and her own being. Just like Princess Xenia Anderson said, "She was always and never gave the slightest impression of partial activity." Highly recommended.
