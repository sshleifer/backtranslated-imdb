I thought this movie was a lot of fun. I already knew it was a funny movie, but it was more fun than I expected. Of course there were some flat jokes, but they broke me. I thought the actors were pretty bad, but the actors were good at organizing this comedy. I have to worship Amanda Bynes, she looked surprisingly like her brother and pulled the boy awesome. For other participants, they were also funny. Of course there were "how can you say?" Called for moments, but it's all a fun part. Finally, the plot turned out pretty well. There's a happy ending, but what you expected. In general, it's just fun.
