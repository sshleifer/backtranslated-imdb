This is one of the best Marion Davies speeches - and one of the few who let him show his skills as a physical comedian that was so fascinating in his silent films. OK, so he makes a dirty tap number, but even Ruby Keeler's dancing in the era doesn't last for younger generations. The problem here is the script. The story comes to an incredible melodrama in the last roll. It is quite flat and is probably adapted from the game ... but not well enough. There is still a nice understandable dialogue and all the time. Worth a look.
