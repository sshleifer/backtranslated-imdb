Like most, I thought "the second crocodile". So far, we have had Primeval and Rogue in the last 12 months, what can they do? If both films were acts and violence, it is about fear and tension. <br /> <br /> Performances are not Oscar-worthy if nothing happens, but in times of suffering or terror, these people suffer as much as torture. The plot has holes and perhaps the crocs are not really as others have pointed out, but the fear is so effective that this movie can be enjoyed. It leaves you unaware of the passion of Christ.
