Recently, I was delighted to meet Mr. Hauer at the 2005 Sarasota Film Festival under the leadership of this film. He was not only grateful to write his copy to the BLADE RUNNER when he took the time to answer the film some questions before the room offering theater was displayed. <br /> <br /> The film was so impressed that I used it as a benchmark to compare all the other films I saw at the festival. It was powerful and moving, but fine and short. The film talks about how a young man (the older version of Rutger) one day finds himself in the seemingly invading room of a normal space near the street. While walking, he notices a window that is always open, where you can hear a haunting melody. Every day, she goes through the room, sometimes standing outside, looking through the silk curtains sliding through a mild wind, hoping to get a glimpse of her inhabitants. At the end of the movie, we find out how important this room is and what our main character has brought to it. <br /> <br /> The film was cut beautifully. None of the screen time is wasted on an uninteresting picture. Any frame in the movie can be alone in the art gallery. Rutger is amazing. He is mysterious but still accessible. His dialogue involves a number of thoughts about life that have gone better or worse for this course. His words create familiar feelings and thoughts from the public. In particular, I was moved by a scene where she looks at some old photos, remembering her favorite dog, her favorite horse and her first love. You feel that you are in his presence because he allows you to have a glimpse of precious memories of the life that is nearing the end of his world. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie and recommend it to anyone looking for something fresh, intelligent and moving. All film companies should be required to watch.
