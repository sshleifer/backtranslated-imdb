This is an interesting film. I think it's very humorous, though humor is very black. Fulci is a good and funny actor himself, this is a really funny and really crazy "portrait of the artist" ("I'm making horror films. When I love movies, no one buys tickets ..."). And it's really SEXY movie too: Almost all the time there is some "action" or tension; and many sexy girls / women ... Maybe it is the core why someone starts movies / art first ... This is a real psychedelic journey, perhaps best seen a bit drunk or some other similar mental state. Of course, there are really nasty gore scenes because it is Lucio Fulci. In fact, some of these scenes are quite disgusting. Anyway, this is one of the three best and most complete Fulci movies I've seen (others are House by The Cemetery & Zombie. In fact, the script is quite brilliant in my opinion. : character is forced to admit "crimes" or bad thoughts; especially crimes that he has not even worked on. And he asks himself all the time: what if I have done that? What if I want to do it? Do I want to do this? Do I want to do it? He reacts and exaggerates his thoughts.I'm sure Fulci is interested in psychology and maybe even read something about this area, for example, his "House Cemetery" has the meaning of Freudstein be the most focused and direct personal film of Fulci. I also like the simplicity of photography / pictures of this film. Only the thing that disturbs me a bit is sadism, especially for women; sta, why? Is this entertainment? Is this art? Is it horror? Anyway, and in general, it is a really interesting and well-made film, certainly a classic movie at least for fans or anyone interested in this genre. For others it may be too much.
