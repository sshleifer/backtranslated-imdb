It doesn't give me the end that I must now and forever identify this movie (which I consider to be a masterpiece and I don't use the word lightly) with the qualifier "Not Michael Douglas Movie!" The headlines are not just the same, but refer to the same thing - the radioactive precipitation that hit the first nuclear bomb to survivors. In Imamura's film, this is not a cheap metaphor; the whole film is Hiroshima and the war itself, physical and emotional decline. As the deterioration of the pair and their grown-up brother becomes increasingly clear, the ironic image becomes stronger, starting with the old clock, which is reset every night to rocks that gradually grow up outside the heroine's door. (These, in turn, are carved with a skinned veteran who is forced to attack something with an engine approaching the city in tragicomic episodes.) The bombing day itself is shown with dreadful setbacks. At the same time, "Black Rain" ("NtMDm!") Can even be viewed repeatedly, because Imamura has compassion for his signs. I repeat: a masterpiece.
