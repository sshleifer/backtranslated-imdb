From an open drum hit "Me Gonna Groove" to the last guitar hit "Whole Lotta Love", these two DVD sets can be one of the best music DVDs that have ever hit the shelves, since the Beatles anthology was finally released at the beginning of this year that it is possible to find the whole concert and many television shows on the disc 1. For example, the entire Royal Albert Hall concert is on DVD, as well as some of the best performances of the band's last concert in Knebworth. <br /> <br /> At the Royal Albert Hall concert, for example, the band had plenty of room for improvisation. Jimmy Page's guitar solos make "Dazed and Confused" a big rock-power ballad, compared to Led Zeppelin's blues song. <br /> <br /> Next, on DVD 2, the ad video "Immigrant Song" hit Led Zeppelin III. One of Zeppelin's heaviest songs is video-like like a Pre-MTV video, but it shows a lot of guitar power on Jimmy's page because it was taken from live performance. After the end of the video, during the transition, a short picture of fans who fill Madison Square Garden is treated. The following are performances that were supposed to belong to "The Song Remains The Same" but did not make the paragraph. A great reef, like those on "Black Dog" and "The Ocean," both were present. <br /> <br /> After Madison's performances, we treat us with Earl's Court. Here, most of Led Zeppelin's IV material was played, like the most popular song ever recorded by Zeppelin, "Stairway to Heaven". It's brilliant as always, even more than the IV version. watch it, they have to admit that the voice of Robert Plant is getting deeper and deeper than any past rumors, and that is obvious here. For songs such as "Kashmir" and "In The Evening", Plant has no old vocal momentum, but "Full Lotta Love" returns one more song. DVD of the best musical works ever released, just next to the large Beatles Anthology box set, which appeared earlier in 2003. The sound of both 5.1 DTS and 5.1 Dolby Digital, like the Beatles DVD, gives you the feeling of playing with the directors, standing next to them as you feel on the Beatles DVD when they interrupt the studio. Although Beatles and Led Zeppelin are different bands, they both got different DVDs. Although this set is only available on two discs compared to the five Beatles Set discs, it will still recognize the viewer after it has passed all its content. It's also a pleasure to look over and over again, not only because of the sound quality, but also because Robert Plant is singing.
