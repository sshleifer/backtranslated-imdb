This movie is my favorite of all time. I'm sorry IMDb is not more positive about it. I hope it will not keep those who have not experienced it from watching it. <br /> <br /> I've always loved this movie. I look at it about once a year and I've always been happy about the performances of the movie and especially the full-length stars. <br /> <br /> I have always wondered if Jean Stapleton actually ended up with Travolt ??? ? If anyone knows this trivia, please leave a comment. <br /> <br /> Thank you and enjoy!
