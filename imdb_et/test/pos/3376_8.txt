The assumption is quite original and well thought out, but unfortunately the good story of sowing is a very low budget that does not even allow for proper special effects. Jeff Fahey does his best to the poor among the poor, as is always the beautiful Linda Hoffman. They should make more movies. Although the film has not given much praise, it must have at least one viewing.
