If you're like me and you bought a new Tenacious D album on the day he came out and went to the movie, knowing all the songs for all the songs .... you will surely enjoy this movie. Yeah, I am extraordinary as a huge Tenacious D fan, but I really like this movie that made me quite fool. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty much what I expected. Comedian genius supported by great songwriters and some great ones from Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins. I especially liked the part of Tim Robbins. <br /> <br /> If you don't know the Tenacious D HBO series and fantastic debut albums, it may not have the same comic effect on you. However, I would advise you to go and watch because it is still worth every penny of the entrance price and makes you smile even if you are not always stitching.
