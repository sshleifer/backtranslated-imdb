The last few days are a very independent film. Compared to many of today's more modern films, this is the lack of many parts. Taking pictures sometimes seems quite amateurish, dialogues can be a bit cut and characters are not impressively complex. Hence, this film does not have too much hope, because, as I said, it is very independent. But whatever he misses on the specific aspects of the film, this story can be ignored because of the charm! I can't claim that the plot is extraordinarily original, but the story is still beautiful and in many ways warming up! This does not mean that it is a mold, being straight, it is faith and how you decide to lead your life! It's a stupid story that makes you cry and smile at the same time! So frankly, the later days are far from perfect, but I really loved the movie and recommend it very much! It is very critical of the religious aspects of our society and is associated with homosexuality, but is approaching it openly and I'm pretty sure most people enjoy it as much as I do!
