Harry Langdon's "Saturday afternoon" is often one of the biggest silent comedies, at least for short topics, and may therefore fall slightly for some. Unlike other recognized classics, such as Keaton's "Cops" or Chaplin's "The Immigrant", this film is in some ways familiar with the usual comedy that doesn't offer much to laugh on the stomach; you might even wonder if Langdon belongs to this rare company. However, in my opinion, this is a completely charming comedy in its insignificant way, and Harry is interesting to watch. <br /> <br /> For a modern viewer lifted from the TV, a "Saturday afternoon" plot can be recommended by Honeymooners or many of its spin-offs: two dim men, one of whom is married and very much under his wife's thumb, trying to a couple of good times to entertain the girl in the afternoon; but everything goes wrong and they stop fighting girls' tough boys. Is it familiar? And maybe a little terrible? Well, the assumption was already at the time of making this movie, but besides, there was nothing typical of Langdon. He was strange, starting with the fact that he looked like a middle-aged child who was half asleep. All of the Freudians on Saturday afternoons have a day off, where scenes remain between this scary, dirty-face babysitter and his stern. When Harry tries to hide money under the carpet, but tries to put him in action and forces him to hand over it, I swear you look at the relationship between a 6-year-old boy and his mother. . . and maybe that's why Harry Langdon gave some people a slip and still does it. For example, with coins under the scene, Harry finds coins by placing one foot in front of each other carefully, like a lanyard, counting his pace until he finds the right place and his technique is hypnotic. Langdon moved like someone else. Whether it makes you laugh, it is worshiping, seemingly in your own world. When his film plot is worried, Harry is curiously passive and almost never let the story pass. In the "Saturday afternoon" finals, when a big fist race takes place, Harry's co-star, Vernon Dent, is the thickness of this action, but Harry is dazzling at a great time and breaks some punch between two cars (sitting on one running board but on the other foot) when they run through on the streets. This is a memorable picture and, according to critic Walter Kerri, he completely surrounds the personality of the Langdon screen: he is a passive figure who somehow finds himself in the midst of frantic action, flashing in a dream as the world rushes into the past. It is also worth noting that Langdon and Dent, who have often worked together, have a report in this movie that suggests that Laurel & Hardy's plan will follow when they come together later in the year. Langdon's style was probably influential for Stan Laurel, especially here. <br /> <br /> "Saturday Afternnon" and its letter may not be for everyone, but the movie is worth watching and may find that Langdon makes this impression that is hard to shake.
