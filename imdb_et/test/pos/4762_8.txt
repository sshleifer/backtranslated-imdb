I love other comments on this movie. They reflect my attitude. I am a 70 year old boy, minus the disco and "Star Wars" childhood. There was nothing great about this movie except chasing. That's why it was good because it was tough, basic and economical. Roy Scheider wore a film based on a team, 7 on the ground, supporting Gene Hackman in the "French Community". The people in it were believing and the middle-burning ones burning coffee showed fear of scenes and almost lost their loved ones. There were no fictional weapons, but basic revolvers and crude shotguns. There was no tough boy philosophy in the area of ​​Tarantino. There was also no kung fu or samurai nonsense or fancy trick. There was no wise man carrying out some complex schemes based on hundreds of things that happen exactly as he planned, including the reactions of everyone else. The criminals were bad guys, but they didn't let the people out of this hell. In fact, there were only three bodies. something that the average movie opens these days. This could be a G movie today! No children of the orphan school were kidnapped or terrorists threatened to kill half of the city. There was no high tech hijinke, nor were the crimes very moving or ingenious, the highest technical thing I saw was a touch-tone ATT phone. It had no development of sub-blocks or amusing character. Nor is there gender or women except for one mobster's husband who shouted to his girlfriend about the threat of our hero. The local mobsters are robbing some simple payouts. Entrepreneurs. Vitot was played by Tony Lo Bianco, who did a great job, as good as Roy Schneider, the head of the Buddy 7-seat police officer, who he informed and used. What happened to Tony Lo Bianco, he looked like a Pacino shoe, good looking and talented? It was a great NYC background for a simple crime story. Locations that were blind and dehumanizing without sociological research. It was a simple plot associated with the abduction scheme where one Buddy cop was accidentally involved, literally unintentionally dragged and then accidentally dead. Since Buddy and his 7 ups are a hot dog unit, both the NYPD Brass and the mobsters thought he was involved because the robbers masqueraded like ordinary clothes to the police to attract mobsters. Of course, mobsters thought they had lawyers and the rights to protect them from ordinary police. Even the mobs were clear, old and ugly, there was no goddess royalties or Soprano hipness. <br /> <br /> This is a good basic film between two 70's Pontiacs. Even cars were simple and economical, not even GTO or Trans Am, like the actor and the story. In Batman's uber-hype or "24" days, this film reminds us that less is better. It should be shown to film screen writers and directors as a warning not to dazzle, amusement to finally offend tricks, gadgets and clown psychotic behavior.
