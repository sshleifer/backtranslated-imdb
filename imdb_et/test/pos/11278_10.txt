Such anger can only be a young man who is very serious about his faith and his place in this world. As the text at the beginning of the movie says, these pictures are dead: they are in the past and have been right from the moment of product readiness. But it is only for those "product" makers: maybe someone who is in the same spirit system (I think very many people, at least those who are seriously interested in religion, undergo the same terrible nerves and doubts about their personal development). And this is, of course, the reason why art is first made: Identification and comfort among other people. <br /> <br /> This movie uses the "classic" technique of the experimental cinema. And this is where these techniques are, in my opinion, the best options: to read stories and create an atmosphere for them, not only as a pure abstraction, but also in the end itself. These "tricks" have already made enough time. Some of the other films I imagine have been influenced / inspired by the director, are Eraserhead and Nosferatu. Interesting is how these techniques make this movie completely timeless: there is nothing modern in this movie. Or nothing at any particular time. It could have been done a thousand years ago. <br /> <br /> The interesting thing about this story is how these people treat this new born holy child: they use it for their own purposes and do not even try to listen to it. They beat him, kidnapped his guts and castrated him. They drag their (living) body from place to place. And they do the same violence against their mother. The story also reminds me of Borges' story "El informe de Brodie". The criticism of the practices of Christian institutions also reminds me of the great "El Topo". <br /> <br /> Unpleasant view at times, but beautiful. Very simple, thoughtful and concentrated. Very strong film, almost too strong. All human energy is concentrated on it. This movie also shows that if you have the passion and the idea, you can make a film with a round zero. <br /> <br /> But I have to admit that it was a bit difficult to see "modern". viewer like yourself because of experimentalism. It was so slow and demanding. But after all, I endure suffering. I have to give ten points just for someone making such a movie.
