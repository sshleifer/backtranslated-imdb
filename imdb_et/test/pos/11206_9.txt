If you look far, you will know that you are not watching a French film, there is little sex and it is mostly elliptical and people don't talk much here, there are a few lines out there and a few important conversations, just let you understand what's going on . Nor does it see America, no car driving or shooting, nor violence unless you think murder is a blood act or a daily tension that occurs with a mild disaster. Sometimes, relatively long-term medium-sized shots may remind you of a "contemplative" Asian cinema, but simply reminds you that the director does not push things into the radical minimalism of some Taiwanese filmmaker, but it is not a Taiwanese film, it is a Turkish film. I don't know what that means, I don't even know if it should mean anything. <br /> <br /> The film lacks the right plot and some of those lines, the ones that were a little long, and that often alleviated tensions gradually create something that means "plot" is better for the lack of a word that grows on you.
