This quiet and modest Danish film is flawlessly managed, written, performed and filmed - this is the best example of cinema, and if there is a person who can look at BABETTE FEAST without touching a very fundamental level, this person is I do not care about it. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple. In the 19th century, two older maiden women (Birgitte Federspiel and Bodil Kjer) live far away in Jutland, where they have sacrificed their lives, romantic opportunities, and personal happiness to continue their dead father's religious service to a small herd. One of the youthful admirers of women sends them to French Babette (St√©phane Audran), whose husband and son have been killed in France and who has fled their homeland for the same fate. Although they do not really need his services, the sisters attend him as a servant and bake - and when years pass their intelligence and tireless efforts on their behalf, an aging church will allow them to stay together and to live more comfortably than they had imagined; indeed, the whole village admires and depends on it. <br /> <br /> One day, Babette receives a letter: she has won a lottery and is now a wealthy woman according to village standards. Knowing that his new wealth means he's returning to France, the nurses want him to be able to prepare a truly French meal for them and for their small church members. The meal and the evening that has been delivered is indeed memorable at night, but not for reasons that could be expected, because the Babette party has proved to be the body and soul food and is ultimately the gift of her love to the women who took her and the villagers. who is so kind to her. <br /> <br /> The film is extraordinary, detailed and detailed, but does not reflect their presentation. As the movie progresses, we get to love their simple devotion to God and their too human weaknesses, and the scenes where Babette prepares her party and where meals are consumed are powerful, beautiful and incredibly memorable. There have been a number of films that have used food as a metaphor of love, but no one approaches the simple artistry and beauty of BABETTE FEAST, which reminds us of all the good things about mankind, and which proves both body and soul food. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
