I have to admit that I am particularly pleased with the style of humor and the story of British films, although not all of them succeed. <br /> <br /> This movie made me think and left me with a quiet smile on my face. This is about character development and relationships, truth and lies, and whether love is sometimes inadequate. Some participants, especially two members, Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson, were very undervalued. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of noise on Gosford Park, but with this work I felt that Fellowes actually produced a better film, although it wasn't the release of the mainstream. <br /> <br /> Intelligent mature story of real people who are undoubtedly faulty but also capable of true love.
