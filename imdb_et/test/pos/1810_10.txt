What can I say ?? This movie has it all ... Romance, break, rich kids, pants and preparations. This is my favorite movie of all time, which I can draw on the line .... I remember when it first came out, I was 14 years old and couldn't get in there. I was hooked! He wanted to move to California and be a Valley Girl. (Hey, I remember even the song of Moon Zappa, do you?) You tried for years to get the soundtrack ever produced ... now you can find it in rhino accounts.
