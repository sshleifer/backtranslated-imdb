I saw this movie in the early 70s when I was about 10 years old. old on TV. It was after school, and when I looked, I was so pulled into the whole idea that two astronauts were on a mission to another undiscovered planet, so I asked my mother if I could get a tape recorder. He promised me. So I wrapped the microphone cable around the channel button so the microphone hanged in front of the speaker. This movie is the first thing I've ever paid attention to - and I'll take care to save it. (Just sound - no video clips at that time). On the plot you have hanged every word ... every minute of this movie. The end says your mind. After watching the trip far away from the sun. I played the sound recording for many years ... and "saw" it in my mind. Then - maybe 15 years later .. when videotapes were normal and they sold tapes in stores. I was always looking for it ... but never found it. But when the internet came one day, I searched for it and bought it for another. So ... after about 30 years of seeing it for the first time - I saw it again. WOW! ~ ~ It was remarkable! Just a reference .. I had to watch it 50 times.
