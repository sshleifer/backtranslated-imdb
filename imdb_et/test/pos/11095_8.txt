This film is based on the true story of Christopher Boyce and his friend Daunton Lee. This fascinating story takes place during Whitlam Dismalis, when Christopher was a secret correspondent at the time he was working as a secretary of TRW, which acknowledged CIA's participation in Australian political and trade union circles. The film features several scenes from Gough Whitlam (broadcast on US television), with events that confirm Christopher's previously read classified documents. Gough Whitlam Removal was an organized CIA coup. Elsewhere in the film, it was mentioned that most people do not have a clue as to what level of fraud persists, ultimately ensuring that the US is used as a tool to promote certain policies on behalf of all others. At this age, nothing has changed. <br /> <br /> Christopher's life was deeply influenced, read shocked, knowing what and how the CIA is shaping foreign democracies, including the Alliance's democracy in the United States. Christopher reacted, apparently not in the best possible way, to selling to the Soviet Union the most secret information Daunton Lee, who was in his shift. Finally, Christopher and Daunton were caught out of treason and convicted. On May 23, 1982, while serving in the US prison, Christopher Boyce agreed with one and only interview with the 60-minute-old Ray Martin of Australia, as it was an Australian association that profoundly influenced him. It caused a week's furore in the Australian media, then it went quietly. <br /> <br /> I liked the symbolism of the film for the spunk and called Chris Falcon and Daunton's Snowman (a drug connection), but in reality Chris hadn't used the title "Falcon". <br /> <br /> Christopher Boyce: a criminal or a conscience? You decide. <br /> <br /> Resources: http://www.playitforwardoz.com/boyce.html
