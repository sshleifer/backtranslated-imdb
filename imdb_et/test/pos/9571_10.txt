This movie should go as one of the funniest films in history. His relatives The Powerful Wind, Spinal Tap and Guffman Waiting are in themselves terrible, but the show is the best show. <br /> <br /> A film about the peculiarities of dog owners that show their dogs competitively is the complexity of those characters that make it so good. After watching the film about 75 times, I have come to the conclusion that there is no weak character or actor in this film. There is very little interaction between the "groups" of characters, but it only seems to add to the beauty of the film. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie and find it not as funny as I settle, check it again. When I first saw it, I thought it was usable, but not too fun. This is a film that grows on you. This is definitely a movie you often quote. Characters: Hamilton and Meg Swan: + When you get a DVD, check how these characters were "born" amazingly so that the two could hit it. And to find out that they really didn't go the script and sort of like they went. <br /> <br /> Gerry and Cookie Guggleman: The cookie is especially funny and he does a fantastic job of selling the character of the cookie. Gerry (Eugene Levy) offers the weaker side of his usual star-shaped fun discombobulated type. <br /> <br /> Stefan Vanderhoof and Scott Donalan-A + Find me a more funny character than Scott Donalan, YOU! He will forever be such a sign as he was so natural and did not seem to be forced at some point. Stefan (Micheal McKean) was also very good and they are here together (and a short look with Gugglemans) to show why he is always in these films. Great actor with a razor. <br /> <br /> Harlan Pepper-B +, I don't want it to be funny, he's sure, but he's the only "Solo" act he can't be as funny as the others above. He uses the dog more than others and has some other idiosyncratic events for him. <br /> <br /> The rest are also big, with no weak features. Watch this movie at least twice. Buy it, you won't regret it.
