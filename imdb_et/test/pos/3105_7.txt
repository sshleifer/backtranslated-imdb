One of the genres that flourished in the 1930s was the fiction of crime, known as "murder understanding", because adding sound to films helped to make a faithful translation into the film about which audiences experienced the original playing. And since the horror films were very popular in these years, the murder mystery films experienced popularity, which was almost equal to the enjoyment of the previous decade (where the first films of the genre were generated), by enhancing the elements of fear. Waiting for playwright Charles Belden saw this renewed interest in murder mysteries as an opportunity to name himself after Warner Brosel chose his three-track "The Wax Works" to create the 1933 horror film "The Wax Secret Museum". Belden joined the independent filmmaker Frank R. Strayer to make films, and "The Ghost Walks" was one of his best. <br /> <br /> "The Ghost Walks" plays John Miljan Prescott Ames, a young playwright who wants to impress the famous Broadway producer Herman Wood (Richard Carle) with his new game. Ames takes Wood and his assistant Homer (Johnny Arthur) to read his country house, but his car gets into the mud during a dreadful storm. Three men ask a refugee in an old mansion, one of Ames' old acquaintances. Inside the house, Wood and Homer Ames are familiar with the strange relationships between homeowners and house owners, but this is a plan designed to impress wood: all house owners are an actor who plays a role in his murder mystery. Unfortunately, the murder committed has been made real and although Wood and Homer think it is all fake (after discovering Ames' original plan), it knows that someone inside the house is a real murderer. <br /> <br /> Expected Charles Belden's "The Ghost Walks" scenario contains the classic elements of the mystery stories of his time as we have a stormy night in an old dark house as a setting, a mandatory group of suspects, and a touch of comedy. But the interesting thing is how Belden turns the film into a real hit with many twists, which he puts into his play to play the mystery of murder with games. Dialogues are great, good and lightly tough, and although the plot will definitely lose a lot of steam (anyway, the mystery of murder), it will never be interesting and entertaining thanks to its smart turns and specially its peculiar characters. Interestingly, the gay subtitle is obviously stereotypical, it is never disparaging and it is really funny. <br /> <br /> By 1934, director Frank R. Strayer was already an experienced craftsman in the film industry's poverty line. , but his collaboration with writer Charles Belden would give him a few of his most interesting films and one of them was "The Ghost Walks". Although Strayer has obviously made the budget of historical games and the typical production values ​​of independent films of his time, Strayer manages to use his set and make an atmosphere film that fits well with the mood and tone of the story. Stimulation is somewhat slow from time to time, but Strayer knew that his film's power was in the Belden script, and that it would be most helpful in letting his pain do great results from his characters. Certainly, the performance is a bit typical and unigiginal, but Strayer does an effective, albeit restrained, job in this movie. <br /> <br /> As described above, the scenario is full of good features that make peculiar characters shining and fortunately, most of the cast game is in their favor. The veteran character actor Richard Carle is remarkably funny as a tough producer, Herman Wood, adding a lot of charm to his character, especially in his scenes with Johnny Arthur, who plays the enchanting secretary Homer. Arthur is the one who gets the best scenes, and he gives a fun job like a coward, but wisely a helper. John Miljan is just as effective as Presocott Ames, nothing wonderful, but something very bad and the same can be said about the June Collyer like Gloria Shaw (compulsory love) who is just good. But Donald Kirke is really enjoyable as a malicious Terry Shaw, and it is a shame that he didn't get more screen time. <br /> <br /> As usual with Frank R. Strayer's films, a bad low-budget movie badly because Strayer does the best he can, the movie still seems normal. The main problem, however, is the very slow pace, because even if the film is full of shy moments of funny dialogues, it slowly moves so slowly that it can be boring and tedious for a moment. It should also be said that Miljan and Collyer are effective in their roles as quite boring and average compared to Arthur and Carle, and one wants the film to be more focused on their comedy pair than the main couple. Finally, as described above, the final result is weak, and not the high level of first and middle parts, although Belden needs to be given credit to keep the turn of the creative plot until the end. <br /> <br /> It can be said that Charles Belden is a sympathetic hero of the mystery type of murder, because among the many horror and mystery films that came out of the B-studs, which is called the "line of poverty", "The Ghost Walks" is easily one. the best (along with Strayer's previous movie "The Vmapire Bat") despite his shortcomings. And even if this is certainly not a masterpiece of the genre, it's a great way to spend the night enjoying the mystery of murder in the sense of its own origin. A highly recommended movie if you like the genre. 7/10
