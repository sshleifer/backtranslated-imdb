Strangely enough, "You can't touch it" definitely applies here. As a result of the fear and sci-fi movies of all the clones, with all the worse transformations, it is difficult to find something worth 2 hours of your time. That's why I've always relied on the classics that frightened me when I was pre-teen. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly my dream, the toughest, most difficult sci-fi horror class ever done by John Carpenter or another director (sorry, even you, Mr Spielberg). But what really gives it power is not gore (it is mucus and blood, and God knows what other fluids are), but rather the feeling of fear, separation, and distrust it carries in symbols and viewers. > <br /> You cannot go further than Antarctica, and in this despicable light, the story is where the story is going. There are a number of Americans, scientists and soldiers there. One day they saw a Husky dog ​​in Siberia, who runs dear Norwegian army for their life. Before they know it, the American outpost struggles with a mysterious creature that can mimic any creature he wants. It can get into horrible slippery blood forms before it is finished, but when it is finished, if you don't see it, you can't tell it to people or other normal Earth animals. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald Moffatt, TK Carter, Thomas Waites, and Charles Hallahan are just a few of the fines. This movie is the reason why horror can be a great genre. It really scares me. Alien's blood "jumps" out of the petri dish, when the hot wire still touches that ME jumps !!! <br /> <br /> Still the most frightening of all of them.
