Ali G earned his fame on a small screen - though the big screen hasn't lost him. Ali G Indahouse is a fun laugh-second-fun festival - just like a small screen. She hasn't lost any of her character at all, and she has no stupidity - no film is meaningless fluffy. During the film it turns out that Ali is a human side, the idea that Ali G works for PM is brilliant, fresh and funny - and the incessant stupidity of Stainese gangsters is well blended in a stern and harsh world that is politics. The film is also full of new great characters - and not just an interview after an interview, but we get the right comedy movie that never gets repetitive or boring. Why didn't I give ten stars then? Well, the end was funny, but also botched and failed - none of it was reasonable. And in part, the film became offensive when he tried to be funny - but that's Ali G - if it's not offensive, it's not itself and it's completely and completely destroyed. Ali G's big-screen debut was, in my opinion, successful, and it should have reached the 6-7 average rating in IMDb. But it could have worsened and people are bound to interrupt opinions, especially on a movie like it is. <br /> <br /> Ali G Indahouse is generally a fun British comedy at its best - and the funniest and smartest. Great work! 9/10
