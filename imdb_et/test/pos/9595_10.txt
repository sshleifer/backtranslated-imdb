As the reviewer has already commented, this is always the best football parody for television comedy. But if I wasn't able to broadcast this video for the first time, I think it's not in any form. OK, so it has only polled 17 votes so far, but the 9+ average seems to want something special. Basically, I think it's a difficult happiness when it missed it because it's no longer visible! Aaaaaaaargh.
