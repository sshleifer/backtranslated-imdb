I thought it was a beautiful movie - very brave. Such beautiful shapes and I liked breaking the glasses. He also showed how the best friend repeated the line about "..and he's one year older than me ..." that their friendship has revived and grown, but maybe some competition left ... I loved the fabric-like hand. The dance concert was beautiful. The beginning seemed slow, though ... it seemed for some time to feel that the characters - the spouse could have been more abusive - he just seemed missing, so when other characters talked about him - it didn't fit. Thing btwn. the best friend and husband seemed to be random .. the meeting of doctors seemed to suggest that there wasn't much time (live ..), so when infidelity was revealed, I didn't feel so much compassion for character-like relief! the end was so big - lines btwn. she and her husband and the scene she's taken over are great!
