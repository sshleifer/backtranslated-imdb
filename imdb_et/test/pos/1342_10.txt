I grew up in New York and this show came when I was four years old. I had a half day nursery and it was in the afternoon at WPIX Channel 11. I just loved music and stories and remembered them around the house. <br /> <br /> I just saw a part of an episode on YouTube and for a while I remembered how she felt like a little child watching them. Of course I stopped watching when I got 1st grade because it was before school leaving (VCR or DVR back). I grew up, not realizing that the show was still there until I was in 11th grade! <br /> <br /> I had no idea that there are DVDs and I want my brothers and sisters to be young enough to enjoy this example, but now they are all demographic or buy all these DVDs . It was so much better than how much the baby shows today.
