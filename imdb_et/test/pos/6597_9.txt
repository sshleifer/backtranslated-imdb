This movie was fantastic. This is a documentary about how surfing on the first day influenced the skateboard. She has interviews with rollers like Tony Hawk (my idol) =) and Stacy Peralta to name a couple. Dogtown is part of the so-called "ghetto" in California, where there was previously an amusement park that was broken. People started to ride the dangerous ruins of the park. Soon the Zepher Surf team was formed. This led to Skateboarding's first real start at Dogtown. Z-boys were a dirty teenage team who loved skateboarding and started vertical skating. They started skating in skating pools. It's just a little story behind it. It even includes rare recordings from Charlie's Angels of Stacy Peralta. I think you should buy this movie when you are a skater. It teaches you that skateboarding was not always popular. Even if you are not, BUY!
