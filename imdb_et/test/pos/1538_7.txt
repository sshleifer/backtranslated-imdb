Of course, acting! Think about it, Closet Land can easily come out so terribly - a whole movie filmed in one room with just two people, they have better conversations about interesting things to do. <br /> <br /> But it wasn't terrible. On the contrary, thanks to the incredible images of both Stowe and Rickman, Closet Land is an independent masterpiece. <br /> <br /> It doesn't mean it's for everyone. Individuals who have attracted attention have shrunk due to brilliant families and accidental fire that they may have difficulty with basements. However, those who appreciate a good story without explosions should look at it (no matter how many video stores you need to call to find someone who has it in store).
