I've just read what I believe is the lyrical Irish man's analysis of this movie. Lovely read. <br /> <br /> But the short analysis of this film is that it is the interplay of seven deadly sins with four types of justice. <br /> <br /> Envy, greed, pride, lazy, anger, etc. and justice in the form of retributive, spread, blind and divine forms. <br /> <br /> I could show three examples, each of which was three; however, it is much more fun to note them yourself. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie. <br /> <br /> Don't miss it.
