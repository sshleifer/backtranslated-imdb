It must be a more fun movie I've ever seen. Chritopher Guest is truly gifted. He has a gift for humor. I almost laughed. In fact, when I saw it in theaters, I kept walking because the movie was so stupid. But that's good. It's funny. And it's really a good combination. You laugh from start to finish. <br /> <br /> This mystical style film follows various symbols that all compete at the Kennel Club Show. The cast is Parker Posey, Fred Willard, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, John Michael Higgens, Michael McKean, Larry Miller, Bob Balaban, Jennifer Coolidge and more tons. <br /> <br /> This is a really funny movie that everyone laughs at. Someone who was born without a personality would laugh at this film. It is displayed on a widescreen to give you an image you are watching as a real documentary and it is probably fun. BEST IN SHOW: 5/5.
