I'm not sure how IMDb's "weighted average" on this film was so low. In my opinion, all other accounts are the neglected gem of the movie. Rip Torn is fantastic as the stubborn Noel Lord and Tantoo cardinal superlative as his household. The Tower and Cardinal are both undervalued actors who are finally given a handicraft work on the stage. <br /> <br /> Their relationship is not always pleasant, but it is very real. It is not a "humerous and touching love story" that is considered as a DVD jacket. Finally, it is a tragedy. The Lord simply tries too high and ignores all the advice the power company offers to move. <br /> <br /> Music is fantastic, as are period sets.
