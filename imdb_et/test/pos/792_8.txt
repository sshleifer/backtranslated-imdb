I've never seen a silent movie for my eternal shame - not even the mother of all vampire films, Nosferatu. But if they show the creativity and joy of Buster Keaton, I'll try to watch for a while. It's really funny and it's a strange introduction to the world of silent comedies. Such a premise, as it is, focuses on the regrettable mistaken identity, as Keaton is mistaken for Dead Shot Dan (co-director Malcolm St Clair) of bad men. This leads to a number of moves and fleeing when the authorities are increasingly going to Keaton's increasingly desperate. <br /> <br /> You were surprised and entertained by equal actions. Keaton is a natural comedian, but also an accomplished stunt man, deciding how he jumps and jumps like Jackie Chan at speed. And comedy is also exceptionally high - my right side had to call my parents in a short time because he smiled too much! If you have never experienced such a silent movie, it is not just a viewing observation - it certainly blew all the ideas I had about silent movies. Of course it is not as polished as today's movies - the actor is pretty terrible, the truth is said, but it doesn't matter because you enjoy the movie regardless. Anyone with a general interest in films should make an effort because they do not have to be disappointed. Brilliant!
