Like Long Island's independent filmmaker and I've had two theater releases under my producing / leading belts, I always said how much I could learn by looking at FRED CARPENTER's output, so I was lucky enough to be my "Eddie Monroe" as my initiative for his great My heart went out of this character, it is a story and it was completely won by the trick / switch end that brought the film to life! The locations were perfectly chosen and the human emotions in its characters brought a realistic link to my engagement with all the elements that Mr Carpenter used all in his favor and his movie!
