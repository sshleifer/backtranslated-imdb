June's high and high school teachers find The Cure an excellent teaching tool, both as a companion to Huckleberry Finn and as an independent lesson. While AIDS should be the main theme, the friendship and strong text of love between Eric and Dexter is a very effective message for teenagers. The writing instructions surrounding the tennis shoe symbol are particularly effective. I also recommend directing a class discussion on how Eric develops from a manipulative user to a loving friend.
