This movie is a mixture of dark comedy and drama, about two men who worked in a butcher's shop and wanted to build their own. When they finally fulfilled this dream, they faced a new problem: there were no customers! One day a man dies in a cold room in a room and a new meat industry business begins? They're going to sell human meat, telling customers it's just a chicken? and their business is getting better: the flesh sells good! Oh! Did I forget to say something? These guys are not normal! There's really something missing in their brain! <br /> <br /> The film has some beautiful dark humor scenes, but I think it's mostly a drama. One that shows us what is inside the psychopath head, what is its motivation for what it does. I have to admit that I was a little surprised at the end of the movie because I don't expect them to do it without discovering it, but it's probably because I see too many Hollywood movies? What I mean is that in Hollywood cinema we always expect to be punished by those who do "bad things". There is always a moral that protects "good values", although we all know that "real life" does not happen so many times? And I mostly liked this movie because it fits a kind of cinema that is real, frontal, without false morality, and "sees" what is on the other side of "normal morality"? It just happens in an independent cinema (especially Europe)! In addition, Nikolay Lie Cat and Mads Mikkelsen have excellent performances in "particularly disturbed boys" roles? Very nice Danish movie!
