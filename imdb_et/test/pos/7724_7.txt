There have been about 60 different films and TV shows, in addition to the classical story of the mad girl and the lover of her unhappy soldier. This story has been done so many times in many ways. <br /> <br /> Vicente Aranda controls the adaptation of the Joaquin Jorda script to the Prosper Merimee classic novel and game. <br /> <br /> This is only a story of Bizet's opera Carmen <br /> <br /> Pas Vega is an exciting Carmen, full of passion and the ability to guide simple men to make terrible tragic things. Leonardo Sbaraglio is an unhappy soldier who has been caught in Carmen's poisonous web and has done bad things. <br /> <br /> Jay Benedict is the author, Prosper, who says this story. <br /> <br /> Many actions but there are some very hot sexual directions. <br /> <br /> It's almost a NC-17 movie. <br /> <br /> Because I have this story in so many guises I wasn't too impressed. <br /> <br /> This is a very well done movie and it interests those who don't know it, <br /> <br /> My not too enthusiastic review could be that I miss Bizet's fantastic Opera score. <br /> <br /> See it as you like it more than I do. <br /> <br /> Ratings *** (4) 82 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)
