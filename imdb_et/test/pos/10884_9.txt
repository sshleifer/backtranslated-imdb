What Can One Say About One Of The Biggest N64 Games Ever? Is this action fast enough to keep even the sweat of experienced FPS veterans sweating? That the graphics are great, until the explosions everyone loves to see? The fact that nothing is as fun as playing a multi-player mode and taking friends and siblings on the back with machine guns? <br /> <br /> Very little Goldeneye 007 wins. The only thing missing was voice action and a bit more enemy soldiers. If you have N64, and you like people and things that have passed through espionage, get a copy of it.
