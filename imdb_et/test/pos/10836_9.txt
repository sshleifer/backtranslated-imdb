This was suggested by a friend who said it was "cute and cozy" for "lesbian sex flick". He was wrong with the boy. I think he just didn't get it. Growing non-understanding and then trying out yourself and discovering misery is more similar. <br /> <br /> The characters are full and viable and the story is fun enough to throw theater performances to keep anyone interested. /> <br /> Rachael Stirling as "Nan" goes through so much trying to find the love she wants only to find that it is one person she was scared to reveal. Leaded by May as "Flo" was remarkable. he spent a couple of hours trying to remember where I saw him before, only to find that he was a "sister" Alice "Mohicans last". Luckily I had grown up in a liberal family and I had no trouble trying the movie like that. So many people lose such flickes. I'm glad I took my friend's advice and tried it. But I'm sure I enjoyed it more.
