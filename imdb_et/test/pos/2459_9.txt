<br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> Emilio Estevez takes a great game of HOMEFRONT and makes it an interesting movie. Here is TOP NOTCH! <br /> <br /> Credit must also go to Emilio Estevez, Director. Visual transitions between the past and the present were very smooth. The sound effects during the battle scenes were effectively added to the cooling and tension. the dynamics of the whole family. (The viewer can see this point more clearly, bearing in mind that the discovery of the old film has been viewed from the beginning, as the rest of the film is being viewed). <br /> <br /> According to the film I found THE WAR at home to be more direct and accurate than BORN JULY 4. Fine effort - almost 10. <br /> <br />
