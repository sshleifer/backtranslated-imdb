The whole movie, one artistic adaptation of Joyce's "Dublin" stories takes place on the night of January 6th (Epiphany), 1906. Most of the film takes place in an annual party by three spinsters (two sisters and their sister) gathering for the evening music, recitations and dinner. Although there are very few parcels there, the group's interaction and conversation shows a lot about Dublin in the early 20th century, when the blends of independence were just beginning. Cast, all talented Irish stage artists, except Anjelica Huston, are universally miraculous, and in fact they seem to be a guest at the assembly. The amusing final scene between Huston and the amazing Donal McCann shows a lot of characters about marriage. The mess and confusion is confusing, and for those who like a quiet, thoughtful film, "The Dead" is highly recommended. My wife is from Dublin, we do a ritual about watching this wonderful movie on January 6th. After many views, it will never be able to move me, and every time I do something, I haven't done it before.
