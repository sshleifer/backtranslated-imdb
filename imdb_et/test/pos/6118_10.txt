I loved this thing. The most wonderful thing about Pink Flamingo is that he is desperately trying to have a terrible taste, but has really become a world culture. We talk a lot (we are people), do not. Pink Flamingos succeeds because Waters made the film he wanted to do. The film may not be spooky, but it may be. When you watch this movie, you see things that are disgusting but ultimately brilliant because they are freely displayed. We are an honest personal creative expression here. Anyone who takes care of an artist, whether in a movie or other media, must watch this movie.
