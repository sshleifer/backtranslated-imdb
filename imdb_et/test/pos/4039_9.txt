I really enjoyed this movie. I'm not usually for fairy tales or believe in floors, but this film hit my attention. <br /> <br /> For the first time I saw this movie on the British channel Hallmark ..., which usually shows tough movies ... but then came Queen Snow ... and I loved it! I really admire Bridget Fonda in this movie ... he's playing snowdrift superbly and glamorously. <br /> <br /> I don't explain what the story is, as other people have already done, so there's no point in repeating it. <br /> <br /> I would just like to say that if you want to see a fun fairy tale ... get this movie ... but if you want to buy it and you live in the UK, you may have a hard time. I have bought it from South Korea (of course in English).
