It is a great show with full freshness and innovation. This regular board (a woman's sofa), a mandatory band playing monotonous stories, the same old jokes, the same pattern that was copied from Nebuchadnezer's days .... probably Johnny Carson's pattern copied by one and all, Latterman, Leno, Conan ... Daly , this show doesn't seem to be any of them. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with this show for the first 10 minutes and I intend to hold it. Although it is too early to say that this exhibition lacks any intellectual claims that most of the talks are so difficult to design, and I hope it would make this exhibition different from the rest. I hope this exhibition will last long! <br /> <br /> After months back, I still love this show and I love his self-healing humor (for example, his assertion that only the pothead lonely would be home to watch his exhibition at midnight on Saturday and so jokes are funny for stony boys only), which, however, does not include Conan O'Brien's usual temptation (I know that O 'is a cardinal sin. Bren's worship, but I really don't like his style and repetition). <br /> <br /> I looked at it again the other night with Tom Arnold. Ferensen's commercial spouse fraud (and the Nanny 911 in the earlier episode) is fun. Idiot paparazzi is fun, especially if a security guard warns them of taking pictures of people and (if I am not mistaken) they will begin to call their pictures "Gary Coleman". <br /> <br /> Added April 16, 2007: Returns and his dog is back again. I can't decide if it's a joke or a real thing. In both cases it was funny as hell. <br /> <br /> I don't expect Spike Feresten to read these pages, but maybe he will. He's furious than the monkey chain, and so I would write his wish for him: I'd like to have a full 30-minute show with Crazy Gideon, a late-night television commercial star. I would like Crazy Gideon to have an interview with Spike, sing a song (and play the guitar), rhythm of the SNL, and also answer the audience's questions about a possible mayor of Los Angeles (I know Crazy Gideon may not be aware of this, but there are websites that explain in detail why he would be the perfect candidate for the post of Mayor of LA). <br /> <br /> God wants! <br /> <br /> Returning on July 14, 2007: Someone here wrote that Spike's honored people must have bribed Spyk. I admit that Spike really gave me a bribe, but I have to admit that Rockefeller called me by his will and last night I had sex with Cindy Crowford.
