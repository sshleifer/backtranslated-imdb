Boogie Nights is full of surprises, nothing makes it a soul. Yes, it has a soul while dealing with the most severe smile and respect. Brillantly cast and magnificent character development, performances somehow combine the best stage acting in improvisation within the cinema blood style. <br /> <br /> The plot proved to be richer than I expected and the underlying items are teased quite thoroughly as every "B-Class" person rises out of the crisis outlook. <br /> <br /> The sociologist's dream event, the film resonates with the raw truth about what we all know about self-esteem, parental love, and lack of it, the lack of attention / love and its manifestation in adulthood, desperate need to belong. Something here for everyone ... almost ridiculed the intact and their own milieu as a problem, but of course they are universal. <br /> <br /> Film works on multiple levels. The ironic loop is that the evolved milieu exists only because the Watcher looks at the movie ... <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights does not understand the rarity of its content and character. It deserves every acknowledgment and more.
