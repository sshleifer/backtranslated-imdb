Of course, talk radio is probably not the most well-known Stone movie, but don't let it down, this movie is mature to discover, I don't believe anyone whom it won't let. With the best of the 80's cinema, Eric Bogosian, for me (with JFK), remains the best moment for Stone. Stone does not seem to comment a lot on these days and did not make a director's comment on the DVD like all his other films. Stone has nothing to be ashamed of, most of the directors would kill to get a movie @ such a movie. <br /> <br /> Studio claustrophobia is intense and Champin's opinions are very important today. "All Legalization of All Drugs" is powerful and you can accept yourself. In my opinion, the film is about freedom of expression and how people sometimes dislike hearing, which they disagree with. Speeches and conversations listeners are very convincing, even distracting, the chill ran under my spine as the crazy man calls Champlain, saying he must rape again because the city drives him crazy is totally shocking. Of course, Champlain takes for granted her ridicule. Champlain (or should I say Bogosian) is a fearless, totally unbelievable, disgraceful @ @ Bogosians in the film and the performance The other big role of the cheater Under Siege 2 (dear god!) Barry boss Dan (Alec Baldwin) can calm him down , Barry does not seem to be a person who closes and does, as he has said, a bit busy and clich√©. too formal, this is true because Stone is trying to make the film more cinematic and allow the viewer to see Champlains start, but it doesn't work completely. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent cinematic film with extreme close-ups, deep focus, extremely fast cutting with a fantastic 360 set for the ultimate breathtaking monologue. You have to see the cinema, it makes it rare because it was ignored at @ time, but now it is paying attention to what it deserves so much. The classical class should study for generations of film students. <br /> <br /> Of 10 out of 10 to use Bad to The Bone as an inventor before T2, a brilliant form of support, including John C Mcginley (Dr Cox Scrubs) as a slick Stu, Leslie Hope ( 24) as a Champlains girl, John Pankow and Alec Baldwin as suits and Micheal Wincott, who plays three roles (a very underrated actress), tensions between listeners and Champlain, which are very heartbeat @ and of course the bowing stars for Bogosian and Stone such a fantastic cinema . Enjoy!
