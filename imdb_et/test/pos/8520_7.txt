Yes, this is Sean Connery, who plays Bond again, looking alive and his part as he ever did for the first time in 1965 when it was called "Thunderball". However, language skills are so exciting as Connery does not use some of the tricks observed by his friend and humorous descendant Roger Moore. <br /> <br /> Moore is my favorite Bond, but Connery is doing a tough trip. The only serious Bond movie that is not made under the classic Eon Bond series "Never Say Never Again" is the modest return to the well. Soft action, however, is strong in character and smart dialogue. <br /> <br /> Bond, it has been found out right now, man is unpleasant. No matter how many times he has saved the world, his new boss thinks little about his fat lifestyle. "Too many free radicals, it's your problem ... caused by eating too much red meat, bread, too much martini." "Then I cut out the white bread, sir," Bond responds wisely. <br /> <br /> Early struggles in the spa represent the highlights of the movie, Bond and the striker fight their way through the kitchen, bedroom and lab before Bond finally makes his opponent ironically, without the little help of these free radicals. Humor is freely applied in the film, rather than most Moore tours, although Connery seems to be more fun when Moore's less egotistical example sends himself up. <br /> <br /> Was it because he was a good gross? Or did it work for less fragile producers? Whatever it is, the scenario is well equipped with a modest style, resulting in a richer and more entertaining than the two previous Eon Bond races, "You Only Live Twice" and "Diamonds Are Forever" by Connery. <br /> <br /> The 1980s was not a good decade for Bond, be it Connery, Moore or Timothy Dalton. Foot warmers, video games and ugly sports cars are all evidence and Bianca Jagger sunglasses by Klaus Maria Brandauer have seen her first scene. Forget the first impressions. Brandauer is the main villain of Maximilian Largo, one of the best in any Bond movie, Brandauer playing enjoyably with his character threat and mania. At one point, he allows Bond to move freely around his room, with the launch of a martini, and his dancing eyes and crazy, tempting grin to become a delightful company all the time. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie, other than Connery, is the Bond girls, who have been more attentive to Bond movies than the testimony of Douglas Slocombe and director Irvin Kirshner. Barbara Carrera was nominated for the golden world because she was like Fatima Blush, who was as bad as Largo and even more beautiful. He doesn't last the whole movie; You have to almost go away to focus on others. <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger's breasts and buttocks should have their own agents for the duration of their movie, but I don't complain. Basinger is a rare beauty that, in this early role, like Largo's mistress, interferes with the incredible heat of a childlike vulnerability that brings me Bondi and many others I suspect. (His lips and cheekbones are also sweet.) <br /> <br /> This is not a well-designed film. This is a better slogan of the Bondi movie, a terrible result and a flat end. But it has a Connery, which proves that he was the ultimate cinematic final secret agent, even if he steals a page or two from my 007, Mr. Moore. The end result is fun enough so I don't complain.
