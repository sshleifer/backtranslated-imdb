I read about 3 years ago angels and demons, and I can honestly say that this is one of the few books I couldn't read. many activities, somewhat mysterious. In my opinion, Tom Hanks plays a much better role in Professor Langdon than in the Da Vinci Code. <br /> <br /> You don't have to worry about being as bad as the Da Vinci code, that's all that wasn't. Much more interesting, more action, more intercourse and less necessary disputes. If you haven't read the book, don't worry that it is still very interesting. And when you read the book, let's say you may have a little shot, because I found many scenes that I look forward to. But maybe the fans of Dan Brown are nothing special.
