I saw this mini-movie when he first gave it, and loved it! It's funny to see how far people are spending money. It's also funny to see how much a boy can be "whipped". "Whipped" to kill. I think the cast was great, especially the character of Kristin. Without his smooth talking and deceptive appearance, the film would not have been the same. <br /> <br /> I never use to view the US, but now it's one of my stations. <br /> <br />
