One of the funniest movies I saw in the theater at the beginning of the 1970s, and unfortunately, it's been on television only a few times. This movie must be released on video. It is the sellers of his slippery, slippery spot as the administrator of a seized hospital. Great, great movie. If someone has a good copy of VHS, I would like to buy it.
