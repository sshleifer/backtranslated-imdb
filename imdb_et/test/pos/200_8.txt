I had long wanted to see this romantic drama (with the Second World War) and now that I have it can be said to be a true Russian cinema masterpiece! <br /> <br /> Soviet films are known for their overwhelming propagandistic approach, but fortunately it is free from such pressure - with a keen interest in the central tragic romance between a promising artist and a vibrant girl. War, for which he gladly volunteers, but which he never returns. The girl (a remarkable performance from Tatyana Samoylov) also loves a young man's cousin and if he does not get his boyfriend literally, he gives him the last and gets married. But he is an ambitious pianist who murders the war, reducing his chances of success, and knowing that the girl is still a soldier, he will ignore him. Finally, the word comes to her beloved death girl, but by the end of the film she has learned to accept it for her homeland and is happy to live with her memories. <br /> <br /> The film has some really amazing camera work that makes the screen space for extremely rational use, and often uses tracking, biased, and low or low angle shots to make high performance an emotional drama. Individual sequences are equally impressive - two in particular: a stunning scene that is frenetically edited and launched, where a girl rescues an abandoned boy from the track; and the premature death of a young man in an unfortunate incident, undoubtedly one of the best I've ever watched (the sun moves away from him, symbolizing the life that looks out of his body, as he imagines on a wedding day he is never!). However, the scene where the girl goes to look for her parents in her home, which is hopelessly devastated during the air strike, is also remarkable; as well as his latest violent capitulation to the concert pianist - which he is trying to resist when he repeatedly faces him - during a later air strike and using extremely effective hanging curtains! <br /> <br /> When disappointed, this outstanding movie R1 DVD is a bare bones thing (the RusCiCo edition contains some supplements, but when it comes to exports, it tends to be heavily overpriced and hard to download!); Criterion published it with another military solution to Russian classics, BALLAD OF A SOLDIER (1959), which my palm has told me in a local DVD leasing ... <br /> <br /> The only other film I've been watching for this director is the Arctic epic RED TENT (1969; albeit with a much shorter US version), an international international production based on real events; Given the unmistakable artistic quality of the COLLECTIONS, I regret to have lost many times with my famous documentary I AM CUBA (1964) when I was in Hollywood at the end of last year: after one week of theater directing, I was shown more than once on a television with a game length added!
