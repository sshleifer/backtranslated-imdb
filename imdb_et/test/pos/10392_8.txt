I was stunned with this movie. I've rented / rediscovered Antonion's films, and this film showed me the top and fruits of 50 years of leadership. What is eye-setting, color and detail! I've never seen such visual beauty and poetry that was filmed before. I had to finish after the first story and hold on to the tears. Yes, beauty moves me as he moved to Keats to write Ode grecian urn. This movie is for a mature, emotional and intellectual audience. Those who want to see physical activity and soap opera are disappointed. I have to see this movie many times before I really appreciate it and appreciate it. This movie should be required to watch all the operators and directors. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Kurosawa's dreams have a really big movie.
