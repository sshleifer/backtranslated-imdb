ALEXANDER NEVSKY is nothing more than a big movie. The film opens the world of the window and culture, most of which Americans never know. Much has been said and written about the film's thin reflected patriotism, in view of the imminent war with the German Nazis. <br /> <br /> US standards are a bit prone to action. The scenario is short for words and great visuals and activities. And while action may become tiring, visuals are often stunning. The direction is incredible. In a second note, Ralph Baksh's animation fans may notice that he stole a lot of his visuals directly from ALEXANDER NEVSKY for WIZARDS.
