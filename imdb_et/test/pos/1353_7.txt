The role of this western title is played by Jr. Robert Walker. He is a young weapon with his partner David Carradine after he has made a deal with the Mexican public. Carradine and Walker leave their partners. Walker arrives at a lawyer Robert Mitchum who loves Walker and is doing a repentance and recovery project. <br /> <br /> This is the first of two films by Robert Mitchum's writer / director Burt Kennedy. The second was humorous The Good Guys and Bad Guys. <br /> <br /> Not that young Billy Young has no fun moments. But this is a tripartite story that includes Walker's restoration, Mitchum's bad yacht who killed his son and the romantic triangle, which included Mitchum, Angie Dickinson, and the city's boss Jack Kelly. David Carradine is the son of John. Dean Martin's daughter Deana is in there, Walker is Robert Walker's son, and Jennifer Jones and Mitchum's son Chris play with Mitchum's son in some quiet setback. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum started in the West and always looks at home. Angie Dickinson essentially repeats the role she played in Rio Brava. Walker had a short career in playing rebellious youngsters and did a good job in that. I have often wondered what happened to him. He looks hauntingly like his father. Perhaps he did not want to end such tragic early as his father. <br /> <br /> And that wasn't enough, Mitchum fans could hear the old drum eyes singing in the headline. film.
