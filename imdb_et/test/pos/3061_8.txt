This movie has to come out of the DVD because it's the only way to buy it. I thought it was funny because it didn't have a real plot. It shouldn't have been an Oscar winning film. I appreciate these movies. Cary Elwes was very cute Robin Hood. I can't even think of my favorite movie because they're all pretty good. Anyway, peace.
