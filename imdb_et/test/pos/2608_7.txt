This is a lovely movie starring Spanky, Lucerne and Buckwheat. During the southern war, it may seem a bit strange to see that the buckwheat is a Spanky slave, but this film is as charming as shorts with the same pain. It was our only Gang's movie, and I recommend it for The Little Rascals Remake from 1994.
