Well, okay, maybe not perfect, but it was pretty close. This movie jumped from a criminal drama to a romantic goofball comedy, and back so fast all the time that there seemed to be two different movies that played simultaneously and joined again at the end. But they did it smoothly and some in the theater found that the bloody parts (like a scalping scene) are funny. I just threw it up, but I think it's just me. Greg Kinear is the perfect soap opera actor. He is capable of performing these over-dramatic soap scenes with just the right facial expression and voice intonation. His scenes with Betty seem like "a dream in Seattle" or some other romantic comedy. You almost forget that Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are looking for Bett. The enchantment of Morgan Freeman with Betty was quite horrible, given that he can practically be his grandfather, but the scenes where he talks to his photo are definitely worth a laugh! The performance of Chris Rock seems quite wooden, but he has his moments. Renee Zellweger is both sweet and Betty, a lovable waitress with raw, unfaithful husband who treats her like dirt. It is very unlikely that he would actually have been hospitalized without a genuine proxy, but hey, this is a movie, just go with it! Also his roommate Rosa looks like a woman who cares about Betty, but she doesn't know how to deal with Betty's disease. And finally, Crispin Glover. As a fan, I thought the film might have been funny if it was more. No one else has the same style that Crispin has, and the argument between Chris Rock, Crispin and the soap opera sheriff is fun. I think I'm saying I liked this movie a bit! If you get blood blood, violence and a lot of inaccurate language, it's worth looking at and giving you a lot of laughter!
