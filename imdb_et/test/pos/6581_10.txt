I saw it with DVD subtitles, which made the film a bit depressing because of the length of the movie. But I was riveted all over it. The fact that I liked the characters and always penetrated the story, despite the subtitles, is proof of the film's power. It's an amazing job. I have it in the list of all ten favorite films. It's just the best foreign film I've seen in the last twenty years. I would like to know the full story of making this movie. It must have taken a very long time and demanded the use of hundreds of locations. The use of some hardcore scenes (on the television in the motel room) may, unfortunately, select some people not to see it, but if you do not mind them, all of its stories will move deeply.
