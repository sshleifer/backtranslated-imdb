While browsing this YouTube, I discovered its covert 70's fears. For a low budget effort, it has a lot of compelling moments at a gradual pace, leading to a surprisingly shocking finish. Although there is one woman who takes her shirt down all the time, she is a nymphomaniac, these scenes are an important story, and there is one scene with a curly haired young man trying to attract her, which turned her on before she pulled her in. yelling crazy. The young sister who comes and hires is tempting and I'm not surprised she put Playboy on the cover. Some signs are very irritating and some scenes seem ridiculous. Mostly, however, don't look at the basement (this is the title I saw on YouTube) offering enough drama and chills for an entertaining B-movie.
