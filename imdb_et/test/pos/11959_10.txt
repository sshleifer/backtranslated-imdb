What can I say about this movie except that it is a lot of fun! <br /> <br /> John Cusack plays Hoop McCann, a recent graduate with two choices, studying for a street sweeping family business or spending a summer in Nantucket with his prayer with George Calamari (played by Joel Murray in fun) and his friends with friends. <br /> <br /> When I say for rent, believe me, it doesn't get a lot of zanier than Stork's brothers, Egg (Bobcat Goldthwait) and Clay (Tom Villard) and Ack Ack Raymond (Curtis Armstrong). Throw a little girl named Squid and her strange mole and Demi Moore's great power, and you have the gaps that your parties are laughing at, the movie. <br /> <br /> Laugh this movie and story freely. The line, although a typical good versus bad and good conquest, is great with a regatta twist as a showdown. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who likes to laugh and be happy. If you want to thoroughly enjoy your movies, you can't forget one crazy summer!
