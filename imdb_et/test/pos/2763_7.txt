Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall beat his tempting epic "Alive", there was already a legendary Mexican exploitation manager Ren√© Cardona who used the same drama as his ambitious "Supervivientes de los Andes" sketch. The unforgettable deadly flight of the Fairchild 571, which collapsed in the Andes of Argentina on October 13, 1972. This terrible accident cost the lives of many travelers, most of them being members of a professional rugby team. But 16 of these people were finally rescued by their strong will to survive and because they fed the mortal remains of their unhappy passengers. Of course, you can't claim that this cheap and roughly edited movie is better than the famous 90's, but I appreciate and respect this movie for sure. After all, the exploitation film requires much more input from both the team and the team, while the high budget Marshall film, though intense, feels more like routine money. Sets and special effects cannot naturally compete with "Alive", but "Supervivientes ..." offers equally impressive hope for hopelessness and creates even more noisy snow. The Cardona film is ambitious, surprisingly convincing and just one of the most outstanding Mexican productions. I am really amazed that Cardona's taking this story is no longer exploitative and clear. However, scenes where dead passengers are opened and consumed are difficult to digest, but they only increase the credibility of the disaster and emphasize the inhuman conditions of survivors. Rather commendable for the director, who became famous for his infamous bad films, such as "The Bloody Apeside Night" and the Santo series. Unknown young Mexican actors do a good job and the musical score is lovely. Of course, the story is well known, so the scenario does not offer unexpected shocks. Earlier or earlier "Alive" saw, you know what drama these people have to endure before rescuing and you can only wait for them. However, it is a good film that should not be surrendered as often.
