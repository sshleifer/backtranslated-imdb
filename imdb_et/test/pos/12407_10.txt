I love this movie. Tighten in large letters. "Sandlot" child is great, as is Corey Feldman. When the children rush to the bank, it is pure adrenaline. Inside the bank, it becomes a little "flying to the Lord" situation where they turn to one another. Justin Walker "Clueless" is wonderful. I saw it during "Showtime" when the channel was surfing. It was a pleasant surprise. James Remar is also very small here, like the small town of Sheriff. Taylor Nichols, whom I love from "Barcelona", also does a good job as a federal agent. I recommend this movie to fans of bank robberies with many good signs. I was shocked to discover that Roger Corman was the producer because the film is not a B movie.
