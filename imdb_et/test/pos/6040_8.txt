Elizabeth Ashley receives phone calls from her nephew Michael - she cries, screams, and asks for help. The problem is that Michael died 15 years ago. <br /> <br /> This film frightened me back in 1972 when he was on ABC. Again, years later, this is STILL. <br /> <br /> The film is a bit slow and predictable, deaths are very annoying and there is a fun, fun ending, but it's a TV movie, so you have to give it space. Elizabeth Ashley is great, Ben Gazzara is fine and fun to see that Michael Douglas is so young. And these phone calls still frighten me of daylight. I actually had to switch on one light at a time. <br /> <br /> A scary little TV movie. It's worth seeing.
