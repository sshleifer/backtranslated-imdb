With MY DINNER JIMI, there is a glimpse of Howard Kaylan's famous and famous fame in his 60s Folk-Rock band The Turtles. Turtles were "second-tier" actions of the sixties, but the film clearly shows that they can eat, drink and hold Hippie culture with Titans. And not just that they had music to back up. Many activities of the era are viewed in a way that they interact with the band at work and playing. That's my only complaint about the movie. Almost since the beginning of the film, we can see that it is almost impossible to find actors who can convincingly make such recognizable stars. Too often during the film, I felt that I was looking at an interesting exhibition of wigs and wigs. But if you are a fan of The Turtles or The Swinging 60, in general it can be your movie. And don't forget to look extra. The band members Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan are very funny (and informative) about the disastrous experiences of their leaders and representatives.
