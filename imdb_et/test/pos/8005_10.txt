Many of us find that art is pleasant only when the masterpiece itself touches us deeply. This means that finished creations can only be accepted and appreciated if we can personally associate them with it. It was winter, here in Australia in 1992, when I saw Batman's return to the cinemas and it flew me away. Both "I". I had to belong to the ideal, the standard, but at the same time I lived another life. Tim Burton was the first filmmaker to say OK so that the comic film would be dark and admit that darkness could happen to all of us. After Tim Burton's Batman interpretations, many other dark comic book heroes and heroes flooded the cinemas. For decades, comedy folklore has been talking about friendly, pleasant heroes with pretty beautiful smiles and magical superpowers flying in the sky, twisting powerful fabrics on their wrist and wearing red boots and rolling power. But what happens if you are only ten years old and you see that your parents have been coldly shot before your eyes? You snap. Somewhere in your psyche, your young delicate psychological part breaks down. The only way to control such pain and hurt is to create an alternative person. Your other self is stronger, use all the anger of all anger to use all possible means to free your parents from the innocence of this offender, their criminals, any criminals. This is the life that Bruce Wayne's eyes look like. Both couples. The world he sees is dark, gloomy and cold. Although his patrols on the streets and people hear him on a cruise, they are not in a hurry to get their autograph. He is the Savior of these, not the winner of the personal competition. Batman Returns is about losers. Batman, another one at Christmas, remains the "only lonely man in the beast city". Bruce Wayne can never legitimately arrest Max Shreck. The penguin can never release his pain, which his parents carry off to Gotham citizens, and Selina Kyle has forever disappeared mentally fragmented and traumatized. And the hero doesn't get a girl or a cat. This film rubs the desire of all of us that we want to be so desperate to be at home, as Bruce Wayne and Oswald Cobblepot have expressed. we all listen, respect and not ignore Selina Kyle, Oswald and of course Bruce Wayne. But sometimes we are all pushed in one way or another, we are told to be ideal to behave in a certain standard. This is until we finally finish. At the end of the film, there is only hope when we see Catwoman rising to the night sky. But come, what we all need to have a good will for all men and women. As far as I am concerned, I cannot say that I reach the point where I believe that my problem with duality will be agreed. But that's OK. We all have a dark side. Batman's return is not only the best of Batman's films, but also an extraordinary masterpiece of storytelling.
