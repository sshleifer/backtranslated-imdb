Danny Boyle was not the first person to realize that zombies can fly like cocks. This honor belongs to Lifeforce, which is, of course, the biggest naked space vampire zombie from Halley Comet, who is working on the amok London world film. Tobe Hooper may have done a lot of trouble, but it deserves a place among the immortals for its shamefully demented epic sci-fi horror. Plus it offers space for vampire Mathilda May, the best thing to come out of France from Simone Simon, spends the entire movie naked. What he does very well. Just remember that although he is the most feminine presence, someone has ever been on Earth, but he is also "completely dangerous to the planet and our life and completely dangerous". This is an on-site meeting that I would have liked to sit on: British astronauts on a space program find three bare humanoid alien forms located on a giant 150-mile artichoke / umbrella spaceship hidden by the Halley Comet's tail. Dried bats return to Earth with apocalyptic results as they continue to run off the London population with their vitality, who has a lot of nudity, thunder and bubbles over coffee in the direlogue ("I've been in the room for six months and sees me as perfect." "We assume we don't know anything that is humiliating." Oh, and we can write to Alien and Blue Thunder writers with the writings of the criminals, written by Fucking Mark, Sex Thief, and Eskimo Nell and Jonestown Monster Director. winner, here's $ 22m? Have fun. And they do, they do. <br /> <br /> True, raw materials have enough promises that they have done something really horrible and thought-provoking (when AIDS hysteria is approaching its height , plague "offers plenty of opportunities for allegory", but in Cannon's Go-Go boys that could have been another Quatermass and Pit quickly turn to be more plan 10 out. e is perfect for breaking, be it Frank Finlay fun death scene ("Here I go!"), Peter Firth's big entrance ("I'm Colonel Caine." "From SAS?" room full of reporters: "Gentlemen, the last note was not for publication thought. This is a D-message "that responds to a surprisingly obligatory press officer), security officers who offer Mathilda May a bare room for a vampire a nice cookie to stop his escape, reanimated bodies explosively dust all over the people, sweaty prime sucking lives of his secretary and London filling zombie nuns, Stockbrokers and joggers as the city gets its most comprehensive screen trashing from Mrs. Gorgo lost to junior Battersea Funfair and went to rob. And that doesn't mention "This woman is Masohh!" Extreme Masochist! "Scene or big stereo echo effect for male vampire" It's much less frightening if you just come to me, "while Peter Firth's leading contribution takes his best man's voice to answer" I'll just do it! "In one scene alone, you have the dominant Patrick Stewart, who embodies a woman in our deeply confused hero of astronauts, playing Steve's" Charlie-Manson ", Railsback and his amazing dances with eyebrows" Helta- Skelta! "A regime that is trying to resist the temptation to kiss him, an incredible Aubrey Morris (the only man who makes Freddie Jones restrained), playing home secretary Sir Percy Hesenine like some demented Brian Rix, Peter Firth (one of those actors who always looks like) as he was supposed to be a doctor who didn't see it anymore when no one looked at it anymore, blas√© grabs the public school maso in the hope that no one will ever see it and John Hallam as a male sister who is a male sister opens the door to an average psychological tornado It would be a shame that Frank Finlay's crazy scientists, who are not qualified to confirm the deaths of aliens (the role originally intended for Klaus Kinsk), missed this activity. <br /> <br /> Not as mad as you think the movie is, it's still getting it, be it a zombie pathologist ("He'll have to feed") to explode the entire Home Secretary suit, Patrick Stewart's blood and entrails that make up naked Mathilda. Space Vampires make St Paul's Cathedral the world's largest laser show to transport human souls from the London Underground to its geostationary mother ship. I loved every brilliantly mad moment. This is a truly unique way that can be the greatest film ever made. <br /> <br /> The DVD offers an original 116-minute version that was launched in the UK, not a strongly modified 101-minute US version that not only offers much more fun for your dollar, but also fully restores Henry Mancin's score to its original glory (The US version contained many gaps with additional signs by Michael Kamen and James Guthrie). While Mancini is a somewhat surprising choice at first glance, Mancini's teeth cut to many of the 50's classic universal sci-fi horrors, and his score is quite brilliant - a terrible headline of driving that rarely reminds of how interesting he might be to stay away from Blake Edwards. Unfortunately, there is not only an extra option as an add-on, although it would be nice to count on a special edition for some days, with some deleted scenes from the original 128-minute section by the Cooper: what's shown here can just offer more comedy gold!
