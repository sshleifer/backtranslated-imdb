[Contains spoilers !!!] <br /> <br /> Garfield and his owner Jon Arbuckle were in a hurry. They had no life at all. All they did was lying down and reading the ceiling tiles. Jon even arranged his sock drawer according to color and fabric. He needed a life. So he consults with the book on a topic that tells him to meet a woman. The single bar was a great place to start. Unfortunately, when music started and Jon hit the dance floor, we see what made the disco death: Jon killed it. Next, Jon tried to pick up the girls in the video module. He reached the mouth. Literally. Laundromat was no prize when Jon and his future date saw each other's underwear. Jon tried to act on the beach everywhere, but soon he was angry with the real buff who left Joni in his mouth again. Literally. Then Jon tried to start girls walking and jogging. Not useful. Jon pulled out the guitar and sang the blues. Unfortunately, when he mentioned his cat as fat, a fatty man walked and hit Joni's guitar. It was hopeless. <br /> <br /> Luckily, Joni had an ad on TV: an ad in Lorenzo school, which is worse. It ensured a lifeless person life in a few simple steps. Jon and Garfield are in the classroom. The building did not look on television in exactly the same way as Lorenzo didn't look like on television. Jon sat right next to her Mona. So when Lorenzo taught his lessons to introduce himself, check his pulse and pretend to speak a foreign language, Jon and Mona can get to know each other. They leave together, forgetting about Garfield. At home, Jon and Mona were just sitting on the veranda and talking. Garfield was jealous of Mona for being taken away by Joni. Garfield saw the future: Jon and Mona marry, he moves, and soon he will give birth to a small Arbuckle who is happy to pull Garfield's story. So far, Garfield wouldn't resist it. He tried to get rid of Joni from Mona until he started scratching his ears. But then Jon learned that Mona was allergic to cats. It was basically their relationship. But they still saw each other and now, and Garfield was definitely with them. <br /> <br /> Another fun Garfield TV special! It was made during the run of TV Garfield and friends. Garfield was a bit trimmed. SOMEwhat. Since the beginning of the 1980s, cartoons. Jons' scenes that try to pick up chicks are funny, so it's the fat guy on Joni's guitar. Good Ol Lorenzo Music is back at Garfield. Thom Huge is Jon. Frank Welker (Third Man 1000 Voices) is Lorenzo. And June Foray (1000 votes for a woman) is Mona. If you like Garfield, I suggest you see Garfield's life today! This, along with Garfield and Garfield, appeared on DVD! So check them all today! You have a good time. Hey, does Garfield shoot you before? <br /> <br /> -
