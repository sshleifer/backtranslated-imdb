Watching casual movies at random times is a pleasure to never know what to expect or where the next big movie will appear. Recently, my viewing has evolved in the form of stapled classics such as Raging Bull or Lost Ark Raiders, but this time my VCRs took me from modern comforts and immediately set me on the Lionel Jeffries railroad. Children ". This is a skilfully directed film of three young children, a mysterious event with a father, relocation to the open fields of England and ultimately the inherited benefits of shouldering trains. In the first fifteen minutes of the film, it is understood that it is more than just your common place for a children's film? "Children of Railways" was created at a time when purity was more than "no" when the family meant everything, and where the adventure was ready for every rail track. is more than a divine film, it has an amazing cinematic technique, it keeps the ordinary viewer on the screen unanswered with unanswered questions and gives three perfect companions to follow the 110-minute journey. movie enthusiasts. <br /> <br /> There are many moments that proudly stand out for the "Children of Railways", what s make it mediocre to excellence? one happens to be our three children; Bobby, Phyllis and Peter. Modern cinema tells us that these three children are unable to provide enough darkness, laughter, and insight into the world around them, but Jeffries' children prove the opposite. Intelligently talked about lines (both action and script), sincere kindness and dedication to this small village, until the final meeting at this train stop; These children are more than just a child's star that promotes the story, they guide us with emotions, persuasion and realism that today's children don't see. This little VHS has been offered more imagination than I've seen in the film for years. For Bobby, my birthday was a favorite scene that could have been considered more generally than I've seen in other films. So that Jeffries floods him between guests and gifts, he was exciting and refreshing, keeping our eyes excited for both the scene and the mind. The second scene that attracted my attention was when the kids made gifts for Perks, asking one person for a gift, he just said to Jeffries, "No, I don't. I don't like Perks." Children's reaction is fun? providing moments for both children and adults to enjoy. A small feature filmed in the 1970s offers a real smile as the most modern comedies. This is a creative film with great choreography and direction. <br /> <br /> That means that as much as I loved this movie, it wasn't perfect. Jeffries is doing a great job of preventing what happened to his father, but he felt that the event was happening, the children were kept in the dark, and suddenly it ended up. More details about Dad, not much more, would have strengthened his character and allowed us to see more of the child's reaction. There is also one scene in this movie, one of the spectacular wide-screen photos that are just off England's landscape, which is just breathtaking, but when you look a little closer, you'll see cars in the background. It made me confused, but didn't get too much attention from the overall picture. This kind of cinema is very puzzling and weird today, it seems that only the British can produce it. Movies like "Love, Actually" or "Dibley Vicar" show the power and excitement of community cities, places where everyone knows everyone and we are not afraid to be a neighbor. Is this more a topic that an American audience could have more? more understanding of what is happening outside, rather than staying separate from your events. <br /> <br /> Generally, I loved the children of the railway. I didn't know what to expect when I first put the VHS on the player, but from the opening scene to the exploding train set, the birthday of Persi, Jeffries proved that he could more easily handle the most child-friendly story. His ability to make a child's actors feel like real characters, involve less adults, and involve children like they were adults. This is a film that needs to be seen as a strong alternative to all of Disney's publications. Continuous themes such as friendship, friendliness, and forgiveness break through the grace and power of the TV. "Railway Children" is more than just a child's film; this is a feature that should be the mainstay of contemporary audience viewing. Not only does it provide an excellent visual image of the English countryside, it also teaches (and shows) how life would be, focusing on imagination and courage, rather than fighting CGI against bad guys. <br /> <br /> Rating: **** Â½ *****
