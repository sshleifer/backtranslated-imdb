Most people involved in this film have no idea about Arthur Miller's great novel, which is the basis for it. This is a novel that more people should read to see how prejudices affect and change people's lives. <br /> <br /> At first Lawrence Newman is an ordinary person. The glasses his boss does to him changes everything he has done, and his whole world is falling around him, little by little. It would not have been possible to better match this intelligent performance to the screen than William H. Macy. Not only is she a talented stage and screen actor, she is honest about every character she plays. He is a daily person who is his own insecurity. His anxiety intensifies as he stands and walks out of his work. Suddenly, he has to face the challenges he has been trying to avoid throughout his mid-40s Brooklyn. Is he a Jew, isn't he? Cinematography in this great and atmospheric film, led by a hands-on Neil Slavin, reminded me of some of Edward Hopper's land, especially at the beginning of the film, when Newman steps out of the building and at night when he and his wife follow a long black shadow pair, threatening and preventive confrontation with bullying. Laura Dern, David Paymer, and especially Meat Loaf, who invade an incredibly deep bully, are excellent, but they are all pale compared to William H. Macy's characters (H must stand HONEST). If you haven't read the book, I would recommend it sincerely because no one has written truly and convincingly when Arthur Miller has.
