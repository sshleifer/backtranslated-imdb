If you liked movies like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, then you are going to LOVE Two Hands. It has the same black sense of humor and attracts you through the film. Like Pulp Fiction, it has weak scenarios that characters enter and deal with. With Gallipoli and a picnic at Hanging Rock, this must be one of the best Australian films I've seen. It also marks the young Heath Ledger before it became big in the countries. <br /> <br /> This is a terribly underrated movie that I believe is as good as Pulp Fiction and those greatid. You have to see it!
