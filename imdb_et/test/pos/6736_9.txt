Blythe Danner and Judith Ivey present great performances here, as Jonathan Silverman, like Eugene, speaks his life on Brighton Beach in 1937. <br /> <br /> What makes a movie so good is that the relationships between the characters are extremely wonderful family values. <br /> <br /> Bob Dishy had a great opportunity here as a clan father. He gives restrained but convincing results as a family patriarch. <br /> <br /> His sons played by Jonathan Silverman and Brian Dillinger are staggering. There are certain scenes when Silverman is skating or jumping where I am reminded of Jerry Lewis. <br /> <br /> Danner and Ivey are also wonderful. Their roots are the Jewish culture of cunning, intonation and idealism. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is just great. Beautiful Brighton in 1937! Even when war was inevitable, the film is rich in many of the typical problems that families face in this period. In some ways, you do not have to be Jewish to experience what the family is going through. <br /> <br /> You must see nostalgic buffers and those who believe so strongly in family values.
