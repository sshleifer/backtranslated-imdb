It seems to me that many are strangely ignorant of Chabrol, so it seems to me that it's cold, it's slipping. Not as openly sexy, violent as nervous, because many of the films in this period will start to do quite amazingly, and although they are increasingly measured, it will continue to produce a very unpleasant smell. Lady Audran, not here's the maid, but the drunk mother, Donald Pleasence, is the child's moor master, David Hemmings has eyes on the juvenile sex, and the central issue is the relationship between brother, sister and niece. Not at all very nice and Chabrol treats all this if it is very normal (as it may be in some small French villages!) Instead of Ed McBain in New York. Had it been more sensitive, it would have been more acceptable, but less film. Here, you really have to choose between the likelihood of various unpleasant opportunities before finalizing. Very observable
