"Gay Desperado" is wonderful all over the world. Dragging between Leo Carrillo and Harold Huber is as funny as what you would hear in the movie today. Best Line? "That would be my third choice!" "Diego" is probably Kevin Smith's "Silent Bob" archetype. Lucien N. Andoit's black-and-white cinematography (especially with the bandit's shadows) was striking. I can say about East Lupino: "Thank God for the DVD!" You can go directly to a scene where he tries to look at sombreros and serpas and see that he is standing in front of that mirror over and over again. .
