I did this a couple of years ago on community television and I was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable this film is. <br /> <br /> Although it is somewhat enjoyable, its main task is to be a mysterious thriller. great, thanks to a script that is a brilliant plot; it kept me in mind and the resolution was inspired. <br /> <br /> There is a stellar letter that includes mixtures at the end of their career (Richard Long died the same year it was made)) or those who had hit the TV series (Kate Jackson, Tom Bosley). They all do a good job, except for Cesare Danova, who is traveling through her role. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
