I think this movie is one of the most interesting and funny movies of all time. There are so many intelligent thoughts that someone who thinks the film is terrible did not get it and is undoubtedly able to recognize the truly deep philosophical themes that are present in all 3 Schneider films. A number of universities in Germany and throughout Europe have been looking at seeing Schneider things. By the way, Helge Schneider is a very intelligent and sensitive person and Jazz music in Germany (perhaps European). He is inspired by the great M.Davis and T.Monkis. So if you don't like it, it's ok, but please don't try to convince others that it may be stupid, cheap, boring or not funny. Because if you had to face this opinion in the discussion, and if you're ready to deal with H. Schneider's art, then you should "give".
