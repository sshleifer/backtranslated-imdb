After traveling all over the world, I saw that Australia really has one thing other countries have: history. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Australia wasn't sure after the war. war and most of his political history is rather ..... boring! Nothing "great" happened to mark any turning point in Australian history ... until the release of the Whitlam government with Australian Governor John Kerr. <br /> <br /> For those in Australia, you can skip this paragraph and move on to the next. This is useful for curious non-Australians! Australia was colonized by the British. As time passed, it turned out that Australia was able to stand on its two feet. Thus, the United Kingdom authorized Australia to establish its own parliaments, laws, courts, etc. Australian law and politics are no longer provided directly by the British; Rather, Australia manages Australians independently, although courts, precedents, Parliament and so on are largely modeled on the British system. This change was codified in the Australian Constitution. Despite the fact that the Constitution legally establishes Australian governments, legislative procedures, courts (but those who are curious - there is no bill of rights), these are two "chronic" sections that have remained so far and remain here. They are considered more or less "reserve mandates of the kroon (King of the United Kingdom / Queen)." The first group of groups is related to the establishment of the Office of the Secretary-General. In short, the governor is considered the queen's royal representative in Australia and is called the "executive management" of the Australian government. When the Australian Parliament adopts a law, the Constitution provides that it will only become law if it is signed by the governor. As such, Govenor's general is considered to be something other than a rubber stamper who performs archaic and unnecessary constitutional functions on behalf of the crowns. Theoretically, the Governor may refuse to sign a law passed by the Australian Parliament if he considers it appropriate. For example, if Parliament has passed a law that allows the police to kill dead people over the age of 50 (of course, of course, hypothetical), then GG could refuse to sign it and it would not become the law of the land. But this power is theoretical and has never been used. The "Convention" (which is the buzz of the events leading up to the dismissal), the governor mainly acts at the request of the Australian Government, and when the government adopts the law and the Prime Minister orders the signature of the Director General, he is almost always without a doubt. In fact, the governor acts with the "convention" in accordance with the advice given to him by the day's prime minister (and only the prime minister). Another aspect is Article 64 of the Constitution, which stipulates that the Ministers of Government will perform the "joy" of the Governor's Office. Now the events of 1975 - covered by this film - brought a precedent in this particular section: if the governor is somehow dissatisfied with the government and / or the prime minister, this paragraph seems to allow him to legally sack the government (which happened in 1975 ... so The title of the film "dismissal.") Can the "Secretary-General's joy" be interpreted as "the unlimited right to dismiss" is the disputed issue, although this led to a fairly hot change between the Australians - especially given that the Governor is not elected by the Australian people. <br /> <br /> Now that this background aspect has failed, return to the discussion film. It was well done. This pace was patient, but not at all. The drama was well closed and very realistic. It did not dramatize events at all and, most importantly, it did not present its point of view from one political point of view. On the contrary, I felt that it was fair and balanced, even though the conclusion of the text before the credit shows that filmmakers have apparently not approved the Director General's decision to release the Whitlam government. But I would not describe the film broadly in one or the other direction as biased. <br /> <br /> In terms of accuracy, it was practically on the ground. The filmmakers definitely did their homework and obviously read the books and writings of all the major players involved. There were a number of subtle details that were somewhat skipped, mainly because they took a long time to explain and ultimately had little effect on the 1975 events, so I forgive them for that. In addition, I think it was hard to restore public opinion after the post-Vietnam war, but Noyce pulled it out a lot. <br /> <br /> Finally, I was pleased that the film tried to raise both sides of the individual policies without being analytical, obsessive, or even more, whatever we raise, such as Connor's pipeline. very important. The filmmakers realized that their task was to tell the story of the events that led to the dismissal, and not to provide political affirmation or opposition to politics and positions. It was wise because it meant that the film could not be blamed for misusing one party's policy. <br /> <br /> The dismissal is probably the most incredible piece of political history that has occurred in Australia in a short life. I'm glad it is crystallized in celluloid. An important look at any Australia.
