I had moved very much from a young man's life experience that had risen so high in the academic world. The difficult life surrounded by the love of a close family and the extended family of companions created a man who can succeed in the world. Mostly, the Spanish culture is shown as I have always observed and admired - hardworking, optimistic and truly family-oriented. The points of religious superstition were quite authentic for the Catholic Church. Undoubtedly, the mother deserves the actor's Academy Award. His prayers for his missing sons led me to tears. I recommend this amazingly thoughtful film to your friends and family.
