It's made for a TV movie by Hallmark. Hallmark has always made quality films that are family-oriented. Just desserts are a boy and a girl who love working with a movie. Two bakers will compete for a $ 250,000 prize in the professional bakery industry. It is fun and easy with the heart. Desserts are great. The film has a memorable, spooky little song that is played during the competition. I assume it's done for Roger Bellon's film. The bad thing is that no sound is available. I would really like to get a copy of the song. I don't even know the name of the song because the credit ends up at the end of the movie to make room for hundreds of ads. Anyway, it's great. Brenda Vaccarot is always nice to see. He's very effervescent and lively. Lauren Holly is always a plus and Costas Mandylor creates good guys with great performance. Professional chef Wolfgang Puck has a guest. The film is worth it.
