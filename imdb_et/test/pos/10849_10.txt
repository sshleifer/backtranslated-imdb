When I rented this movie, I waited halfway for a small budget, drawing less Indy movie, but I thought I'd give it a try. I started looking at Part 1 and couldn't take it out until it ended 3 hours later. It was definitely my absolute favorite movie of all time. From writing to staging, I was laughing, crying and singing all the time with Nan Astley's ritual of innocence and adulthood. Rachael Stirling is phenomenal in this film. I've never heard him before, but now I remember the vulnerability and strength I felt in my work forever. He, Keeley Hawes and Jodhi May, are incredible because they lead you through the emotional instabilities that most know when dealing with another form of sexuality. The fact that the film was set up in the 1890s not only does the audience know about homosexuality during this period, but also today about its society. You have to see this movie and probably like myself, you make it to the store to add it to your collection.
