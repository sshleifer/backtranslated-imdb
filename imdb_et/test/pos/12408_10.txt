This movie is great for a small group of teenagers who decide to hit a local bank. Brian (Justin Walker) wants to get out of his small town, just like Jimmy Stewart's "It's Wonderful Life". Unlike George Bailey, Brian robs the bank to finance his dream to attend art school, even if his father doesn't support it. The offer offered to Brian is to act as a client and disturb the guard. This is an appealing offer to many when I ask what they are doing. Anyway, Brian does it. When Sheriff (James Remar) and his forces surround the bank, things get worse off. It is standalone even when the Feds move, so that children can kill if they have a clean shot. The Sheriff must avoid it and try to stop peacefully. Unfortunately, tensions rise and teenagers turn to each other. Some of them are out of control. The paper cutter scene is tough and hard to look at. Very intense!
