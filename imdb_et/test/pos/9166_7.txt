This movie was much better than I expected. After a couple of movies that Will Smith did that was not as big as I, Robot, he is pleasant and fun about it. Smith plays, Hitch, a date doctor. Most of the films focus on him, teaching Albert how to be himself and get to Allegra Cole, who is the rich celebrity with whom he works. Albert is klutz and goof and always collides with the legs or not. All Hitch has to teach her how to act cooler and not so nervous around Allegra. <br /> <br /> During this time, Hitch meets Saraga, a rumor columnist who has sworn men. Hitch worships her, so of course they go out. But Hitch can teach other boys how a girl falls for them, she doesn't believe in herself. She has never been a girl because she was dumped in college. But she likes Sara so she goes after her. Sara's friend is an injured boy whom he thinks he went to the doctor. So Sara is watching the doctor down to learn only that grip. So he thinks he's a pig. Then Sara and Allegra have to explain what she is doing, so they both give forgiveness. <br /> <br /> END OF VERDIKT: Good, some are laughing and have fun. I recommend it.
