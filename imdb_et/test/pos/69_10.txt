I found that this story is just enough for a thriller that wonderful henry mancic music doesn't leave me. Julie Andrews was great and I don't understand why this movie was in the box when it came out because it finally makes me happy that everyone would sing. and I like to be happy after the end of what I think you can say that this movie is with some traditional blake edwards humor ...
