Deep Water (2006) **** <br /> <br /> "It's indifferent ... it's waiting for you to slip one." These words (parafrased) are probably the best summaries of what ocean I have ever heard. Her fur is unlimited, at least one of which is her loneliness. These words come from the fascinating and heartfelt documentary film Deep Water. This is the story of Donald Crowhurst, an amateur sailor who took part in the Sunday 1969 Times Race world. If you don't know your story, you may be best to stop reading. Don't read this or any other information about Crowhurst or the competition. Find and watch a movie. <br /> <br /> After the first ocean circulation in 1967, adventurers and observers began to look for the following. This time the journey must take place without landing or stopping. Crowhurst, who had fallen in severe times, saw this race as a great opportunity to get his family back on their feet. He had lived in financial difficulties as a child and wanted to return some of this life. So he decided to find sponsors and did it at Stanley Best and Rodney Hallworth. Two men wrote a possible coffers and gave a boat to Crowhurst, provided that if he had to withdraw from the competition, he would have to bear the costs himself. However, his boat was seriously in need of repair, and he was afraid that it was not ready for the final departure day. Her sponsor told her she just had to go? After all, they started to do the dough and waited a long time ago. The story details are infamous: the Crowhurst boat started to take water and its progress slowed down. Faced with the decision to try to round up the African horn (certain death in such a boat) or return (financial ruin and poverty), he was looking for a third chance. He decided to hide alone in his yacht, waiting for Cape Horni from other competitors in South America. From there, he stepped back to the race. He reported false positions and record speeds. Then he ended all relations, fearing that his position would be given away. He also had to carefully prepare fake log books for each day of the trip he didn't take. Finally, loneliness, guilt and understanding that he is likely to be caught, weighed too hard on Crowhurst. His final log entries make Kurtz's music completely sensible. Just a few weeks at home, he turned his boat away from home and said it would soon jump overboard. <br /> <br /> The crowhurst odyssey is exciting, and its end is a heartbeat but inevitability. Our dreams often become fears and the consequences of our actions leave us so few opportunities for a happy ending. This is the story of being caught up in the infinite gulf of cruel seas. Filmmakers do an excellent job of talking about this story. It has been compiled with the cooling of Crowhurst's audio and video recordings, and the stories of his increasingly insane log books. The story begins slowly and may distract some viewers, but the story's prizes are a complete success. <br /> <br /> There are also queries about some other competitors, such as Frenchman Bernard Moitessier, who was in the best possible competition to win the race, but to pull and start another trip around the world. The film also includes Robin Knox-Johnston. He donated his prize money to the Crowhurst family. <br /> <br /> Crowhurst's saga of short reading just doesn't do justice. Of course, this is interesting, but quick browsing ignores the raw emotions and wonders presented here. The last moments of deep water are truly heartbreaking, listening to your widow's thoughts and respecting and understanding your friends. This is a fascinating story and it is the documentary that carries such large channels.
