The "Landscape After Battle" opens with fleeing fleets full of fleeing prisoners - a rather funny move with Vivaldis Four Seasons. Missing opening. But soon we will get to know these prisoners as mobile, and if they (also treating humorous) buried the man alive, the protagonist will stop for a moment, but soon he will rather find a mapped camp by finding books than looking after his neighbor. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is set in an American camp, where prisoners are not released, a half-freedom, a half-camp. The perfect set for exploring war crimes, American camps, Polish nationalism, Catholics, grief and human misery in general. <br /> <br /> Film makes a big difference. Women come in and the movie changes light, color and mood with them. At the same time, it turns out that these prisoners were slaves of the Holocaust. I think that the main political theme of the film is to treat the humanity with the Jews during and after the World War, not just the destruction of the Nazis, but humanity to allow it - and even forcing them out of Europe after the war. On an emotional level, the film speaks of the sad and the problem associated with grief, how the environment makes it difficult and how difficult it is to share grief for people with different experiences. But the film is the carpet of major contradictions, humor, irony and sudden beauty. A couple of times during the film, a gypsy prisoner plays a harp, an emotional voice that was brutally rejected by the protagonist (speaking in the film). This example captures the essence of the style and theme of the film. When it comes to humor, it is very comical how the protagonist loses his eyes, finds the crowd, chimneys, etc. <br /> <br /> When you see this movie, it's not hard to understand Spielberg's respect for Wajda. The great treatment of light can be compared to Spielberg's best. Grunwald Intermezzo speaks for himself. Narratively, it brings the film out of the camp, but it brings the film to the dream and eternity with deep beauty. Anyway, there is another scene that I can't shoot without comment. His Christian dinner. Undoubtedly ironic, but at the same time deeply religious, we see the moment of transcendence, everyone falls on his knees, while the protagonist is saved from the separation of the priest to be a comic altar son. His watches blaze the scene, but also give him emotions and love. When Nina gets the bread, the sunlight gets on her and calls spherically at the peak of the film. <br /> <br /> The main players are excellent in their roles. Olbrychski as the perfect Wajda protagonist - a dubious reflective mind who is unable to put all aspects of his mind and emotions into life. The beautiful Celinska is a great body who acts in the debut of a character that is unable to express her proud movements in her inner. <br /> <br /> Those who try to describe everything are often unable to take into account. It is managed by Wajda. His films are either very moving, deep or beautifully photographed, but pay attention to the peculiarities of life and society. One moment of joy for one is the moment of irony for the second, the third moment of grief, for the fourth moment. <br /> <br /> There are at least two reasons to pay attention to this period's Wajdas films. First, there is considerable free expression of profound political influence. This country was the first to overthrow communism twenty years later. Secondly, there is the development of a philosophical and narrative language that Kusturica has grown into.
