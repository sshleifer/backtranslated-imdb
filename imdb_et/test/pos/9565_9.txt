I saw this movie openly, not knowing what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised that this film was written, directed and acted in such a way that every minute is a wonderful time. People do not seem like they are acting, they are the real people who really train the dogs and lead the life depicted in this film. There are some wonderful moments where you laugh or laugh, some jokes can be dry, but are presented in a very observable way. Highly recommended!
