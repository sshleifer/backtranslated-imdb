Cuban Gooding Jr is back on top! Jesus, he did a great job in this movie! I loved this movie. One of them knows good movies that make you want and volunteer on a mission or something. Anyway I would recommend seeing this movie in the heartbeat! It is worth the entrance price. And like Cuban Gooding Jr., just give him the next Oscar right now !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
