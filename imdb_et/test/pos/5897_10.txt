I am very pleased to see that this great movie gets so high-profile characters from IMDB users. The best years of their lives are the best cinematographic statements about the veterans who have returned from war. The best results from the March of Frederick were easily overlooked. In fact, the whole cast, including the music legend Hoagy Carmichael, looks at us all with a fine version of our classic Lazy River. I recommend this good movie to anyone who loves movies.
