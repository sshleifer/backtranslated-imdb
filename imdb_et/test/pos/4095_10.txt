I was about 14 years old when I saw the music version of Lost Horizon. I loved the movie as much as the songs I went to the cinema several times to see it again and again. My mother bought the LP and I learned these songs from my heart, just as I did "Sound of Music" (hardly known in Austria). I think the problem with the critics' own criticism is that they do not have a romantic soul and have not seen the film in the eyes of young teenagers. Maybe he's a fan of Ingrid Bergman, but I was happy with Liv Ullman. Does Ingrid Bergman sing and dance? What was so big? Perhaps the critic did not criticize him because he needed new glasses or a contact lens because he saw the close similarity between Liv Ullman and Bill Clinton. It was the idea and story of the film, the philosophy that was the most important and interesting factor and the musical color, making it more fun and enjoyable, without damaging the intellectually attractive aspects. It is shameful that many other films with so-called big actors and actors with irrelevant themes / stories are completely boring.
