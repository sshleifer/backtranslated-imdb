This interesting film has three great performances: Sanders, Patrick and Blackmer. The scenes between Sanders and Patrick are particularly prominent. Unfortunately, if the detective is unfortunately almost as good. He lacks the intelligence, strength and cynical worldview of Bogart. If Humphrey played this part, we could have been classic. <br /> <br /> Pace, location (library) and atmosphere are all good. But there are some holes in the plot. Sanders strongly fears Blackmer and his ruthless organization (the Nazis). But after Blackmer's mistaken killing, Sanders seems to have no anxiety or regret. Sanders then grabs the library and its riders, using it as detective investigators for his murder. Later, Sanders' attempt to kill Demming (without dampers), even though many other inmates could have expected a hearing of hearing and concern. Finally, Sanders strikes a man to kill Roberts who has discovered the truth, but when he despises, he does not do so inexplicably. But what was most disturbing to me was that the big and unexpected conclusion was wasted. Throughout the film, Patrick is depicted as a smart, hard nail that is not afraid of anything. Finally, he escapes from the last surviving Nazi, a cruel thug. By the time the police found him, he killed him. And it just comes as another weak, stereotypical victim. What should have happened is that the police officers find the Nazi thug, but he is dead. He killed him wisely and then disappeared - to continue his evil ways.
