You can remove the claw from the joint, but it seems that the removal of the joint is extremely difficult. In this situation, we have seen such a situation before (and since): in films such as BOB LE FLAMBEUR, ELEVATOR TO GALLOWS, TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI, ANDERSON TAPES and so on. What makes this one of the most remarkable is the (naturally) father himself, who plays literally in real time and lead behavior. Bogart would think twice before crossing this boy. The ironic end is perfect for this story (it almost requires it). All around, one of the best movies noir.
