This movie was recommended to me by the same person who blessed me with a copy of Narnia's chronicle. Shadowlands is one of the most amazing scenarios ever written. It is well executed, behaved and directed. The film is a little dark for my taste, but I'm sure it was so. The scenario is similar to the parts of the poetry movie, through a movie I found a break to reflect just the comments made on the screen. This is a great cinema and I can only hope that more people will travel around and add comments. A fair warning, though it was a 6 tissue film for me. Very touching. Very cordial performances.
