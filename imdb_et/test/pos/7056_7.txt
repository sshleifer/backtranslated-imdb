The reason I like this movie so much is because of this spirit. This is a brilliant summer camp movie, so jokes don't mean a permanent way that makes one character a permanent ridicule. The ashes are happening, but you feel that the corresponding falling boys would be able to laugh and laugh because they were small enough for them - and without being too cheesy, it is really nice that everyone will still be the end of friends! <br /> <br /> This is an extra special bonus if all of their jolly japide ringmaster is Bill Murray. For me, he still looked at the god of comedy when he could get rid of it. No one is better off to create a sense of free-sized mad anarchy without anyone actually suffering. The whole film has the same style as his leading man, created with an excellent home screen that shows Murray's way of getting ready for the day. Everything is stupid, yes, but more important than the behavior of an adult is that you have a good number of good stories. "Meatballs" allow this and eventually bring food.
