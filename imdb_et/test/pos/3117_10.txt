What can you say about a short little movie that is full of secondary actors and not "stars" that have no bad performances, not one badly communicated dialogue and cold violence on the one hand balancing the warm "heart" story of the protagonists? <br /> <br /> This is a jewel, a diamond, a small valuable legacy from the West that awakens the western spirit and legend of America. To the West, which is not solved by big heroes like Hickock or Cody, or Masterson or Earp, just because of the proliferation of everyday man and woman, farmers and beaches, merchants and miners, and forest workers, whores and barkeepers and daytime entertainers. for the sake of wealth, some for peace and quiet, some for freedom of religion. <br /> <br /> This is perhaps a very spiritual story, though not a specific religion, even though Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. story, regardless of religious affiliation and beliefs, and go out of your way of promoting tolerance and charity when a wagon train reaches a stranded drug for people. And in a truly biblical way, like David and Goliath or Samson and the Philistines, they are the guardians of angels sent to the train of the wagon, who must eventually go head-on to the clegg's clan incarnate, which compares these snake gardens. Eden, and regret what they have to do later. This is a sweet folkloric story from the West that hits every target toward John Ford. <br /> <br /> Today I have a Santa Claus in the West, whose red clothing is covered with a denim-colored coat, with a red stocking cap replaced by a brown Stetson who is carrying a gift box from a gift and a rope roll. To my Santa, I added a Winchester rifle that put one on his shoulders and a Colt revolver on his waist. When people in the office ask why my Santa needs to carry arms, I just say, "Snakes!" After all, is not one of the Christmas seasons where everyone should get what they deserve? Fifty-five years later, especially after 911, movie characters and story-proving philosophies and attributes are as important today as they were then.
