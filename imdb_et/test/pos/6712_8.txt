For a man who had healed the Lifeforce idea, I have one thing to say: Thank you, sir! Lifeforce combines Star Trek's big budget sci-fi boom: The Motion Picture with Phantasm's cheap horror excitement and cups all turned off with t-ts - and some real grinders. actually a good movie! It amazes me that no one really justified the mainstream movie, which is a hot chick in the form of a vehicle for one and a half hours naked on the screen producers. God bless you, all of you who were involved. <br /> <br /> Steve Railsback (Helter Skelter) plays with colleague Carlson, an escort of an international space mission sent to Halley Comet for investigation. The Carlson team finds an alien ship inside the comet, and from inside they find three naked people in a suspended animation - two men and a warm one (Mathilda May). Well, to make a short story, they are "space vampires" ... naked "space vampires". They trash the team apart from Colonel Blueballs who decided that he had to let the hot chick out of his lucite display case, as part of his brain that controls his nut liquids told him that it was right to do. The colony brings it back to our big blue ball to escape. Meanwhile, another space shuttle team has discovered a ship that has died in space, and has brought the three spaces of living dead martensians back to London. And just then people start to become pork bark and s - t just starts to get too quick. <br /> <br /> Carlson is with his controversial colleague Cain (Peter Firth). British SAS our naked cutie - having one time hell, sucking boys left and right. Carlson discovered that he had a spiritual connection with Vampire, which allowed them to follow him, with the ultimate goal of blowing his ass and wrecking the big roof of his and his palms, sucking the energy of the people that the vamps attack. Will they succeed over time? MY SPOILER: Yes. <br /> <br /> Wow. What can I say, but "Wow"? This damn movie really works. I can't believe they've seen real British actors on this film, such as Aubrey Morris (A Clockwork Orange) and Patrick Stewart (Sexiest Man Alive or any such title). All participants are good. The direction is good and the last half seems to be seeing London's fantastic destruction. There are also no special effects. In 1985, this film must be as s as fx. All the effects are quite impressive and there are many different talents in animation, make-up, light and very nice room scenes with good old-fashioned modeling and matte finish - very nicely done. There are even some gore and bloody squib pictures for all the horror fanboys out there. <br /> <br /> Lifeforce is a great movie for all those who are nostalgia, when the popular bigsceen movies were made 100% with love to end. The film's creators proved that all the bases are covered and the end result is a phenomenally fun thing that won't let you turn, because the procedure is too good to look at. Actual solid entertainment here: 8 1/2 out of 10.
