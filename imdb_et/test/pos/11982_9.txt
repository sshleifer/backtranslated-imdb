I just watched this movie over the weekend and I have to say I enjoyed it. Two Italian American actors are excellent as usual (Michael Imperioli and John Ventimiglia). It is obvious that the director was influenced by two great past films by Italians. He was mainly influenced by Dino Risi and his film IL SORPASSO. This is the story of two young men who meet randomly and become friends. One is extrovert and the other is introverted. They enjoy the whole day together and by the end of the day it learns to be shy that there is more than normal ordinary monotony in life. The same goes for Albert De Santi. Unfortunately, IL SORPASS has a very similar ending and it probably affected the director of ON THE RUN because he uses the same technique but with twists. I was expecting something, but I was surprised that it turned out to be the opposite. When you watch both movies you understand. The second film, which influenced the director, is the DAY, led by the great Italian American Scorsese. I recommend all 3 movies!
