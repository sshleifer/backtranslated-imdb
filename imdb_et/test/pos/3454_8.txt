I rented this dusky aussie remnant a few years ago to show off my friend and it was immediately successful. A classic story about the oz wizard, who has a decisive cornball in the 70s Australian. community stuff here, but later, "Mad max" star Bruce Spence is a beautifully undervalued surfie / scarecrow, and Gary Wadell and Robin Ramsay have nice comics by the delightful 70's camp fairy wizard / father character. musical contribution from former Daddy Cool ancestor Ross Wilson on the title song. In a similar way to later aussie comedies, such as the "Queen of the Priscilla Queen". Good fun.
