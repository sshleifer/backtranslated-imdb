The reason I think this movie is fabulous is that it has so many emotions. From the scenario and the fabulous acting you can say that there are all the feelings that exist. You understand why characters take certain actions and why others don't. They can feel compassion and joy at once and love and sadness. You see humanity at its best and at its worst. You can interact with characters, because although you have never been in their exact situations before you see the qualities and downs you see yourself. To a certain extent, it keeps the movie as you think, but eventually it explains itself and you know some peace and understanding not only in you but in characters. I say I have never ever cried so much in life, and never got so much. I ask you to watch this movie and take it to heart. That's just one real thing and it's ... love.
