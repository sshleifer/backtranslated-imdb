If this film is faithful to Burrough's vision, it is great; where it comes from Burroughs, it's great. This is the story of a family, looking for a father with a real and emotional orphan. Lambert speaks of one of the toughest lines in the cinema: "He was my Father!" it is enough to bring tears in the eyes of the most cynical critic. Not the perfect movie - Glenn Close's notorious McDowell voice over-copying is pointless and only explained by a very British mistake - but a fine as a flawed masterpiece and noble goodbye to Sir Ralph Richardson.
