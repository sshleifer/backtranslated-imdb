I would like to emphasize these great points in favor of this movie: <br /> <br /> # 1 Angelina Jolie's Sex Music <br /> <br /> # 2 Foley Artist Overwhelmed <br /> The plot was quite thick < br /> <br /> # 4 DVDs contain trailers and chapters <br /> <br /> # 5 no animals were harmed when making a movie <br /> # 6 respects the blade runner through the movie <br /> < br /> # 7 burning garbage bins <br /> <br /> # 8 funny guys without feet <br /> <br /> # 9 Jack Palance's voice commands added a real dynamic element to the film. <br /> <br /> # 10 Get advice, for example, "If you eat with a devil, bring a long spoon". <br /> <br /> # 11 Angelina Jolie was only 18! <br /> <br /> All in all, an entertainment night was offered.
