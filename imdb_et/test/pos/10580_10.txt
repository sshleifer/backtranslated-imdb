After reading all of Sarah Waters' books, I was eagerly awaiting the Fingersmith BBC adaptation. Especially because the old acquaintances Andrew Davies had done so well that Velvet Tipping has done. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with the results, I really think it might be TTV; both romantic and entertaining. And not so many uninformed people think you would be a useless lesbian romp. After being a fan of Elaine Cassidy, as she saw her innocent turns on Felicia's journey, I thought she embodied both hard scams and growing insecurity like Maud. His transformation was credible and impressive. I felt a small role for Sally Hawkins, like Zena Blake, Tipping the Velvet, so I didn't have so many expectations, but she was an amazing Sue Trinder. His eyes were mesmerizing, giving all the rage to absolute despair. These two acting together, combining these talents, made this drama unacceptable. Of course, Imelda Staunton was usually amazing, he is obviously a national treasure, and the supporting pains were all high. Even the rather unknown direction of Aisling Walsh used contrasting, but beautiful blue tones of brown to Briar and London. <br /> <br /> But so much praise must be given to the script writer Ransley. A 600-page book, each with a three-month extravaganza, is a great choice. He enlightened the main revelations at a constant pace, while giving plenty of back and character development. He's my full admiration. <br /> <br /> To sum up, it is a brilliant adaptation, where all involved gave 100% and made it one of the best BBC dramas I've seen.
