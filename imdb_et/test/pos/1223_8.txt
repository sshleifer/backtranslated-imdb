Well, unlike most people .... I went to this movie, assuming it wasn't so good and it turned out to be a fantastic movie. Pretty cool plot I love the idea, but what really made this movie was the actors. They all did incredible work and it was pretty cool to see that fish and dillon work together. It's a movie where you immediately think when you can predict what will happen, but it's not quite sure how you predicted. I don't want to give that story, so I wont ... but I suggest giving it a chance. When you saw the Cash Train and enjoyed it, you would love this movie. Maybe everything about Lawrence Fishburn touches on gold?
