When I was sitting in a theater where I wept scary for fear, Ron Howard and Tom Hanks called the Da Vinci code, so I didn't see the light at the end of the tunnel, which is angels and demons. <br /> <br /> Hanks and Company are back for descendants and angels and they have learned their lesson. <br /> <br /> Everyone has a much better way of doing things. Aylet Zurer is very good than Vittoria Vetra and better than Sophie Neveau. Tom Hanks is very good, as always, he is still better off because he works harder, giving the film a feeling that it is a thriller. I think Ewan McGregor is doing the best work for all participants. He may even deserve the nomination, but it is doubtful. He was convinced of me until the end. He is dynamic and faithful, but rational, and understands that the Church is keeping its past behind them. Small participants also do very good jobs. <br /> <br /> Technically and visually, the film is much better. Cinema is a lot ... much better and the visual effects are great. The final sequence of explosions is great. Howard does a masterful job of bringing you through a Roman tour. <br /> <br /> Ron Howard is doing an amazing job of keeping the story ahead and not getting bored with the historical lesson. condemnation of Christianity. With the film, you feel more than at stake. In our weak minds who discover whether Jesus had children or not, the list is not as high as the cataclysmic explosion that killed thousands, including the Roman Catholic Church. Part of the reason why I think this story is so fast is due to excellent results. I can't say enough about the score. Sometimes it was epic, like something from the Lord of the Rings, but sometimes it seemed like a Bourne movie that is a nice mix. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about this movie is that it is ridiculously drawn away. The chances that Carmelengo is someone of Ewan McGregors' age are very unlikely, and the chances of a cardinal choosing his chosen son as a pope are even more ridiculous. Not to mention the whole Antimatter thing that is not yet being created, and Dan Brown wrote the book in 2003 ... <br /> <br /> In general, angels and demons are much more dense, faster, more exciting and important than the Da Vinci Code. It must see a thriller for anyone who loves history and mystery.
