Are you looking for a comic drama with a midnight review and a band? Well find this little sleeping place. John Lithgow and Billy Bob Thorton are great at this small plot. Don't forget Jamie Lee Curtis's coming. The touch of the 60s, the touch of the "prince and the pauper" and the dash of its domestic gold change the little story of fat.
