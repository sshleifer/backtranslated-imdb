039: Anna Christie (1930) - published 2/21/1930; Viewed 3/10/06 <br /> <br /> October 24, 1929: Black Thursday, Stock Exchange runs. The country and the world are now looking at the Hollywood exit of the world from the great depression of the world. <br /> <br /> Words: Anne Frank, June Carter, Yasser Arafat, Bob Newhart, Barbara Walters, Doris Robert, Ed Asner, Dick Clark, Roy E. Disney, Gene Hackman. <br /> <br /> DOUG: Finally, our Odyssey continues with Greta Garbo's first sound, a simple character study by Anna Christie. Excellent performance by Mrs Garbo, who showed to the right that her talents could have passed from a quiet era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be storing them.) One thing I noticed time and time again was how The Swedish accent sounds like replacing a letter with JY sound. Anna reaches the only character I liked; I didn't care about my alienated father or his desires. Sound recording systems seem to be getting better (no one tends to talk to the mystery), but the camera is still not moving. We will certainly see that it changes when our odyssey continues. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Our first film from the 1930s is the first soundtrack with a silent star Greta Garbo, Anna Christie. This is a very simple movie with just about five different locations where we spend a long time with a 89-minute-long, often static camera. It was nice to see Marie Dressler in good shape and quite fun as what we hear is an endless, cordial, but intruding slurry. I was very pleased with the results of Garbo because it supports the film even in the most challenging moments. I didn't like George Marion or Charles Bickford because I didn't make sense to some of them, so I was relieved and excited when Anna stood up for her and shows them she doesn't belong to her "alienated father or her muscular Irish boy. it is nice to see that the famous silent screenwriter Frances Marion has not kept up the pace quietly. <br /> <br /> The last movie: Speedy (1928), the last film chronologically: The Love Parade (1929). 1930).
