Flatliner's basic premise is quite simple. Several medical students put themselves to death to find out exactly what the brain is doing at that time. It seems like jokes are made by the mobile of dull students, but this is the basis for some very scary areas. In today's world where Hollywood has to go for foreign markets to make ideas for making horror films, Flatliners is one of those rare gems that shows that Hollywood can do something other than trying hard enough. <br /> <br /> What separates Flatliners from many movies based on the premise that comes out today is that it doesn't tend to be irrelevant or arrogant. Flatliners recognizes that people go for entertainment, not morality. In such a supernatural thrill, the difference that it limits is really incredible. What's even more amazing is that Julia Roberts appears without being annoying or showing that she can only play Julia Roberts. The twilight theory that performers work best with the smallest audience is valid here. <br /> <br /> The sub-blocks of what characters find when they disappear, which makes them alive, and how it comes back to their present time, is done surprisingly well. Especially intriguing are the moments when William Baldwin's character finds his personal video tape collection that will return him again. The fact that William Baldwin seems to be so perfect in his role says a lot about the script or the direction. I'm not sure what. <br /> <br /> Kiefer Sutherland, on the other hand, looks like a leader. It looks like he is a mystery about what the past experience is, which is invading today and why it opens up. As Kevin Bacon's character goes to find an old schoolhouse whose life he did in hell and tells him how sorry he is, the film becomes clearer. We can try to change the past as much as we want, but that is what we are doing the most. <br /> <br /> Another good aspect of Flatliner is how it achieves the atmosphere without expensive, developing visual effects. Quite unusually, what is essentially a horror film, Flatliners has spent its budget in places where it was not needed. Most of what we see during surreal sequences is a case of professional pretense, simple trick photography or stock footage. Sometimes the simplest things are. <br /> <br /> If there are problems with the film, it seems to be too short for about ten minutes. The end result seems to be more convincing than the final one would have asked the director to film the film in the studio so that they could bring it out in a particular market. Of course, many movies have spots for that reason, so Flatliners shouldn't really have anything else. The one hundred and fifteen minute we get is very satisfactory, though not too brilliant. <br /> <br /> I gave Flatlins seven out of ten. It works well with date tearing or late night popcorn film. This leaves a good reminder that the low budget horror exhibitions were not always sad glasses.
