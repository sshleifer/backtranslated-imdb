When people talk about how they "don't", as they used to, they simply point out the horror of this fantasticly entertaining and strange comedy from the writer-director Glenn McQuaid. <br /> <br /> This is a story about graverobberies (played by Dominic Monaghan and Larry Fessenden) who finally dig more than silent, immobile bodies. After this initial shock, they will soon realize that they can actually take advantage of the situation. And that's what they're trying to do. Remember, it seems like things may not have been as well designed as they were when poor young Arthur (Monaghan) is actually involved in his story with the priest (Ron Perlman) before he goes to camping. <br /> <br /> Looking at the details of his filmography, it seems that McQuaid has taken the core of his first short film and expanded it to a feature that is not bad. Fessenden returns and does well, Monaghan is one of those boys who could really like you when he goes to the stealing of the dead and other genres like Perlman and Angus Scrimm. for the genres it is a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> It is also a unique and affordable design and appearance that occasionally moves from EC Comic-style panels to lively action (la Creepshow) and always feels like an authentic Hammer Horror. Maybe everything is just covered with so much dry ice, but it's just next to the point. Whatever happened to film everything on the film, it works. It works well. <br /> <br /> It may not have any real fears, but this movie has a great black humor and will surely sink with this running time everybody who has the patience for a horror that is a bit more calming and seems As it certainly would have been, it could have been done on Hammer Days. <br /> <br /> See if you want: meat and fans, doctor and devils, Creepshow.
