This movie was full of tension and was well targeted, black and white effect made it a big secret. Fay Emerson (Hilda Fenchurch), married to the famous musician Skitch Henderson and son of Elliott Roosevelt (son of FDR), fell in love with Zachary Scott (Ronnie Mason / Marsh). Ronnie wins the hearts of all the ladies in the picture, even Mona Freeman (Anne Fenchurch) and marries when she gets. Rosemary DeCamp (dr Jane Silla) (famous radio and TV actor in the 30's and 40's mostly played a small town of MOM) warned women of Ronnie Mason's ill-minded and abusive childhood that she had grown up, causing her love / hate relationship with women . Fay Emerson and Zachary Scott would have been larger stars whose roles would be more profitable, but their lives were short in real life. This film is not critical, it is a wonderful 1945 film class for many generations to enjoy and enjoy!
