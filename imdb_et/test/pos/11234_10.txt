It is quite obvious that many of your nights were spent alone. If you look at the actual 5-minute show instead of looking at commercial use, you would have seen one of the biggest TV shows in Canadian history. Too bad you would have looked at it alone. Probably the reason you hate it ... is not a game. VIP keys are fun, light and funny. The guys eat it to show. My game is tight and I can't wait to get to this show. Chicks were HOOOOOT and clubs threw a ass. I look every week. This makes me wonder why no such great exhibitions are made. It is now clear that Canadian talent is capable of producing American high-quality television.
