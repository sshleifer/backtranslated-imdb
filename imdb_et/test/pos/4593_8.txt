First, let me say that while I generally appreciate Mike Judge's work, I've been in response to Office Space, Hill of King and Beavis and Butthead. I generally prefer a more intelligent comedy and it lies in the irony of idiocracy. <br /> <br /> In a future world where Beavis's and Butthead's views, key instincts, and spiritual abilities are the framework for a chaotic framework. , a dirty, semi-Mad Maxi Blade Runner Society, where every trailer-trash fantasy becomes a reality, even the average average intelligence man is threatened and accused of gay talking, and the mobile mentality takes over. And this world is also incredibly funny. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's obvious that the leaders of Carl Jr., Starbucks, Costco and Fuddruckers scare the twisted values ​​because their products are in 2505. <br /> <br /> Opportunities and Relationship Between Travelers - The Second was an average intelligent woman who was worried about her boyfriend (pimp) for a punishment - could have been stronger; chemistry is there. And there won't be too many women in the future. <br /> <br /> I left a smile on my face, but the experience is a bit better than memories. So this is my type of popcorn and it's fun to watch the video again. Recommended! FYI will go through the extra scene credit.
