The leader actor Yuko Tanaka performs so much peaceful spirit in such an extraordinarily meditative "Milkwoman" as in the life of a 50-year-old woman. Akira Ogata is an unusual romantic film that is a picturesque, peaceful city in Nagasaki, so it is a less straightforward melodrama than the deliberate appeal of her symbols to her present life due to the tragic past that forced them to choose what they did not demand. <br /> <br /> Tanaka is playing the perfect world-fatigue through the spiritual routine, playing the medieval woman Minako Oba, who, prior to changing her job at the supermarket, assumes the supply of milk bottles among the mountainous Nagasaki inhabitants. One of the houses he is constantly passing through is Kaita Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe), a local government employee who takes care of his sick woman (Akiko Nishina). Minako and Kaita were expensive high school friends who left their time because of an innocent incident with their parents. <br /> <br /> Opening your movie with a young Minako violent narrative that never leaves Nagasaki, Ogata does it as a narrative, suffering patiently from Minako, as she respects Tanako's little but very effective result , follows her - whether she is alone with her aunt (Misako Watanabe) or if she runs up or down countless footprints in her mountain town to distribute milk - as she and Kaita gradually crossed over the obstacles that separated them over the years. Such an unhurried development may not be suitable for viewers who wandered off the fast narratives, but for the rest, it is a cordial introspection that affects forcefully and emphatically.
