Thanks to a very misleading advertising campaign, I saw it in movie theaters from a relatively young age of 10. Televisions depicted the film as comedy, and I finished my parents before they took me. After seeing the film, I blown away. I had no idea what to think about. Completely different from what I saw earlier, leaving a lot of young thoughts. Needless to say, I loved it. This morning, for the first time, I've been watching for 2-3 years, and I think it's one of the biggest films of the last decade. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges are both in the top form, a mysterious man who may or may not be from another planet, and a psychiatrist who develops his mystery in deciphering. Supportive casting is also almost perfect, the inhabitants of every spiritual institution are incredibly convincing in their own way. The open end was dealt with very well, giving a lot of evidence to support what you believe, what happened at the end. The fact that this film did not at least become a candidate for this year's Oscar is not on me. If you haven't seen this movie, drive to Wal-Mart right. DVD is usually a promotional box, take it up! <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
