Get ready for a trip to Haneke's "La Pianist" ... The main psychological illness that Huppert played excellently exceeds any limit you can expect. The most stunning part of this is that you begin to feel compassion for the character Erika. Trash-Sexuality (not nudes scenes), perversion, masochism, incragous relationships ... Haneke gives us raw milk that is difficult to digest; sometimes the only way to get out of the extreme of some scene is to laugh at it. "Mise en sc√®ne" may not be the most attractive part of the film, it has obvious Austro-German, sometimes Scandinavian remarks: static, long scenes but never boring. The Viennese settings, the French language, make the whole look like a European blend. Permanent German music background (Schubert) is beautifully chosen. In particular, both of Cannes's top actors have been awarded: one of the biggest French actors who is one of the biggest achievements of the year.
