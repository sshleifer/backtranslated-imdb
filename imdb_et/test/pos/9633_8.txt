Basically this is a very good movie. However, this is very different from Seagal's other movies, which unfortunately may turn off some fans. Unlike some other movies, it doesn't look like a "Seagal vehicle". You will also see many other signs and not all of Mr Seagal's actions are the same as we have seen before. The notion that he is "intellectual" in something other than bombs and other weapons is a nice change. Although the film has some unrealistic parts (some more obvious than others), you can generally let them slip because the movie is fun to watch. <br /> <br /> You might think of this: if you are looking for a classic Seagal movie, sorry, but you're disappointed. Look at it for fun. If you're open to seeing Seagull without action, it's worth it. I personally believe that this is some of the best work he has done for some time. <br /> <br />
