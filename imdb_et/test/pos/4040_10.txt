This is a great movie and I still love it! It's just so magical and it's fun for the whole family! I recommend it to people of all ages. I promise you won't be disappointed! The characters are always so interesting, as real as you love them! The story of Gerda and Kai in love will amaze you and put that little shine into your life. <br /> <br /> I don't see anyone caring for a movie with a book. the movie was amazing! I haven't even read a book and think what? I don't care. In fact, if the movie and the book are so different, you can call these two separate stories and be happy with it. <br /> <br /> I thought it was bloody brilliant! Bridget Fonda plays snowball, so bad and so cold - you just have to hate him. Chelsea Hobbs plays Gerda, a girl hit by love, who has decided to find her love no matter what she takes and continues her wonderful adventure. And I just love all Snow Queen sisters (spring witch, summer princess and autumn robber) that are so fun and different in many ways. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen this movie for a while, so forgive me for making a little mistake, but there's no doubt I always love this movie.
