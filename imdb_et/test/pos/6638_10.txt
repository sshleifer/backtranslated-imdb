This movie offers one of the greatest experiences available to the film's visitors. It is not a pleasant movie, it offers realities and emotions that the human mind may never anticipate. It opens the way for an individual to think, and after that, man changes forever. <br /> <br /> For the first time I saw this in the movie class and immediately after I saw it, I had to skip my next class and go around to reset my body and mind. I felt devastated and somehow unreal, as if I didn't exist. Just a few months later, I talked to one of my friends about SHAME, and he said, "Oh, was it when you had seen it and got to talk to me about this strange thing?" I didn't even remember that I came across or spoke at all, while outside that day I was surprised. <br /> <br /> Under the plot, it's just a story about a couple that is broke with war. The sufferings are bigger than the dead and finally ... there are no words that could complete the image created by Bergman. It's like a terrible dream that forces you to wake up, changing your reality forever. This movie must be seen.
