Moving into a dark police station at night, living in an alcoholic fog, Detective Mickey Hayden can always say that he has a real sense of reality, but if a blow triggered by a head releases terrible mental visions, it is really weird. Soon he will be killing a killer and pursuing the secret of his beautiful first victim, the hard-to-understand Alice. <br /> <br /> The role of the runaway burning game seems to be tailor-made for Keifer Sutherland and most of it. The plot is a typical serum killer, but it has enough letters, twists, and real surprises to raise it above the usual genre price and even offset the painfully low budget. (One wonders what this film might have been, if there had been money for some rewriting and more.) <br /> <br /> All in all, "After Alice" is a pleasant deviation for everyone, but Lewis Carroll's "Alice" i "for book fans this is a real treat. Outstanding reality, where things are rarely the ones they seem, with more obvious references - a killer called "Jabberwocky", which leaves playing cards on the bodies of its victims - there is every Alice reference every turn. Below is a list of what I discovered. Since finding them is half fun, I have marked them as spoilers. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Casting Characters <br /> <br /> Mickey - In some ways he is Alice himself, who travels through strange landscapes, experiencing odd characters but Harvey admitting its true nature, recognizes him as an unhappy, bumblebee-white knight. <br /> <br /> John Hatter (Mickey Boss) - Is he really "crazy"? You are a judge <br /> <br /> Claudette - African American Transvestite. Obviously Margaret Ellison - Mickey calls her a royal king, but her brutal hopes for a queen of hearts. <br /> <br /> Gideon Wood - A suspected Jabberwocky killer is his ambiguous role for a snark (or perhaps a boojum). <br /> <br /> Harvey - the meaning of his unofficial guide to "wonderland" and his name, another famous cinema rabbit, makes me think he must be a white rabbit <br /> <br /> Dr. Vera Swann - his The surname and the relationship with Mickey refer to the White Queen. <br /> <br /> Other Connections <br /> <br /> Mickey's adventures begin when he controls a white man and drops a (rabbit) hole. <br /> <br /> Mickey tells his cat about the end of his smile (Cheshire Cat) <br /> <br /> The killer appears "through the glass." <br /> <br /> The climatic showdown ends with a game card whirl, as Alice's adventure in the book did. <br /> <br /> The shapes in the garden look like giant chess pieces.
