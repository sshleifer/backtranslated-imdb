Since there have been so many comments on this fine film, I write a form and try to address issues that have not been discussed. <br /> <br /> 1. Dana Andrews was 38 years old when filming this movie. According to his scenario, his character was in the mid-20s. Very underrated actor Andrews played a great character that was supposed to be much younger. <br /> <br /> 2. Like all the big players, Fredric March must adapt to the director to avoid excessive action. She created the camera when she was drinking at night after her arrival and the next morning she checked her in the mirror. <br /> <br /> 3. Dana Andrews was great when she was "Laura", "Ox-Bowl Incident", "Walk in the Sun", "Purple Heart" and many other movies. Why did Fredric March win the Academy Award and why wasn't Dana Andrews even a candidate for her outstanding performance? <br /> <br /> 4. Harold Russell gave the best show I've seen not by the actor. <br /> <br /> 5. I understand that it was in the 1940s, but Dana Andrews had no romantic interest in her exceptionally attractive wife (Virginia Mayo). <br /> <br /> 6. Ray Teal, who played the right-hand bigot, later became famous for his sheriff's "Bonanza" years later. <br /> <br /> 7. The South Professor wrote that the film was slow to move, dull and badly acted. The professor is more than likely to be unaware of the classic films. The beauty and importance of these older classics is that they are slow-moving character research that avoids robbery, excessive violence, and free sex. <br /> <br /> *** I was surprised to find that my rating was worth three out of three people.
