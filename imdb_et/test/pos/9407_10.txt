I thought this movie was great. Jon Foster is one of my favorite actors, he was perfect as Micheal Skakel. I found everything to be great, exemplary, costumes, production, management, photography, script and music, and so on. <br /> <br /> Spoilers come! Martha Moxley, who they were talking about in the film, was deadly dead by her violent neighbor Micheal Skackel. Micheal did it because of his brother Tommy's jealousy when Martha rejected her and took Tommy instead. Fortunately, they captured him for years and were sentenced to 20 years in prison. Although I think he should have understood "natural life" without a password. <br /> <br /> Cast on, for team and filmmakers. Two thumbs up.
