I saw five fingers in Drive-In ... what, 1973, '74? It was the first Kung-Fu movie I ever saw and I was very entertaining. I recently bought it on a DVD and looked at it again. I was also very entertained for the second time. I believe this is probably one of the Kung-Fu films that will be modeled after that. Rival schools, different styles, revenge, "white hat" good guys and "black hat" bad guys. They even threw Japanese (very bad guys) Karate and Judo styles. I remember that the fun of the copy dialog was "Hey You! You are a very bad guy!" and "They should not get away from it! I have this bad crowd!" This time it was not so disturbing, I think I am used to it. If you have even the slightest appreciation for this genre, it should look.
