This movie is a great comedy drama. Christopher Walken is a huge manager and his comment keeps you laughing. Robin Williams plays a big role in "Jon Stewart" fast and will entertain you when you are a fan of Comedy Central. The exhibition is good because, if the viewer has a half-brain, they see it as a much needed subcultural attack on the policies of the current Republican government and criticism of the American democratic process ... mention the means by which most politicians are elected. <br /> <br /> I was amused by amusement parks and found that the movie is very fast paced and entertaining, with no ordinary "oh-brother" agreeing that the film is less comedy than marketed, but no doubt it's better than 90% in theaters. Just my thoughts ... Don
