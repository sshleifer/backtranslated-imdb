This movie was really interesting ... it is also quite shocking because the film's similar events took place only 10 months after the movie was first released. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see problems that may arise and be realistic to show that no matter how ready you are, you are not. if it had been made for an American audience - it would be different because they would have used it as a complete propaganda film and not as an alarm that the BBC did! it is still propaganda, in some ways - today it is not possible to have a movie about these topics - but it dealt successfully with the problem. <br /> <br /> A movie that should be shown in all terrorism / counter-terrorism courses, but it's not because it shows mistakes that aren't allowed to be admitted! The big movie, in which the BBC took some risks and unfortunately London, no longer needs a fictional story because of the reality of 7 July 2005.
