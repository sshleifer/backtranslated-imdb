I've loved this movie because I saw them for the first time several years ago. I'm not sure how many times I've seen it, maybe 10, or 20. This last time I looked at the detail I haven't noticed before. <br /> <br /> When the picture ends, the killed heroes will be returned to the city. There are a couple of dead men. What hit me the most was a blonde youngster. Everything you see on the screen is his profile from the head. His hands hold a flashing candle. The wind blows and his thick blondes dance in the wind, together with the candle flame. The contrast between death and lost life is incredibly powerful. Moving hair and a candle flame remind us of the vitality that once lived on your body. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch this movie, I see something new.
