If you are a long-time fan of the doctor and you hear when you heard that they were doing another series, then rest easy - that's more than meeting the great expectations of the originals. Stimulation is much faster than the original exhibitions, which are more suitable for 50-minute episodes, rather than an average of 90 minutes. Writing is great, the actor is great. The most difficult - and best - is the value of a new series of production. Compared to the original, it is now some. (Although I always have memorable memories of bubble wrapping and doll monsters.) If you're not a fan, or if you tried the original and couldn't handle it, jump on both feet now! Everything you really know about a doctor will tell you when they go. This series is written with minimal reference to the huge backbone of the doctor to encourage new viewers. Of course I can see the first new series now when it is shown on a Sci-Fi channel (in other words, probably cut into time constraints into strips), but I'm looking forward to future episodes on either broadcasting TV or DVD. (July 4th is not fast enough!)
