When I first rented Batman's returns, I immediately thought it was less than exceptional. I mean, Jack Nicholson was undoubtedly the best part of the first part, so without him, how would a good movie be? Easy, throw Danny DeVitos. <br /> <br /> Batman's return is arguably a darker film than Batman. Here are more villains, less real dark comedies and more nervous issues. But music is similar to the first, if not darker. The landscape is certainly more depressing than the first, every detail up to the year. This movie follows the same comic type we loved in the first Batman. <br /> <br /> Now performances. Fortunately, Michael Keaton returns to Batman / Bruce Wayne. He was great in the first film and the same in this step. There wasn't enough time in the world for Keaton as Batman, more! Danny DeVito gave the award-winning performance Penguin, the most exhausting, disgusting, lovable, angry, evil, sad, pathetic villain who once gave the mercy of a superb movie. You hate him so much, but you feel so bad at the same time. And it explains it to the last detail, making it even more controversial. Michelle Pfeiffer was great as Catwoman / Selina Kyle. Two completely different personalities in one. In fact, he got a good backdrop. Christopher Walken is not disappointed with Max Shreck, a greedy, decisive and self-sufficient CEO of energy. Luckily, Michael Gough returns as a lovable Alfred and he was just as good. Pat Hingle also returns to Gordon, although I feel he was never really in the spotlight. <br /> <br /> Batman's return has a lot of great twists and tiles that are definitely fans of the original. <Br /> <br /> 9/10
