Having seen the original when I was 13 years old (and yes, I was stupid enough to watch it during my childhood), I was delighted to see this remake. <br /> <br /> Camilla Bell did a great job like Jill Johnson. And the fact that in 2006 a huge vulgarity and gore-earning teenage horror could be made made the film even stronger. It was a great time for me to try not to chew my nail! <br /> <br /> This movie won't win an Oscar, but it's fun and worth the matin√©e ticket that I bought to see. I think girls around the world should look at the original and remake ... and then decide that they will never be able to do childcare. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that I'm glad I was too old to have a baby! There's just something to be in the dark creepy house sleeping kids that makes this movie classic. No blood, no gore ... just good psychological fun! Winner!
