Although "a woman's story", I found it quite interesting. It is unusual that there are three real sisters who play sister in the movie! I refer to Priscilla, Rosemary and Lola Lane. <br /> <br /> Why national critics have loved this movie, a bad boy-rebel John Garfield. In its twisted liberal dominant dominance, all-American characters are bad, but the sour-living, bad-minded types, like Garfield, played here, are the people they can identify with. Nevertheless, this film has a general sense of well-being, which is why I liked it. Some characters may be stupid things, but they are good hearts. Whose heart was bigger than "Ann's" (Priscilla Lane)? I agree with the IMDb user comment critic here who says it's a Priscilla movie as much as a beloved (not mine) Garfield. <br /> <br /> With Michael Curtiz's caliber, the film is better than anyone else. Curtiz didn't guarantee that no scenes, soap or anything else went too long. <br /> <br /> In addition to Lane's sisters and Garfield, we have Claude Rains (who adds a great sense of humor), Jeffrey Lynn (girls' main love interests), Gale's page, Dick Foran, Frank McHugh and Mae Robson. <br /> <br /> Probably this movie has to be hit because there were several spin-offs. they are approaching the success of this content and box-office.
