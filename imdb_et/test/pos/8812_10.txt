I love this movie. All about that. I almost seemed to watch me and my friends on the screen. The way the film was filmed was a pure masterpiece, very original and creative. I was involved with these characters and I even had the same thoughts as some. I am really glad that I ran this movie. If only there would be more genius than justin!
