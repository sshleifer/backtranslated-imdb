You've just seen this movie on a satellite in Australia. Since I've avoided more than the usual news coming from the US about A-arms for the last week, it's completely dark, this film is a real pearl. Great for everyone. I had only a little understanding of what the film was like, as is most often the case with good results, and that was definitely cinematographic. Scene setup is effective in the most serious sense of the word, with all the furry objects in today's world associated with their own embarrassing family, though in the suburbs. The first forty minutes set a professional theater that I wasn't ready to laugh out loud when they came. Although the cathartic moment of comedy and character as a family and neighbors came together exceptionally. <br /> <br /> All in all, you can see who we are and what we are. The most meaningful film and it must be seen. <br /> <br /> Please indicate the date of this review.
