This film is breathtaking and desperate. But I think it can only be appreciated by the harsh RPGs. It's like a game. One problem is that the plot is too game-like and has just too many turns. The twists are excessive. Jude Law has a very good result. I like this movie like Jerome Gattacas and Gigglo Joe A.I.
