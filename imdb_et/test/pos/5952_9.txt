OSS 117 was fun from start to finish. <br /> <br /> It's hard to determine why one film touches or unites you, and I'm not trying to analyze such perfect comedy, so politically wrong, that even academic papers should be dedicated to it :)! <br /> <br /> Everything here is old-fashioned, women's clothing (ohk!), Mambo's dance, "hero's song" ... ("Bambino" sounds like Italian) canzonetta sang ... arabic :)!). <br /> <br /> Hubert is physically fit but stupid like hell. From all 007 he looks like Sean Connery, but he's definitely more of a heart because he's ... stupid, his mind all the time, laughs, even some homoerotic fantasies and he's rumored. In short, like a hero, he tends to :)! Sometimes it only rises on the eyebrows or frowns, and it all needs to laugh at you. <br /> <br /> Bérénice Bejo is the real queen of the movie. Graceful, deceptive, but with ideals. On the contrary, Aure Attica is limited to femme fatale. It's surprising that you see him as a "sexy bomb", you. You just can't compare it to "Austin Powers"! I agree with Amazon at D. Hartley (Seattle, WA) for respecting the genre. <br /> <br /> What is your favorite scene? One of my favorite scenes is a "chicken fight" masked villain. But it's really perfect when you talk to a cocktail with your contacts, how they all trust trust ... That alone makes the comedy genre worthwhile.
