Kevin Kline offers a brilliant comic book in the 1997 comedy IN & OUT. Kline plays Howard Bracket, a small town history teacher, eager to sit down to see Academy awards this year, as one of his former students (Matt Dillon) is a candidate. She has applied for her performance in a movie where she plays a gay soldier and when she wins, she thanks Howard in her speech for inspiring her because Howard is gay. Now this is Howard on this floor because he has no idea why he says this on international television. Howard is even married (Joan Cusack, Oscar nominated) so he has no idea where Dillon's Cameron Drake got the idea that he is gay and finds he needs to defend himself in every school, but has been shocked that no one seemed terrible shocked by what Cameron said about the Oscar. Howard has a birthday party, where she is given a birthday party, such as a YENTL soundtrack and explains to her guests why Barbra Streisand was supposed to do FUNNY LADY. His parents (Wilford Brimley, Debbie Reynolds) are shocked, but promise to support their son, even if he is gay. He also gets a visit outside the city reporter (Tom Selleck) who wants to make him an article because he is gay. The moment when Selleck grows in a big kiss directly on Kline's lips, it's classic. But in all these little things, Howard actually questioned his sexuality and wondered if he was really gay ... much of his confusion, Cusack, who was confused. The classic is a scene where she leaves her wedding dress bar and stands on the street screaming for the lack of single men in the world. But what I like about this movie is how Kline invests fully in the role and is not afraid to look stupid or look at the gay. There is a fabulous scene, probably the most famous movie where he buys a record, how to be a macho, and a record man talks about how real men do not dance and disco tune (I NOTE when the memory serves) and the narrator on the disc says no matter what you do , don't dance, but Howard won't be able to help himself and he will be dragging his groove. It's hysterically funny and Kline plays it sincerely and happily. The film is not a pro or a gay gay ... it's just a dirty and amusing study of a man trying to find out exactly who he is. Wonderful movie.
