Imagine the most depressing winter you never experience: gray, not white, snow and certainly not wonder. This is Finland, which is represented by "frozen land". This film follows a number of people whose lives are strangely connected to each other with results that exceed someone's nightmare. Yes, most of the symbols are faulty so that only the celluloid marks can - a completely annoying and frustrating look, but for some reason you want to turn your luck. <br /> <br /> Some of the randomly placed humor and whales, which bring Finland to a somewhat mainstream position, provide a glimpse of the Finnish way of thinking, which, despite its falling spirals, succeeds in restoring faith in humanity. Even less than Kaurism√§ki.
