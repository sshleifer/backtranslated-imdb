When I saw Lon Chaney, Jr. and Boris Karloff, I was expecting to find a typical 1950s stylish horror film. The opened scene (a grave plan with a wolf in the background of a wolf) seemed to confirm it. When I started to look at it, what I discovered was a little bit of a secret about the English (Richard Green) who was trying to find out what had happened to two of his friends who had disappeared in the Black Forks and, if necessary, revenge against the evil Count (Stephen McNally) who ruled the territory. Chaney, like the silent Gargon, had a rather limited role (one that actually reminded me of Notre Dame in reverse), while Karloff had a somewhat greater role as Dr Meissen. In fact, Meissen was one of the most interesting characters in the movie, and until that end it was hard to know if he was a good man or a bad guy! The castle was great, and even the limited image of Black Fort was real enough. It certainly didn't come with such a small budget compared to other movies I've seen. I thought the only disappointment was Rita Corday's performance as a Countess Wall. He seemed somewhat dry and seemed not to have much passion for this role. <br /> <br /> I find this film all the attention, and there was enough tension about how it all happened to be worth seeing. Definitely recommended with 7/10 rating.
