Lone Ranger & Tonto brought to the court a band of hooded riders who had killed three Indians for what seems to be an obvious reason at first sight. This is so long as Lone Ranger discovers a conversation with Indian head Tomache, so that every man possessed a medallion. The five medallions that Tomache gave to his friends, which we learn later, give the captain behind the master rider with a map of the legendary lost city. Can the Lone Ranger protect the other two who hold the medallions before the hooded riders get it? Is there a golden city somewhere in the local land? When I looked at it, I had to know what would happen before, and everything seemed really familiar until I finally realized that I had seen the exact same movie when I was just a little boy. and I remember having a pretty fun time when the child enjoys it with my friends. However, as an adult, the plot is somewhat predictable, but you know that although it is not in the same league as the 1956 film, it's a lot of fun to watch. Clayton Moore is perfect as Lone Ranger and Jay Silverwheels, because Tonto steals a lot of this movie because he's probably more in action scenes than even Lone Ranger. Here are some very familiar faces, including Douglas Kennedy, such as Ross Brady, the leader of Hooded Raiders, Charles Watts as the glorified Sheriff and Ralph Moody kindly Padre.
