This flawless writing and brilliant show that this unusually pleasant and witty plot-twister is one of the best American films I've seen this year. Neil Labute's amazing pain and cynical direction keeps this film too sentimental, while Renée Zellweger and Morgan Freeman's authentic performances give him the soul. A violent, provocative and humorous, truly wonderful ending. Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear Aaron Eckhart, Crispin Glover, and Allison Janney give all hostile languages ​​in the cheek. The biggest soap opera fraud from Soap, but better and smarter. 9 out of 10
