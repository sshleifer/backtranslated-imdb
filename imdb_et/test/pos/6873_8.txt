Walter Matthau is best remembered for a series of long comedies he made with Jack Lemmon, an equal comedy partner from THE FORTUNE COOKIE to ODD COUPLE II. But people tend to forget that at the end of the 1970s, he and his other partner appeared in two movie-female partners. It was English double Oscar winner Glenda Jackson who showed his comic abilities to Matthau for the first time at HOUSE CALLS and then at HOPSCOTCH. Matthau's role was somewhat higher in both films because his characters were at the center of the plots, but the chemistry between them was pretty good. If you want to see two pros that show how sexual intercourse can be funny funny, see Walter and Glenda as Dr. Charley Nicholson and Ann Atkinson to see if two people can have two beds under the two-party old film code rule each has one foot on the floor! From this clinical and mechanical point of view, sex has never been seen. <br /> <br /> Matthau Charlie has just been widowed before the movie started. She has only one woman in her life - a woman. She is now eligible for a Bachelor's degree. He is also the leading surgeon in the hospital, who works out, but Dr. Amos Weatherby (Art Carney) is the head physician. Carney is probably senile (there are moments in the movie that show that she turns her antiquity on and off - look at the scene where the rams of Richard Benjamin are). Amos is ready for re-election (Charlie is his closest competitor - if he so desires). But Amos succeeds in persuading Charlie to allow him to keep his job for self-esteem. <br /> <br /> One day Charlie marks Ann in the hospital. She has had a mild accident and she is resting in bed, but Amos has put her in a cage-like device (not used by Charlie since around 1920). She pulls her out of the device and will soon romanticize her. He joins the hospital staff, but he criticizes Charlie's willingness to meet Amos, and he criticizes certain selfish tendencies he sees among the doctors in the hospital. <br /> <br /> Amose's hit causes the death of a hospital patrol (Lloyd Gough) who belonged to a baseball team (his biggest innovation was a separate entry cost for a double headline). Amos is trying to relieve the team owner's widow, giving praise to the burial service (the line above is the eulogy of the oral line). But he still decided to sue (his lawyer Thayer David says the hospital is the most incompetent he ever saw). So Amos suggests that Charlie romanticizes the widow to satisfy her in this expensive case. But how does Ann react? The film is quite amusing and so successful that after Jackson and Matthau's success, it was also a television series.
