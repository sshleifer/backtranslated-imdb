I love everything Savage Steve Holland, the writer / director of this great movie, did. See also "Right out of dead" and "How did I get to college." Wonderful! Anyway, this movie is really humorous and gives some unexpected things. Where else, but in this movie do you see Demi Moore as a talented singer and Bobcat Golthwait as a twin? I recommend it to someone who is looking for some old comedy (George with a turtle raft), not to mention some really well written sarcasm (car roof Christmas tree). This movie throws you unexpectedly after you have seen it 100 times! Enjoy!
