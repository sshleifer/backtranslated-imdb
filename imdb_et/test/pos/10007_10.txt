This movie is amazing because the fact that real people represent themselves and their real life experience and do a good job is like they almost live back to the past. Jia Hongsheng plays as an actor who gives up everything except music and drugs that fight depression and seek the meaning of life, while being angry with everyone, especially those who care the most. There are moments in the film that make you cry because the family, especially the father, did such a good job. However, this movie is not for everyone. Many people suffering from depression understand the problem of Hongsheng and why it does the things it does, for example, to keep yourself in a closed dark room or to walk on foot or by bicycle. Others may see the movie boring because it's just so real that it's almost a documentary. In general, this film is very good and Hongsheng earned an Oscar for this film, so did his father.
