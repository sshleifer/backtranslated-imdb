When I read the "Messiah" summary in the television guide, I was not ready for what was in store. The story is followed by DCI Metcalfe, who is trying to solve the harsh murders in London. Soon he understands the pattern, there is a row of killers, kills people with similar names and jobs with 12 apostles, and their killings are the same as their apostles. The two-part series kept me right next to my place, where Metcalfe tracked this murderer, but he always disappeared for a few seconds and discovered that he had left aside his malicious victim. "The Messiah" certainly causes a lot of controversy, but it is still the biggest drama that the BBC has been showing for a long time.
