The "Sharky Machine" is clearly the vehicle of Burt Reynolds, which is designed to allow the asterisk to push its talent and paint the machine, with film colors from other films and other styles, offering a variety of foods and foods. . <br /> <br /> Made in 1981 for 119 minutes (for a long time), the film worked well so that the gross amount of the box office was $ 37,800,000. There was a lot to do: Burt Reynolds actor and director, one double punch; William Diel's New Adaptation and Atlanta Georgia's Southern Land, Currently Hollywood Film Production Land. <br /> <br /> Reynolds Tom Sharky falls in love with Rachel Wardi's Dominoe whore - with the Golden Heart here at Hustle when she played with Catherine Deneuve, and this movie was also a corrupt politician, but a shrink that didn't stop Hollywood's happiness "Sharky's Machine". <br /> <br /> The story is a pure detective procedure / actor. Drug Detective Sharky manages the drug dealer's burial, killing some innocent bystanders and falling down, literally handed over to vice, pervers, and other misdemeanors that are considered by the "supreme" police officers. His new excavations offer him the opportunity to meet many equal prominent officers who do dirty jobs that no one else wants. When certain attention is paid to a particular pimp, Sharky looks at some evidence and finds that one particular prostitute, Dominoe (Rachel Ward) - Dominoe, is hidden by police forces and political forces, and Sharky sets himself under 24-hour surveillance to follow him. At the time he watches, he learns that the current ruling constituency, Hotchkins (Earl Holliman), visits Dominoe, as well as the slick Italian gangster Victor (Vittorio Gassman). Before the police can prove the evidence, Victor Victor's brother, Henry Silva, takes the door of the Dominoe apartment, which apparently kills the beautiful Dominoe, but when Sharky discovers that the murdered victim was actually a roommate Tiffany (Aarika Wells) Sharky meets Victory and tells him he's going to arrest him. Sharky is captured by a Ninja killer led by Smiley (Darryl Hickman) and tortured to get Domino, but Sharky invades them and arrests the governor and the hot chase kills Billin after Victor killing. <br /> <br /> Reynolds wants to show the inner workings of loved police officers, but the police story with a noir element and the ability to develop Reynolds film art tend to slip into the dynamics of relationships. <br /> <br /> We are going to learn something about some men and this leads us to the reason they work towards their pensions, on the contrary, instead of fighting real crime, Reynolds's film seems to be a unique feature of Reynolds off. She likes to hire stars, either character actors or others, and then allow them to improvise, sometimes with different results. <br /> <br /> With his team at Sharky, he gets some fine moments and sometimes a little overflow. but always a sense of ensemble and benevolence. It is the author of Reynolds. <br /> <br /> Reynolds, actor / author always seems to be smiling at himself and the viewer as if to say that it is all fake, but good fun. <br /> <br /> Big Line: With Victor when Sharky throws up, "You've walked everywhere you are, and you want to know the worst part? You're out of the country." This seems to be the biggest offense the officer may have in criminal proceedings. <br /> <br /> Reynolds made a Atlanta movie at his career and lets himself read in the phone book and would definitely target and demographically. / / <br /> The film noted the appearance of Rachel Ward, who was named the Golden Star of the New Star in 1981. <br /> <br /> Reynolds has always had a presence and starry power and has chosen Georgia to make movies close to his home page. <br /> <br /> I got $ 7.99 from pool.com on DVD and unfortunately it doesn't contain any comments or features that are ashamed. Maybe it's the next generation. <br /> <br /> The movie is still fun and both Reynolds and Ward are great-looking actors.
