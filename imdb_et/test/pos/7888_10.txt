Recently seen, Cry Uncle, the same director, I decided to look for it and am I glad that I did!? This is an exceptionally good movie. Far, far better than likely, considering the ingredients. How many times have we had to suffer from someone playing a middle-class father, mixing it with aagh! And here, thanks to the perfect script, it is believable. Not ideal, not good or bad, but plausible. Peter Boyle, like a working class, hippie and ni ** er, and Dennis Patrick, as a game class, play their respective parts immune and I never remember seeing these two classes without getting sentimental. Susan Sarandon is effective as a hippie chick, but she doesn't have much to do in her first movie. It is, indeed, a must see that the film is captured, as is the very short time of the West, and especially of the US, when the counter culture was almost open.
