And it says a lot. Rent it if you want one of the strangest scripts, directions and pains in the history of the movie. I'm alternating. I can't believe I watched it. I'm a big fan of Bernadette Peters, usually - but it tried my judgment. Don't read more comments here, it's best if you don't know anything about the plot. Just rent it. You don't believe what you see .......
