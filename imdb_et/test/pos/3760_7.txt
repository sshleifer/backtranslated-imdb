Mark Blankfield (on the "late Friday" TV show) dr. Daniel Jekyll, a light surgeon who looks like a powder that makes him a crazy party to drugs. It was not, of course, his intention, he had higher aspirations, but he went with the flow. It's actually a pretty stupid movie, but it's also pretty fun. Of course, as a good doctor understands what he has done, he is ashamed, but he does not do it again and runs through Hollywood as a machine for mad sex scattered with hair and gold chains. There are some sub-sites, such as Jekyll's groom, who is the daughter of Jekyll's employer rehearsal for our victim and pain. And Tim Thomerson is a plastic surgeon with seemingly few "real" parts and male tastes, and an abundant old man whose situation is Howard Hughes parody and who makes several people rich with a healthy organ transplant, including testicles. Yes, humor is dirty and stupid, and the whole thing is pretty tasteless, but if you don't have a gutter with a quick wedge, you probably like it easily. Now available on DVD for the first time! Woohoo! 7 out of 10
