I saw One Life Stand when he premiered at the 2000 International Film Festival in Edinburgh and it was blown about it. The micro-budget, black-and-white digital film is a very European film and it is a great success despite the limitations of the DV. The film works because it is an indie tradition - it deals with complex issues, but moves and relieves underestimated humor. One Life Stand avoids the trap of other realistic movies in the UK, with ordinary workers being depicted as hopeless victims or comedy stereotypes. Performances are strong, especially Maureen Carr as mother, Trise. I understand that the movie has recently been published on DVD and I would definitely recommend it. The rating on this site is misleading, so I gave him a high score because the filmmaker, May Miles Thomas, obviously put his heart and soul in and deserves better than 2.8 for his amazing achievement.
