I remember watching this movie when I was pretty young and disturbed. I found the story very appealing and still remember different methods of bullying. This was especially the case when another schoolgirl created her soup before she even spooned. They also tied her and shook her party. It was all because he was unpopular. Why was he unpopular? Because he was bad in the games. However, I have the feeling that even if he was good at playing, he would be tempted because it is difficult to decide what makes someone popular. For me, he is the type of person that is always chosen because it is the way the children act. Popular children are popular because they are "cool" in some way. It is difficult to define popularity. So, even at the end, when he is successful in his career, there is no difference and he is still embarrassed. I found that the end was quite disturbing because there was no resolution.
