I just saw this movie at Birewham, AL's Sidewalk Film Festival, which was actually a really fun festival and what it blew. It was the best movie I saw all day long with long shots. A school-aged prostitute meets a middle-aged man and tries to end deep depression there. This is an internal look into the darker parts of human sexuality. The story comes from real events that are hung directly from titles. The end result is a raw, blunt dialogue and killer. The film contains graphical sexual dialogue and nudity. Definitely not suitable for children. Too depressing to the taste of some people. It is definitely worth checking out my opinion.
