Note: This should probably only be read after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> It's very rare to find a documentary or film that focuses on the loser. Deepwater does just that, it's one of the longest imaginable films. It does not give us heroes to look, but rather an anti-hero who forces us to explore. <br /> <br /> This is a group of men trying to drive around the world, one by one and without stopping. Only one does it, many die, we decide not to return home, each of them on a psychological journey that is intriguing enough to make whole films for themselves. But the most interesting is Donald Crowhurst, or rather the way the filmmakers portray it and our reactions to it as viewers. <br /> <br /> According to any standard, this man should be considered a despicable character, but why is he imagined so heroically? Why do we feel so sympathetic? From the beginning, he made all the wrong choices. He risked his family financially to get a boat, left him at a more dangerous time to get more advertising, he ignored all the warnings despite his lack of experience, he decided to lie, the snowball of that choice to the inevitable and the last: suicide. All about that? Place History? Feeling of perfection? Maybe. It is important to consider whether this man's situation was inevitable. <br /> <br /> Every person has to ask himself whether his natural glory for human glory and achievements would bring him to such recklessness and I believe that studying your own reaction to Crowhurst's story will give this question at least some answers.
