Michael Haneke is known for his disturbing movies, such as "Funny Games". This time he accepted Elfriede Jelin's "Die Klavierspielerin", which is probably his best work. Jelinek always writes about the abuse of families and, in particular, the repression of women in patriarchal society. <br /> <br /> Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) works as a piano teacher at the Vienna Conservatory. She still lives with her mother (Annie Giradot), they even sleep in the same bed (something strange). Erika harasses her students the same way she is tempted by her mother to tempt and watch secretly porn movies and play sadomasokistic games with herself. Student, Walter (Benoit Magimel), falls in love with her, but she just refuses to sleep with her. He wants to play with him, but he's nasty. He reluctantly follows his rules, which means that both of them have a disaster. <br /> <br /> Haneke has a very clear language for the picture, all filmed almost spartanly, so that sophisticated characters and story improve. /> <br /> People who don't know Austria very well may not understand how important this story is. Jelinek (as well as other great Austrian writers like Thomas Bernhard) suffer from the cold and coincidence of Austrian families and society. The Austrians (at least the Viennese people) often fail in their pain, their desire to formulate, they suppress emotions, so their families do not have enough true love, affection and closeness. In a society where it is most important for society to show the perfect facade (even if it means protecting families from crimes, when Erika and her mother protect Walters Erika's rape to avoid a scandal), it's probably not sure that Sigmund Freud founded psychoanalysis in Vienna. Erika has a relatively cold and distant relationship with her mother, they only share some emotions very violent and not at all loving. Erika replaces her hidden emotions with the wishes of violence so that she can finally release some feelings. But he has no one who really wants to talk about his emotions, so eventually he has to himself to relieve his pain. <br /> <br /> Isabelle Huppert shows the best results in her career. actors). With a striking face, you often see only emotions on your face, a quick smile, a glance at his eyes. And finally, his pain is masterfully displayed without one tear. <br /> <br /> Benoit Magimel and Annie Giradot also come in a powerful performance, but the film belongs to Huppert.
