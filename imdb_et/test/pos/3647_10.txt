In Tweety's S.O.S, Sylvester goes out of selecting trash bins to be a rider who is on a cruise ship carrying a certain Canary bird and Granny, his owner. Uh-Oh! What's more, Tweety and Granny offer a lot of obstacles to getting a bird in the cat. Sylvester also gets sick of the sea quite a few times. And the second time that red-nosed cats go to a ship that has something to cure his health, Tweety replaces it with nitroglycerin. Now you can blow Sylvester! I stop here and say it's another great cartoon, directed by Friz Freling, who is a popular cat and bird duo. Tweety's S.O.S is most recommended.
