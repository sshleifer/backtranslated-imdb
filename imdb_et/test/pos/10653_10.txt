The film touches the audience's soul very much, some movie scenes are final and tears come out automatically, I am surprised to see this film that every director can direct this type of film in 1925. cinema I can say that this film helps to understand the use of assembly much better. For the first time, when our teacher told us about this movie, this film genre means what we thought could not be understood in this movie, but finally, when sir explained, we finally came to know how big this movie is. say it helps a lot to understand movies. And being a cinema student, I can see viewers seeing this movie.
