The somewhat protracted episode of the previous week cost an episode that hit the height in insecure conditions. There was a certain deus ex machina taste in the clinic's resolution, but it was a good start for it. As is common with the physician, the moral, ethical and emotional considerations of his activities were central. They were always in the classic series, but they were a side issue that they would have gone over when the doctor was in the heat of the battle. This regeneration even tells a cyberman during the battle. Finally, this episode shows Mickey's heroic side, which was implied in earlier episodes. His journey from zero to hero has ended and it has been completely convincing. With this fear, humor, and scenes that brought your throat to a lump, this episode was all. After much consideration, I can finally say that the new series is a classic series in every respect. Coming to the dead hard Whovian, there's no better recommendation.
