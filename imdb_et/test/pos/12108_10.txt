Crossing the Bridge: The sound of Istanbul got one of the most famous applause from the audience when it ended and deserves great. I didn't expect too much from a musical documentary, but it was a lot more. It was also a visual documentary from Istanbul, with great contrasts between old and new, western and eastern, poor and rich, modern and traditional. Black and white photographs of old Istanbul from the world-famous Armenian photographer Ara Guler were extraordinary. But of course the main theme was music and God, what it is! It was similar to the Bueno Vistas Social Club; interviewer-Alexander Hacke's love and respect here, replacing Ray Cooder, because the musicians exuded the screen and hit us all. The music was mostly very interesting. The Romance Gypsy group's jazz session in a small town in western Turkey was a bliss. I'm not surprised when travel agencies start making reservations for Kesan after the movie is released. But I liked the Muzeyyen Senar, who saw an astonishingly elegant way of burlesque, and when he proclaimed his "Raki", "My voice and I'm 86 years old!" Well done Faith Akin. I bet there are many more Turkish musicians who are feeling excluded: Go to Volume II.
