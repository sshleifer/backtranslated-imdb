I've seen Jimmy Stewart in all his usual tasks, but "St. Louis's spirit" was one of his favorites. If the film is released poorly, this film is mostly forgotten by now. Stewart seems to have known the story of Lindberg's famous flight in 1927, and it seems to have been badly cast first, and his famous voice will never let you forget who you are looking at; it looks like George Baily again. But Stewart had obviously worked on this role and he did everything right, so before long you no longer care that Stewart was 20 years older than the man he represented. Stewart Lindberg is both gosh-darn, all-american, apple-pie that comes to you, and you realize that Stewart is going to portray Lindberg with all the aw-shucks, the Yankee know-how he could collect up. Lindberg was almost a mythical hero in the US and Stewart seems to be determined to continue. <br /> <br /> Flash feedback is cleverly used to keep a really dull story, and I was hit by the subtle references to Faith, scattered through the movie; Lindberg tries to teach the desperate priest how to fly, only when the priest is confronted with his beliefs, or Lindberg, who refuses to carry St. The Christopher Medal to save the weight by weight only to find his hidden medal in his sundown after he crossed the Atlantic. For me, this film is not unknown to the man's epic journey, but his perception that this life is much greater than the things we see and feel.
