Lang makes Hawks as well as Hawks in the first part of this extraordinary western part before deciding on the deterministic, dark and guilty Langi for the final. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that show its greatness almost immediately, but at the same time very fine. Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott) is on the horse and continues, we do not know why - he stumbles on the wounded Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger) and decides to take his weapon and horse, but discovers that Creighton is bad. confirm it first. It is transmitted mainly through facial expressions and a very short, truncated dialogue - after 2 minutes we know that Shaw is a legitimate, but basically good boy. Shaw reaches Creighton by civilization, then disappears. <br /> <br /> Cut a few weeks or later, with Creighton and responsible for the expedition to put the telegraph wire west of Omaha. He hires Shawi as a scout who is trying to leave when he discovers that Creighton is responsible; but Creighton still wants to pay her back and something good. It has also been hired gently, the project's benefactor's son, but atypically, the eastern Richard Blake (Robert Young) is quite competent, as he immediately shows in an amusing but exciting bronze break system. Both employ the Creighton sister, Sue (Virginia Gilmore), who - again, usually - seems to be as caring as she is. In the first third of the film, the friendships between the three men, the comedian elements of unwanted cooks and various untreated and drum images, and the well-played light romantic elements dominate and reminded me more of Howard Hawks "Red River" or "Only" Angels are wings than most Langs - but they are so well played and action evolves so naturally that it doesn't matter, and does not change our joy - if it may change our expectations - like the most common Langian themes in the later part of the movie dominated by haunting past, dark secrets and enormous, destructive and evil ways Shawi's old palms came back to bother him, because the wagon train and its wires are moving westward; attacks on the crew and Shaw must wrestle with what he should say to Creighton about his tortured relationship with Jack Slade (Barton MacLane) <br /> <br /> Early Technicolor and moves quite smoothly to the sound that from apps to western places, it's just Lang's best Western and one of his best films for my money, which transmits as forcefully as any of his films the tragic failure of men to escape from their past and build a new future. Scott is as good as I saw him, showing me more about how many actors can make a dialogue in the paragraph and the rest is equally good. Shawi's previous criminal life and the unavoidable interruption of his potential future are extraordinary and surprise even for long-term Lang, like myself; and even in 1941 it seems that the margins of civilization had no more meaning than the hairdresser and the dusty street outside. You can get shaving, you can feel like a new man, but you can never really be as long as the old ties keep you back. <br /> <br /> Genius.
