Gene Kelly's home studio MGM won her creative talent and gave her some control over her film making. Cover Girl also became Rita Hayworth's signature film about GIs and their pinup fantasies during World War II. <br /> <br /> Kelly plays the owner of a small nightclub in Brooklyn, where Rita is a comic and Phil Silvers. Of course, Kelly does a little bit there. <br /> <br /> Hayworth comes to the attention of millionaire Otto Kruger when it turns out that Kruger had loved and lost Hayworth's grandmother. In some queues of the gas light era, Hayworth also plays with his grandmother Jess Barker, who plays the young Kruger. You may remember that Jess Barker was the wife of this second legendary redhead, Susan Hayward. <br /> <br /> Broadway producer Lee Bowman has also attracted Hayward, but he is not interested in nostalgia. She wants her to recycle her Ziegfeld's follicles and actually the biggest number of Cover Girl's movie titles. It's nicely done in the Follies style. <br /> <br /> Hayworth can also sing a particular thing in the gas light era, and the only song Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin have written is Hayworth's old English music hall number Poor John. When I say singing, as everyone knows Rita's mouthpieces. The song here is done by Nan Wynn. <br /> <br /> The biggest hit of the show is long and far off, introduced by Gene Kelly. It was one of the greatest hits of World War II, and one of the biggest sellers was Jerome Kern. In fact it happens that this is my aunt's favorite, who celebrates 60 years of marriage with my uncle in September. Long Ago and Far Away were named the best songs, but lost to Swinging on a star. Test and Alter Ego Number. Harry Cohn decided to do what Louis B. Mayer had refused in MGM to give Kelly his creative control over his material. Later, Kelly said that the alter ego number was one of the hardest things she'd ever tried in her career. It dances with light reflection and choreography is dazzling and complex. <br /> <br /> In fact, after another loan, Universal Christmas, Louis B. Mayer never borrowed Gene Kelly for the remainder of his time at MGM. And he got creative control since then. <br /> <br /> With this dazzling technology of color cinematography and Rita's red hair and Gene Kelly's unlimited creativity, Cover Girl was classic and is forever.
