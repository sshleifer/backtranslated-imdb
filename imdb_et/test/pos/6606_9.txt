Tens of boring surfers, mostly children in Venice, California, not only climbed the skateboard, but repeat the forgotten about 1950s peri-urban phases for the sport revolution. <br /> <br /> Narrarated: Sean Penn, Dogtown depicts life in the nearby Locals Only coastal communities in 1974, mostly consisting of surfing during early morning tides and spells. The Zephyr team (or Z-boys, as they are called) spend one summer boredom building their boards with a local surf shop. After they re-enter skateboarding competitions in SoCal, they convert all into their scene; one that rouseb a roller-skating generation consisting of larger creators like Tony Hawk, Shaun White and X-Games. <br /> <br /> Dogtown puts a chronological perspective on roller skating and the history of the raised tiles that you never knew was. <br /> <br /> Andy Fryelt at MySportsComplex.blogspot.com
