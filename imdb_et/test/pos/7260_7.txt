Plunkett and Macleane are a wonderful update to the swingbuckling tradition, before Johny Deppi and his pirate friends. Tone is a light, social comment, but nothing too heavy. You could almost see Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone. <br /> <br /> It starts with a small move, introduction of signs and social inequality and rebellion issues; but the guys hit the highways as the guys hit the highway. The robberies are large and stylish, with romantic touches, which are bread and bread for bread biscuits. Participants are involved and help raise the material a bit, which is quite hollow. Numbers don't have much depth, but they are played with such a charm and skill that it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> Muh has said about modern music. Periodical music tended to be calmer, which seems inappropriate. A classic score for actions with Celtic rhythms could work, but more modern, rebellious rock and technology music seemed to add an edge to action. As the characters are more legends than reality, the accuracy of music seems to be pointless. The pieces usually fit the mood of the aerated scenes, so it usually works well. I just don't know how they stayed between Adam Ant's "Stand and Deliver". Don't make a mistake, it's not a serious movie. It is pure escapism and a great lark. Tony Scott shows some of his father's visual beauty, but I don't think we're looking at much more Oscars in his career. He seems to understand the material here and pulls out a fine film. Over time, it may be a name. His father took the time to mature beyond visual stylization and become a more rounded director. This is definitely one of the most entertaining nights or a cozy movie festival.
