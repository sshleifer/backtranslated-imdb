every movie with a series of dialogue that goes something like this .... "Judy is preparing for her date, Butthole!" must be good! I found it on a DVD that hasn't been rated, edited, and pleasantly surprised to do a lot of work to make this movie. I enjoyed more than the many 80s I've seen. Great addition to my movie collection. <br /> <br /> Building was great, putting the rest of the movie in fear. Loved by GORE and R&D. I never thought that eyeballs that had fallen out would look out, the eye splatter color was great! I think "Rog" looked like Tiger Woods, but more black, does anyone agree?
