Dolemite is awesome. The kung fu pimp of Rudy Ray Moore's carcase with terrific choreographic sequences is about as close as you can become a genre without actually being silly. Citizen Kane it may not be Les Infant Au Revoir, but it is undoubtedly a genius in his law. The production values ​​of this film are so bad that they could be qualified as existential special effects.

Sometimes it does not know whether the boom mike was expedient to comment on the ridiculous aspects of filmmaking, but I usually get erotic scenes that lack the eroticism of high art thinking.
