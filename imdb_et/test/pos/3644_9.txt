Pretty decent for his early work and without Kokaku Kidotai without it and gets 2 points for extra Easter eggs. Shirow is definitely on the ladder. I'm biased as a Shirow fan, but it was a big step by Dirty Pair, which was what I knew about him. Violent fun porn soundtrack! You can't look at it in any way. I know people appreciate him for Ghost in Shell ... but all the deep spiritual records were handled in Appleseed. ESWAT killed terrorists, struggled for people to stay viable as bioroids, and Deunan remained thin despite the junk food consumption. Certainly like the characters even traitor .. and I don't know why.
