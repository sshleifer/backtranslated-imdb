It's a harrowing film and it's moving relentlessly. At the same time, it is completely unique among war films, because it focuses exclusively on the civilian population, the loss of humanity in ordinary people during the war. Two young married musicians undergo a slow, bursting process of civil war on both sides. The film has completely removed the vision of a modern world from sentimentality and I believe it is especially recognizable for many Europeans. Jul Ullmann (never better) and Max von Sydow (also) with bold, intense performances. For my money, the most indelible film Bergman ever created.
