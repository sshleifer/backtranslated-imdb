SPOILER IS NOT A SPOILER <br /> <br /> I have to add my name to the list of people who feel that other viewers just can't. But no one has even said the word I've seen. <br /> <br /> Although I agree that the boy died, I think we can be more specific: he committed suicide. He runs down the slope of an old wagon, lets down the rock and ... "flies away". Perhaps the whole form of death is an allegory, or maybe he will commit suicide in a wagon as intended. In both cases, he "flies" (c'mon, not so harsh metaphor). <br /> <br /> Maybe I only have a thing for Tom Hanks, but I was right with the story. In addition, he raises $ WW2 for the monument and you have to love him. <br /> <br /> Oh, I loved the movie and found it moving incredibly.
