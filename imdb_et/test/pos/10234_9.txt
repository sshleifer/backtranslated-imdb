Customizing your novel "Cabal" on screen, author / scriptwriter / director Clive Barker designed this wonderful story of horror and fantasy. Craig Sheffer plays Boone, a young man suspected of being a serum killer. Cops guns him in front of Midian, in the capital's cemetery, but which is actually a refuge for social intimidation. When they demand Boone and make it their own, it will have consequences for everyone, including Boone's sweet girlfriend (very cute Anne Bobby) and the suspicious psychiatrist (the most enjoyable David Cronenberg). <br /> <br /> Nightbreed shows a natural and twisted imagination that I don't see in the movie so often. First of all, Ralph McQuarrie, an old hand in conceptual art that has worked with films like the first three "Star Wars" entries, helps Barker create great visuals for "Nightbreed", starting immediately with the opening credit sequence. Visual and makeup effects are complex, and production design and cinematography are quite impressive. The Barker and the team are doing an excellent job of creating this whole other world with significant signs. It is a colorful and terrible entertainment and it is a pleasure to enter. And, of course, there is a strong sense of social comment on intolerance and hopelessness, not to mention the serious consequences that may result from human activity. <br /> <br /> Great supportive performances add fun. Cronenberg oozes a lot of malicious intentions and is a real gas as a bad doctor, while Charles Haid is a good love-hate-type antagonist, rather a nasty police captain. Doug "Pinhead" Bradley is buried again under heavy makeup as tired of Lylesberg and it is a strong stone. Hugh Ross is very fun as Narcis, like Catherine Chevalier as Rachel (as an extra bonus she bares her breasts in one order). Here, too, here are the first two images of "Hellraiser" by Simon Bamford played by "Butterball Cenobes". The 50's and 60's sci-fi star John Agar even has a cool firefighter. /> <br /> "Nightbreed" is a great genre film that is worth watching for anyone who hasn't seen it. I'll give her a heartfelt suggestion. <br /> <br /> 9/10
