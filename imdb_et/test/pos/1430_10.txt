Gold-shouldered man, Otto Preminger's controversial, panoramic crime drama, plays a rhythmic connection among the spiritual descriptions of its living and architectural inhabitants. Opening the film, close-up through the Frankie bar, which looks through the window, tells us that the subjective experience of the protagonist understands. The film is shrinking into an ever-smaller space, as the local gangster's long-term poker game turns off from the sun, turning itself in, because the Sinatra Frankie machine is locked in its locked-in space to overcome its harassing struggle to overcome its habit. The shape and faces of his jazz city paradise are characterized by visual traffic with the golden shoulder of man, characterized by the emergence of weak psychological circumstances, forming an overpopulating environment retained by repetitive tracking devices in the vicinity of Frankie's eyes. <br /> The grace of this fiery drama, which is striking at the time of launching an exciting crane, shows the perceived world that studio production allows. Wonderfully decomposed city kits define an independent place that has no beginning or end, an indefinite state, one that is actually not so long as that sliding line appears before gentrification or leveling. The beauty of certain performances, especially Robert Strauss as the well-known underworld of the underworld stock exchange Schwiefka and Arnold Stang as Frankie's four-eyed lapdog, comes from this pleasantly heartless surrealism. The premise of drug addiction, the performance of Sinatra's power sources, the infectious, powerful jazz score of Elmer Bernstein, and the famous, influential and controversial opening order of Saul Bass, which focuses on the animated piece of paper on the heroin addict's hand, secured this era; It is impressive and subjective, as I say, but its intention, strength and spirit are much closer to home. <br /> <br /> What most absorbs me in this film is its gangster film aspect. It has illegal card games, short draws, struggles, weapons, double crosses, sheep marks, femme fatale, stunning sexy weapon moles, shady nightclubs, and urban landscapes, but it's more than that to take advantage of the entertainment environment. Really, this is the perfect environment and genre where this story is spoken, a crime-related urban area where it is too convenient to escape a bottle or two or three or four or a drug, a transient dose that really just works to keep one from illiteracy and all clear scenarios what the world could offer.
