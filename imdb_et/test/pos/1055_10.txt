I became a teenager in the mid eighties, and it immediately became one of my favorite holidays and non-holidays. As you can tell from other reviews, this movie has a very good story and is signed by big actors. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is great as a bride, which is another idea. Dennis Morgan is also active. He's unnoticed in most movies, but he was a very capable actor, KITTY FOYLE. In this movie he plays a visiting sailor who wool Stanwycki is away from his wife. <br /> <br /> This is Christmas Eve. Settings and story make romance a great Christmas
