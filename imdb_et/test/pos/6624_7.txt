After seeing Ingmar Bergman's Skammen, I had a lot of feelings, but I felt particularly dissatisfied. I've heard a lot about this movie, but I found it missing. Don't do it wrong, I can fully understand the artistic value of such a movie, but I was not so impressed with the depth and emotions. I found the characters unattractive and unrealistic, which undermined the dramatic effect. In addition, the fact that the war was fake made me feel that emotion was not real. Dramatic war movies are, in my opinion, much more effective than events (not necessarily the story itself) really happened. I think that all the films that try to show cruelty fall in the middle of efficiency.
