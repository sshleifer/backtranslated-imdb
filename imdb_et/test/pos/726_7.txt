What can I say? Not as bad as many here have done. The only reason I watched this movie that I had never heard before was strictly to IAN McSHANE. <br /> <br /> I wasn't at all disappointed. IAN McSHANE was absolutely brilliant and brings some amazing nuances to his role. She is always good at watching and for her money ... a very underrated actress. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the movie ... Every other film actor gave strong and strong performances. These people were certainly not paid a large sum of money for their participation (because it was a fairly low budget film), but that does not mean that someone has "posted" their performances. they had even been pleasantly surprised by the performance of ADRIAN PAUL, although I have to admit that I've ever seen him in the HIGHLANDER Television series before that movie. <br /> <br /> The plot was well-paced and story intriguing and very similar to real life, not everything ends up with a nice clean little package at the end of the movie. Anyone who assumed that at the end of the movie was clear, next to the numbers, connect the "conclusion" or "answer" ... CLEARLY did not watch the movie carefully enough! This movie doesn't tell you what the "life thought" is! The idea is that after seeing the movie you can go and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends about coffee. I certainly didn't. <br /> <br /> No car ... No explosions ... No bar space strikes .... (It looks pretty boring, huh?) But the reality is that I was completely absorbed in the movie and it's just well-written small piece with interesting hooks and definite performances from all parties. <br /> <br /> ****** WARNING ... ****** A person who doesn't like movies that hit a huge "question" story as a central engine, and then stop the movie without answering this question directly ... <br /> <br /> YOU ARE NOT MAKING THIS FILM.
