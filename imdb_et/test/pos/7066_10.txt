"Meatballs" is a summer camp ode. Those of us who went to camp see many scenes, as we remember or want them to have. <br /> <br /> Bill Murray plays Tripper Harrison, a counselor for parents boys who really drives the camp. He reminds us of the funny cool worker everyone loves. Young campers are pulling towards him and when he talks to you, you feel like a family. This is one of Murray's best roles. He drives the film with his single liner and ad-libs. <br /> <br /> Chris Makepeace plays Rudy, a loner camper who has been taken under the Tripper wing and breaks his shell. <br /> <br /> The other campers and film workers were also great. <br /> <br /> The overall theme of the movie is overcoming obstacles to finally win. Rudyst to Spazin Camp, and even Tripper, are the stars of the movie. The film has a heart. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun and funny, being cruel or excessive, as some teenage movies are today. Cast appearance and behavior is a real person. <br /> <br /> Comedy and heart lead you to the end of the camp, as you are sad to leave. <br /> <br /> In our summer camp experience, we had underwear that rose to the flagship, mysterious meat, trying to smile girls' lunatic-with-hook stories around the camp fire and sleeping them out of their booths elsewhere. But we also had a special camp staff who led us to the best we could be. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is CIT overnight when they are canoeing over a lake where a buggy song is sung. One line that breaks me every time is when Tripper announces the evening before the bay of the day and ends. "Tomorrow is the day of parents, and you have to look at the rest or Morty is sent to a national penal institution."
