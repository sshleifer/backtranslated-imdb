I would give this movie 8.5 or 9. I thought it was just straight fun and I don't know how you couldn't think this movie was funny, but the only thing I was disappointed was that it was a little too much harsh things because I think that if they fly off bikes and things like that, it's a lot of fun, but I'm sure there are people who think other things are very funny, so it's not my wish but still the big movie sees it and after that you should definitely go buy it even if you don't like the movie that's good because i'm sure there are many people who think this movie shows how our society humiliation is or what is it just my personal opinion and you have yours. also jackasskasto set is definitely something you need to download or buy videos or what you do to get your videos
