The creators of the South Park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, will eventually get out of their harsh schedule to talk to the cameras when they sleep in the champagne in the jacuzzi. First of all, looking at it, I didn't feel as much sarcasm as it was. I knew they were joking when they complained about the show's different participants, and when Trey said he didn't give his mother any money, but there was so much sarcasm that the documentary was rather ridiculous jokes. <br /> <br /> This "documentary" shows everything from South Park (to the second season). This shows what is happening behind the scenes of animations and recordings. It has interviews, many of which are fake interviews, but some of these materials provide an overview of the exhibitions. The short clips of both Trey Parker Christmas parties are shown, as are many good exhibitions. If you were a fan of South Park, it would have had to delete your exhibition information at the end of 1998. Now the exhibition has obviously changed, but it's still interesting. <br /> <br /> We are here with an entertaining documentary where Trey Parker (especially) and Matt Stone come with arrogant wilts and that's exactly what they wanted to get out of. They may be in real life, but here was a joke, a 51-minute insightful joke. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** out ****. 51 minutes. Not rated, contains language and sexual content.
