So far only the first episode has been shown, and there has been a lot of noise on the lesbian sexual scenes. But for those who struggle from the past, they find an incredibly beautiful love story and what is in this episode ended in a disturbing climax. I found this story so powerful that I was inspired to read the novel on which this fantastic series is based.
