Five Fingers of Death: Although the previous epic of Shaw Martial Arts had shown the influence of the American cowboy genre, no such public respect had paid for it, especially in the fight against the cabin. And while Shaw Brose's films had previously been borrowed from the Japanese chambara genre, no one had done so successfully. I think some of this was due to the fact that the director comes from Korea, and therefore brought a non-Chinese perspective on such loans, which certainly raises interesting questions about culture; but in any case, this film presented the real innovations in technology and technology in Hong Kong films. for the first time in Hong Kong, the camera was given access to any given set, which meant taking a wide variety of angles, such as a low-angle interior image showing the ceiling of the room (the original American innovation, which is generally credited to John Ford), or with large-angle long shots to visualize a large ground , or a front tracking shot. <br /> <br /> It is true that this was not the first hand-to-hand film about a true cinematic substance - which remains Wang Yu's "Chinese boxer"; but on a commercial level, Shaw Bros had the right to choose "Five Fingers" for the first time to be released from the West, because it can be said to be the "least China" of their feature films, ie the least dependent on pure Chinese theater traditions. Although it did not give American journalists an impression at that time (universally trying to capture a picture), it did not disappear from American audiences, especially among African Americans, whose culture had always been - if necessary - an eclectic patchwork and innovation. "Five Fingers" gave them the opportunity to discover the core of the story, a serious young man who was forced to make additional efforts to overcome social barriers and betrayal to gain recognition. This seems to be a modern universal issue, but every culture has its own way of expressing and solving it; "Five Fingers" presented it so that many Americans could be involved in both Chinese and Chinese. <br /> <br /> So this film is only of historical value? Definitely not. Firstly, this issue is not lost. Secondly, some of the innovations leave a large part of the film freshly fresh today, as it was on the first release. The action is also well-staged and the performances, though slightly too serious, are crisp. The film is too long, but the story covers a lot of ground. And there are wonderful sets, such as cabin confrontation, fighting on the race, odd double finals. <br /> <br /> is definitely better on the notification screen but still impressive for home viewing: recommended.
