I saw this movie at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer, all the enlightened actor is Liev Schreiber's debut. The scenario was also written by Schreiber. In the film, Jonathan (Elijah Wood) collects items from his family, from toothbrushes to holders to paper scraps, which he then fixes in his house on ziploc bags and pins. But his grandfather's space is conspicuously empty. All of Jonathan is pretty much her jewelery and old photo of her woman who hid her in the Second World War from the Nazis. Jonathan decides to turn to Ukraine to find a woman, thank her and learn more about her grandfather. <br /> <br /> His efforts are supported by a few characters who run a Jewish tourist company. including a young man who is embedded in western culture (Eugene Hutz), his grandfather (Boris Leskin) who thinks he is blind and who may have war memoirs and demons, and his grandfather's temperamental eyesight of a dog of the eye. The scenario combines humor and drama efficiently, as three characters travel through the countryside, looking for Jonathan's grandfather's city, driving deeper and deeper into the past's memories. The best performance is likely to come from Eugene Hutz, who plays Alex Jr., who begins to wear the movie as a sportswear, to break as a dancer for fun, but develops more than just Jonathan, but all the characters get their light <br /> <br /> Liev Schreiber, Elijah Wood and Eugene Hutz took part in the screening and made very humorous questions after the film: <br /> <br /> - Schreiber was very close to his grandfather who was a Ukran immigrant and died in 1993. It made her write to get memories on paper. In the meantime, he was asked to read Foer's story "Very Rigid Search", which was an excerpt from an unpublished novel. Schreiber was blown away for the quality of the written letter saying that Foer had done on the 15 pages that Schreiber was trying to do in 107. Schreiber turned to Foer and talked about his grandfathers, culture, films and the nature of short-term memory to America; finally, Foer agreed to allow Schreiber to adapt the book. <br /> <br /> - Schreiber's own project was on the road, but there is a parallel narrative in the book, which is the imaginary chronological history of the city of Trochenbrod covering 500 years; considering his budget and the limitations of the filmmaker, he said he would leave it to Milos Forman and make a journey instead. This imaginary chronology was what led him to make the film for the first time, the idea that "the beloved image of the past was as valuable as the past exactly remembered". <br /> <br /> - Schreiber said the movie was a series of happy accidents. After he had been unsuccessful in seeking an actor in Ukraine, he walked down the Lower East Side in New York when he saw a female centaur pitch, upside down, at the top of a cossack. The poster was named Gogol Bordello Ukranian Punk Gypsy Band. <br /> <br /> Eugene Hutz then took over the story. He had never acted because music was his first passion. One day a friend gave her a book and she thought it was written like writing music; screw phrases / syntax, language is for me. <br /> <br /> Later, they sent a call from a manufacturing company looking for medieval but contemporary Eastern European music. Hutz met Schreiber and soon found that the film was based on a book he just read. Not long after, Schreiber asked Hutz what he was thinking about Alex and could do that character whenever possible. <br /> <br /> - Foer and Schreiber talked about the film in the fall of 2001, just after the events of September 11th. Both were at that time in Europe, and they spoke about the annoying comments about Americans, which led Schreiber to try to find an expressive American who would violate the stereotype of Europeans of Americans. Someone who was uncomfortable, vulnerable, faulty, innocent, and was looking for history outside his country. Schreiber began to think who it was, and Elijah came. <br /> <br /> One of Schreiber's inspiration for filmmaker is Emir Kusturica (I think this is what she said, who led the segment in another film, All Invisible Children), who said "you don't look at the participants, you're looking for people." Schreiber said there was something for Elijah that he had a generosity spirit and sincere goodness as a man who met on the film. Schreiber said that the eyes are important in formulating the observer, and when "the eyes are the doors to the soul, Elijah has garage doors." <br /> <br /> - Elijah Wood had a fun question about her character in Kevin's Sin City and Jonathan in this movie, both being a sort of blank slate on which emotions are projected. Wood replied that Jonathan might seem to be still and seemingly emotional, but it concerns all his observations, his experiences with other characters and the environment in which he was. <br /> <br /> - Differences between leadership and writing: Schreiber said he likes to write much more and describe it as "hell". After the grandfather's death, Schreiber began to think about how to preserve some historical concept and himself; is it content-driven or not, or just good at interpreting other people's work? He said he loved you to feel emotional to you.
