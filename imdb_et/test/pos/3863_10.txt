Many people criticize the 20th classic animation for Disney's classic "mediocre" or bad quality, but it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> It's too bad that "Aristocrats" don't get the credit they earned. I personally see it as one of my favorite Disney classics. <br /> <br /> Despite being extremely underestimated, this is one of the most funny Disney classics. It's full of fun (some of them, hysterical) moments. <br /> <br /> Edgar, the greedy butler, is the villain of the movie, but he is the perfect comic. She's one of my favorite Disney villains because she's so funny. <br /> <br /> Each scene where Edgar and the Napoleon and Lafayette dogs are behind him is one of the funniest you will ever see, especially when Edgar rides his motorcycle on the river and bridge where the dogs follow him. It's hysterical! <br /> <br /> But classic humor comes not only from Edgar or dog dogs. Other characters also have moments. <br /> <br /> The quality theme is not perfect but remains high. Even after Walt Disney's death, these artists were aware of Walt's spirit and "Aristocrats" are one of these examples. They don't do them today like that! <br /> <br /> As usual, legendary Disney actors pronounce signs. In this case, we have Phil Harris, Sterling Holloway, Paul Winchell, Eva Gabor and Pat Buttram. <br /> <br /> Characters are generally cool: Thomas O'Malley, Duke and his 3 kittens, Mouse Roquefort Alley Cats, English Geese, Dogs and Horses. Human characters are also included: the eccentric and kind pensioner Opera singer Madame Adelaide Bonfamille, comedian Madame's old lawyer Georges Hautecourt and Edgar himself! <br /> <br /> There are some beautiful and memorable songs about music, such as the Thomas O'Malley theme (but I don't remember its name), like "Everyone Wants to be a Cat" and "Aristocrats" (Maurice Chevalier sing). <br /> <br /> This film takes place in Paris (France) in 1910. It is especially a joyful, nice and very pleasant movie. Timeless classic, often underestimated and forgotten, but very worthwhile. <br /> <br /> It should definitely be in the Top 250.
