As a child who grew up in Sydney in the 1950s, I can easily identify the content of this fine film. Every week I visited George Street's Wynyard Newsrein cinema to watch Cinesound (and usually 3 Stooges) shorts. Never B / W and color are better mixed. The wrong production value will ever round off the unforgettable film experience.
