I had to see a different version than the first person in the user comments. The character of Val Kilmer is very similar to the novel, although the emphasis is on Gusel and Call and Comanches. We see what happened to Call and Newt's mother. I don't break it, but it gives a lot of information about Call's character. <br /> <br /> All participants did a very convincing job. Steve Zahn's biggest challenge was to follow Robert Duvall! There's a lot of action, humor, tragedy. It's something for everyone. I can't wait for it to go, my family is all jealous.
