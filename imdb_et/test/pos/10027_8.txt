If you keep this rigid historical perspective out, this movie is actually quite fun. It has action, adventure and romance, and one of the main roles is Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland. This table shows that the picture does not move with the purists who are looking for 100% accuracy of their story. To go beyond that, you only need to leave the book of history and enjoy the story as if it were fiction. I know I know it's hard to do this if you have to stand Custer's last at a small horn and its importance after the American history of civil war. So I think the picture is an outstanding solution, no matter how you look at it. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of time here to take a picture of two hours plus running time. Custer's arrival at West Point is probably the first chief accountant to travel as he does a complete military regalia. The practical fun of Sharp (Arthur Kennedy), which put him at Major's headquarters, would probably have had to be both in trouble. <br /> <br /> Ironically, many military films play comedy, like Custer's first encounter with Libby Bacon, followed by meetings that include Callie (Hattie McDaniel). I hadn't noticed it before in other films before, but McDaniel reminded me a lot of other favorite girls from the forties, Mantan Moreland. So much so that one scene seemed to have Moreland dressed. With that in mind, the owl scene was also a hoot. <br /> <br /> As far as Flynn is concerned, it is interesting to note that a year earlier he represented J.E.B. Stuart replied to the description of Ronald Reagan from General Custer "Santa Fe Trail", both competed by none other than Olivia de Havilland. In this film, Reagan did not take any arrogance and astonishment into Custer's character that history remembers, while in Flynn's image it is more than obvious. But it is not close to that of Richard Mulligan's hero of the "Little Big Man" of the 1970s. Let's just say that one was a little up. <br /> <br /> Better taking the picture for me was the way Custer stayed in order to keep his good name and not venture into a business venture. It and his loyalty to the men he led in battle, with the discipline he had to develop. The most embarrassing was that the final confrontation with the archi rival Sharp just before the small horn, where he announced that hell or honor was entirely dependent on his point of view. Earlier, a similar comment gave us the best picture of Custer's character when he said, "You take with you the time to go".
