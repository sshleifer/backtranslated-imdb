I appreciate it because of 8 movie assumptions. The action was good, there was no one who seemed amazing or terrible. It is alarmingly true that intelligent people have fewer and fewer children, or do not want anything at all ... given that the leap ass "W" in the 04 supporters is like rabbits. And although I don't think the earth actually exists for 500 years, I see Mike Judge's parked prophet, like a life imitating art. The world is dominated by idiots and it deepens as intelligent free-thinking people become a minority and "git er er" fans cross them. The proof is the farce of our election. <br /> <br /> But I'm going. If you are lucky enough to play it in your city, look at it. I've paid my $ 7.50 plus popcorn to see FAR WORSE garbage like that (Date Movie or Napoleon Dynamite?). Laughs, there are traps, but in general it is fun. If you have half the brain, think for yourself how this movie, though funny, is spot on (exact) and * tiny * a bit amazing. I am not surprised that this film is almost completely unknown, because Fox was the one who spread it, and they don't want their sheep to see it and think "maybe I read the book and not watch" Next "or" Scams' or 'My My Balls'. "If our society does not stop scaring and scaring English (ahem, Mr Bush), it is actually where we go.
