All reviewers make one big mistake. This film was not expected to be serious. <br /> <br /> It was done for children and teenagers in the late 80s or early 90s and as such was a truly timed movie. If you hated this period or loved the first movie so much that you don't even get kidding about it, it's garbage, but just because it wasn't meant for you. The low budget and the failure of the Beastmaster 1 ticket office (less than four million euros with nine million budgets) were clearly the reasons for abandoning the seriousness of the original and putting it to the present. You can complain about a story, a dialogue or a logic, but it was done again in order not to win. If the film had tried to take it seriously, it would be a complete failure, but it doesn't do it in another ("our" world, Dar sees a movie that advertises Beastmaster 2, enough said). Paraphrasing Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry films: This film knows its limitations. It's more of a comedy / parody than an ordinary adventure. Soundtrack was also great. The actors don't take it seriously, so even the normally irritating "broken rich brat" role (played very well by the young Kari Wuhrer) turns out to be fine. <br /> <br /> So, if you are nostalgic in the 80s (for the 90s (cheese) culture or if you liked the first part, and don't forget to remove the extremities of the cheese, you'll have a tremendous amount of fun in trying to revive Dar in the 90s (in writing) This is not really the first step and do not look at it if you want it.It is more than "fantasy" following bones (at the end of part 1)? By the way, the film ends at the zoo because of the cheap (financially) attempt This is the best place for Darile to show all his moves (he is an animal manipulator).
