I enjoyed two of the three films "Sarah, Plain & Tall" in the trilogy. This, the final of these three, was certainly one of the "good." <br /> <br /> The story is simple but well said. The only sub-parameter was one of the children. It was interesting to see how children have grown after this movie. <br /> <br /> Three of the three, that the original "Sarah" was filmed with the most beautiful film art. This movie didn't have it, but it had the best story. It had some really tears of sentimental moments and a very nice ending. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
