Somewhere in IMDb, the biggest director of all time (Spielberg, Copolla and others have been named there). The biggest argument was around Spielberg and whether he is or is not a big director. The problem with Spielberg is that if he is a master technician, most of his films have no depth. Ryan is really remarkable from a technical point of view, but its message is boring and, although it is a lot of fun, it does not make you think so. AN is the best movie I've ever seen, because it combines so many things from a deep philosophical perspective of great photography, from war in general, the clash of civilizations, the condition of soldiers (a soldier a hero or an assassin? Brando says he's not, the French lady says that he is so ...) and many others. The problem with some people is that they try to claim whether these points are true or false. But a great movie and a great work of art should blame the arguments, not solve them ... Maybe Coppola is right, or maybe he's not, nobody holds that truth. You can watch this movie for your external beauty, amazing scenes, great exhibitions and memorable quotes and you are completely satisfied. But what really makes this movie a masterpiece is its internal quality. You can't help but make a comparison with the recent Fahrenheit documentary. Both Copolla and Moore are dealing with similar issues, but although Copolla presents things from outside, from an objective point of view, Moore takes a very partisan position that actually compromises the entire documentary ... It's really a shame that the movie like Fahrenheit 9/11 won a prestigious award like Cannes. But still, if you want to start some Vietnam war, Iraq war, World War II and general war, you should definitely see this movie, not the other ...
