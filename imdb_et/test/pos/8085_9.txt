Yes, I'm sentimental and yes, I love movies where kids are better people. True, Klatret√∏sen has some logical or even plot deficiencies. They are mostly compensated by children's big shows (Julia's first film role!) And the charm of Dogma's movie (I liked such cinematography long before Dogma; ever since Herzog's Herz aus Glas). Well, I cried for the last fifteen minutes, which is a higher factor than bambi or Fly away home was for me.
