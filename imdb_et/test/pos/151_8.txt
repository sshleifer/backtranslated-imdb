The Korean cinema has the ability to change genres on its head, and the last labeled director, Chan-wook Park, is a story of a good divine priest who becomes a vampire. Add a bully who misleads him and eccentrics, and you have a great recipe. <br /> <br /> Partly in a style similar to the "sympathy" trilogy, it's as proud as dark. Exiting clich√©s does not offer any new tricks in the genre of over-painted vampire. His existential film, which tries to defeat moral confusion as to how exactly a person must decide to live with his conditions, not to enjoy blood supply. But the film does not take itself too seriously and there is boundless humor. <br /> <br /> Our leaders play their role in perfection, play our emotions and humor in the dark. All moral contradictions involved in the film are reflective moments, but never preach. Some may find it overwhelming, and this may displace points, but it is worth giving it an opportunity to finish. <br /> <br /> If you like left movies, it's better than late. Dark and enticing, it pulls the crowd. I would recommend you try.
