Personally, I think the movie is pretty good. It's almost 8. I liked both ethnography and great photography. Colin Firth's character is not the most pleasant, but in his role he is better than decent work. The heroine, played by beautiful Nia Long, is a familiar movie hero, because she is trying to do what she thinks is best for her child - getting married to a respected member of her expat community - while fighting her "bad" man - one who is not member of his community ("bystander"). Most of the film is about her mother's struggle: should she do what she's expected, what she thinks is best for her son or should she follow her heart? I don't want to give up the end. Let me just say that this is a good movie with great location shots, a great African dress (it's worth watching a movie just for women 's stunning African clothes and headgear) and pleasant characters in general. An actor who plays with Nia Long's son is bright and divine. The plot is a bit formal, but I liked this movie. If you are a fan of Colin Firth, you have to watch this movie. If you like stylish flicks, look at it. I think I'll see it again today!
