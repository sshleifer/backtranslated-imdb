One of Alfred Hitchcock's three biggest films with "Psycho" and "The 39 Steps", "Strangers On A Train" is just as brilliantly uncontrollable as the merry-round Metcalf and almost as deadly. It's a movie that has so much fun watching, you can't even blame it properly until you have time to catch your breath. <br /> <br /> Top Amateur Tennis Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets an extraordinarily strange, stranger, on the train, called Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker). Thanks to the rumor pages, Bruno Guy knows the problems with his disgraceful wife, Miriam, and rather tells them to do each other: Bruno kills Miriam and Guy kills Bruno's father who wants to put Bruno in the institute. Guy laughs at it, but Bruno is not kidding because Guy discovers his danger. <br /> <br /> It's a great idea for a murderer, and Hitchcock gives a train to all strangers. its value, with the help of Walker, perhaps the greatest performance in the Hitchcock movie, including Anthony Perkins' Psycho. While Perkins makes his mark tetrical against grain, Walker, as Anthony, is one of the most brilliant at home, whether we could have old ladies in a dumpling party or strangle in a young woman's amusement park. <br /> <br /> What drives Bruno? Many commentators suggest that his obvious homosexuality finds the game quite Guy. Yes, Bruno lights up the old gay dari, but Guy seems to be pleased with the withdrawal of love with Anneite Morton (Ruth Roman). Bruno's interest in Guy can be as easy to envy as someone at home when he lives, letting his mother put his nails on. <br /> <br /> "Oh, I definitely admire people who do things," Bruno breaks, looking like a cat who sees the mouse. "You know, it must be so exciting to be so important." <br /> Later Bruno calls himself "hell", accurate enough, except for our rooting interest in him, even when he destroys Guy's life by killing him. This is a very perverse alpine story. There is honesty with Bruno about his dedicated dedication that commands our respect and what Hitchcock plays so wonderfully. When Bruno gets out of his big crime scene, am I the only sick person in the world who is really happy with him? I don't think so, but Hitchcock keeps the track on the right track so we can understand how low we are. We don't want Bruno to win exactly, but we enjoy his life when he tries. <br /> <br /> Everything else is so perfect, or at least close enough to make every fiery memorable. Hitchcock always kept at least 2-3 good devices on the film; here you can get them alone in the amusement park. ("20 Big Shows" to the neon at the entrance says and they are not joking.) Script, camera-work, thrilling tennis game, Ruth Roman jaw dropping, this is too big a priority for one movie. Even Granger does more of his youngsters' things here with more resolved credibility than Gregory Peck, who was never successful. <br /> <br /> This can be called a clinic making a movie, but "Clinic" sounds too boring. "Strangers On A Train" is a good nasty fun, all the time, leaving you with the tail when you realize that you are roaming the wrong stranger. Heck, I'll take this ride again!
