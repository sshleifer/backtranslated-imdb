Before watching a movie, it will pay off the mortgage. The three main female deities - wise Sita, who take care of Laksh and Kali Transformer - and the three main male deities - tomb Rama, playful Krishna and Shiva Ender - are all mentioned. Familiarity with folklore, as is certainly the case with every Indian audience, provides a rich story today. In fact, one folktale is first on stage, as part of a spiritual lesson, and then in the "real life" movie. "Fire" speaks of contradictory and homophobia in a society of local producers, and it does it with beauty that generates a message to the multiple levels of the viewer's awareness, making it a profoundly satisfying presentation. It has been the best film in the last ten years. highly recommended!
