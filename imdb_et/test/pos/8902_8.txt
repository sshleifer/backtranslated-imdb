Being a faithful fan of Asterix all my life, I have to say that "Asterix and Vikings" are probably the best made of Asterix films. It has some very funny jokes and the animation is great. As many people have said, it does not follow the comic book ("Asterix and Normans") very much, but in many ways that are as good as this book stands out in my mind as the one that hit the fun of the sixties culture, and much of it is today is very dated. <br /> <br /> What really rubbed me the wrong path is how they created a movie in the Disney-style plot that focused on Asterix and Obelix. We have a misunderstood boy who doesn't fit, Justforkix. We have a tom-boy girl who doesn't fit because he wants to treat men as equal, Abba. They meet and fall in love, but their love is threatened because the boy is ashamed that he is completely honest with the girl, but eventually their love comes out. It has been a plot of so many Disney (and other studios) films that are not funny and the plot was twenty years ago. I mean, they even gave Justforkix a crazy keeper. <br /> <br /> Not only did you find this derivative and the clich√©, but it really is a story and left me contented. <br /> <br /> I think it's a lot about how great the rest of the movie was that I still think very much about it, no matter how the plot was hijacked.
