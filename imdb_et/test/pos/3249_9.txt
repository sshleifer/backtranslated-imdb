Two hands restored my faith in Aussie films. It took the old assumption and made it fresh. I enjoyed this movie indefinitely. I recommend it to people who like Guy Ritchie. Bryan Brown was fantastic and almost perfect in his custom role. Ledger was an adequtly stupid and his performance confirmed a very satisfying film for me.
