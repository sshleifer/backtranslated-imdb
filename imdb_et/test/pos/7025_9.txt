I didn't understand what this line meant ... I'm doing now. I also didn't want to see Dirty Dancing. I rented it out, but never watched it - and I did it today. And I thought it was really fun, a great movie that makes you get up and dance. Alright, it was funny at times ... but it's still a great movie. I can't believe Jennifer Gray was in this movie 27 - my friend and I thought she looked around 18 or 19-20. I think it's attributed to his talents. And at times she was uncomfortable. Patrick Swayze is also very good, but you can say that he is in his thirties and seems a little old. Nevertheless, it is still very good. I love 80s songs, so it really drew a chord with me and the love story (yes, I'm romantic) was so wonderfully done. I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. Overcome my expectations!
