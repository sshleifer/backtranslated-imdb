36. HOSPITAL (comedy, 1971) A number of emergencies have been involved in the Manhattan Hospital. Patients die due to overcrowded conditions and left and right. When a resident doctor has been sentenced to death, he is invited to investigate the responsible medical examiner, Dr Bock (George C. Scott). Since Doctor Bock has been working as a doctor for many years and has undergone a living crisis in his midst, his dr. He decides to commit suicide. But then he will meet Barbara (Diana Rigg), a young hippie beauty. Whose eager understanding of life helps depressed Bock. <br /> <br /> Criticism: Black comedy presents veteran actor George C. Scott's "tour-de-force" performance. He's good at playing high-level, serious signs that have been rigorously tested for rigorous morals. The first part of the film opens like a melodrama, giving a good overview of the life of the hospital and sometimes of them. But when things stand out for a dramatic climax, it falls to a shining comedy. If Paddy Chayefsky's manuscript had retained its dramatic sense, then I don't know if Scott had stepped out with the second best actor Oscar (he had previously won it in "in in absentia"). His attack (suicide) scene is one of the most intestinal in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> QUOTE: Dr Bock: "............ I said," No Bock is doing it. You are a doctor, a healer, you're the right person, you're Life makes sense. ‚ÄùThen ... I find one of my doctors killed a couple of sisters ... how do I keep that in mind?
