Slipknot is a heavy metal band from a big city in Des Moines, Iowa, where travelers are wearing their outstanding mask (I know someone has already said that, but I need to fill this room with space). The band members are Joey, Mick, 133, Sid, Clown, James, Corey, Chris and Paul. This band, in my opinion, is one of the best new heavy metal bands and should be listened to by anyone who loves hardcore rock. Another good movie is called "DISASTERPIECES", which shows the band's performance at London Arena. The video "My plague" was shot there and it is on DVD. They've also made the fastest story they did (Sic). So if you love this band, you have to see it and if you love heavy metal, you have to hear that band.
