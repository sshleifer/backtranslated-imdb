Based on the actual event, this epic is set in 221 B.C and tells the true story of China's accession. An action full of intrigue, passion, betrayal, and unforgettable battles, was my focus, despite 160 minutes. <br /> <br /> King Ying Zeng, played by Li Xuejian, is embedded in the unifying China's seven kingdoms and its first emperor. His lover Lady Zhao, played by a beautiful actor Gong Li, is working on a plot where he travels to the neighboring kingdom of Yani to move a fake murder card that gives the king a pretext for invading Yani. But he falls in love with the assassin because the king is becoming more and more ruthless. <br /> <br /> There are sub-blocks, tragedy and constant high drama. There's great beauty and harassing cruelty. There is great cinematography and great spatial use. <br /> <br /> The deep character made me think of Shakespeare. And tragic events that require Greek drama. And yet it is entirely Chinese because it deals with aging questions about whether the ends justify the means. And raises the questions of life and death, good and evil, and all vague edges. <br /> <br /> This is the story of individuals from history, a history that has shaped China's past two thousand years. I bumped into both the story and the moral issues raised. There are no simple answers and this was one of the strengths of the film. <br /> <br /> Recommended. But be prepared for violence and gore. <br /> <br />
