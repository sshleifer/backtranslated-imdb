The 1996 MICHAEL is a warm and won comedy-fantasy with one of my favorite works from John Travolta's library. Travolta gives one of his most beautiful and pleasurable performances, like Michael, an archangel whose silent existence at the home of a lonely hostel Pansy (Jean Stapleton) is disturbed when Pansy announces Michael's home to the "National Enquirer" newspaper. and editor (Bob Hoskins) sends reporters to the motel (William Hurt, Andie McDowell, Robert Pastorell) to check it out. Hurt, McDowell, and Pastorelli are pretty good when worried news workers who have a hard time accepting have met an angel but this is Travolta's exhibition and his rules are pot-bellied, eating sugar, smelling a cookie, pie-loving, Aretha-loving , bull-Michael, an angel who just isn't what you think when you mean angels. And you have to love the scene at the bar when she and the ladies dance with the "Lolls Chain". I love this movie more and more every time I watch it, and this is mainly due to John Travolta's wholly winning result.
