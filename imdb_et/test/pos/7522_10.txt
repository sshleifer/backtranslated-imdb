Anyone who has been working in a hospital or medical facility has to evaluate this movie. The plot is completely wild but fun from start to finish. Action is great. George C. Scott is a brilliant doctor, but class A, as a man, a father. Diana Riggs, the symbol of sex in the 1960s and 1970s (Avengers), saves herself. The surrounding cast is great and the dialogue is quite fun. I think I enjoyed watching the 4th, 5th place in the movie. or 6 .. time because I got much more dialogue about wealth and symbolic interaction. Worth checking over and over again. You just don't want to go to the hospital in the near future.
