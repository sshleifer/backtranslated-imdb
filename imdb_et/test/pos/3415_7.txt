Red dust has worked as well as well done, but what the film is, I think it has suffered a lot of viewers like me. There was a movie that was formerly called "my home country" by Sam Jackson, and it was not so well received, and both movies were almost as accurate, I think the red dust was better because the more interesting performances were especially the future Oscar winner Chiwton Ejofor, but the plot is just incomplete, it starts quite strongly, but then the movie hits a movie where viewers have countless interesting courtroom sessions that could have been a great movie if the writing wasn't so missing. But look at the performances.
