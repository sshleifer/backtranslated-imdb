This movie was bombarded with a box and vote here, but I loved it. One dimension of film value is how much you still remember in 25 years. I didn't list you, but there are dozens of deeply comic scenes, as well as good story and great pain. Inert robbers are hooters. Look at it and decide if it will ever go to TCM.
