"Murder Over New York" is fun, but not as good as most other Fox Chans. This movie would have been called "Charlie Chan in New York", the title of the film's work. This is Toler's chance to play Chani Big Apple. Here's a lot of fun, including the star of the guests, Shemp Howard, who are three Stooges. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite Chan's statements: "Coincidence like an old egg - leaves an unpleasant smell." Toler and Yung are good and so supportive in this field. But in these films, I'm looking for a little or no mysterious atmosphere. However, it is good to see.
