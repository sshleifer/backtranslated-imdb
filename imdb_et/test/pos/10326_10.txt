The whole civilized world is now aware that this is where Emil Sitka tells his immortal "Keep your hands, you love the birds". But Shemp Howard, professor of music, steals the exhibition. See her instructing Dee Green when she breaks "Spring Voices". Look at Shemp when he shaves with a mirror hanging on the ceiling. Look at her when she gets Christine McIntyre. Look at her and you laugh and learn. Also Moe is not slouch. Look at her when she tries to sit on a woman's trap. Larry, as usual, is a Zen champion of the reaction. All in all, one of the best Stooge shorts is. You won't find any weak moments.
