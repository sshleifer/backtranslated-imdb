Master Sharky, you look so ... normal. You can never table in this fancy cocktail restaurant. I, on the other hand, and every day eat grapes and pasta. Do you like my coat with all the fine cuts? My Golden Gold Rings? Or maybe you like those blondes, "do you say?" You like? You can't! Zey is all mine. Domino was the best except Maman. You don't understand the art of love. Just look at your worst mustache. It is almost funny for me to think of this ridiculous deviation on my foolish face, because it shines around Domino's love hill like a piggy, who is looking for truffle, a forest ride in the woods and admires the desire for warm wind! You lose Sharky again. <br /> <br /> If I love women, you know Sharky, zey. Zey is studying, zey studying until zey becomes a teacher. Not nano-math, love art. Domino was a seedling that I watered. I dipped her so often. Everywhere in Sharky. Her scented petals, her gorgeous stalk, everywhere. She warts under your ridiculous hose, like the beer is removed too quickly within five minutes. <br /> <br /> I have to go with Sharky now, you suffered from such shameful behavior. It is you who wash the peeir like a smelly thing. <br /> <br /> Bon Bonus!
