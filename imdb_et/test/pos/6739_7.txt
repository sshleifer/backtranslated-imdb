It is a gentle comedy of future comedy that comes from the later, more mature period of Neil Simon's writing. Although there are many wisecracks to go around, this is not one of those Neil Simon pieces, where each character outflows a single liner joke for 2 hours as they are guest stars Bob Hope special. There are also dramatic elements (some work, some are superfluous) that create the story. <br /> <br /> The performances are good, especially Blythe Danner as a mother (although she and Judith Ivey were strangely WASP ish choices for Jewish women). I am never a fan of Jonathan Silverman, but I say he hits the right notes, which is a terrible, nervous and completely horned up teen-age narrator / story protagonist. <br /> <br /> The film is very similar to Woody Allen's "Radio Days", but the latter is much more creative and funny than it is.
