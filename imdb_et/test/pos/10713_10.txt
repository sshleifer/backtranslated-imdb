Just as Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) is about to interrupt his working life, his frustrated woman, Joanna (Meryl Streep), finally has the courage to leave her, leaving Ted to take care of her five-year-old son (Justin Henry). Being a single parent proves that Ted is quite diligent and professionally trained, but also learns much more than life in life, as he continues to associate with his son and really learn. But then Joanna returns and plans to get her son back, leading to cruel custody. <br /> <br /> Kramer v. Kramer is a wonderfully well written and perfectly functioning human drama that leaves the coldest looking viewer intact. Hoffman's growing relationship with his son is so well illustrated and the film is never an easy way out. This is always very real and thanks to the low-key approach of the film, it has even more impact and can easily work with multiple views, with no dramatic effect on the film. <br /> <br /> It's just recommended; 10 out of 10
