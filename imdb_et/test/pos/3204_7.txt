Usually Alan Alda plays signs that are too "soft" and too verbal - it's probably how he actually lives. This time he fits his character. Although he exceeds the delivery of the judgment. <br /> <br /> Many of us remember the 1971 Atika Prison Wrap and the New York State scary event. Only a few journalists have talked about a real story. This film gives a quick overview of the horrors and excessive surprises associated with Attica's rebellion / rebellion. Attica had a great influence on this country. Maybe it stimulates the film to explore someone's history. <br /> <br /> I can't remember a film made from prisoners' point of view - although there is a great PBS piece with actual Attica survivors / participants. The perspective of the guards in captivity is investigated against "Wall" by Kyle MacLachlan, Samuel L. Jackson, Clarence Williams III and Frederic Forrest. <br /> <br /> That day we called, "Attica! Attica!" It was nice to hear it in the movie. Back memories. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the movie is Morris Chestnut wigs and other African Americans have to wear. It would have been easy for these people to grow Fro.
