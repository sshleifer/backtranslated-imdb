Allow me to say from the start that I'm not a specific fan of such a movie, but Nightbreed has some enthusiasm for me with a message of perspective. <br /> <br /> Behind the old days, people living in Midian would be called zombies, the Undead. And according to what Clive Barker has given us certain human members, this Craig Sheffer has the potential to become part of this world. <br /> <br /> Psychiatrist David Cronenberg sees first of all a light-minded professional as a fanatical mission to get rid of the nightlife world. His tricks police are killed by Sheffer, but Sheffer goes to the graveyard called Midian Cemetery, where Nightbreed collects and lives underground. <br /> <br /> Sheffer has also left her girlfriend Anne Bobby, who still has feelings for her even after killing and is now one undead. He tries to be a bridge to humanity in his small ways. <br /> <br /> The creatures of Clive Barker are pretty tough to watch and not particularly appealing to humans. But it's clear that when people leave them alone, they don't worry about them at night. <br /> <br /> Your sympathies are definitely a nightmare, especially after you see a fanatic like Cronenberg and Chief of Police Charles Haid. For some time now, Clive Barker has been a homosexual man and some have told me that there is a metaphor for homosexual people at night. I see where it would be, especially since there are many people who don't even think of gays as people because they are taught so. <br /> <br /> The nightingale is quite bloody with a lot of free violence, but it also makes you think and I like the way Clive Barker, in turn, changes the head of traditional theology and makes Craig Sheffer a mess for nightlife.
