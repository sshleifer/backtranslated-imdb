I saw this movie years ago, I tried to find it, but maybe it's hard to find it anywhere. It was so esoteric, and another handful of movies that would stay with you for a long time. I'm still not sure what the reality of the film is, and maybe, like the principle of uncertainty, uncertainty is a definite thing. Action is great, the atmosphere is always full of mindset, general melancholy, and yet, it's hard to marvel at the story. I rented it, thinking it was a science fiction (it was in a sci-fi section where it was completely misleading), but it is quite clear that it is not. Or horror or even intercourse. In fact, there is unanimous gratitude that the director took the courage to make a film for which there is probably no definite audience. I know some people have complained about the short role of Klaus Kinski, but I think it is very relevant - his limited exposure is critical to the mystery of this film.
