When you listen to Wen (Pod, God / Satan), you know what's going on with "Split". I found watching a movie under the influence of LSD helped me with fantastic editing of audio and video tags. The plot was important only from second to second. Hape helped communicate with the sounds of this masterpiece, the subconscious and the overall pace. Do not bother writing something about your perceptions ... This great independent challenge is not enough at the most raw, amateur level. I dare to make a film that can confuse my head and change the reality of visual art and the world. Not to mention the many realities that this person has not yet studied. I love Chris Shawi's vision. I also appreciate the Elis Merhige's texturing terrorist film "The Begotten".
