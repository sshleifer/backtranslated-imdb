Gary Busey's best results for a nicely flowing biography. Since he had a musical background, he was able to make his own songs and it really works. It's always good to see this good actor, Don Stroud (one of the crickets) and Charlie Martin Smith. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. Best performance = Gary Busey. Fortunately, Mr Busey was an Oscar candidate who lost Jon Voight's RECOMMENDATION. A relatively low-cost flick that doesn't disappoint, Mr. Holly with big songs. I hope it made a lot of dough. Busey was never popular for these reasons, but fortunately he has one big one in his pursuit.
