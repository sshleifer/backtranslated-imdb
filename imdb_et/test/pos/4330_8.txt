This is probably the second best of Death Wish movies. Death 5 is the best. <br /> <br /> Death Battle 3 reminds me of "West Side Story" with a new twist. Even the recent flick "New York Gangs" cannot measure one of New York's neighborhoods in Death Wish 3, which was not plagued by two rival gangs - just one big gang. Gang, who is ready to do things that cut a person to death with an ax when he breaks his set. <br /> <br /> Deborah Raffin, who is a public defender, plays gently in this action pack full of many violence-up-ups. So, like Geri Nichols in Death Wish II, the Death Wish III score with delicate, romantic moments and violent moments. Only James Bond's love-interest scenes would do much better. <br /> <br /> And in addition to 38, Kersee plays Wildey .475 Magnum with this new weapon. It reminded me of Dirty Harry's films when Callahan used his .44 Magnum in the Magnum Force, Sudden Impact and Dirty Harry. Wildey's weapon packs a big punch and when Kersey kills it, he doesn't care if the gun is big. <br /> <br /> And this anti-attack missile that killed the main gang leader? Well, that's something. Kersey would not use his usual vigilant weapon as a reluctant rocket that is too military for him.
