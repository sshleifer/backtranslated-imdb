I haven't written a review here at this age, but all the TV shows, live shows, and I felt like I had to make my movie about my movie! I feel it's a perfect comedy movie. It is not a beloved dwarf story (I wouldn't want Gina Carbonara to love you for the enrichment of the rich? Is she or naked, who's naked ... does not love it), which other comedies go from good to shit, this is not the usual dilemma that needs to be overcome in most other comedy movies ... if you don't think they poisoned guests and have to flee visitors as a green vomit like a dilemma similar to other comedy films ..... No, this movie only presents one thing and only one thing: one laugh. What does Comedy Films Require? Laughter. This movie just laughs after a laugh, without laughing to fill a serious mess like other comedy films! So I still call it a perfect comedy movie and I never stop watching this beautiful movie! I drove such a fantastic gene and I'm talking.
