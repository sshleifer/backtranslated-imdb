Project A II is a classic Jackie Chan movie with all kung fu, crazy stunts and slapstick humor. Not as good as the prequel, but still it's a great movie if you want to see something fun. The story is simple, jackie chan versus evil men. So if you want a movie that you don't have to be a braniak to understand, I would recommend it.
