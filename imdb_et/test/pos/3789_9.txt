Given all the comedies with the military situation in history, someone had to be the first. It may be that Charlie Chaplin's genre was invented by shoulder guns. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that this was a bold step at that time. If you think some of the best films that people like Bob Hope, Abbott & Costello, Laurel & Hardy were involved in military service and made during the war, it's just something you take and laugh at. <br /> <br /> During World War I, Chaplin along with other characters Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford went on race trips. He was a great ally cause, unusual when somebody sees his left view. It seems only natural that the tramp has been developed and, regrettably, will be shaken and destroyed. <br /> <br /> Many of the things you would see in World War II Service Committees began with the arms. There were no more imitators in Chaplin, because a few weeks after the movie was released, the war was over. <br /> <br /> But the greatest comedy in the genius was the comedy art form.
