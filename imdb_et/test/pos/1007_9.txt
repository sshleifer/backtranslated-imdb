I'm a big fan of Harald Zwart and I knew I had to see this movie, although I can't say I'm a fan of football. But watching it filled my heart with joy and I had a great time watching movies. <br /> <br /> Bj√∏rn Fast Nagell does a tremendous job of managing this movie, and even if you notice that the main characters are new, when they act, they grow with the film and do what it is. Although it should be a football movie, it has surprisingly little football. The whole idea is to show six men who make up the word N O R W A Y, playing football this year in Germany. <br /> <br /> If you see only one Norwegian movie this year, this is one.
