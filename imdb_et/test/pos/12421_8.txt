It's a surprisingly big low budget horror / comedy, it's funny and pretty well done, with good shows and really cool twists! All the characters are pretty cool and the story is very good, plus Eric Jungmann (Adam) and Justin Urich (Harley) were together with fantastic chemistry. One of the funniest moments of the movie is when Adam is stuck in the bathroom and Harley wakes up to find a monster truck sitting there and decides to enter the truck and Aimee Brooks is just sexy! , plus this is one of the best low budget horror movies I've seen for a long time. It's very funny, but comic, and I thought it was very well written, plus Michael Bailey Smith is fantastic as Monster Man and he had some divine makeup! It is similar to movies such as Joy Ride, Duel, Jeepers Creepers, etc., and it also has some tense moments here and the plus effects are usually very well done. It is a surprisingly big low budget horror / comedy, it's funny and pretty well done, with good performances and really cool twists and turns, I highly recommend it! The direction is very good!. Michael Davis is doing great! working here with great camera work, good angles, good use of colors and great setting, and he kept the movie funny and at a very fast pace. <br /> <br /> There are many gore! . We get extremely bloody nosebleeds, gory impaling, bloody stabbings, the boy is cut by the monster truck, the person stays cooked stewed, guts all over, boys dare to fall off, pencil eyes, bloody slit throat, a number of people who walk without limbs, dead squirrel , head is split, carcasses, blood and mangled corpses, proper bloodshed, one very gentle scene at the end and more! <br /> <br /> Action is very good for a low budget movie. Eric Jungmann is fantastic here as Adam, he was a nerd, but very pleasant, he had a fantastic chemistry with Justin Urich, he had some cool features, and I just loved his character, it seemed that he enjoys himself and he was especially happy. good at the end!. Justin Urich is the best friend but I just couldn't love him because he was very funny and often stole a lot of scenes, I dug him! Aimee Brooks is proud and did what she was supposed to do, she was good at chemistry with Jungman, and as Jungmann was particularly good at the end, because I loved her mysterious character. Michael Bailey Smith is great because Monster Man, with a very horrible view, was a nice makeup and is now one of my favorite slashers! The rest of the cast is fine. <br /> <br /> Generally recommend it! *** 1/2 out of five
