I saw this movie with the hope of a good laugh, but when I watched it, I didn't stop laughing for weeks, they were so bad actors and it made this movie so much more fun to watch. (BTW Ryan Dunn didn't eat a toy car, he pulled it to his ass). Random performances by competitors and parts of Vitos were great. Give some grapes a Vito! No Light, your grapes are in the shop. I wouldn't recommend looking at anyone under the age of 13; honestly, they wouldn't understand half of the jokes or what they're talking about. I love VLB and after watching this movie I couldn't buy it or Viva La Bami series. What is this stupid commentary about? It must be 10 lines, what is Bull-sh1t? I should be able to write one for as long or in this case as short as I want. I'm just writing until it tells me I can actually send it. A waste of time, I assumed I was just saying what I wanted, it wasn't too much, but then I say I have to put more and then fix my spell so if I don't write something right, you get it what I mean. It is ridiculously long. <br /> <br /> ~ Those who live by the sword will shoot those who are not ~
