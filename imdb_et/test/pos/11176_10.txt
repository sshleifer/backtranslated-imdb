What can I say? The Monkey Island Curse is fantastic. The story is good and confident, but foolishly appropriately, jokes are conscientious, puzzles are puzzling ... no more in the adventure game. "You don't need to see my identification" is a bit worth playing to talk about, not to mention Murray, who has become a hot topic for many of my friends (only a few of them have played). You love this game. And if you don't, it's too bad!
