What can I say? The little boy has always been very fond of the following ... giant robots, giant monsters and attacking, megalomaniac pencils and this movie. As an adult, it's easy to prove the many mistakes of this movie and say it's really just a series of episodes taken from a children's TV series. Nevertheless, I find that the end is very moving and the content is surprisingly adult. Huge fun when sometimes a little pointless.
