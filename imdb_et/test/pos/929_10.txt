This is my favorite movie because there is so much that you don't see at first and so many things that make you think "Does Kieslowski mean it or is it with my head?" For example - is the judge intended to be God or an ultimate creature? <br /> <br /> Also, Irene Jacob, as Veronique's double life, is outstanding, may be some superficially beautiful actors, but none of them can convey the beauty of the Spirit through the physical beauty of how she does it. <br /> <br /> Triting is also great, saying a lot and many things he says are great, like his response to Valentine. . . "Ole".
