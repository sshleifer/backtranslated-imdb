Hello To view the entire plot surrounding the "OZ", simply look at the IMDb to find it. <br /> <br /> ** WARNING SPOILERS BY THIS REVIEW! shows a small bit. The American prison system, but I have to say (looking for detection channels over the program prison), it is not really realistic. <br /> <br /> Although I have to say, not shy, rape, felting happens sharing. However, it is television, so for you who think it is realistic, it is right for you. <br /> <br /> There's a good level of violence and some of the scenes here and there (plot over the plot) can be pretty boring. But remember that the series is now almost ancient. So times change too, I believe I should appreciate it when it came out. <br /> <br /> Since the season was up to 5, it was pretty good! Up to one disadvantage wins $ 2 million lottery ticket because he talked to God, he hit me as "this is the point I don't want to see this series" And now I just saw the 6th season episode 3. That was when grain gets his brain zapped and then his "mother" keeps him after he's descending. Then you see how O Reilly cries as he saw it (RL BROTHERS). Now this is the best scene in the whole "OZ" series, which was real for me! Still not reading this lie, which I am trying to capture and burn. It's a really good series! And even now it's worth checking out 2010! I'll give him 7 because the season that is seasonally weakening. But still a golden glove.
