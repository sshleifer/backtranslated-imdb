With the help of "Anatomy", German filmmakers have tried something completely new. Usually only drama or comedy movies - horror's genre is (or was) brand new at that time. <br /> <br /> The story is also new and shocking. Franka Potente plays her role perfectly and I do not want you to find who is a murderer. This is possible but difficult. A really great movie with many talented actors.
