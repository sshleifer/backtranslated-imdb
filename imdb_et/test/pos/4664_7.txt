The firm direction of Gary Gray is that "Italian work" will never be lost if she is cool and fun. Although the material is around and on average, the film itself is masterfully executed and satisfactorily good. Tone could easily be much more difficult, given the signs of murder revenge, but F. Gary Gray keeps tone light with good humor, spooky dialogue, and pulsating music. It is a joy to see that these bad guys form a great bond and remain against each other through fraud and murders, never forgetting fun. That's 7/10.
