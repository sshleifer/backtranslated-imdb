De Gr√∏nne slagtere or The Green Butchers, as it is called in English, is a very dark comedy about two losers working with a popular butcher. They are fed up with criticism from their bosses and decide to start a business independently. Their store is expensive and it doesn't even have electricity all over the place. And, to make things worse, they don't have any customers (as their former boss predicted). When a man pays a visit to his shop, he denies them the opportunity to arrange the meat of his dinner party. <br /> <br /> When a tragic accident happens. One of the butchers locks the electrician into the freezing chamber when he closes the shop. The man dies and the neurotic one of the two butchers decides to cut the fillet from the electrician's thigh and serves it to the dinner party instead of calling the police. This is an incredible success. All the villagers want to season this unbelievable "chicken". Because of his unexpected success, the butcher sees no other option but to kill more people he can sell chicken. <br /> <br /> I think no one can enjoy this topic, especially not because it is showing a lot of humor. I liked it much personally. This is a perfect indication of how far some people want social acceptance and separation. It may seem a bit far removed, but I'm sure you would be surprised to see how people in real life sometimes operate. <br /> <br /> Besides the original theme, I was also satisfied with the participants. performances and humor. It is not superfluous, as you might expect in such films, it is all very sober and realistic (I think it is typical for Scandinavian and Scandinavian films). Same for humor. I'm sure I wouldn't have wanted it as much as I did when humor had been up, or how much nose, vomiting ... as you see so often in American films. I loved this movie and give it 8/10.
