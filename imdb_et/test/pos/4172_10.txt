The insignificant music of the symbolism, this film soon shattered the expectations of the target group. These monkeys, and of course the members of the selected group, saw their faces finely, kissing each other well. Today's message is really a cage to escape from, and the bridge you want to jump is the next generation's frustrations, there are always new kids in the block who replace those who get rid of the chain. The film can sometimes be frustrating because the themes that the film attacks on the American lifestyle are a mindless and thoughtful person who cannot help but look at their reflections in Head scenes and not only ask their personal motives to continue the madness of American everyday life, but the motives of those who want to continue this madness. The final scene, similar to the Battle of Don Quixote Military Tigers, is how most dreams are misleading and impossible.
