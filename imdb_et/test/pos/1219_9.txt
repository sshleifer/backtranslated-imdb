True love, I truly enjoyed and loved this movie. It was fun, funny and inspiring. I just saw it on a DVD. How I touched it is the winner! I mean, Flex was "That Guy." I wanted to marry her. It was my first time seeing him as a straight leading man and pulling it away. I thought Tangi Miller was the best and I was also the leader of Felicity. A terrible woman who only fears her Nana. Thank you for giving us a choice of colors and looking good! Tasha Smith was a blast! Aloma Wright was invaluable as Nana. This lovely romantic comedy is "A Black See". Oh and the new comer Marcus Patrick deserves surprise ladies ... True Love. Karen
