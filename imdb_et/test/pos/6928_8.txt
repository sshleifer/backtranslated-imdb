First I thought this film was annoying. It was as if I had seen this movie before. Disappointed hero, father figure and 9-year-old sister who is older and smarter than her years (see Gregory's girl), but then not for 15 minutes, she could laugh out loud, comic pearl from the movie. Dylan Moran (whom I thought was just a mistake) was great. Like Mr Gambon and the crazy Scottish hitman. Lena Headey was extremely sexy. I tried to remember half of the movie where I saw him before. Release Officer. He has the most amazing smile. But a clear movie hero is Mr Caine. This man should do a lot of comedy. This is alongside some of his best comedy roles (without confusion, dirty rotten). He is glad to watch all his scenes, but especially to the end. <br /> <br /> Nobody can say that Michael ** can do it. <br /> <br />
