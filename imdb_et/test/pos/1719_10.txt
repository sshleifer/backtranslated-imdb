I have some Dr. Who's older videos and DVDs. I've played them over and over again. I adore all "doctors" for various reasons. But because of a man in the BBC hierarchy, Dr was still one of the basics of the BBC lineup. When Sylvester McCoy left, the doctor survived through the fans. The BBC was happy to provide fans with books and cartoons. Dr Whoi's momentum has persisted even after 1989. Then they took the opportunity with Paul McGann. The film was wrong but gave the BBC an idea of ​​what we wanted. In 1999, the "man" had disappeared and beginners at the BBC felt it was time to bring the doctor back. It was a complete success. Here in America, the Sci-fi channel took the opportunity and has become a success, although writers had to start and explain Dr Who's mythology to new viewers. For me it is incredible that they have done so. In season 1, looking at Christopher Eccleston with Russell T. Davis as lead editor and Phil Collinson as a producer, the doctor has come back to us and we can find out more about who the doctor is for each episode. The Doctor Who universe has always been "choice", "love", and "sacrifice." That's what they offered. That would make me more willing and sad that Mr Eccleston has decided to leave the show. My first doctor was a doctor. 3, Doctor Jon Pertwee. Mr. Eccleston does not have to worry about his position on dr. It's as strong as the rest. He's a 9th doctor. I didn't know Mr. Eccleston before he was dr. I wish there would be some way, he knew that dr. In the Who community of fans, they have been forced out to find their second job and enjoy it. We have already seen that he is a great actor.
