I loved this movie well, loved the romance with COlby and the girl ... Rachel (?) 4 I forgot her name .... I was just interested in them. I loved them in the movie I want to see more movies. but please no longer be a sad end where they can't be 2gether! = (it made me cry, but romance between them. The plot trauma was all very good.)) I was just Colby and Rachel. ha ha =) everything about this movie was exciting to keep your seat glued. because I'm sure. To be honest, my only personal desire would be to focus on a pair (Colby and Rachel) and at least a decent finish. I hated the end, it might have been better to think, not to force COlby's death and Rachel's son. The end would have killed the movie.
