I had only written one review of IMDb before, because I think most of the games are valuable in time and effort ... The curse of the monkey island is different. <br /> <br /> Monkey 1 played and impressed and 2, I had great expectations of the third release ... and wasn't disappointed. The first thing that hit me was much better graphics. Don't do it wrong, for the games made in 1990 and 1991, Monkey 1 and 2 were groundbreaking and offered the goods well, but CMI stepped up and offers an excellent cartoon style game that is both fun and satisfying. All scenes and settings are carefully designed and thought-out and are ideal for games of this type. Animation / CGI is a mixture of reality and exaggeration; a fantastic combination in this case. <br /> <br /> For me, the script has been crucial to the success of the previous two games. The CMI script is smart, relevant and above all completely fun. In addition, the script is sound different from the previous two, where the call is displayed in the text format at the bottom of the screen. The voice of Dominic Armato is ideal for Guybrush: witty, clear and a bit naive. All other talents of votes are perfect for their characters, especially Earl Boen, who is behind the LeChuck. I loved one character of each game: not only their personalities and wit, but the way each character is perfectly and specially animated. Although sound effects are concerned, it is worth mentioning the soundtrack. Monkey 1 and 2 soundtracks were both monotonous and nevertheless they were very effective in giving the atmosphere and changing the mood. The CMI soundtrack is a step again. Each scene is complemented by memorable, subtle, playful and pirated (if it is a word). By changing settings or moods, music also adapts to the entertainment and entertainment the game offers. <br /> <br /> Monkey Island's idea is to solve puzzles and problems to progress. It may seem easy, but in many places it is actually horrible. Some may be downgraded from the logic and the level of thinking that goes to Monkey Island, but in fact it makes the game even more fun and fun and adds a repeat value. The possibility of "monkey arch curse" or "monkey island passion: mega-monkey" (which includes more sophisticated and rich puzzles) is suitable for players with all abilities and also provides a good opportunity to play at least twice. Regardless of the level of difficulty you choose, each time you play a second game with lots of speech choices and other solved puzzles that do not affect the game's result, it is just a fun game. The most fun part of the game is fighting the ships and "fighting" the sword that follows. They were particularly well thought out and make the game completely valuable. Add to it an amazing story that is non-violent and suitable for all ages that will keep you busy and want more to the end. <br /> <br /> Finally, a uniquely special note must go to designers for this game. The way in which every complex puzzle and problem is thinking is simply amazing. While collecting items and objects during games, you cannot see how everyone can help you make progress, but do not represent a lot of thinking and determination, and that CMI designers need to be very commendable. br /> <br /> is the best game I've ever played (not exaggeration)
