The ruthless evil warlord Samanosuke (who played perfectly on Yutaro Gom's hateful shore) is cruelly threatening the peaceful inhabitants of a small village. The giant stone statue of Majin finally comes to life to destroy Samanosuke and his evil minions. Director Kimiyoshi Yasudo and screenwriter Tetsuro Yoshida give a convincing story of the legacy and simplicity of the legendary legendary folklore of ancient times: there is a very strong sense of ancient and distant distance (specially designated in feudal Japan), good guys are noble and tempting, while the villains are really disgusting and the disdainful, occasionally disturbing sword races are staged with remarkable skill and joy, special effects are subtle and impressive, a serious tone and a steady pace do not turn for a moment, and Majin's last scraper of wild destruction is extremely lively, exciting and more than a little scary. What's more, the fantastic elements of narrative provide significant credibility if they are firmly grounded in an incredibly dark, harsh and sharp world. This film earns bonus points, depicting Majin's portrayal of a more cruel and frightening angry wrestling force instead of an absolute good spirit. The veteran composer Akira Ifukube is a traditionally rich, powerful and striking result. Fujio Morita's sharp, moody cinematography also hits the bull's eye. Anyone capable of pouring will give an admirable and sincere impression, especially the commendable work of Jun Fujimaki as brave, protective Kogentai and Tatsuo Endo, who means he is a bunch of Gunjuro. Highly recommended.
