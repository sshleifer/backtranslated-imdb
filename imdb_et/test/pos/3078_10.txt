I love this movie! I know some people might say it's not a great movie, but I don't agree. Comedy is a classic Mel Brooks style and the actors were perfectly chosen. It was my first contact with Cary Elwes and Dave Chappelle, and what was the first impression they did. Cary Elwes shines with Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood. He has a great comic timing and the right attitude to this type of film. Dave Chappelle is obviously much bigger now, but at that time it was her first film and she did a great job with Achoo. The characters were all very well planned, and everyone added their small quizzes to the movie. I suggest you rent this movie and enjoy it with a nice popcorn and some close friends.
