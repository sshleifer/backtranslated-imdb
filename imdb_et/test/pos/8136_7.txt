No, it's not Ed Wood movie. "Angora Love" is the last silent movie by Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. End of the era! â€œIn the 20s, Laurel & Hardy has left a real mark on the silent film genre, whose films are still popular and are being regularly monitored and inspired today. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that this film is not the best among them. <br /> <br /> The premise of the movie sounds good and is good. This time boys are a goat, which of course brings them to trouble and some fun situations for us. At the same time, however, it is extremely foolish and simply unbelievable to look at boys' comedies with a goat. Most movie jokes still work well, but the film is never really fun or memorable. Comedy and story are still sometimes lacking and are usually too simple and predictable. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is good enough and fun to watch the fans, but still a bit disappointed with the last silent Laurel & Hardy record. <br /> <br /> 7/10
