I saw this movie at the Seattle International Film Festival, and a full-featured Indian-style filmmaker. The film is amazingly beautiful and smooth for the first movie. The direction is self-confident, especially for the locals who were recruited to fly parts of extras and bits. Although the plot and story are essentially non-existent, the joy of watching performances and landscapes compensates for lack. The soundtrack of this film is a great attraction for the world's music students. If you want to see what can be done in 45 days, where there is a different place every day, see Hari Om for inspiration. It wasn't published in Q&A, but I imagine that Hollywood could learn from this director by learning from this film artist.
