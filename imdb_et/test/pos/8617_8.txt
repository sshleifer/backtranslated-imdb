This film was very interesting to me, in a movie, a very strange director who convinces the actor and the actor (who do not like each other) in the film. The director is facing obstacles because he is trying to get two people to play the film beautifully. Sex is comedy much more than comedy, full of uncomfortable moments that also affect the psychological and innate behavior of men and women with sometimes contradictory sex. I loved this movie, which is characterized by beautiful Anne Parillaud. Jeanne plays great on the screen when you share her struggle to create cinema.
