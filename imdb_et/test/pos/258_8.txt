Signing in to imdb to say what a charming movie Love Love is and I'm totally confused. It seems to me that someone has mixed their headlines. "Plastic demon baby" what? It wasn't Love Life. Little luvy dovey to my taste, but a great, funny and original movie. Particularly like the end that did not fall into the usual clich√©s that all Hollywood romantic films collapsed and burned. Nine out of ten.
