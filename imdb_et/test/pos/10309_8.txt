In 2005, I saw the Queen of Bandit over a decade after it was in the midst of India's widespread contradiction. The language, harsh treatment, and natural action (relatively unknown at that time) could have been even more shocking at this time in the fantasy cinema for the more sensitive Indian population. Film, Cast, and Shekhar Kapoor deserve prizes for breakthrough efforts. <br /> <br /> The plot does not differ from a typical revenge drama made in India from different forms. In fact, there have been many fancy accounts about this story itself. The reason it stands out is that it should be the first person to really go through all this, and much more that can't find a place on the screen, and lived to tell the story. Lived long enough to see her story at least as a movie. Phoolan Devi did not live in prison for a long time after being released from prison in 1994. <br /> <br /> The movie has several results. Cinematic art is brilliant. Music is right. Cast, many of whom became more familiar later, is very good. However, the scenario is uneven. Things move from time to time too fast and pulling. This is understandable, because there are too many directions that need to be linked to make it all coherent. Or maybe I felt it because I read a book by Mala Sen that is more detailed and better, though obviously not as shocking as visual, to Phoolan Devi's travail, and which is said to be one of the main sources of the film. <br /> <br /> Also some factual ambiguities. According to Phoolan Devi, he was not present at the time of the Behmai massacre, and despite being a Phoolan dictated account, he shows that he is involved and actually initiates a massacre. Then the last scene where the handing over of Phoolan shows that he touches the prime minister's footsteps has actually given up Mahatma Gandhi's portrait. Only symbolic value, but showing that Phoolan did not want to show servitude to a living, ordinary person. It would have been nice to show the Prime Minister that he is similar to Arjun Singh, who many remembered that it was Madhya Pradesh's CM. <br /> <br /> But these are small drops in this very well-made film, a rare pearl from the main film industry from India, made by a man who was the best masala movie of the late 80s - India India.
