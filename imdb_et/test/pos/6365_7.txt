Many people don't think Dan Aykroyd is funny. This movie proves otherwise. Aykroyd is great for providing one comedy in its comedy. The only big problem with this is that it wastes too much time to jump from Aykroyd's character to the doctor who turns to him to prove he is a scam. The doctor goes to the nut like doctor Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss) "What is Bob?". Scenes where the doctor desperately tries to come back to Los Angeles are stupid, unbelievable and uncomfortable. Other, this aspect of the film is really funny, especially the first half.
