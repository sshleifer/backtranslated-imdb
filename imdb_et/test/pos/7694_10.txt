I have always been a fan of the vastly invisible filming of this Gershwin Opera, since I saw it last in 1959. As many of you know, it's not available on video or DVD; in fact, the Gershwin family tried to destroy all existing prints. <br /> <br /> But the Gershwin family recently approved the display of the museum collection for printing for some reason - in the hope that it will end the opposition. Image Image of Astorias, Queens. Well, widescreen, Technicolor's print was great! (Not perfect, but great.) The sound was outstanding, showing a high quality stereo. People who saw it in the original edition would not have seen much better copies. (The program notes contain an initial overview of the varieties, which warns that people may stay at a price of $ 3.50 for a limited release ticket!) <br /> <br /> As much as I originally loved, PORGY AND BESS was better than I remembered that. It's just wonderful. Sidney Poitier as Porgy was at the moment when his career began to come, and his charisma is out. Dorothy Dandridge as Bess is wonderfully beautiful. Brock Peters as Crown is aggressively masculine. Pearl Bailey as Maria offers some comics, although her role is small. And Sammy Davis, Jr. as a sport, steals every scene it has; she has been particularly rotten in her two big numbers: "It is not necessarily so" and "There is a boat that will soon be Leavin in New York." (The latter won the appeal I saw.) <br /> <br /> PORGY AND BESS are set to be tied, but this is not really important if the kit is as proud as it is. Costumes are also outstanding. <br /> <br /> Sidney and Dorothy's song games are dubbed, but they are very well dubbed. Fine "Summertime" sings Clara, played by young Diahann Carroll; his singing is also dubbed. (In fact, only Pearl and Sammy make their voices.) <br /> <br /> Of course, the music is sublime, but what really hit me this time was how much emotion the Preminger story came out of. People pulled in the audience several times - when Bess sings this beautiful "I Loves You Porgy". And I got hit by an audience who actually smiled loudly on the lines "It's not necessarily so." Could it be that they never heard the song before - never heard of it? I believe that much of the emotional impact of this film is due to Poiter's and Dandridge's performances - you are driving for your love to win. <br /> <br /> Little beating with 136 minutes of work - one or two slow places and a stereotypical, Amos-n-Andy-type scene that saw Bess to see Shyster's lawyer to get a divorce from Crown, though he's not even married to him. (I would have reduced it.) And the start is a bit confusing - both headline characters are uncomfortable - they are part of the movie before you understand who they are. <br /> <br /> And I don't think Preminger used any close-up pictures in the film. Everything seems to have been shot at 3/4, which I think he was working on a wide screen. <br /> <br /> PORGY AND BESS has always been a cult film for those who saw it, the one who loved the soundtrack, and some of us who have just heard of it. We hope they will find ways to release it and put it on the DVD. It deserves the greatest possible audience.
