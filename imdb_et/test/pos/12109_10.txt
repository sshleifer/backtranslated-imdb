This is a movie about the music that is currently being played in Istanbul. Istanbul was the center of the two great powers of the old world, the Byzantine Empire and the Ottoman Empire. Today it is almost 10 million megalopols. So it is no surprise that there are a lot of music in Istanbul that has many different voices, styles and effects all over the world. Of course this is Turkish music and I was interested in Turkish music because I bought my first record for a long time. The film includes various singers, instrumentalists and bands. The comments made by musicians illustrate nicely the music and contemporary Turkish social context. In my opinion, the most interesting comments were from Orhan Gencebay. In addition, the films mainly show the urban landscape of Istanbul, which is very pleasant to watch. <br /> <br /> "Bridge Overrun" is listed as a documentary film and includes minority music, e.g. Deaf and Roma. Other important topics have been excluded, such as Turkish jazz or Armenian and Greek music. <br /> <br /> This film is recommended for lovers of music and culture in Turkey, the Balkans, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East. It may also be useful for those who are very interested in the global impact of musical styles such as Rock and Roll or Hip Hop.
