I watched this movie yesterday from my office with a 20-year-old intern (OK - it was a quiet day after Thanksgiving) and we both loved it. I love the unique plot, David Duchovny, David Allen Greer and how the dog is waiting in front of the door. Are we not part of any of us like this dog when we love to die? <br /> <br /> I also love old people in the restaurant - they remind me of an older person around southern England, where your ethnic group is a very important topic of discussion. And I love the end of the wedding. <br /> <br /> The Minnie driver is great in this movie - and Bonnie Hunt should have won everything. <br /> <br /> Bonnie - Make More Movies!
