Okay, maybe this movie is not a revolution. But this is a very good entertainment and it is a variation of Liv Tyler's Alicia Silverstone's "Clueless" or Cameron Diaz's "Earth Has Something Mary's". <br /> <br /> Sand plays femme fatale that just wants to be in its house and any material comfort in it. And he does everything to get that ... even crimes. Many crimes. And he falls for all the guys who don't do these things. In addition, he doesn't want to have some other lovers next to his current boyfriend. <br /> <br /> This movie is even funny to see if Liv is really under zodiac cancer and cancer. be very homey. So here's the Liv parody of the Liv character. <br /> <br /> I was alone in the cinema when I watched it. It was quite convenient because I could laugh as loudly as I wanted all the time, but it also seemed strange as if someone didn't really care about the movie? <br /> <br /> I really liked it. The action was very good and excellent, especially the main actors who were great. Where there are enough jokes, many black styles and good dialogues. <br /> <br /> This is a trash film full of black humor. If you like such a movie, try it!
