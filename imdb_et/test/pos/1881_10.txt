Usually I don't look over the net, but it's Saturday and I'm trapped in my room, on a rainy day where there's nothing to do, but to watch sci-fi movies and Xena: Warrior Princess (I can't get fucking Joxer's Mighty song from my head, this has been there for the last ten years, just appearing randomly when someone (i) does something idiotic). If you have complaints about this movie and are actually posting on the Internet, do you have any idea how much the idiot looks like? If you expect more from Bruce Campbell than what he puts out (in the most literal sense), why do you watch G in his holy films? Nobody looks at Bruce Campbell's movie if they want to see something genius and understandable, let's look at them so we feel better (like the people who watch Jerry Springer and eat Chunky Monkey) and the entertaining psycho bomb. I personally love Bruce Campbell's movies. I'm not a complete idiot, I actually see myself as an intellectual and a scientist (haha, shut, Ally). His films reflect crazy, casual, peculiar, ridiculous ideals that can be enjoyed by anyone with a brain, screaming or not. That and he was sexy Xena: Warrior Princess, even facial hair. I appreciate this movie with an excellent 10, just because I get it. If you can't take the simpler plot schemes (if any), then in the sci-fi glory (leather, spandex) and acquaintances, if you have not exhausted the views with enthusiasm, then choose, don't look at the movie (or any mention of the name Bruce) Campbell). Oh yes, Ted Raimi was fantastic in this movie! Ted! You did the best you had. ;
