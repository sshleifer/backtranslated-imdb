Dead or Alive: Final, a film that allegedly brings together three dead or alive trilogy and is mainly related to its characters, Riki Takeiuch and Sho Aikawa, and that every film has some of the bizarre-world games and neuroses, and the heap of violence is undoubtedly the weakest part of the batch. The fact that none of the three films is disappointing is less evidence of the creativity of the material, but of the pound-for-pound guts taken by director Takashi Miike with the surrounding environment and material. Here he presents openly the dystopian future, but with a low key, where the homosexual mayor / dictator (Richard Chen) is the whole village drug, except the rebel group. There are also replicator-robots in 2346 - one of them is Ryo (Aikawa), a full-blown robot, but also the ability to love and learn and so on. Then the policeman Takeshi (Takeiuchi) mayor is the top guard. But things start to unravel on both sides, Ryo with his employer with the rebels and Takesh, although the bad enemies wetted with blood like hostage compromise went bad and Takeshi revealed that his wife and son are robots (not made) Alien's mind, remember, suddenly as if the power had dropped) and that he himself was one. And all this leads to one of the last two unexplained showdowns between two men. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, there is another movie where Miike is here with vertices and valleys, sometimes finding that the center of success is of no relevance to scientific literature. But nothing comes from this nature except that the mayor / dictator is a dingbat who does not have a backlash, who gets his stones out to make sure that his pairing drugs get pregnant and that everything stays under control. He's a slave of his love with him, I guess the saxophone player was in a non-spoken part, who also doubles the person if he doesn't connect the moody blues. In the meantime, we get the usual sides of Ryole and the northwest of Takeshi and they are never uninteresting, just not convincing enough to keep them interested. Of course, Miike is no more fun than Takeshi plus Michelle (Maria Chen) with water so that he can swim after the mayor's attempt at the mayor, or if he is at first a rebel leader who does not speak good English at all. Even at the beginning of the film, there is even playful respect for old sci-fi cartoons. But there is nothing very persuasive, except for Takeshi's small turns, which become "good" in the middle of the film (helping one couple to get the baby), and mostly Miike's strengths this time purely stylistically and the choice of places and sets. <br /> <br /> It's like grungy Japanese Alphaville, where everyone has a modern feel through all the special effects. And I really liked the yellow-green tone Miike used through the film, because it worked very well outdoors and simply added sufficiency to indoor scenes. However, as with tops and valleys, we see this increasingly clearly - and the level of the visual effects of the sci-fi movie channel, maybe a few more dollars at this peak. It includes some of the funniest materials that the director has in the most delicate, frustrated sensitivity, even if he has to start with unbearable power; The way in which Ryo and Takeshi finally meet is a sort of casual and simple tool by which manufacturers try to capture the last two films, if not needed. On the other hand, Miike, where one sees something completely unexpected and very harshly sexual, has a glorious entertaining value, ranks with the best scenes in Katakuri's happiness and visitor Q. or Alive: Final is a 90-minute cheesy effort that doesn't take too seriously and is even better for cultural events at the level of malevolent, militaristic degradation and cellulose.
