This is a great movie. I read the summary and it was impressive, but when I looked at it (mostly for Caroline Dhavernas), it grew on me. <br /> <br /> This is such a nice change to see a movie where girls / young women are not punished for their sexuality. Girls are given full permission to investigate and even have the chance to make mistakes if there are no ridiculous consequences. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are completely fun - and many of them are allegedly erotic scenes that were not up or uncomfortable. The male characters in the movie were excellent - David Boreanaz was great because it was an amazing hunk - and it's great that the movie doesn't hate us so much. The other two younger men also celebrated the good without being extremely expensive. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best films I've ever seen that girls are growing up and are quite capable of seeing how they perceive their mistakes but eventually come out and continue their lives rather than dragging their mistakes with them.
