People are often uncomfortable with the "Venetian merchant" because of their anti-Semitic theme. Fortunately, this film avoids it by choosing instead to show how anti-Semitism prevailed in the 16th century Europe. Of course, Antonio (Jeremy Irons) needs money to help Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) ask Portia (Lynn Collins) for a marriage. He receives money from a Jewish believer, Shylock (Al Pacino), who demands a pound of Antonio meat if the latter does not repay the loan. If Antonio is unable to repay the loan, Shylock has decided to owe it. <br /> <br /> We expect this service to do a good job and they won't disappoint. This is another sign of what great actor Al Pacino is.
