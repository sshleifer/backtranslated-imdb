With a great mastery of a low budget thriller with more turns than you can shake, and lots of haunting humor along the way. <br /> <br /> Casting plays it very well, though Richards himself a central film director is sometimes a little harder. Sir Alec Guinness's small two-scene camo, threatening to threaten Moscow's criminal tsar, is just the icing of the cake. <br /> <br /> Worth repeating, but not in the dark at night, when you're completely alone!
