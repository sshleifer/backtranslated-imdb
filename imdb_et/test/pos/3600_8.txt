"Capt. Corelli Mandolin" is an old-fashioned Hollywood romance, but sex and nudity, allegedly not American. The story takes place on the Greek island during World War II. The Italians get to the island, but under German supervision. There is a romantic triangle consisting of a Greek couple and an Italian captain. Nice presentation by all participants; The best job of Penelope Cruz is yet.
