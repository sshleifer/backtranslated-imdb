Not a movie enthusiast, I don't know the names of managers, script writers, manufacturers, etc., but when I see one, I can say an outstanding movie. <br /> <br /> The makers of this fine movie may now be at the top of their fields or maybe soon. I know the actors are already there. <br /> <br /> It takes the genius closer to show the realism of how the national tragedy, like Vietnam, has influenced the everyday life of the average American family and makes us see for the reason why there are so many homeless Vietnamese veterans. <br /> <br /> Without getting into gore and bloodshed scenes, it understands why so many men had a setback for what they had gone through. /> <br /> Dialogue is particularly engaging and gives us an idea of ​​what happened in so many families after Vietnam. <br /> <br /> I would like to see more of these movies, not just about Vietnam, but also about other social conditions.
