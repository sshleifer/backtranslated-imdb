From the first to the last scene, this film is made very realistically, even too realistically, that we sometimes do not see the night (detailed night) in the dark, in the desert (sunshine is as strong as in the real desert). <br /> <br /> The script and actor game is also very realistic. Photos and episodes are edited so that things and events are not "effectively" displayed, "explained", or - like many Hollywood films - for entertainment by viewers. Here is the editing to represent events as if they had actually happened in Afghanistan. The camera is sometimes far from deadly drunkards, even when the main character Major Bandura has been taken down and killed. <br /> <br /> This method reminds me of Italian masterpieces of neo-realism. And the structure of the story is based on the same principles as "Pais√†" or "Bicycle Thief" - chronological "real life" episodes and a series of pathetic moments that initially seem unexpected and illogical, but have internal causes. <br /> <br /> I think that the internal cause of Major Bandura's suicide attack is a religious emotion - a repentance for the death of innocent people (not just his casual killing in the family village, but also the death of the solder under his command. He hasn't been keen for this reason, his last decisions (go back to the destroyed village and return to the armed boy whose family he killed seem like repentance. <br /> <br /> Russian Orthodox Choir that sounds like the end of the night ("Evening Victim") is another context through which the whole movie can be seen from this point of view.
