"Cooley High" is one of my favorite films EVER !!! I think I saw this movie a year ago with my mother on TV when I was small and I thought it was so funny. This movie was also called "Black American Graffiti". Glynn Turman is wonderful because the preacher and Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs are great as a preacher friend at Cochise. There are other great signs in it, and this film has a lot of humor. From the beginning of the movie, when Cochis goes to Preach's home to prepare for school to end Cochise's funeral, this film is what makes you laugh. There are many scenes in this movie that I really like. The scene where Pooter (another of Preach and Cochise's friends) goes with the animal to the zoo and gets the gorilla faeces on his shirt (very tough but also funny), the first scene in the corner of the cafe, the quarter party in this girl's house that became a catastrophe, and some others are admiring. This film also features an excellent companion to a soundtrack album, packed with many great Motown hits and artists from the early 60s (only 6 songs on the soundtrack were made '75, the rest were 60s). The film is mainly about two friends dreaming of impoverished and harsh neighborhoods after high school, but their future seems almost inaccessible because their innocent joy rides in a stolen car, two other hoods are responsible and Preach's relationship with his girlfriend Brenda (played by Cynthia Davis) is almost in danger. Go out and rent or buy this movie and get ready for a comic entertainment load !!! Get a soundtrack. It's also fun!
