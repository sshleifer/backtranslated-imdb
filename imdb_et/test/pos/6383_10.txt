This movie shook !!!! I saw it every week. It is a strange story where James Franco plays the jerks who marry Sienna Miller to get out of the country and go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon. Don't want to give it away because the movie hasn't been published yet, but it's totally cool and you never expect what's going to happen. I thought I hated this romance, but also twisted and things I really like. The action is really good and Sienna Miller is totally smoky and plays this really sweet girl. I think he should do more such roles. James plays jerk, but you will end up with him and the end of the movie is really good. David Carradine plays cowboy and he's good. I gave this movie 10 because I really liked the movie and wanted to see it again, which I didn't expect and my girlfriend really liked and shouted. good date flick
