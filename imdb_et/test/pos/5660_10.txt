Finally, I managed to see this movie ... after so many years ... <br /> <br /> I was so curious to see if this movie was as bad as some people say. <br /> <br /> And my opinion is that this movie wasn't bad at all, on the contrary, it was AMAZING ... <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this second second ... from start to finish <br /> <br /> The participants were great when they sent me the feeling that I lived the story while the movie was playing ... <br /> <br /> Landscapes were so beautiful the movie was filmed ... and I liked it. Music was also extraordinary and I have nothing <br /> <br />. The plot was very original, I don't think I saw such a movie ... <br /> <br /> It's shameful that it's not recognized all over the world. There is no way to see it. I will give this movie 10/10
