The Sharky machine is a criminal drama committed in Atlanta in the early 1980s. It marks Burt Reynolds as a renegade policeman who is in his city for stopping crime and corruption. The story speaks of a black politician who has been kneeling around the neighborhoods in a crime scene. Sharky's link with the downgrading of this syndicate is the high-priced whore he covers during the film. The sequences are well done in the early 80s and the soundtrack / score is pretty good. It's a B-level, but it's a pretty decent movie that's in your DVD collection. <br /> <br /> General 7/10 <br /> <br /> Peace <br /> <br /> Buggieblade
