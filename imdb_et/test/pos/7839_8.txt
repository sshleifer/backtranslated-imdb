First of all I would like to start by saying that it is a refreshing start to see the British drama that eventually seems and seems plausible. <br /> <br /> Patrick Stewart plays a role in justice (Ian Hood), a government science adviser who has a steady and steadfast view of power and thoughts on the future of "real world" science, and how he feels it is either being used by others or abusive. <br /> <br /> Not only is casting fully maintained throughout the series, but it makes its characters more sensitive than most other British dramas. <br /> <br /> Ashley Jensen also offers first-rate performance as Dr. Hood's bodyguard (Rachael Young), brings refreshing science, ignorance, uninterested everyday life, and his constant struggle with Hood is made by some very funny and memorable moments between them. <br /> <br /> How the series keeps all the scientific elements more realistic. . <br /> <br /> With the series, however, there are considerable disappointments, every time the episode ends, I find myself disappointed that they did not see all aspects of the plot and sometimes leave open stories apart. Although we remember that it is still the first, I hope that we will see a return in the near future, where these open end results will finally give us an important conclusion that they deserve so correctly. <br /> <br /> For those who enjoy more slow-paced science-related plot features, this is the perfect show to look at because it can always remain credible and more important.
