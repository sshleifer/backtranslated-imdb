Last year was the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin's birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication "Origin of the species", which is why Jon Amiel's "Creation" was released. The film focuses on the time of Darwin's (Paul Bettany's) life when he wrote his famous work, and the mild burden he put on his family life. <br /> <br /> I think the film surpassed Darwin's tension over his religious wife, Emma (Jennifer Connelly) and her annoyed daughter Annie, but I still like to think about Darwin's theory, which works like a karate cone with a religious dog. The US was one of the last countries where "creation" was found to be a distributor by communism and evolutionary debate (yes, it is still ongoing). <br /> <br /> All in all, this is not a masterpiece, but I recommend it the same way I recommend "Inherit the Wind". I hope that one day there is no problem with the debate on creativity-evolution. If this film helps to rest in the discussion, then more power for all the film participants! Also starring Martha West, Jeremy Northam, Toby Jones and Benedict Cumberbatch.
