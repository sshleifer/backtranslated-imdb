I suspect that there are several pieces of this document. The copy I saw was largely focused on Joe's erotic films and referred to his outbursts of fear. The X-rated glory and the EMMANUELLE IN AMERICA legendary "sniffing" (with movie interruptions) feature numerous X-rated movies that provide an excellent display time. <br /> <br /> Interviews very pleasant Joe is informative and sincere. He is uncomfortable, expressive and discusses his interest in a shocking audience, why he wanted to mix eroticism and horror and how he could be responsible for one of his performers who turned to gay. <br /> <br /> His friendship and working relationship with the beauty of Indonesia, Laura Gemser, is being touched, as does her indifferent attitude towards shooting. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato personalizes the amazing time that has passed by Continental. It's nice to see a documentary dedicated to him and his exquisite, unique work. <br /> <br /> RIP, Joe.
