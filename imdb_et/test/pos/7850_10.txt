This film has some rather shocking scenes and subject matter in 1971. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood, Geraldine Page and Elizabeth Hartman are doing a great job in the movie, as are all cast members. /> <br /> The movie, set during the war, begins when the wounded Yankee soldier Johnny, represented by Clint Eastwood, is equipped and assisted by a girls' academy located in the south. <br /> <br /> The headmaster of the school, Mrs Farnsworth (Geraldine Page), one Edward-Edin teacher (Elizabeth Hartman) and a small group of half-grown girls have been in the middle of the people without too little. <Br>> <br /> Although their loyalty is in the confederacy - their emotions and physical needs will definitely lead in the opposite direction. Johnny immediately uses his masculine charms to try to win women on his side - and keep them from turning to patrolers. <br /> <br /> But the feelings that were previously the criminal, the adulterous father, the brutal rape, and the inexperience of the adolescents, with jealousy, turn things upside down, with unexpected consequences for both Johnny and the school population. <br /> <br /> 10 stars
