Oliver Stone, who is always ready to do politically-themed movies, makes another one here. "Talk Radio" is widely based on Alan Berg, a broadcasting server in Denver, who was murdered by white supremacists. In this case, the character is Barry Champlain (Eric Bogosian), the host of the speech at Dallasis, who doesn't love anything more than letting people call. Like most, most people who call are heaps. racists. And things can get hotter than anyone understands. <br /> <br /> Bogosia's presentation brings a light comic tone to an otherwise serious film. I really liked the scene where she smiles when she calls. Allowed, I would never call this Oliver Stone's greatest film ever, but it is a good reference in an age when the media is becoming more concentrated. Ellen Greene and Alec Baldwin also provide good help.
