Like most other reviewers, I enjoyed this TV ministry. I didn't see it when it first came out, but my grandfather - a big fan of secrets and war films - happened in 1989. I remember watching it in my grandparents' lounge one night and I was completely in the story! It is a very intriguing plot and a good combination of drama, romance and espionage. I've seen many movies set during World War II, but none like that! Fortunately, I was able to make a copy of the VHS movie several years ago. Since then, I've been watching it many times and still enjoying it. I love this movie on DVD. Chapters would be so much easier to watch.
