Everything about "Choose Connor" was the top = drawer, especially the script and the very good work of 21-year-old director, writer, producer Luke Eberl. . . gifted young man to expect great things. Everything was reliable, the dialogue was smart, the topic was important. We liked it !!! <br /> <br /> You saw it at the 2007 Woodstock Film Festival, where it is screened twice and went over the audience enormously. It's more than just an age movie - this child learns a hard, heartbreaking lesson from trust, politics, and "the system" - how things really fit into the personal agenda of powerful people in positions. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who has a working brain.
