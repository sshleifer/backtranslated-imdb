The film is never going to be the name of the Oscar forever, it is never the best film for the best show. But this movie doesn't have things that other movies don't do. With so many scandals, so many problems, films are little to think about the morality of society, at least this film promotes good. What's wrong with promoting something happy? We should support films that tell our American teenagers that life is more than sexual drugs and alcohol. As for Haka's debate, as has been said before, Hakka is not exclusive to all New Zealand's black, many Utah high school football teams and colleges will perform this ritual before the games. Including Hawaii, BYU, etc.
