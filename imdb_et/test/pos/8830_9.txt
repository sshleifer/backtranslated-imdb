For the first time, I heard this exhibition in 2005, first online and then watching (and of course buying) a typically BBC linked book. Then I got a DVD; it is not disappointed! I had hoped for years that someone would do a science fiction program that would emphasize the thrill of discovery rather than aliens, struggle with a laser gun, and other tricks of Hollywood boogie! Thank you, Joe Ahearne (also for your Dr. Who work and Ultraviolet - mini series; not the same name crap movie)! What forced me to write (2 years later) was that I just saw SUNSHINE last night. And what appeared to be in the same family as SPACE ODYSSEY (about 2/3 of the third) will meet Freddy Krueger in 2010! This was when SPACE ODYSSEY really showed a positive example of how to make a REAL science fiction film; more science, less fiction! ODYSSEY (like SUNSHINE) also dealt with astronaut deficiencies (Zoe's failed EVA, Ivan's efforts to Venus, mission controls) and completely dangerous to explore new planets with unknown dangers (lethal radiation beam on Mars). I would just have paid to see it in the theater (I-Max, anyone?). And all up, not only was the space field captivating beautiful, but also the characters. I found their interaction more realistically than SUNSHINE's Icarus 2 team (Icarus; sunset name) slamming histrionics - did anyone read Icarus ?? mythology? Sometimes it is not so good a film to watch a better movie. As a armchair astronaut, I would trade my Icarase icon in Pegasus. However, the visuality of SUNSHINE is quite stunning but quite memorable. That's why I was so deeply rooted that it would succeed honestly as a good sci-fi movie. So, while this review is almost a backdoor for SUNSHINE, I hope it reads what it was supposed to be; strong support for BBC TV, which succeeds where most large budgets, swelled cinematographic glasses do not work. SPACE ODYSSEY (a.k.a. VOYAGE TO PLANETS here in the country) creates fatigue, SCIENCE fiction and appetite. I also enjoyed the pseudo-documentary approach. Concerning pastime / speed of light, they are treated as you pay attention. When SUNSHINE melts, ODYSSEY keeps it cool. If you plan to go to SUNSHINE's second dose movies, stay here; Go to the right room instead of ODYSSEY!
