Looking at "Plots with a view" (the so-called "Betty Betty" in the US), I got the feeling that more should be filmed in Wales. It depicts a woman (Brenda Blethyn) in a small town in Wales trying to get her deceived husband. So, he and the head of the funeral department (Alfred Molina) are offering a plan ... but are likely to have some down the road. <br /> <br /> I would say that Christopher Walken's character is in the neatest film (how could he not be?). In general, the whole idea is really pure, setting some "uh oh" moments ... especially the scene of a haunted house. This is a film I wish I would enter, but also to experience it. <br /> <br /> Also starring Lee Evans, Naomi Watts and Miriam Margoyles.
