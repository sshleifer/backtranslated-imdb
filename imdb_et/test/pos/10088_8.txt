What can I say about this movie that doesn't give you any previews when you see it? Very little. The plot is related to the return of a teenage girl to hospital after her disintegration. This film follows. This is one of the toughest films in recent years. Everything in the movie is a bit off in the middle and leaves it feeling bad after the movie ends. It's not a perfect movie. The film has problems in the last six months that are already creating a confusing story, even confusion. (If you have read a number of other comments in IMDb and elsewhere, you know that a lot of time has been spent to open up what's really going on) I'm not sure what I'm really thinking about this movie, besides being scared of me and bothering me the best-known fear films ever. If you like horror, and don't forget that you don't have everything clearly summed up, I suggest that you try it because it is likely to make your skin crawl.
