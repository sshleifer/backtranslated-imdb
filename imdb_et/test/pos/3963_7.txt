This movie has something more in the genre: intelligence and good messages. Accepted, is a story about a child named Bartleby (Justin Long) who is rejected by every college. Her parents are incredibly strict, frustrated and disappointed. So, Bartleby and some other students who face similar problems will start a fake college to escape to their parents as college children. Not everything goes according to plan and the film is wings on them. But behind this ridiculous sound, there are good messages, morals and a new perspective on the American education system. The South Harmon Institute of Technology they accept will accept those who have not received it elsewhere. The message is that you don't need the "money, tradition, or fancy books" you just need to make yourself better. "they are a completely unusual school, but what the film teaches is that it is still OK and different (whether it is a person or a school) may not be bad and that everyone should not be given the opportunity to feel better - regardless they are "weird." its message is a mismatch and it also has anti-power traces. But not only are the messages big - its fun! haha ​​i was very laughing. humor can be fine but can also be a blatant and wonderful blend. be careful.
