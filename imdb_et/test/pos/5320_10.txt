Leland follows the story of Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling), an impatient teenager who has apparently murdered his brother-in-law, his brother. The question is not whether he did it or not? Leland Acknowledges That Now? rather, why. Interestingly, Leland becomes a character story, not a criminal drama, exploring why people do what they do? not necessarily the simplest land. <br /> <br /> And Leland has the required indie group of people who have been twisted. In addition to the title, there is also Pearl (Don Cheadle), who is her teacher at a juvenile correctional facility and who sees directly that Leland is different. We meet a distant and egotistical father of Leland (Kevin Spacey's extended chancellery) who does not feel emotionally confused about what his son did. But the real flavors come out when we dive into Pollards, a slowed-down family of a child. First, is Leland's girlfriend Becky (Jena Malone), a drug addict who can't keep her clean; his sister Julie (Michelle Williams), perhaps the most common person in the film, who just tries to get it all off; and Allen Harris (Chris Klein), a young man living with Pollards and being a Julie boy. Finally, there is Ryan (Michael Welch), whom all others call football, unable to communicate and hardly aware of their surroundings. from time to time too slow? penetrates everyone's life by asking the main question why people do what they do? Although Leland publicly discusses it in Pearl, it allows it to keep an eye on the good and bad and personal responsibility of all characters at any point in the film, where they have to make their own happiness or another, perhaps the most common choice a person can do it. The film looks well at these choices and their consequences. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, you just hit the depth of the pain. Spacey. Cheadle. Gosling. Michelle Williams. Even Chris Klein? these are people who tend to tend to raise any movie that is inside them and make them all together. For a room in the middle, the film seems to collapse, sputter if it opens; it will look for some time as if the content was only for asking questions and giving answers. But when we get home to stretch and the film begins to strike and come together, Leland becomes quietly a powerful cinematic. Leland's explanation of the world and his actions will eventually bring every story into focus and all the investments made in the film will pay off. <br /> <br /> Said Ryan Gosling is a wonderful sunny day is nice. At this point in your career is it redundant? it is one of the best young actresses working today and it is a pleasure to watch her craft that could have been an unlikely character. Gosling here uses the nuances that hardly seem to be acting; he must respond to most of the film against Don Cheadle whom we know is a commodity, and he not only keeps his own, he also raises the Cheadle game. Cheadle herself is in the ultimate form of absorbing Pearl with a completely rounded humanity? good and bad. Spacey is a kind of one-off character, but it's a character and it works great. All surprised by Chris Klein; acting on this level, I thought he was buried in the mix, but he still gives his career. Amazing work everywhere. <br /> <br /> Leland is a bit down and again it is mottled. However, it ends strongly and leaves the viewer with a lasting effect (in this case). The film also has a subtle comment on racism (Leland's first day in the classroom for juveniles, the only white person in the room), which, like many films, is very effectively handled. I don't go so far as to call it necessary to see it? some may find it too slow or too strange? but I thought it was one of the best films I've seen for a while, much stronger and more satisfying than most tickets there. I recommend it? with the above warnings? if not for any other reason than to look at Gosling's more craft.
