It's not a movie that really deserves critical attention. It doesn't win any Oscare - it's not really a very good movie at all. Heck, it's not really really a movie - just a short nasty, brand-out skits tightened to make entertainment. And as far as each critical body bone in my film fails, the gosh darn it, I give it a much better result. People who enjoy this movie are not people who really care about what the critics have to say, so I'm not going to give any snobbish criticism of Jackass's quality of surrealistic existentialism that passes and comments on how our society .... oh forget it. <br /> <br /> What to say? There is no plot development, no sign development - a real start - a semi-enjoyable ending that is not nearly as funny as the previous skit, and all the inappropriate bathroom humor that younger children are laughing at. It's actually pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Leave all the good conditions for a good movie on the door. Jackass: Number 2 is just a withdrawal. It's really all. I still give it to the filmmakers: they come up with some pretty creative things. You will probably crush several times, you want to throw, strangle and move a couple of times uncomfortably when people on the screen die and vomit tricks. Vomiting, crap, urine, sperm .... Jackass can see almost every body fluid: Number Two. There's nudity, sexual humor and so on and so on. <br /> <br /> It's fun. If you're the kind of person who finds this thing enjoyable, you probably really like Jackass: Number Two. I laughed several times. As I said, it is quite imaginative. I never wanted to vomit - though I have a pretty strong stomach. Just accept the premise of the movie: a number of idiotic boys are strange. When you are over, you will accept it and go with it, you will enjoy it. The only mistake in the movie is the surplus of all strange and disgusting things. There are many very imaginative, very disturbing skits, but it drags in many places as they do less interesting. After all, things are picking up, but in the middle of the film, the quality of the film is wounding. After half an hour, the TV show is not a problem, but in the case of film-length pulp it is inevitable that boredom will occur at some point. After some time, the gross job will just become unknown. <br /> <br /> However, each other is a fun, imaginative, and above all nasty comedy that leaves you in pain, nausea and fun. Look at this if you need to, but hey, if you know you don't like this, don't worry. You're just frustrated.
