Before my speaker, this film noted that this film was the worst that was ever imposed on him as a child. I have to say I loved this movie when it was small and I still love it. The film has the best family composition. Considering the release time of the movie, I thought the film worked well. I just wish I could find a copy of it! In the 1980s, I watched it be among my favorites. I know I watched it at least once a week with my brother and mother. I definitely recommend it to anyone I know or don't know. So if you find a copy of it, I suggest you look at it! It's wonderful and cordial.
