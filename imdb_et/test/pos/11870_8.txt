Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler. Yes, it is hard to remember the eye-catching beauty (giving fast image-perfect performance) because it simply has a lingering tongue. "One Night in McCool's" is a dementedly peculiar and dirty black comedy associated with the old fashion tones associated with its familiar but intelligently designed and chaotic narrative that has three men for one woman and she milks it under her advantage. When you see Tyler, it's no wonder why they're surprised and do something? this is something to see his "happy and lively" dreams. Just like Tyler, there is something more intoxicating about this feature, because we see Matt Dillon, John Goodman, Paul Reiser (who is great) and especially Michael Douglas (who plays a cool, but questionable hairstyle for a hired assassin) with his roles. The nourishing plot opens with three main characters (Dillon, Goodman, and Reiser), who tell their story of how they came into contact with this divine presence and the potential effects they have on bringing to the top. There is an unpredictable chain of events (ranging from fruity to sensual), where everything would be practically bound with characters with a certain ironic (snowball) twist of fate (which, when they leave, are reserved from the comfort zone to fill that girl). The Howard Zwart direction is colorfully flamboyant, balancing the script's fast fire and fun fun as difficult situations. One of the best radar comedies in the last decade that is under your Tyler thumb.
