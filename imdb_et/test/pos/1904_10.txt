Citizen Kane .... Godfather Part II .... D'Urville Martin Dolemite. It is the only major piece of cellulose ever created and fired for humanity. Rudy Ray Moore, in a role that goes beyond the Academy Award stars like Dolemite, the worst cat in the universe. He has probably not taken any turkey (I am sadly a turkey) and prove it with his powers of scrambling, pimping and chopping. It's a blaxploitation of its absolute best, bright example of genre with its low budget, continuity bugs and hate rat-soup eating honkey discovery expletive. The true godfather of Rap (not the new Ali nonsense) Moore is something of a matching technique; somehow the most charismatic actor in the 1970s will be successful and it says something. It is highly recommended for people, if not with just one liner.
