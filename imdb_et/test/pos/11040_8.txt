I loved great lighting and was warmed by the story of American working class society and seaport in the first half of the 20th century. I drew the timeless traceability of this realistic performance. to see and feel the power of the star. melancholic "greek" comedy. Anyone who knows himself with beer ... or a little ginger? Hey, son of a kid!
