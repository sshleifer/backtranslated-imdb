I loved this movie because of Candace and Jacqueline dialogue and great action. But I have never known that I am watching Bette David's marathon at TNT, that this movie is the old version of the 1933 Bette Davis classic. Bette with the characters Miriam Hopkins, who she was terrible at the time of the film, because Bette was in communication with Mirja's wife, who directed her in the movie before they got an old message. <br /> <br /> Anyway, both are worth every minute you watch. I highly recommend this movie if you like a lot of dialogue and drama. This is my psychology study and their relationship with each other.
