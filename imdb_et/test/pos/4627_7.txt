At 14.37 in Adelaide High School bathroom, the student takes her own life and the different worlds of six teenagers are changing forever. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is a brutal, honest and breathtaking movie that focuses on teenage pain. The film follows one day in the life of six teenagers, all intertwined, all dealing with their own personal dramas. Although there are a couple of stereotypes in the mix? a beautiful, popular girl who deals with body issues, obsessed with her classes, has many horrors that are as far away from the mainstream as possible, including the social challenge of brutal illness and youth. The girl tries to understand a devastating event in her past. <br /> <br /> The movie is mixed with documentary interviews from characters that some viewers can find elsewhere in the seamless narrative. The pace is also a bit slow, but it fits the film's feeling. Young Australian actresses are all stars in their own right, especially Theresa Palmer, who is a heartbreaking result, gave her the AFI nomination. <br /> <br /> The movie is very amazing and terrible. Some scenes are a bit difficult to watch? especially a five-minute suicide, but in general it is a film that has a big impact on your viewers. It will draw you directly from this shocking openness scene and will keep you away from the six main characters in the bathroom. Ultimately, this is a beautiful, but somewhat disturbing look at the life of teenagers.
