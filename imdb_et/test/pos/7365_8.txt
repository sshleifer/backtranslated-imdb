Caught in this flick is one of the five-for-$ 5 deal local video store, and it was the most pleasant surprise. It is a set of four interrelated tales built around four children who have a car wreck and are waiting to be picked up by someone. They talk to each other about these stories to kill time and sometimes amazing flashing lights and funny noise that all come together at the end of O. Henry-esque, which remained a gleeful. Real discovery. Blood (and a lot of it), breasts and wild animals round it up quite nicely ... Jacinda Barrett deserves only the entrance price. It's a keeper - Jim Bob says it's over. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, "Pumpkinhead" was one of our five choices and IMDB suggests that anyone who likes "Campfire Tales". I'll follow right now if I have a chance to sit and watch it. Joyeux Samhain!
