That's all you want, if you want. Bluebeard's eighth WIfe message is to be careful about what you want until you want it on request. <br /> <br /> Most men have heard stories about what happens when your sexual frustration is not alleviated and some of your anatomy is blue. Misognistic pirates are left aside, Cooper plays a very wealthy man who is very accustomed to what he wants when he wants it, learning only too late that he didn't expect it and never learned his lesson until he got into feisty Claudette Colbertis. Through a twisted (breath and practice) business deal, he reaches out to the wife / wife's intention to buy, but he does not have it (literally) and he throws him at every step and corner and space, and the tourist attraction. <br /> <br /> The film has a certain French sensitivity, which means it has strong double-invaders and boudoir humor for the day and a sharp edge that you are not used to (and may not see) either Cooper or Colbert. The whole reason I watched the movie was that they were "nice" actors and the whole idea of ​​this movie is that they are unlikely people or at least people who have developed improbable traits to defend themselves. the world. <br /> <br /> If you can accept it on your terms, you will find satisfaction in this witty and experienced movie ... and satisfaction, as we said, is what it is. With such pain, such a movie comes only after the end, once ... ummm ... blue month.
