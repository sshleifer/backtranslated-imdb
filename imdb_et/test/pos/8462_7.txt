I saw this movie when it came out and then a few more times later. I look at it 20 years later and it's still a very good story. Does this create a "lifetime movie network"? Yeah, but unfortunately the life time didn't even exist so it needed air. <br /> <br /> Cast was great. The story was small. two women become close friends and no one is sure that he or she is communicating with other friends. He is invited to a dinner party, where he discovers that his lover is the wife of his best friend. He's scared and tries to break the thing. Soon he will be tragically killed in a car accident that is devastating for both women. Of course, a woman unhappily finds this thing and wants to get Holly out of her life, but their friendship is in control because they need each other. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a great story for a great cast and perfomrances. I really enjoyed it.
