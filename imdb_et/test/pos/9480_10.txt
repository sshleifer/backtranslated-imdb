For the first time I saw this DVD, I was not only happy because it was the first time in decades when the band put something out, but also because the DVD itself is extremely picky. Jimmy Page probably can't live beautiful music. However, I must say that during the concert at Royal Albert Hall, they extended too much time and Moby Dick too long. It was also fine. My favorite song all the time is now on this DVD. Trampled Underfoot. This is either it or "During my mortality". In this song Jimmy plays this thing well. Ever seen Randy Rhoads? Well, Jimmy plays like him, except his guitar is lower.
