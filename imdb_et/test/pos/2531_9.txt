It was really a "nightmare" movie; I saw it on cable TV about nine years ago and has not forgotten it. Pixote is a 10-year-old boy living on the streets of Sao Paulo (Brazil) and leading the criminal life of his teenage friends Lilica, Dito and Chico; they steal, pimp, sell drugs and murder to survive every day ... In the first half of the movie, Pixote tries to catch the police and send him to a sadistic home where he feels any abuse of older prisoners and the rest of the child's guards; one night, Lilica's boy is killed after beating so Pixote and his friends decide to escape during the rebellion. The rest of the movie shows Pixote's descent into criminal life; he does not show any feelings or regret after killing someone, perhaps because he knows that good feelings have no use in the world in which he lives ... However, in the middle of the film there is a gentle scene; Pixote and his friends are on the beach, missing (and wishing) one of his friends from the Reformer was there. I thought it was a poetic and melancholic scene in the midst of all these terrible events ... the boys probably miss not only their friend but a better life. Director Hector Babenco "Pixote" is a bold and frustrating film that does not reject the tougher reality that many people, including myself, tend to ignore or misunderstand. This film will probably open your eyes and make you a better and more compassionate person.
