Many comments seem to see this film as a baseball film, but I think it's just secondary. It's really a living in Japan and it really succeeds. <br /> <br /> I spent a couple of years in Japan and I think the reason why this movie wasn't too good is that you have experienced Japan to get it. I watched it with a well-traveled friend who has never been to Japan, and noted that many of the events in the film were so ridiculous that they destroyed the suspension of disbelief. My answer was that these events were the absolute unvarnished truth of life in Japan! <br /> <br /> I think this movie is definitely worth it, especially if you have lived in Japan or are interested in it.
