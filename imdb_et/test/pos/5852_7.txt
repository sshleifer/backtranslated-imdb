Sandra Bullock paints an incredible picture as a worrying detective, although seeing her as a cynical victim of a human being, a leap of faith (or two) is needed. Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt represent enough two horrible trouble. <br /> <br /> I have some difficulty with Ben Chaplin's uniform equation (the same problem occurred when I looked at "Truth about cats and dogs" (http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0117979 I mean, if you put an English-American-American movie, there should not be at least a reason to put it there? American police force detective? Should there be any dialogue that explains and explains this pretty obvious thing? Or even some jokes about being in English He looks like he looked out of "Truth about cats and dogs." Manufacturers should really notice, annoying and annoying the audience (at least I do). There's nothing wrong with Chaplin's behavior it is just an actor's act, an unfortunate and unbelievable one, and does not take him anywhere without a good reason or storyline. <br /> <br /> The film itself: well, thrillers, especially those that are needed to solve g complicated crime That's it it does not differ, in fact it requires much more effort than usual. In order for Bullock to be smart enough to push this case despite all the pressures that require his release, there are some unrealistic assumptions about the evidence and I am sure many people who followed it were a few moments to come, is in a very unlikely situation "or even" hey, you can't get used to such evidence to pack this movie! ". As I said: reasonably fun and observable. Just don't use it when you need to look at detective tests. There are no shortcuts.
