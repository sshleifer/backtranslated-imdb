Yes, it is one of the best made television movies and I didn't expect less from Joe Sargent. One thing for this reviewer is that I was also a big fan of Carpenter, I could sing all my stuff in primary school and high school and I got a lot of solo stuff Karen sang. I thought he was one of the most amazing pop singers of the 70s - being kids / teens singing these songs and learning music - one thing I was expecting was that woman. I never got it, he died three weeks before that. And yes, it affected me because I didn't know anything about anorexia - and couldn't fully understand what happened. <br /> <br /> When this TV movie came, I got a good idea. Maybe not everyone in Karen and Richard is open to the television audience, but when I opened the show, I have understood a lot from the music industry ever since. I'm disturbed by the fact that I write "from that time" and see "now". No one has learned the courage, although it was a very informative and cordial study of family problems in the music industry. <br /> <br /> These movies aren't fun, they're ready to open the door and show us something. There was a wonderful woman who got the idea that her talent was based on weight. He was good. Didn't know that. She received mixed messages of her weight from her beloved brother, the parents she loved, and the music industry, who looked more at her appearance / weight than talent. MTV worsened with the onset. With American Idol, it's like a glowing hat with an English accent. the lack of another great talent.
