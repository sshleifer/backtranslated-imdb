I'm an Egyptian. I have a green card. I've been living in the US since 1991. I have a very common Arabic name. I'm married (non-American, non-Egyptian, non-Arab woman). I have children born in the US. I have a PhD in cell biology in the United States and I traveled to conferences. I'm making a 6-seat income and I own a home in Washington DC. I pay my taxes and outside of 1 or 2 parking tickets because I have no mistake in my record since I came here in 1991. I see more Egyptians than Ibrahim's character, but the English I speak is as good as his. A few months ago, I returned from a conference / company business in Spain through Munich, Germany to Washington (Home). At Munich Airport, I pulled the German officer right out of the Madrid plane. He waited for me. He started listening to me until I just told him "I don't have a business in Germany, I'm just going through". He was very disappointed by me. It was nothing compared to the case of Washington Dulles Airport (which was not nearly as bad as what happened with Ibrahim). The customs officer asked me a couple of questions about the length and purpose of my trip. He then wrote a letter C on his declaration form and allowed me to go. After I got my checked bag, I stopped at the last exit point (some domestic security mess). I sat there for 3 hours with many people of different nationalities. I was not told the reason for my detention. I was not allowed to use the phone or other phone. I was weak first, asking me to say the reason or let me go, but I decided to suck it and just wait. I asked if I could call my wife to tell her I was late, but she was told not. When I tried to use my phone and as soon as my wife said "hello", the officer sacrificed her hand and threatened to confiscate me. When I asked if it was necessary to call home because my family was waiting, they said, "Three hours is nothing, we will be contacting after 5 hours." When I asked to use the bathroom, I was accompanied by an officer. The toilet was funny; I think it was a prison-style toilet that is all metal without a toilet seat. Finally they called my name and gave me my passport / green card and said you could go. I asked what the problem was, they said "something"! I know it was only 3 hours, but I was dead tired and wanted to go home to see my wife and children. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, it was very well done. Unlike most Arabic films and non-Arab actors who simply speak, this film is 100% correct in Arabic. I expect the country to be Morocco (North Africa).
