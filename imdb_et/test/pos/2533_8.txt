In the early 1980s, Pixote's Brazilian society appeared to have problems with young criminals and its impact on Brazilian society. I can't watch the movie at this time because I was too young, but now I got the chance and looked at it a few days ago. This is a very brutal film, but everything is absolutely true and sad. pixote is a 12-year-old boy who lives on the streets and lives with a misdemeanor; he is staying in the detention house for a while, and when he leaves, he continues to plan the berries and prostitute played by other berries in Pera. The boy is still addicted to marijuana and to another teenager with the glue to forget his sad reality. the quality of the pictures is not the best, but the film is quite realistic about the Brazilian problems and it has to be seen and admired.
