It doesn't happen very often, but sometimes one man can make a difference - a big difference. <br /> <br /> George Crile's Best Seller of the Year 2003, CHARLIE WILSON War, is an exciting and prominent account for the most unlikely "difference maker" to imagine. Relatively disguised artwork from the second region of Texas, "Good Time Charlie," was more about his exorbitant lifestyle than his liberal legislation. Charlie Wilson worked well for his constituency, because the good people of Lufkin really wanted only two things, their weapons, and they were left alone. It's a light street that is familiar enough, like Charlie's angels. He has asked why his entire office staff consisted of attractive young assistants because his answer is classic. teach them to write, but you cannot teach mothers to grow. There is no argument. <br /> <br /> But even the most dreadful rapscallion has somewhere below the conscience, and Charlie Wilson's unimaginable atrocities in Afghanistan have made his entire political mindset collect, humiliating and humiliating. The defeat of the Russian army and, if possible, the acceleration of the end of the Cold War. Fat Opportunity, huh? <br /> <br /> According to Mike Nichols' skilful direction and the intelligent, gentle scenario of Adam Sorkin, CHARLIE WILSON'S MESSAGE is a sparkling wine, a complex satire crowning the mechanism at the back of the thirty years. colored characters consisting of "Charlie's Team". <br /> <br /> The "Team" on the screen consists of three great actresses with four (4) Academy Awards and nine (9) candidates. Charlie has been beautifully portrayed by Tom Hanks in a firm, slightly undervalued fashion, one of the best years. Joanne Herring, a wealthy Houston society she helps, has helped and abandoned her, which is still played by slinky Julia Roberts. Hey, why else have bikini, if let the world know it? For all accounts, Roberts looks good and owns, but the scenario does not even give us a clue as to why Kabul and the state are so important to his character. Perhaps two Afghan actions are usually known to him - but we will never do it as an audience. As for the "team" third member, Philip Seymour Hoffman steals every scene he sees in Gust Aurakoto, a smart (ie not an Ivy League graduate) CIA malicious person who knows the score - both in the board of the agency and in Wilson's bedroom. <br /> <br /> In order for Mujahideen to succeed, the most important help that the United States can offer is to shoot the scared MI-21 helicopter guards that drive the sky. It takes money, a lot of money, and finally "Charlie's team" keeps the funds in Congress concealed to fund $ 1 billion for advanced weapons to get Afghan rebels. This includes state-of-the-art anti-aircraft missiles, anti-tank missiles and other highly sophisticated killing devices. Nasty, nasty things. <br /> <br /> Because such a multi-billion dollar illegal activity is and is going on behind Congressional doors, it is truly worrying. Every American should watch this movie or read that book, because it shows a truly frightening aspect of the traditional political scene, which is rarely seen outside our own government walls. Oh momma, I wish it wouldn't be so ... <br /> <br /> Although the initial result of "Team Charlie" was a tremendous success, it is an unimaginable, unexpected end result that these complex weapons are now being used by the Taliban and others troops. Since the funding was completely "hidden", the young generation in this part of the world has no idea that the Soviet oppression fell and the end of Russian barbarity was the direct result of American intervention. Yes, when the Russians left, we did our help - zip for schools, zip for infrastructure, zip to maintain meaningful relations with the people of Afghanistan. As a result, the overall consequence is a unmerged disaster - like the predecessor of "Mission Accomplished". <br /> <br /> As Nichol's film so remarkably points out: "The ball you've been moving can keep bouncing even after you have lost it." Mike Krzyzewski knows it, Eva Longoria Parker knows this, Lafayette ' Little Lateesha knows this, but a typical American politician doesn't. So we go from good boys to bad boys because we didn't know the world that we are good guys. Talk about Catch-22 (another Mike Nichols movie). <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson may have said it best: "We'll end the game." <br /> <br /> Again.
