Many experienced and magnificent actors interacted with each other, which is the unspoken part of World War II in the East. The badges are well illustrated and unforgettable. One episode leaves you wanting for the next. Pay attention to the closing credits on the list of thousands of Shtrafbat battalions. An unexpected story that involves hundreds of thousands of people. Sometimes it is brutal, sometimes romantic, always full of real people and dialogue. Made with great kits and camera work. Heroes and villains, criminals and priests, patriots and betrayals. Portrait of people struggling to survive and overcome terrible time. I want to buy my collection to enjoy the series repeatedly.
