This Columbo episode is one of the best and perhaps one of my personal favorites. Cast Rosemary Baby by John Cassavets, maestro, his wife playing Blythe Danner (Gwyneth Paltrow's mother) and her mother-in-law, played by Myrna Loy (one of America's greatest actors in our time movie). Anyway, I disagree with someone who criticizes this movie. This episode is one of my favorites because you have a great cast who does a great job. I love Columbo with my beloved dog, which he ever calls in the series. This time, the episode focuses on classical music at the Hollywood Bowl, one of L.A's attractions. Of course, Columbo's classical music becomes so interesting as it does something else.
