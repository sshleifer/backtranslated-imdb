Introductory look at the relationship between Hawking and space / time contingent. This film talks about the laws of Gallilea and Newton and is related to Einstein's general theory of relativity. <br /> <br /> The film is methodically directed, revealing the details of both the man (Hawking) and his work (Black Holes). Interviews with his family are a bit too long, so unfortunately his theories and ideas are less developed. <br /> <br /> Philip Glass's soundtrack perfectly complements the film. Only one other person could make such haunting instellar melodies (Jean Michel Jarre). <br /> <br /> In general, I would recommend this movie based on a sufficient explanation of Hawking's wise nuggets and his Horizontal Event!
