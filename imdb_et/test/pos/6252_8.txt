Don't you just hate those slasher who never seem to start? Sometimes it takes some time for a flat red herring before some real action. "Tourist Trap" is not so! If it's normally merciful, if you want to ... if it's usually merciful, then you can! Lots of this AND constantly from start to finish! This film contains the greatest opening sequence of the 80's fear cinema, when a teenager, after a stroke of the engine, is trapped in an abandoned house and attacked by a horrible set of wax statues. There are four more lambs coming to the house, experiencing a completely mad maniac that looks somewhat like a mix of mad sculptors from Leatherface ("Texas Chainsaw Massacre") and one of the old wax museum films. "Tourist Trap" is an exciting horror entertainment with some real tense, harsh images, the ultimate strange, sick humor and terrible makeup effect. The plot twist is not always original and the actors are pretty bad, but seriously who cares? The fast paced and groovy-killer icon caused this "tourist trap" to serve on the spot in my 5 favorite toys. However, the total lack of nudity is somewhat surprising. Too bad because all girls are hostile and in just 10 minutes it is obligatory to have the line "Who needs bathing?" are spoken.
