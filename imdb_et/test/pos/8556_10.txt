I've seen this movie 100 times, never tired of it. I saw this movie for the first time, when I was 7 years old, and it has remained in my memories ever since. His enchanting love story that brings the sun through most people, even in the darkest times. I think this is the "black" movie and one of Anthony Quinn's best results. I want the TV channels to send this movie more often. It has inspired me and does it for many others. If I wanted to meet some of the actors, it would have been Anthony Quinn. Silver screens are never like, never. I want Anthony Quinn alive. Does God bless his soul.
