I went to the premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in NYC and I loved this movie !!! I am Diane's biggest fan and of course, as always, he gave great performance !! I've seen every one of my movies and I have to say it's one of my new favorites. Diane was funny and moving and just took her breath away. Donald Sutherland was surprisingly humorous, but also good. Anton Yelchin is just a great young actor and gave an amazing result. All in all, I recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates a great movie. 10 thumbs up !!! I would like to see it again and again. This is still the best film of the year!
