I must honestly say that CAT IN BRAIN is one of the funniest and unintentionally fun movies I've ever seen. This film is full of foolish dialogue, ridiculous scenes and a self-contained plot of play with the legendary horror leader Lucio Fulci himself. <br /> <br /> A yarn-like story about an aging director (Fulci, also known as Lucio Fulci in the movie ...) who's going to go for nuts and hallucinations because he's been shot over the last few years. He goes to a shrink, who hypnotizes Fulci and tells him that he believes himself as a killer, but it is actually the one who kills. The rest of the film consists of a "movie" that Fulci directs throughout this action, shrinking scenes that kill people all the time while smiling like FKC-moron and some Fulci hallucinations. Oh, and some tits that are also good at measuring thrown ... CAT / BRAIN is completely superficial and ridiculous in every sense. Gore is a classic Fulci - nasty and strong, with some very decent scenes. Cutting a female body is quite cool, as is the chasing of a little boy. Many skins, slippers, and other cool wallpapers make it quite endless for bleeding. A ridiculous dialogue (LICK IT !!! LICK IT !!!), as well as some amazing funny scenes (Nazi orchestra, opera singing, and innocent hippie decline) just come to mind. ..) makes it one of the fun. Not nearly as dark as some of Fulci's other movies - CAT is a self-evident horror / comedy that if it wasn't funny, it is really sad. I'm telling you to grab a fifth of the cheap bourbon and get to it. I watched CAT with some friends and we laughed all the time. It's summer feeling good movie ... Recommended 8/10
