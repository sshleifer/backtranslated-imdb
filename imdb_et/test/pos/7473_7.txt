I don't know what the critics saw when the movie was released, but they slipped unnoticed. It is well written, witty, satirical and thoroughly enjoyable. It's like a video game that was alive. You never know who's behind the door or what happens. Violence is neither unreasonable nor overstated because of the last word: For you, Mickey Rourke fans ... Mickster is back and his cooler end.
