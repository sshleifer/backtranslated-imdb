It is always nice to see a film that teaches us about African history, because they are definitely too few. The film, however, depicts Lumumba as a political leader who wanted the new independent state to be the same as the old colonialist ..., I felt that it was hard to understand, but the film is a somewhat respectful man. There was too little content explaining how the man first got up and "let them go" throughout the Belgian context. So it is definitely worthwhile that acting and photography are excellent, especially Mobutu himself. I would just have liked a better political analysis.
