Amazing, one of my favorite movies. I think I can be proud not to like what the "general population" tends to do. Jackie Mason is fun in this movie and so is Randy Quaid. I never get enough of my "strong hand" tactics like Moving. He was also remarkable at the National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. Love this man.
