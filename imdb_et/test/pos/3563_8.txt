The gang of dirty, harsh, merciless Monetero-led bandits (the perfect presentation by Gilbert Roland) steals a $ 300,000 gold coin during a brutal robbery. But the incredible member of the Bahunda (Jose Torres amusing gear) gives up and hides the coins. Unfortunately, Bahunda dies before he can tell Monetero where he unloaded. So Monetero has to join forces with the mystery, the mysterious, mysterious bounty hunter Stranger (played smoothly by beautiful George Hilton) and the cagey, corrupt banker Clayton (50th Idol Eddie "Kookie" Burns' delightfully shameful image) of coins. Skillfully directed by Enzo G. Castellari, with a cunning, sophisticated and complex scenario by Castellar, Tito Carp and Giovanni Simonelli, playfully amoral and nihilistic (each with double and triple crossings with one another happily greedily abandoned), Alessandro Alessandroni and Francesco De Masi amazing, delicious , a stubborn result, a lot of distracting shootings and harsh funny funny funny funny funny humor, a steady pace and a real amazing surprise Finally, it makes a meaningless and often fun feature of Sergio Leone's "Good, Bad and Ugly" inspiration. The uplifting of the subtle secondary parts is peaceful Stefanie Careddu as Monetero's fiery galpal Marisol, captain of the hard army of Ivano Stacciol, and Gerard Herter as lawyer at Lawrence Blackman. Extremely fun and enjoyable romp.
