It's a charming movie to say at least. The main character, Fanda, is an old man who refuses to live among the dead that he surrounds. He and his companion are going to twitch and get into trouble all over the city. Meanwhile, his family is armed with what to do with him. From there you can see Fanda's relationship with a woman, her best friend and son. Finally, this is one of the best ends of the movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are rich and deep. They develop well during the film. The film has quite a lot of moods. It goes dark and funny to dark and dark. Any slow portions of this movie will eventually be made out. <br /> <br /> Autumn spring has a similar message to many other European films - don't forget the little pleasures of life. If you liked Amelie, the eighth day or the life is beautiful (all great movies BTW), you probably like this movie. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
