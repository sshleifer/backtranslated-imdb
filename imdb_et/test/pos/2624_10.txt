This movie, in my opinion, has been one of the best TV mysteries I've ever seen. Action is great. I have seen it twice and in some parts still confused. I would love a copy so I can play some parts over and over again. I'm interested in buying a copy of this movie, but I can't find it anywhere. I don't know if anyone has any suggestions to find it? I have tried e-bay, Amazon.com, internet searches and am completely disappointed. I haven't seen it in Turner classic movies or American film classics, and I've even posted fleurs in our community asking if anyone has a copy.
