With Swift writing, there's more to common Kafka and Orwell than fantastic adventure writers, so it's curious that Gulliver's Travels has been considered a children's novel. Happy children! <br /> <br /> The same goes for this movie. There have been very terrible versions of this story, which have to be because people don't want to see this version. I mean, this is a TV movie and it's from muppett Jim Henson, so how should we wait for something except cuteness? <br /> <br /> Look again - beauty appears in the most uncomfortable places. Kids love this movie enough to sit in all three hours, but it also takes time for Swift to have a dark vision right. I hate special effects, but here we use these stories to pass on, not just dazzle us. Note that the manufacturers have struggled to recruit classical actors such as John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole, who perform their eccentric roles perfectly. <br /> <br /> dramatically, the romance between Gulliver and Glumdalclitch has become touching and terrible, as well as funny (he is a little girl, but twenty times bigger). The frame has a theme for missing fathers with whom many children are involved. And part of the Gulliver in the shelter brings out the horror of abuse of power (probably due to Val Lewton's "Bedlam" [1946], another forgotten masterpiece). <br /> <br /> VHS always pays for a few cents, which is offensive to many big artists who put it together. I encourage the audience to recognize a good movie and inspire others to watch it. Although the children have a lot to offer, adults find that it rises well for classics such as Aguirre, Brazil, 1984 and other serious fantastic works.
