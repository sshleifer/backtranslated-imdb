This is one of my favorite films of all time, if not in cars then forget it !! This film contains 1 Aussies largest muscle car, XYGTHO. Yes, not the biggest one - it was never an Oscar winner. Car activity keeps you coming back. In the 70s and Awesome '57 Chev has cool muscle cars. Terry Serio's main actor is also a very cool song. Action is a little funny, but the main focus of this movie is the tire smokin and drag and drop. Large, fast cars with a lot of steel (NO PLASTIC CARS) and some cool street drags. I recommend it only to people who are in cars and not someone looking for great action.
