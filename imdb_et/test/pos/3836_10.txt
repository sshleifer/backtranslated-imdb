"Terrorist Balance" is still one of the best episodes of Star Trek. It was inspired by the movie "Below below" (starring Robert Mitchum), a film about cat and mouse play between two captains during World War II and World War II. In this episode, Captain Kirk and his team play a similar game with the Romulan ship. It is a program that introduces the war-hungry rumor, who is the distant relatives of Vulcan. This is an incredibly tense episode that is tightly designed for maximum effect. It is also interesting to see how the episode contains a number of sub-blocks that add additional layers of meaning to the story. Mark Lenard makes his Star Trek debut as Romulan captain (later he plays Spock's father Ambassador Sarek). Black-this episode!
