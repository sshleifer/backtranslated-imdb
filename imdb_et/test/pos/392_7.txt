Dylan and Bobby are childhood friends and they are in love as young boys sometimes have. But Dylan has met a girl and is going to put those boy's things off. Bobby knows he's not interested in girls and misses what he had with Dylan. <br /> <br /> Talked about the 80s pop video, part of the home video, part of the memory of the video, that this movie speaks of confusion and sadness, but too often true, a story that strikes many who see it. <br /> <br /> This movie brings back a lot of memories and hit a very real chord with me, but I want the filmmaker to go a bit further and leave it for a happier comment. Yes, we all love and lose, even if we are young, but always tomorrow, especially when we are young.
