This movie is good in its genre, and this genre is, of course, a small / medium budget. It looks like Van Damme has a very good performance when he has a good manager who guides him. There's a bar on your bar, an alley scene and mostly a lot of weapons. Some basic drama, but nothing too deep. Isaac Florentine drives OK when you ignore the weak plot and the holes in it. But the person who steals the exhibition is: <br /> <br /> Scott Adkins. How this guy is not a massive Arnold Schwarzenegger caliber star I don't know. Director Isaac Florentine has made a film with Scott Adkins before, called Special Forces (2003), which has some incredible martial arts talents that satisfy the most demanding kungfu enthusiasts. Another amazing feature of Scott Adkins is Undisputed 2. Check this guy and make a noise, this guy must get the status of a superactive star and he must get it right now! <br /> <br /> What else to say Film? It's Van Damme, increasing some of his last job. There are no specific oscarees here, but you already knew it. But never less is a nice little town and I can find worse ways to spend my time. So I give it in 10 out of ten genres.
