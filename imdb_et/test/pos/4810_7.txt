This movie is a refreshing pace of change from the frantic Hong Kong triad movies I'm so tired of. There are no remarkable arms struggles. No cars. And practically minimal activity. The audience is largely kept, although certain aspects of Andy Lau's "ploy" are quite obvious. <br /> <br /> The movie is welcomed as a departure from the violent triad genre films and the "intelligent" criminal movie. To some extent, it is. But to some extent, it is still not a "credibility" test. Every triad member can hardly be imagined to see Andy Lau hide from a woman. It also seemed to have fallen "if someone was seriously ill, someone says that he regularly attracts a lot of blood," Chinese films seem to be running all the time. <br /> <br /> A fine relationship between two controls is a refreshing change. <br /> <br /> All in all, there is a pleasant movie, although the concept is not new and there are surprises. >
