The words alone cannot describe the beauty and power of this film. <br /> <br /> Think about "Toy Story." Now think about "Toy Story", about 1934. Now imagine that animation is as viable as liquid. Think of the movie not as adults and children can enjoy, but imagine it as a movie-noir. <br /> <br /> Imagine trying to do something like that in 1934. Somehow, "Mascot" offers. The story where the toys live, and one of them is trying to make their sick owner orange, offers Starewicz an unexpected level of animation. It's so liquid, you don't know if what you see is really a stop-motion animation. <br /> <br /> Comparing "Toy Story" and "The Mascot" is a futile exercise: although "Toy Story" is a children's story, adults can enjoy, "The Mascot" is a dark, cool adult-oriented story. Meaning, NO, your kids don't like it. One bit. <br /> <br /> Get it if you can. You may find it with "Vampyr" on DVD and LaserDisc. And prepare for Stewicz to make a pair of dolls in 1933.
