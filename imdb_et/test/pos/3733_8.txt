I'm a man, so I was very hesitant to watch the movie because I know Richard Gear likes to be in tears. I'd rather look at action / adventure / sci fi. I was right, the film is definitely a tear. Diane tended to act a few times, as did Richard, but they brought it around and made it work. The daughter was suppressed by a great attitude, so you started to hate her. The film is too predictable, but for entertainment purposes it was a masterpiece. Go for rent, see if you don't take tears. Lily If you like a laptop, you'll love it. The beach scenes were photographed suckily. Although the hurricane scenes were slightly uneven, there was still some panic to see how they responded.
