I must admit that when I first heard about the Apocalypse movie, it was a concern. <br /> <br /> I mean they have a lot to live with, aren't they? When they first showed the show, they won the Perer Prize and won the Sony Prize when they received the radio. When they vented to their TV series, they won the Bafta Prize, the Royal Television Society Award and the Montreux Golden Rose. <br /> <br /> When the first series was released in January 1999, it was peace of mind! The real breath of fresh air in British comedy and when the second series of years later this foundation was built on this foundation and sealed the exhibition culture around the world, our web statistics show that we have received visitors from every planet country! The local exhibition for local people introduced Gents' talents to a lively presentation and opened the doors to allow them to live more, for example, in the "Art" West. <br /> <br /> Fans' favorite has always been Christmas special, less sketch show, and more respect for classic horror movies, still in the style of a delicious line. <br /> <br /> And then, of course, there was a "heavy" third series, still hit by loyal hardcore fans of course, but maybe a bit ahead of their time for a general TV audience. <br /> <br /> As I say, there is a lot to live on. <br /> <br /> Now we have a movie and ... Well, the movie is different, isn't it? This can be seen in much larger numbers than in radio or TV shows, and I was worried about the third series. <br /> <br /> Well, as you know, I was fortunate enough to watch the press tonight in London and all my doubts were blown (literally) in the first few minutes! I'm not giving the plot lines, as some reviewers have done, and I'm not going to tell you the catch statements (though there's really only one), but I'm trying to tell you what they've been able to achieve with this movie! Leaving the cinema on Monday evening could only imagine: "Oh God, it's brilliant, amazing, it's the best they've ever done, better than the first, the second and the special!" Of course, I owe a much better explanation to my visitors! So, why is it great? It's a movie for everyone, a casual fan, an obsessive fan, a casual fan, and even someone who's been in the wrong cinema! You don't have to watch this movie; it works on so many levels. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me why I'm a gentleman's fan! You can say that filming was also the real work of love; attention to detail is incredible. TV shows were always detailed, but I have to watch the movie again to see the background! The story is moving at a fast pace, an action that takes us to the real world of Royston Vase, where we meet the creators who are, of course, too! Along the way, we can get into the favorite characters of the show, but always inside the central story, unlike the TV show. <br /> <br /> I was glad that the movie was sometimes dark, a little scary and a bit strange ... just installing the gentlemen too. Gents also managed to get his revenge on the BBC's censors, not so much a slip on the word "Mongoloid" as he yelled at the roof! Some may think that Gents is a little caring, but it is a joke and with it my only worry, the jokes I mention below, may make some viewers think and they may come a little wisely ... but I shouldn't worry, always poo a joke who is just waiting around the corner and talking about jokes, they are thick and fast and confused with smart references, wig jokes, jokes of jokes, visual jokes and gags of flowers! I didn't laugh at the cinema because ... I can't remember! Fans who have been '' '' from the start will receive prizes with "in" jokes, some that work on two levels, the main audience may laugh with reference to the CD for one reason, while the local show laughs for another reason! You are a genius! Peter Kay and Simon Pegg are the strangest double act you've ever seen. I was a little worried about the aspect of the 1690 movie when I first heard about it, but I was just in the story of a story when ... but it would say! I have to say that it fits perfectly and adds to the overall feeling of the movie! I'm not a professional reviewer of movies, so I find it difficult to put in words how much I enjoyed this movie, but now I'm just saying that if the expected comic book comic book benchmark in recent years is a great Shaun of dead, I'm sorry but The new locality has just found inventive, fun and sometimes a little scary ... gentlemen's apocalypse too. <br /> <br /> Jason Kenny 2005
