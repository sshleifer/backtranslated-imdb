This is definitely a "black" movie. The great director Alain Chabat (who also acts as Ceasarina) has been able to capture "Astérix adventures" (French comics based) and create a fantastically modern and intelligent comedy that is also a tribute to the world of animated films. This movie is so funny, full of jokes (both visually and spoken) that it can bring you two or three screenings before you notice them all, between your laughs. The only drawback is that the non-French audience (or at least the non-French speaking audience) may not get all the "private words". There are so many dialogues that are impossible to translate, so many situations that are directly related to comics or the French way of life that may be less fun. However, it is still quite worth seeing a beautiful picture, amazing tricks, music, a totally crazy atmosphere and great actors. All the actors are great, but the film wouldn't be the same without Jamel Debouze, Gérard Darmon and Edouard Baer. Do not compare EVER with this awesome previous movie based on the same comics: "Astérix et Obélix Contre César" and director Claude Zidi.
