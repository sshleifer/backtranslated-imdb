You want a movie that takes you to the scene? Well, that's a good choice. If you were in this movie - Motown's hayday - adolescence or if you want to get back and see what your parents did so much noise, I suggest you give it away and watch it. In case of air conditioning, you laugh, you cry, remember and remember. You go back to the time when school violence was a fist fight. You remember love after your best friends from school. It's a feeling of a good movie with anger and pain and realism - misconceptions, losing friends, making decisions with your life. I think everyone, irrespective of race, age, socio-economic status, can draw and really enjoy this movie. So take a few hours of a lazy day and watch this movie; is a much worse way for you to spend your time.
