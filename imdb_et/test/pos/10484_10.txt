Sublime - perfect - deep - a real lesson of the idealized meaning of life. We get to the full life of Martina and Phillipa and to Babette. Their longing, desires, sacrificing resonances long after the end of the film. Seeing it years ago - because his subject had grown gloriously - half of the film had one dinner - the audience was "oozing and aching" because some of the courses took the final glorious shape, laughing at eating places because they changed completely seduced when Babette introduced them to gustational pleasures and was completely surprised by the progress of the events at the end of the film. After seeing the film many years later, following my own turns and life chances, I realized how deep the film was. In this viewing, the tears flowed freely. The movie <br /> <br /> meditation over time and the way it uses a seemingly simple story to comment on life and love and art and generosity is really something to be pampered.
