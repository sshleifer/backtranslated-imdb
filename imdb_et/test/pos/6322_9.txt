The same plot line was used in the Simon & Simon episode (Thin Air), originally filed in December 1982. <br /> <br /> The victim's gender was changed, the surviving spouse being one of Rick's. It is also interesting to note that Gerald McRaney played a role in this Rockford file episode. <br /> <br /> Both episodes were based on Howard Browne's story - as noted in “write credit”. > Anthony James plays one of his classic roles in TV evil. <br /> <br /> The continuation of the concept between Rockford files and Magnum PI for Simon & Simon is quite interesting.
