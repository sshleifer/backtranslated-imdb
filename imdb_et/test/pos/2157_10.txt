Hard Justice is a great action movie! The whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting, but it has a great vampire piece! For people who say they don't make shooting and fighting movies as they use. Well, it's really the core! Don 'The Dragon' Wilson is great and his character is really cool in the movie. Nicholas Guest was also very good and he allegedly steals the show! She really fills a fantastic villain! Melanie Smith was also good. I think this very beautiful actor is very underrated. Michael Cavanaugh was good. It was really cool to see Vince Murdock in this movie! As far as action is concerned, it is truly fantastic with all weapons and super cool fighting scenes. The fight in this picture is really one of the biggest I've ever seen! There's so much going on during the 86-minute workout. Action fans blow up all the fire and the great fight that this movie offers! Night Hunter is a movie that is not easy to find and if you are in a video store and see it for sale, buy it up because this movie is a big keeper and a plus box is cool! There are a number of activities that need to be seen as believing! Check out and see if you can find good deals on Ebay, Half.com, Amazon.com Z-Shops and Market Place Sellers! In my opinion, Night Hunter is one of the biggest fighting films I've ever watched and the characters are so clean. If you like Don 'The Dragon' Wilson and would like to see Nicholas Guest's great performance, then I strongly recommend every movie fan who loves em ups, fighting movies and vampire films and is disappointed with other movies that have a real non-stop action but don't give it today to get and buy Night Hunter today!
