Love this little movie that reminds me of a somewhat original Japanese pearl, WHAT WE CREATE? (not an overwhelmed Gere / Jlo remake ...) Luckily I found it and recorded it when it was on STARZ Promo Weekend, because as far as I know it is not available on DVD. I look at something with Yancy Butler (someone remembers this short-lived TV series MANN AND MACHINE ???) and he looks positive in it. She makes a dance routine for a discographic song that's verrrryyyyyy HOT !! He loved all the other symbols, especially those played by Patrick Stewart and Leslie Caron (where is he all these years?). This is one of those movies that I take out from time to time and after that I always look at the smile. Recommended very !!!
