After seeing The Aristocats: Special Edition in two packages with Fox in Hound, I decided to buy it because both movies were childhood favorites. <br /> <br /> Aristocats is a classic, definitely. It may not be a five star classic, but it is a fun movie and makes a good evening of entertainment. This is a somewhat lightweight update to the darker, more serious Disney classic. Aristocrats are trying to be a mild musical comedy, and I think it's almost a success. <br /> <br /> The story doesn't really make sense, and I don't think the plot is particularly strong, but it's certainly not weak. Animation and backgrounds are typical of Disney's 70s movies, but it also has a rustic, old-fashioned charm. <br /> <br /> The strong points of the aristocrats are characters, music and humor. Music is very memorable - try hastily "Everyone wants to be a cat"! The songs are written by Sherman Brothers, who also made Jungle Book music. There was one song called "She Never Felt Alone" in the film, but unfortunately it didn't make it final. It's a shame because I think it would be very good. <br /> <br /> Characters are unforgettable. Thomas O'Malley has been expressed by Phil Harris and is basically in the form of Baloo's cats. Eva Gabor gives the Duke this warm and mother's feeling and the kitten's voice really sounds like children, not an actor who imitates the child's voice. There are dozens of secondary characters here, but you still understand their personalities. Edgar, the "buggy" butler, plays a similar role with Cruella De Vil, but he is more comic than scary, often reaching a funny situation. Even if he's a bad guy, he's still the same cute. <br /> <br /> Two British geese - Abigail and Amelia really beat up with their mad (and drunk) uncle. I also like dogs who want to argue about who is the 'leader'. I could go on, but I don't break it. But I can tell you that Aristocats is funny and entertaining for everyone without having to use a rudimentary toilet. <br /> <br /> The bottom line - Aristocats may not be Disney's crowning achievement or even the strongest film of the 70's (this award is a link between The Whinnie the Pooh rescuers and many adventures). But it is an enjoyable romp and definitely entertaining. If you are looking for a dazzling piece of art, you may want to look at Bambi. But if you want a fun evening, Aristocats is the way to go. It's a charming and lovable movie, and it's impossible. Enjoy! (And, moreover, it is good to have a movie where cats are not considered bad guys).
