Alien and Ghost Busters Blend? <br /> <br /> Starts very promising, then slows down almost boring. <br /> <br /> LifeForce has some extraordinary special effects that they could do in the mid-80s. The story is intriguing, but in the end it will change quite a bit. It was rated R because it was rude, sex and gore. Mathilda May's essential and wild (naked) beauty is very visible throughout the film. A strange film and it cost a lot to make it. <br /> <br /> It could have been a bigger classic better script, but unfortunately it wasn't a big hit, I think it really floped pretty bad. So something went wrong, but still it is a lot of fun.
