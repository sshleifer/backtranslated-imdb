This film surprised me. I'll make it a habit to find out as little as possible about movies before participating, because trailers and reviews offer a spoiler after the spoiler. When I entered the theater, I knew it was a documentary about an old couple and that IMDb readers gave 7.8, Rotten Tomato users 7.9, and critics an average of 8.2! If anything, they start this little pearl. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker Doug Block decided to record his parents' offspring, and at the beginning of the film, they are treated with the necessary interviews with their parents, Mum. and less than the future father, Mike. I found this pair interesting and I had no idea where the filmmaker (Mike & Mina's son Doug) takes us. In fact, I doubt Doug himself knew where he was doing it! <br /> <br /> Life takes unexpected turns and this beautifully expressive film follows the journey. It is difficult to verbalize exactly how I moved this story and in a unique way how it was said. Absolutely riveting from start to finish and this is indeed a must-see even if you are not a documentary fan. This film makes you think about your life and can even create memories you had long forgotten. "51 Birch Street" is one of those rare movie experiences that makes a deep impression and never misses you. The best news is that HBO had a hand in production, so playing with a limited art house audience has millions of people looking at this incredible job. BRAVO !!!!!!!!
