Despite some acceptable adaptations to the main themes of the books, Queen Crime / Vampire LESTAT did not miss the complicated story of Anne Rice. All the symbols make up the deep layers crushed only on their surface, if not on a completely different identity. The chronological order of the major events of the film seemed strange and uneven. <br /> <br /> However, there were a lot of reviews for the film to deserve my rating. jw.org en Lestat (among other vampires) was public, especially for young girls. The film also did a good job focusing on the importance of heredity and history, which vampires were proud of. The scenes of sensuality were also satisfactory to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Operation of the King of Claims was modest than disappointing. Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah have surprising chemistry, although it only shows when the best one works (not very often). Characters are nothing compared to those created by INTERVIEW VAMPIRE. It also lacks the emotional intelligence of EVERYTHING COUNTRY that is shameful because the Queen of Rice's Hungry Book was so and more. <br /> <br /> This movie does not provide everything it seems to be. Impacts are boring and very disappointing. In many scenes, the necessary extravagance is not given and the dialogue is tiring. The settings for many scenes are not how I depicted them in the book, and I think many of them were not even stories. There are only a few inconsistencies in the beginning and middle of the film, but it surrounds itself quite well, giving the viewer a complete story (if they hadn't read the book). <br /> <br /> Something I feel is that the film needs a good original score (Howard Shore or Elmer Bernstein) instead of mixing rock music; although I had no problems with some songs. Another thing that would have made the film better is a better direction. The landscape was both boring and unclear, which is important for a fairly frequent moving story. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, the King of Claims was unevenly disappointing but somewhat satisfactory in the adaptation of the novel. With some simple changes, it can be a very successful movie work. I recommend this movie to people who have seen INTERVIEW or read books so they can make their own assessment of their customization.
