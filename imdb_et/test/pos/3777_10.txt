Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde. <br /> <br /> Michael McGuire was a father. <br /> <br /> Tim Thomerson was a plastic surgeon. <br /> <br /> Did you even see this movie? I doubt it! <br /> <br /> Blankfield was quite popular at this time to play pill-popping doctor on Friday. Thomerson has been funny in everything he does, from movies to series to stand-up comedy. If I ever find this movie on DVD, I will definitely buy it. I recorded this movie back from HBO in the '82s and the tape is pretty much worn out. One of the more fun Jekyll & Hyde themes ever. <br /> <br /> Of course. all the cocaine references in this movie today would be too politically incorrect, like Cheech and Chong. Too bad because it's FUNNY, FUNNY, FUNNY!
