This first (and hopefully not last) Wallace & Grid function meets expectations. There's a lot of fun (somewhat funny), as well as some great respects for past science fiction movies. Shooting amazing and shapely movies from Hollywood is good for seeing such a big movie as it is enjoyable for almost everyone. If there is justice, then it's up to the office and at least the best animation for the next Oscar. Animation is great; The characters are remarkably expressive and their adventures are very fun. This is one of the films that the whole family can enjoy. Charming, smart, fun and well done, what not to enjoy?
