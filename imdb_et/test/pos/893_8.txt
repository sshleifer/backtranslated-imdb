Unparalleled Laura Gemser appeared briefly in the erotic scene of the French Emmanuelle 2. This amazing woman did not go unnoticed and was soon in the lead of this new Italian series, where she is at the center; a beautiful photojournalist who travels around the world, experiencing the mysterious eroticism that the world had to offer. In this first part, Mae Jordan / Emanuelle is sent to Africa to photograph people, as well as stunning and natural exotic animals. Like the character of Sylvia Kristels, Emanuelle does not have her own sexuality in terms of openness and satisfaction. This first film is basically about how he becomes Emanuell, most of the fans of the exploitation cinema. It's full of beautiful cinematography, beautiful people, and the intoxicating 70's score of legendary Nico Fidenco. For those who enjoy the French "Emmanuelle" story, it should definitely be. The main story here is an interesting cat and mouse story about feminine playboys who understand that she is in love with a woman who is her female version! Sexy, fun and fun all the time; the soap opera is sure, but one who has enough skin and overall eye candy to attract men to the audience. For some reason, this is the hardest of the series on the DVD. there has never been a legal DVD that is very strange. The launchers, which sometimes appear on-line, have to do so as long as someone gives this movie to release the diamond correctly.
