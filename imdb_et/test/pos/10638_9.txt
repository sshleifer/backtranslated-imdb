If you think the piano teacher Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) Michael Haneke in the film "LA PIANISTE" is the final degree in personalizing change, perversion and darkness, then I have the news: the piano artist Elfriede Jellinek's novel "LA PIANISTE" (based on the film) is twice "more disgusting", "disgusting", "spoiled" and even more interesting - though there may not be enough words to translate the level of artistic skill reached by Isabelle Huppert here, over all other mortal actors living today. And who else could have played this character with such emotional power, along with the best piano games / duplicates that the actor could offer? <br /> <br /> The novel, like a film, has two major antagonists. heroine "Court: her own mother (wonderful, wreck, Annie Girardot, part originally designed for Jeanne Moreau) and herself. Mother personalizes Jellinek's understanding of her native Austria as a country that deceives and perversely encourages racist / fascist (or at least authoritarian) behavior, sexual and emotional repression, and say that Ã¼bermensch ideals that are impossible to keep today without a mental division. <br /> <br /> La Pianiste also deals with a very powerful and delicate issue: how dangerous it is to publish your inner fantasies We tend to think that our own sexual fantasies must be as exciting to others as ourselves, which can be a tremendous, embarrassing and sometimes tragic mistake. The court learns (?) lessons in the most painful and humiliating way. /> <br /> It should be mentioned that Elfriede Jellinek is one of the most well-known and praised authors in Austria and Europe (well, now she's a Nobel Prize!) The geographical sections can be deduced from his novel because he himself was a pianist and had a relatively difficult relationship with his mother. There are also long passages in the novel about the childhood and adolescence of Teutonic, so you understand how he has now changed. Haneke decided to hide this information in the movie, forcing us to think about how it should be in this way (do we not all know Erika Coffe?). But he keeps a lot of the book's fabric in his film: intolerable honesty, until the pain of the most secret, "terrible" feelings - jealousy, cruelty, violence, jealousy, hatred, misery, sadism, masochism, selfishness, all unmistakably human. <br /> <br /> I thought "La Pianists" was a deeply moving movie, a very disturbing and thoughtful, with a handful of unforgettable scenes, and that's all I ask in movies. It also made me buy and exciting from the book, discover a fantastic author I had never read, and listen again and again to Schubert - so thank Haneke, Jellinek and Isabelle !!! On the other hand, if you are looking for light entertainment, please stay away. My voice: 9 out of ten
