I ended up watching Marigold today and start by saying that I found it on the DVD Blockbuster shelves. Despite looking for something new and good looking, Ali Larter's image earned my attention. <br /> <br /> After limping from Ali Larter, the cover rose and looked around. I thought the costumes were a little over the top. And then I saw other Indians on the cover and thought it was a kind of scam or something. <br /> <br /> When I received a summary and saw Salman Khan, I did a double shot. Salman Khan in American Ali Larter Blockbuster DVD? Since Salman Khan is for Bollywood movies, as Mel Gibson is for Hollywood movies, I was very expected of this movie: it was supposed to be good! I'm very happy to say that Marigold is a phenomenal film! It far exceeded my personal expectations! <br /> <br /> I think such a movie will happen if you have a decent script, a talented, experienced, knowledgeable, goal-oriented leader, two incredible actors in leadership roles and just a very hard-working support and team! Khan and Larter probably have very big chemistry and both look great: they look really good. The musical numbers were not at all bad, which was surprising in view of the fact that cheeses and long musicals from Indian films are on these days. And you will be glad to know that Indian costumes are very far away if you can. <br /> <br /> The start of the movie was kind of slow, in the middle it was really good, scenes were very dramatic, but the end was just awesome! But I have some hands and complaints on the DVD. Although I loved the widescreen DVD aspect ratio, I didn't like the fact that several other things were left out of the DVD. There are no subtitles for beginners. Now that English is my first language, it's not a problem. But when some Indian actors and actors spoke, it was (sometimes) difficult to understand what they said; Headlines would have helped. <br /> <br /> Another thing I would have appreciated on a DVD would be a set of flowers or extracts. And finally, what about a menu function that would allow us to skip the musical number? Man, some of these songs were really good! On the reverse side, I enjoyed watching Marigold's making. <br /> <br /> I have a lot more to say about the awesomeness of this movie and how much I liked it, but I don't have the time or I want to keep writing why I enjoyed it so much. I hope that Salman Khan will make more English films in addition to his Hindi films and hope that this Hindi film is not Ali Larter's latest Bollywood film. And I encourage the director to continue producing Bollywood film hybrids with Salman Khan, Ali Larter and other great actors - make sure the scripts are original and good. <br /> <br /> 10/10 - This is just a great love story movie your family can enjoy!
