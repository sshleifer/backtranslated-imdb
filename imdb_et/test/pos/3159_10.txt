Thanks to God, there are movies that don't follow the same old Hollywood mess. I think the digital revolution and the DVD revolution will make it possible to get a more interesting job out there even if you need to find it harder. I love it when the film takes time to pull you deeper and deeper into your inner emotional forces. It was really like a trip through the American soul and this soul is disturbed and confused. I thought they were using Martin Luther King's speeches about Vietnam and referring to his murder so that it hit me hard. I always found myself when I heard her voice. I have, of course, heard that he speaks before, but the way they used the speeches here felt that I understood his message in a way I never thought. <br /> <br /> What do you say about a movie that has heavy statistics on war, oppression, and condolences at the end of the credit indexing process? In fact, there is no credit at all in the film. They must be accessed by selecting them in the features. Somehow it made me think. All in all, I can't say enough about this DVD. Brilliant.
