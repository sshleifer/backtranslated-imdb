The "cell" is the journey of the serum killer mind and I mean it literally. The film talks about the journey, the world it shows during this journey, the destination is not really important. In my opinion, this way of thinking gives such beautiful pictures that other things are not really as important as they do not disturb. Actually, the story is pretty good. <br /> <br /> Let's start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the cat's mind. How it works exactly does not matter, but it looks like a virtual reality. He and other scientists, including Henry West (Dylan Baker) and Miriam Kent (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), believe that this method can work. Catherine enters the boy's mind and talks to him in a world that has been completely created by the boy. He hopes he can let him do things that ultimately produce results. <br /> <br /> A real story then. The series killer Carl (Vincent D'Onofrio) simply destroyed one of his victims' bodies. In this case, the FBI agents are Ramsey (Jake Weber) and Novak (Vince Vaughn). Another girl (Tara Subkoff) disappears, and at that time Carl can investigate and catch after investigating the dumped body. There are two problems. 1. Carl just went to the coma; he has been ill for a long time. 2. His house and house, which has the last kidnapped victim, are not in the same place. In a sense, this story is partly quite common. <br /> <br /> Things are going to be interesting again. To find out where the girl is, Catherine must go to Carl. This is dangerous for many reasons. In short: Carl is an unknown territory, a schizophrenic and a serum killer. When Catherine believes that Carl is a sensual world, her mind can convince her body; he can die in Carlis's mind. The tape on how the last victim was killed, the fate that this girl has about twenty hours, will ensure that Catherine tries to get her out of Carlisle. mind that makes this movie more than worth watching. Director Tarsem Singh, who made music videos before that, is back with their music videos. Every room in the imaginary world is another short clip that exists from beautiful and sometimes haunting images. For me, the visual style seemed completely new, five "three kings" were a new visual style a year earlier. If something like this can make you a movie, "Cell" won't disappoint. But fans of the thriller and horror genre may like this movie like that. The story itself, without a great fantasy world, is good enough for that. I think you have to be a little open, of course, in our real world (yet) events are not possible. However, it is a very fun movie with great ideas.
