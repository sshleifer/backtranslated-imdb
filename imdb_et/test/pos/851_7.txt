An interesting story about giant mammoth elephants running in today's India. Includes transparent special effects-elephants dressed in coats with coat shirts. All this said, we have a good story and a fine cast of work and an exciting climax. It has been said that this time doubled when it showed in India - a craftsmanship by Robert Lippert, who was "upholstered". If you choose, choose a shorter version.
