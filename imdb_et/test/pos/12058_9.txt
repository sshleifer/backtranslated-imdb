Certainly this is not a great show, but better than most of the others there. It resembles exhibitions such as married children and Roseanne when they go to places that are not traditionally dealt with. Sometimes it is funny even if you ignore the choices of laughter but do not rob the funny ones. It is also one of the few examples in which characters are beautiful (excuses for meat trade) actually effective and funny. <br /> <br /> Is it all in a family or Seinfeld-type show? Absolutely not. However, it is definitely better than to show as "Til Deat (probably the worst TV show of any type out) at the moment." <br /> <br /> Oh and mom is not too bad and Hilary's character is a bit hottie.
