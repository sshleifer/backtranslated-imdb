Brown returned to his role last year ("Slaughter") for this harsh aftermath. In the original, he had devastated his parents' killing, wiping out a huge mobile organization in Mexico. Here he is the person responsible for money laundering, as outlined by McMahon. When the first attempted murder fails, Brown is once again in action, hitting the back of the gangster, trying to protect his new girlfriend, Hendry. Although the original film was generally a better and more cohesive film, it provides all the uses for much heavier doses, making the genre more enjoyable for fans. After a rather frightening opening on the horse's back and a pretty deadly car running down the city street at night, this movie is moving at a very fast pace. Every few minutes, one or more of the following occurs: drug use, sex, nudity, gun, murder or any other activity. Brown is his usual trustworthy, friendly self, assisted by his amazing physical presence, running through any rigidity of the long journey. McMahon is a rebellion! Tinted glasses and her hair left the middle (!), She shows that she commanded her bands and heard her passionate bimbo loves. Seeing Johnny Carson's engaging role in this role is a perverse thrill. Stroud gives the impression that it is an intense, racially spectacular brawler, while Peters adds a little class to the uprising police detective who supports Brown's help. Unfortunately, no mention has been made of Brown's original connectors Don Gordon and Stella Stevens. Suddenly, Brown now has a girlfriend (Hendry) who is pleasant enough but has no previous Stups admiration and personality. Williams makes a fraudulent bang who can seem to pick a girl from a bar and make him a direct member of his harem. Cinematography and general direction are less filmed than the first film, but it has a drive and a sense of danger that goes beyond the original. The film spends a lot of time in wastewater of organized crime, drugs, prostitution, and other things, but it remains of interest for the creativity of its phases of action and now for its astonishing political correctness. One odd remark: The first film had the main supporter who was killed but appeared here in a different role.
