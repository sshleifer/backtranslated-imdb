This is a great flick! It's funny for everyone, even for adults. With it, we got Jason Voorhees / Leatherface like a killer with other crazy people. Very funny flick for kids of all ages. Should it be rented every time we went to the video store! Buster and Babs make a good pair and love a party. He's probably my favorite sign! I was never great on TV shows, but this movie brings back so many great memories. Must see families, exhibition fans or anyone! Nice, how small or old you are! RENT IT NOW IN YOUR LOCAL VIDEOS! <br /> <br /> P.S. USE OF NEEDS!
