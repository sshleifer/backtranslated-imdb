Spoiler Alert I worked as a supplement to this Lifetime TV movie (filmed in Seattle). This is really interesting when you are involved in creating a movie, as they are usually still in the process of writing parts (as was the case here) or making cuts and major changes to the final parts. My husband and I both worked as extras in this movie and I remind them that they are talking about how it was determined whether a little girl would eventually die. Frankly, I never thought that Margaret Colin's character was really punished for his crime that hit and ran, lied to the police, covers, etc. the victim instead of stopping his comic? Just think about something. <br /> <br /> By the way, I play a police detective that you see for a few seconds and my husband plays another detective that you see quite often (we've read four times). Margaret Colin was glad to work together and very much on earth, although Lisa Vidal (now a lifelong regular) had left. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie was about 7/10, but as the other poster commented, it is still a real tear-jerker and makes a big Saturday afternoon cable.
