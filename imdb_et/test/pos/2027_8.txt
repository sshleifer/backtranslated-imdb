I saw this movie when he came out. I was thinking about the average movie. I have now realized that this director was ahead of his time. It's a great movie and a great soundtrack. I've seen my part of rock movies, but even though it's not far from the spinal tap (which I didn't like)> This movie takes us to the 80s rocker who wants to be something else. This is nothing more than our inner child who wants to grow up and be * ROCK STAR * Yes, I said that. Everyone wants to grow and be in the spotlight (the weather has said or not). This movie just puts you in the heart of emotions and you can almost feel the excitement of Izzy. I have to admit that the actor was less par, but the music and story was enough to hold you up until the credit was rolled. It is worth a look, especially if you are to be a powerful hair band fan.
