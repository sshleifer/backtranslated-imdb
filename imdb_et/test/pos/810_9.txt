Hollow is a wonderful mystery of murder that gives everything you expect from Agatha Christie and of course Poirot. It's set in a country house weekend. As always, all guests are suspect and Poirot has the right to find out the truth. With such films, it is always better not to give too much, so I stop here. What I "loved" was that it was an old-fashioned way. When Poirot arrives, everything is around the body, for example. Everyone seems to be the culprit. There's this dubious look and the atmosphere is just a story perfect. <br /> <br /> You can wait for a wonderful time to guess who it is and how and why, and maybe even surprised at last. A cup of hot chocolate on a cold winter night and you have a pretty enjoyable experience. <br /> <br /> The actors are all very good. Curiosity was noted by Edward Hardwicke, who played dr. Watsoni Sherlock Holmes. Nice to see him in a few years. Suchet is amazing as always and luckily most of the time on the screen. <br /> <br /> I found who was the murderer, but it's not yet predictable and it's also very plausible. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a great movie and always a joy. <br /> <br />
