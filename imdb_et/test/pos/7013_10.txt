Like most women, this movie is a very chick-flick. It's hot chemistry, sexy dance rountines and beaitiful songs, I mean timeless classic like (I've been) Time for my life and wonderful she's like the wind doing this movie. I adore Patrick Swayen in this movie and he shows he can sing and dance so hot. She sings in the movie "She's Like the Wind". Chemistry between Swayze and co-star Jennifer Gray is amazing. I love all the dances and everything that comes with it. But saying it Dirty Dancing 2: - Havana Nights is also great, but Patrick Swayze's scenes do it. I love songs, dancing and all that, but it's not Dirty Dancing. As I said, it's an amazing chick. Please give your 3rd place because I love seeing what happens to Patrick's character Johnny. Jennifer's character could have been more sexy, but hey Patrick does it if you know what I mean! Big movie and I'm so glad Billy Zane didn't win the role of the movie. I heard the whispering that was meant for him, but they discovered he couldn't dance.
