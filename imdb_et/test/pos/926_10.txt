Master Kieslowsky came up with the idea in 1993, the idea was a portrait of how human relations are in today's world, passing through Blue (a crafted visual masterpiece of a woman's life) White (visual comedy about film marriage) and finally arriving at the Red (masterpiece that deals with people's communication). <br /> <br /> Although I am not breaking the movement, I can easily say that red is the best film of the 90s because it has one of the strongest scripts I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The movie starts a little slow, but finds its rhythm early enough to hold it through the movie. <br /> <br /> Performances are perfect, sublime. because the characters are completely realistic and they are not in any way cliche and no one can wait for fewer participants and one is not disappointed ... seriously believe that Jean Louis Tringtignat deserves at least an Oscar. <br /> <br /> Zbiegnew Preisner's music is amazing, it's one of the best pieces of music. Piotr Sobocinski's cinematic art is also outstanding, he received the Oscar for it (and earned it). <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is perfect for 10 and loved by people who love foreign cinema and people who don't love it. t. Don't miss it. <br /> <br /> How terrible Pulp Fiction progressed outside of my understanding of this Cannes masterpiece
