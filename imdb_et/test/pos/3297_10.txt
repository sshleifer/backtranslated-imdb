When I look short, like Boy-Next-Door, I find myself a kind of bittersweet feeling. On the one hand, I'm happy. I look at something that is well thought out, smoothly executed and just encouraging to be interesting. On the other hand, I find myself generally on the level of comedy. The TV and the movies are so consistently packed with a mild and embarrassing mess that we appreciate excellence in mediocrity. Then you see someone like Davis who, without studio notes or a significant budget, "benefits"; can create a really cool little comic pearl. Manufacturers and networking opportunities must turn to Travis Davis to find material and stop bidding on people simply because their resume or agent may require them to do so. Hopefully, Boy-Next-Door has attracted the right people to help Davis work more. It's really fun and very well done!
