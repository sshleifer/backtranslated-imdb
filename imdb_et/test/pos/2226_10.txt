I saw it in a movie at Pablo CO during a vacation. I had just finished my biomedical work in the hospital. I find that the script is exaggerated by the type of actual material in hospitals. <br /> <br /> Ideas that put the value of this production down would not get a point and they probably never went to the hospital. And never worked one for sure. Billy Jack (of the same age) was very poorly produced, but he had a remarkable social comment and it was a very good film with a real social message. <br /> <br /> I've ever searched for this movie, it's the first site I found where it's mentioned.
