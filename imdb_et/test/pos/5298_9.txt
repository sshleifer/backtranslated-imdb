I have a strong feeling that what you think about this movie depends heavily on your frame of reference. If you've never seen a Miyazaki movie before, it's probably confusing for you. If you've seen a Miyazaki movie before, it's probably confusing. That's because I found that for the first time I saw one of his animated films, I tried to understand too much about what's happening and why - and that influenced the enjoyment of my movie. Now that I've seen almost every Miyazaki movie, I see it odd and just take it all - enjoying it all. In many ways, these movies (at least western audiences) are like drugs - many wonderful and beautiful pictures that may not always make sense at first, but they certainly feel good! Of all Miyazaki's films, it can be the most unusual and understandable story - even more so than SPIRITED AWAY and PRINCESS MONONOKE or MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO. But like these and many other Giblings in the studio, if you just sit and watch, you'll be asked for a fabulous story. But because it's so hard to describe (and others have done it), I'm not even going here. <br /> <br /> As for art, it is very typical of one of these Japanese films. was a noticeable change. The use of background colored pencils seemed very widespread. It wasn't a bad thing at all - the lovely pastel-like look was very pleasant and unique. In some way, it seemed that Bill Plympton's artistic style was a little bit of a Miyazaki movie. With a high frame rate, extraordinary animation (which swallowed up a ton of personality) and a large "wow factor", this is an extraordinary film of all ages. Although it is clearly intended for more young people (especially TOTORO fans), it is here and there a bit scary (during storm segments), but there are many good things for adults. As an adult (at least chronologically) I loved to love things and praised the film differently to the world. <br /> <br /> Great movie - Miyazaki's best. I'm not giving it to 10 because I am hesitant to ever do it - plus I did some more of the other movies in the studio (especially TOTORO). But that does not mean that you should not hurry and watch it now - do it and do it yourself.
