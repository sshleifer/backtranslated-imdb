In Russia, an ordinary teenager, Vera (Natalja Negoda), lives with her drunken father and her simple mother, without waiting and calling for a telephone operator's technical course. His brother Victor (Aleksandr Negreba) lives in Moscow with his family and occasionally visits his dysfunctional family and Vera, always being a motive for debate. When Vera meets Sergei Sokolov at the university, they love each other and decide to marry. Sergei moves to Vera's home, but lives in conflict with his father. This relationship leads to a family tragedy. <br /> <br /> I've just seen "Malenkaya Vera" and I liked this deep family drama. I do not know the lifestyle of the former URSS, but there are some unusual behaviors that I found very interesting. The first when Victor tells Vera that he wasn't created because his parents wanted to get him, but because they wanted to go to a bigger apartment. Another, when the family goes to the truck beach. In the Third World countries, many of the difficulties, repression in the park, and other situations in the film have been widespread in the Vera family and their friends. This low-budget movie is very well targeted and the story is very deep and real. Great performances cast and actor Natalia Negoda is very beautiful. The Brazilian VHS cover issued by the Sagres distributor contains information that Natalya Negoda was the focal point of Playboy. I'm not sure how exact the subtitles are in Portuguese because many long sentences spoken in Russian are limited to a short translation with a few words. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Pequena Vera" ("The Little Vera")
