Dexter (Kurt Russell) returns from the computer by wearing tennis shoes for a new adventure that may be independent. Dexter, who is always a college student with a tendency to get lost, has the idea that things can be made invisible by the formula. Dean Higgins (Joe Flynn) is less than surprised and hopes to win a lucrative science award for a bee student. But the bees are stabbing the student and he is allergic. There's a chance to get a prize. But wait, Dexter does it! He actually does the fluid that makes him invisible. The problem is that the shameless businessman (Cesar Romero) learns about it and decides that he can use this formula, thank you for something illegal. Can he steal a bottle of Dexter out of his nose? It's a companion to TCWT, but there's no need to see this movie. Russell is a brilliant leading screwdriver who comes through when it really counts. The rest is the dream where Flynn, Romero, Jim Bacchus and others show why their comics are still highly valued today. The script is simply innocent fun that is charming, the special effects are somewhat simple by today's standards, but still effective. If you want to sit and live in an old age or just want to share a high-quality G-movie with your family, this is a great choice. Although it is over 30 years old, there is a great chance that even now you will see your loved ones with blues to show this fine flick.
