One of the best films I've ever seen - the classic movie "Matrix". For many years I have been trying to get it on VHS or DVD - without results. However, the German film and television industry prefers to give valuable cultural contributions (and that is Fassbinder, all!) To break down and collect dust in some archives instead of commercially distributing it (and making a lot of money if it stimulates it instead of promoting creative thinking). Although WDR once told me whether I would pay the DEM 200,000 (then not refunded) for copyright control, and then 8 DM per minute of copying, plus the cost of the materials, they weigh (one!) For making a copy for me. Some way to sell something! The same problem is with many other TV films or series like "So we die die Füße tragen", "Sonntagseltern", "Kellerkinder" and others. Excellent TV series - Never hear. Germany wake up! <br /> <br /> RENEWING from March 2007: Last year, I can finally get a WDR "Mittschnittservice" from a DVD of about 50 Euros. Great!
