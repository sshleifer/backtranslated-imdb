Maybe my rating should have been 9, but the movie looked at me for the first time, and my last review confirmed my initial conviction. Stylish yes, all scenes have shaped views, great angles with the perfect side of sound. <br /> <br /> Especially on Toni Servillo, upload great actors, collect one of the most beautiful and charming women, Olivia Magnan and the exquisite plot, and you will see it over and over again. <br /> <br /> Paulo Sorrentina's next film "L'Amico De Famiglia", which is competing this year at the Cannes Festival, is eagerly awaited.
