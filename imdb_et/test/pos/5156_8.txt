You can't really name Roy Andersson (6 films in 37 years). Nor can you blame him for the usual; he does not "straight line", at least when it comes to narrative. "You, Life", his first film in seven years, is like a surreal documentary that shows a large number of characters that do nothing very much and, if it sounds outward, let me assure you that it is not. It's a funny, accessible and surprisingly warm-hearted movie, a living pill that is far from what we usually see on the screen. <br /> <br /> Of course, the "piece of life" is hardly the right moniker to apply this movie because most people's life is probably not something like that. The on-screen incidents are almost terrifyingly up to normal and downright crappy, and while characters can be flit, sometimes never seen again, others appear when they want to approve, Andersson gives them all sort of benevolent affection. This and some rolling music will ensure that the time spent with them takes time.
