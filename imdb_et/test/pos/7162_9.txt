When I have been filming a movie for the film at the SXSW film festival, this is a movie from the opening night with me. Curious, because it's a dark comedy with a rather absurd assumption. <br /> <br /> The family of hyper-stressed fundamentalists is like a car accident in a small community. Four of these three have the same fatal experience in which they are fully open, because everyone gets a reversal of the original concept of sin (I don't violate it with the specific characteristics of the scene). Fourth, a central school student is not just a physical illness, but also unchanging and is now witnessing his crazy, apparently mentally bankrupt family. Every new moment brings a new outrage because they are innocently naked and honestly changed in every sense, awful to him and then to the community. <br /> <br /> Franklin's forgiveness is the most beautiful scene of sexual awakening between husband and wife, I've ever seen Sarah Brightman's song "Deliver Me", a song that can bring tears to my eyes. <br /> <br /> Cast is terrible. Robertson Dean as the father of Vince Pavia's son and Aviva as the cheerleader's daughter is excellent, Mari Blackwell plays Peggy, her mother interviews the neighbor and her best friend perfectly, much more subtle, accurate and realistic than what could have been (all Peggy in the middle of America knows everything Peggy ). And Theresa Willis glows positively as Betty, mother. Three changed characters play a lot of risks and reward these risks. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie will get a wide release - if so, I plan to see it again. <Br /> <br /> Very accurate review at: http://www.fosteronfilm.com/phil/forgiving.htm
