I just voted great because this film took two Americana pictures: one in 1970 and one after every year. <br /> <br /> Nothing really changed. <br /> <br /> Joe is really a jerk, a big dumb slider who's crazy for everyone else in the world for his idiot. It's not really a spoiler, but the key to the movie is big, the corporate "never does wrong" guy who interacts with friends on this half-troglodyte with Joe, and he gets some kind of validation ... feeling. But few say that a reseller boy deserves to die. And these kids shouldn't have hung up Joe and Compton. And Joe and Compton actually got into the hash and young skin until they hung up. A simple film in many ways, except that in 1970, Nixon's care in New York was in the battle zone and the entire Vietnam War. Writing it (2/25/2007) is a "very long wait" for this movie on Netflix - it makes me happy because I think there are people who want to learn. It was a pretty good moment - not precise, a bit of a cartoonist, but actually it was close to how it was. And the frightening thing is - things haven't changed so much. Of course, there is no more prosperity, but it just means that you have won the slavery. Amazing how millionaires complain about not making enough money, they complain that $ 5.15 an hour is too much to pay for these people.
