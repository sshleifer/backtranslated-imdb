He did one at Christmas to try and bring a number one song, and now the terrible Justin Lee Collins wanted to reunite the cast members and perhaps some of his favorite TV crew as a child, the A-Team. The only member he could not get was the late George Peppard, who played Col. John "Hannibal" Smith, but he got some psyche to try and help. He was able to reunite all members, including Dirk Benedict (Mrs Templeton's "Faceman" Peck # 2), who went to Celebrity Big Brother in 2007, Dwight Schultz (Captain HM "Jumping Mad" Murdock), Melinda Culea (Amy Amanda Allen) William Lucking (Colonel Lynch) and Lance LeGault (Colonel Roderick Decker, the only team member to die). He spoke to Mr. T (Sgt. Bosco "BA" Baracus ") in an interview, but he didn't get back in. It was really fun to see him trying to find them and talk to them, though they probably didn't want to, and of course reunification is great very good!
