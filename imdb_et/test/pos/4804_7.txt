One thing you can say about RUNNING OUT OF TIME is that it is a tremendously clever film. It is interesting to note that the film's writers are French, which can explain the film "out of the norm", because it does not really fit in the name "Hong Kong Cinema". <br /> <br /> The film is about a thief who plans revenge against some criminal types, using the same intelligent police help. But first of all, he must convince the police of his personal crusade so that a series of games begins where the thief plans his police. <br /> <br /> A pretty smart movie. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (For a more detailed review of this movie or for a complete overview of other foreign movies, visit www.nixflix.com)
