As a former (nuclear) submarine officer, I have to admit that this is my favorite submarine film (even over the Red October wolf). Someone knew something about submarines when writing a movie. OK - not realistic - but it's comedy - and it has all the "internal jokes" on the submarine. Great hurt with the stereotypical uptroot boys "Orlandos" and our heroes diesel engine. Definitely "DBF" by the way = it means diesel engine vessels forever. But they want ten lines to post it - is the admiral here in jee? <br /> <br /> Line 10.
