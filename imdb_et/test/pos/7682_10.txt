I was in the US.E.F. and remember this movie very well. we were just created with Stereo Sound! o-o-o-o-o! Well, it was a big deal in 1959. in the game when the projected curtain rod was closed and I also followed the university curtain closed. the theater curtain was closed as an intermediate stop and after five minutes I restarted the film when the projection curtain was closed when the music was used as part of the second part of the curtain ring. I was the first stereo movie I've ever seen and that was such a great musical production, I enjoyed it every time I showed it.
