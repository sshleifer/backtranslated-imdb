It was Bollywood's response to Fatal's attraction and this is a classic film in its own right. Driver Chawla was good and so was Sunny Deol, but it was Shah Rukh Khan, who was shot famous. Since then he has become Chopra's favorite (Dilwale Dulhaniya le Jayenge, Mohhabatein, Dil to under shark, Veer Zaara and Chak De India). At first, Shah Rukh seems to be a villain, but in the end, you begin to sympathize with him. Scripting was great and the songs were graphic designers. My favorites are just moss and Jaadu teri nazar. <br /> <br /> After the disappointed attack by Lamhe Yash Chopra, Darry fought back. Dialogues were memorable, often repeated in K..k..Kirani. Because Darr Yash Chopra has slipped a bit. Dil to under shark was bad, but he redeemed himself a little with Veer Zaar, which was much better. It was Yash Chopra's last masterpiece.
