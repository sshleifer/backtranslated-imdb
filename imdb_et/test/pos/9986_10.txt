I'm not a golf fan in any way. On May 26 at 10.30, the film started with a scene at the end of the 1800s. Old movies that I like but not golf, but the first scene awakens the voices of the young boys (Harry Vardon). He's going out to ask what they're doing, and they say they are building golf ... So, I turned the TV off, but something interrupted me and it was back in. The film is great. Then we see this young boy now as a man; a professional golfer haunted by childhood visions. Then we meet Francis's actual focus and decisions about golf. You will meet your mother and father who want to protect him from the class, which is so obvious during this period. Then there is the little Eddie Lowery, whose caddy is with encouraging words and little push that has won Francis. Don't want to give up too much. I was up to 2 A.M. It's super, look at the movie.
