HOW if any of the "golden days" idea of ​​quiet movies succeeded, you can bet your sub-dollar to repeat it; although "reprocessing" is a term used. Of course, it could be said that this recycling company has never left us, the success of a movie or television always leads to a trend; all competing parties compete for their mentioned hit or television version. <br /> <br /> We strongly agree with this last assumption; it's copying or plagiarism, plain and simple. <br /> <br /> This latest Silent Laurel & Hardy Short must certainly be well received; For ANGORA LOVE (Hal Roach / MGM, 1929), Roach Lot was processed not once, but twice in the next three years. We were treated with LAUGHING GRAVY (Roach / MGM, 1931), where the goat was replaced by a cute little puppy. The weather will also become dead in the winter, in the midst of snowstorms. They also made other changes to replace landlord Edgar Kennedy with the landlord Charlie Hall. <br /> <br /> The second reprocessing of hidden animal husbandry is 3 Reeler, THE CHIMP (Roach / MGM, 1932), which replaced the woman's monkey from the dissolved and lost circus, which Stan and Babe were former employees. The circus paid off its employees and the boys received the Chimprit for their final payday. <br /> <br /> BACK to our original victim, today's theme, ANGORA LOVE. Recomember? Short starts just enough. The boys encounter the goat on the street and the newborn follows them back to their house; when Stan feeds him a donut. The following comics are created between L&H and the slow burn exponent, their landlord Edgar Kennedy. The impact of the incident is amplified when the interaction occurs at night. And if it was happiness; their room is directly above the landlord's quarter. <br /> <br /> In addition to noise, goat bathing, its smell, and landlord Edgar's suspicion that Laurel & Hardy has another person in the room illegally; we were most entertained by a small thrower that the censors could well forget. While the boys are noisy about the noise they did, reminding them of the rules of the house concerning the presence of unauthorized people overnight, regardless of their gender. <br /> <br /> The image of the ITS camera is made over the boy's shoulder. In the hall with Edgar and in front of them, he warns; "Remember, this is a respectable facility!" As he says, the lady dressed in the evening walks over and behind the landlord; followed by the uniform of Sailor, who tends to move his hat when they pass! POODLE SCHNITZ !!
