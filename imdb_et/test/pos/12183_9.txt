*** May contain Spoiler *** OK, it wasn't exactly as good as expected, in fact it was a lot different than I thought it would be, but it turned out to be a pretty good movie. <br /> I usually don't care too much about this type of music, but it worked perfectly in this movie (I mean he is a rock star), but I still loved Stuart Townsend in this and Aaliyah, although he had a small part of the movie was amazing . <br /> <br /> And while Tom Cruise was playing in an interview with a vampire, I have to admit that I am pleased that he has rejected his role, although I usually hate to use different people playing the same characters as lakes and things. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was great and I enjoyed watching it, even if there were parts that might have been better. Big vampire movie.
