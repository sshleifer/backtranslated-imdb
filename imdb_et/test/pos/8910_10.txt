MONKEY is definitely one of the best shows ever shown on TV. I remember when I was a kid, I go to my grandmother's house every Saturday morning and I turn on the TV so I can watch MONKEY. I love it. It had kickass scenes, cool special effects, a great story, a fantastic theme song that never provided head and fun duplication. But it's strange that it's set in China and the actors are filmed in Japan and filmed in Japan, but it doesn't stop making this TV show lovable. <br /> <br /> MONKEY is about three people's adventures: Pigsy (Toshiyuki Nishida), Sandy (Shir√¥ Kishibe) and, of course, an unforgettable and lovable character, a monkey (Masaaki Sakai) who travel from China to India to get the world's holy reels. <Br>> <br /> MONKEY is very fun and it is magic.
