I'm sure the movie contains some logic gaps, but I was so fascinated that I really don't care. The movie plays like a fun, light-looking teen romp with Schwarzenegger-type action. It is packed with action full of excitement and humorous moments. Sean Astin is fun to watch, and I haven't seen Louis Gossetti because I saw in Diggstown theaters. She is a good, undervalued actor and I love to watch her on the screen. I just don't know what he's doing now. Unfortunately, he may be in many of these live video clips. Hopefully my assumption is wrong. Anyway, it's funny, your seat thriller, and I'd definitely recommend checking it out. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
