I still think of a "police team!" An absolute funny TV show of the 1980s. Somewhere, at least in BetaMax, I have all six episodes. I knew that the show was not good and that I had to keep it myself. When was the stupid ABC? They were quoted saying that the viewers did not know "Police Team!" was a comedy because it didn't have a laugh! Right! If Drebin has a line like "You take the opportunity to get up in the morning, drive to work, or face a fan," how can comedy be??!? I've seen every episode at least ten times and I still see something new. Even in the deep background there are always moves. Don't miss it if you have the chance to see the episode, but if you read it, you probably already have copies that are somewhere out.
