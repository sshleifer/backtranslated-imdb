Chop Shop, another feature of Ramin Bahran, is a rare breed. This is an American film that tells the story that American cinema usually does not find, the story of a minority living in poverty. It's a simple beauty. A look at Chop Shop in the shadows of the New York Queensis Shea Stadium is a nuclear reality. For non-actors, it is more common with Vittorio De Sica's classic bicycle thieves than anything done in the United States. There is no score or no soundtrack, all the music and sounds are diagetic. Looking at how you feel when you watch a great foreign film, it leads to another world because it is so rare to see. But this second world is not the post-Second World War Rome or Istanbul or New Delhi, it is a modern New York City. <br /> <br /> Bahrai is spoken by Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco), better known as Alejandro. She is a 12-year-old Latin American child who has no parents or family members after her. She lives in a small room in a car shop where she works. She shares the same bed with her teenage sister Isamar (Isamar Gonzales). Neither of them has done it in another class. Ale, though young, is tough and mature. He is the leader of a small family. She grabs her sister's job and she does something to beat her when it doesn't work in a chopper shop. He sells bicycles on the streets and candy on subways. She searches for scrap metal parts and sells it to many streets where she lives, lining up at many car stores. <br /> <br /> Alejandro is a heartbeat when he learns that his sister is working as a prostitute. He himself will gradually withdraw from law when he abides. He starts stealing, the first car parts and later the purses. Like Antonio, the desperate protagonist of bicycle theft, we can't blame Ale. It's just survival. Ale and Isamar save you the hope that you will buy a vending machine for $ 4,500. They see the truck's exit and a lot of optimism. But, as is usual with neo-realism, we know that it only leads to disappointment. <br /> <br /> Polanco's riveting is the legitimacy of Chop Shop's realism. Here is a 12-year-old character that must be credibly independent and vulnerable to na√Øve. Whether he drives cars to the store, sells movies and snickers bars, or plays his sister in his little room, is authentic. <br /> <br /> The Chop Shop is a nice reminder that not all American children grow up in a land of opportunities. Ale's lifestyle is what many middle-class white Americans have in the "third world". They know poverty and deprivation in foreign countries when they eat their coffee and read the New York Times on Sunday morning, but make themselves blind in their streets. When you look at the Chop Shop, you think differently from the children in the subway. <br /> <br /> More comments at www.mediasickness.com
