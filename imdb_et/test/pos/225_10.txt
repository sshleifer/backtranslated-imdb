I watched this series after I saw the Naked Gun movies. I found it much better than movies and I thought the movies were great! This series literally brings the next TV, vision or funny situation (all night wig, club flamingo) waiting. I don't think I've ever laughed at the TV series in my life, even after the first sight of the movie, and so knowing some jokes. I think it's shameful that only six episodes were produced, but I agree that the writers would be very difficult to maintain this comedy level for more episodes. Generally, the series needs to be seen by those who like puns, bad jokes and shocks.
