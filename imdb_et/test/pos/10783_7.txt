I really chose this movie for my husband working in radio broadcasting. I thought it would be more of a movie that she would enjoy and like, even though it was eighties, so it was a bit dated. This movie actually pulls you in. Sometimes you just want to strangle, Barry. Sometimes you just want to send some big words to a real concentration camp. Sometimes Barry is very sorry because he has become too big for his jeans if you know what I mean. It was a drama channel in Encore - so I think it's a real story. If you really love dramas, you will love it even if you don't know all the broadcasting company inputs. If you are a fan of Alec Baldwin and you look at it, you shouldn't. His part is really a little part of this movie.
