I think I'm a runner fan. I don't care if predictable, I laugh anyway. "Beep, beep" is mostly predictable, though at the same time it is quite brilliant. Of course, the Road Runner is driven by Coyote and of course the Coyote runner cannot catch every new attempt. Coyote's plans are very funny. You see exactly where it goes wrong and you are not disappointed. Well, once you are disappointed with what you think will not happen, but it makes fun even funny. Predictable gags work and animation is sometimes great and quite original.
