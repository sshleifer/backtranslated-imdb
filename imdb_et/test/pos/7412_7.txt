I just saw this movie in the hidden preview, and before reading your comment you need to know that it is very subjective because I love Techno, Trance, Club, House and such music. <br /> <br /> The film deals with Carl, whose brother Jason (or whatever his name was) died in an accident: he fell on the roof, "drunk." Carl meets his brother's girlfriend Sunny and two of them are quite unmotivated for some kind of private investigation into Jason's death, and Carl participates in Jason's former life full of club and drugs. From an artistic point of view, the film is nothing more than a big bunch of s ** t. The plot is predictable, all the characters are extremely cliched and two-dimensional (a small town fool boy, a young beautiful innocent girl, a big bad drug king ... the list is endless) and most of the operations like the plot are not just plausible. Matthew Rhys' enchanting boy, who arrives in London and unexpectedly does not even know the drugs, does not seem very credible, unlike his female colleague Sunny, a Sienna Guillory presentation whose behavior seems more realistic to the spectator. Something other than joking was the presentation by Tim Curry's King of Drummy: Fake caricature, too "eeeevil" and just too ridiculous to be true. <br /> <br /> But: if you like club music (club scenes) like the chosen stories are just brilliant), if you enjoy the simple love of sweet girls like Sunny (yes, I admit, I lost my heart;) ... which makes my comment even more subjective, I think) (predictable) revolutions you will surely enjoy from this movie. <br /> <br /> Someone else: FORGET .... IT! <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (objective view) <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 (my personal position and my final vote)
