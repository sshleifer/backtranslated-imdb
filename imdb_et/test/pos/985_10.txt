For a TV movie it was definitely worth it. All the actions were very well done and the story itself concerned a universal theme. I have not read / seen the original, and as a rule, I can't stand Shakespeare, but I enjoyed this movie (the Civil War setting was also very well done). Don't wait to see the epic, but you should move enough to enjoy it. By the way (a side note) it does not compare (or some other film on this issue) with the original work. Movies do not have to transfer the book to the screen, but rather take that general idea and then adjust the story. When people say "the book was so much better" (they're usually wrong), what they're really trying to say is that book is so different.
