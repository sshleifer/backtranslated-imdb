"Boogie Nights" uses its main character, Dirk Diggler, as a metaphor for acclaimed celebrities from the decades of America's shameful past, consisting of an unexpected rise in pornography, resulting in a number of corrupt youth. Its leading character borrows the qualities of various real actors, engaging in many of the illicit things that Hollywood celebrities have hit and too often used in the press. It seems that such a long story that may appear E! True Hollywood Story special. Drugs, Sex and Violence - American Dream. But what comes up must fall, and the bigger it is, the harder it will fall. <br /> <br /> Dirk Diggler's dreams are great as well as another valuable asset on his body. The real name of Dirki is Eddie Adams, a California who dreams of becoming a star. He believes that God gives one person a great gift on every planet and his gift is quite unusual. Eddie leaves with her mother and leaves Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), an adult film director who offers her a job. Eddie finally becomes a big porn star, representing most of the Horner's leading "actor". Eddie is told he needs to find a new alias so Dirk Diggler is born. <br /> <br /> Eddie / Dirk himself is based mainly on the infamous porn star John Holmes, whose biography was adapted to Wonderland in 2003, which played Val Kilmer. "Boogie Nights" is arguably the best of the two, which proves that movies about pornography can be done without the target audience reluctantly: regular cinema visitors. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in 1977, the artistic era of pornography - filmmakers really believed they were able to compensate for the low points of X-rated features by adding deep stories and an enchanting atmosphere. In a sense, film director Paul Thomas Anderson applies a very artistic approach to a project that results in a free and artistic film of history in American history, when smut was indeed both free and artistic. Anderson's style is so profound and so special that we will soon feel that we will start the era again. No moment will come if we are not convinced of the time span in the film. <br /> <br /> Not everyone was happy with the Boogie Nights collection. Before filming, Anderson repeatedly asked Reynolds to play Horner's role several times. Finally, Reynolds agreed, but claimed that the film was a terrible and worst role in his career, without publicly proclaiming it before applying for the best supporting actor's academic award and suddenly sticking to it. A year ago, Anderson wore Sydney / Hard Eight headlines. He preferred the last title for his movie, and New Line Cinema thought the first was more marketable. He lost the battle in essence, and Anderson often ruled out the title disputes by adding his movie "boogie nights". "<br /> <br /> Casting a film is one of the best aspects of his films. Regular Paul Thomas Anderson is here, as well as the biggest peak of all first-time journalists. Known for the stars: John C. Reilly, Phillip Seymour, Hoffman, Luis Guzman, William H Macy, Heather Graham, and Julianne Moore, but the whole movie is essentially about Mark Wahlberg, Eddie, who is surprisingly convincing in his role. Wahlberg, formerly known for his singing career and disappointing Hollywood hobbies, has all the necessary features to portray such a character. is his best role so far. <br /> <br /> Anderson knows how to conquer his audience and complete control over every scene. When Jack Horner meets Eddie for the first time, Anderson cleverly uses the stars in the background, a sign of things and hidden symbolism so The scene is three minutes long, a long follow-up that follows Jack and Amber into the nightclub, where for the first time most of the characters are presented. discussions about Robert Altman's The Player tracking techniques - it works so brilliantly at Boogie Nights and is the first sign that Anderson knows what he's doing behind the camera. His style has evolved rapidly into Martin Scorsese's vein, where shots shrink quite quickly but never seem to hurry. By the way, Anderson refers to the two classic Scorsese shots - the closing De Niro mirror language "Raging Bull" and the watching nightclub "GoodFellas". Anderson is a young, growing director who, despite his age, is a very adult story and direction. If his first full-length "Hard Eight" feature was remarkably smart and terrible, then "Boogie Nights" is even more. After shooting the extraordinary Hard Eight in 1996, Anderson's film is pragmatic so extreme that it seems almost genuine. Boogie Nights animates us with its free content that occasionally borders on the edge of pornography, but it is much more complicated than such a trash. It is a relaxing and wonderful contemporary masterpiece that is as moody as clear and stylish. Anderson's best film is said to be one of the biggest and most important projects of the last decade.
