Here is one of Jane Austen's films, which I found very pleasant. I read the book first, then listened to it on the CD and wondered how a young Victorian girl could convince her married man she loved because she had no luck or education. Glad to find out that Anne is probably reunited with lost love. The fact that his godfather is trying to marry him is not a cousin who is just for money. Looking at sniffing from the upper classes and how class divisions pair their hearts. Captain Wentworth realizes that he loves Anne after seven years. His last notion that Anne's love was constant all the time and did not let her family confuse her true happiness and the marriage she really loved.
