In Sudan, the Arabs rule and are constantly at war with Christians and animate living in the south of this East African country. This movie follows Dinka's boys, a cattle tribe who was orphaned after their village's destruction and their families were killed by a brutal attack by Arab troops. Most of these boys are now teenagers and are called "lost boys". <br /> <br /> The filmmaker follows his "missing boys" group because they have been accepted as refugees in the US. where they let Houston. Those who have been accepted as refugees have a fame status because they know (what they have heard) that America is amazing. Traveling from Sudan to America is like a "road to heaven," says one young man. To leave them, a big party is thrown out and they are told that they are doing well in Sudan and, once they are educated, return to Sudan so they can contribute to Dinka's society. They are also warned not to be "those with pants bags" who are responsible for the black men's negative stereotype, and whatever happens, not to forget about Dinka's culture. <br /> <br /> See how boys come from a third world to America and how they try to integrate into American society, as they have practically gone to a rich world where everything is massively overshadowed and overwhelmed. They are taught about purity and how to use every day's self-evident utilities. Sometimes it is humorous, humble to others. <br /> <br /> Listening to the comments they make about black Americans and American society / culture is quite interesting. As the film progresses, you will see how American culture begins to corrupt its formerly modest ways of thinking. One of the guys, Peter, is not happy to live and do enough to survive. moves from Houston to Kansas City to educate. When other boys visit him, they talk about how they can't get to any school. The main reason they came to America was education and the media say boys come from Sudan for education. This happens because the boys got an arbitrary age, making them older than they really are, preventing them from enrolling in high school. <br /> <br /> Film equals images from Houston to Kansas. We look at Peter's school at school, where he communicates with his friends with Christian conservative children and when Santiago tries a driving school (even if he's driving without his license) and works in Walmart. We see Peter fighting for high school when he tries to change his school's basketball team and Santiago is struggling with work, hiring, tensioning in Sudan and, above all, coping with loneliness. > <br /> This is the point where boys want to return to Sudan and tell them that everything they teach about America is wrong. "You have to do it alone, do it all alone," one of the guys says. A true message to a liberal capitalist lifestyle that shows how it creates radical individualists (a trend that led to the creation of both neo-conservative and radical Islamist movements). But their biggest beef with America is that there is no time; time is money and we don't waste another! Despite this, boys never lose a sense of Dink culture. They celebrate South Sudan's Day of Liberation, which marks the day the SPLA began fighting in Sudan, a battle that continues today. They also meet other "Lost Boys" on the anniversary of their arrival in America, where they discuss their experiences in America compared to Sudan. When asked, one boy says that if he could live, he would prefer to live in Sudan. In America it is too lonely. They will never lose the feeling of their community, conditioned as part of their culture! <br /> <br /> This film makes us question how we live, puts us in doubt with the artificial happiness that materialism and nature have created within our societies. It also changes the way I look at refugees, I never take it for granted how hard they have to work and what immigrants mean a country like my own, Canada. This is a great movie. I laughed, shouted ... a very emotional journey and a very well made documentary. 10 out of 10
