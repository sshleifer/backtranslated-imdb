CAUTION: Potential spoilers in front! <br /> <br /> "Steven Spielberg presents Tiny Toon Adventures" was always one of my favorite cartoons that grew up (hell, it's still). And this film perfectly captures everything I love about the exhibition and puts it in a full-length form. <br /> <br /> Tokyo Movie Shinsa Studio Decorated (WB ordered each "Tiny Toons" project, and it was the best studio to deal with), the film begins at the end of the academic year at Acme Looniversity, a well-known college college where Buster and Babs Bunny (without relationships) and their teen tone peers learning animated lunacy, Looney Tune. After the last clock, the film is split into five different plots. Buster is engaged in the fight against Babs with a water gun that culminates in a wave of breakable oaks and tides, sending Buster, Babs, and Elmyra dogs downstream of Byron's inverted picnic table, looking for an adventure in the deep south. Plucky Duck talks to Hamton Pig and his family to come with them to HappyWorldLand, "Happy Place in the West Hemisphere", but he has to offer an agonizing ride and the risk of a chainsaw being a rider. Elmyra Cat Furball finally runs away, but she's not terrifying ... not when there is a lot of "amine" in the Acme Safari Park. Fifi la Fume devotes his summer walk, star of the movie to the hunt of Johnny Pew, hoping to get an autograph. Of course, the hotel where he is staying is almost impenetrable. And Shirley McLoon puts Acme Acres on the boardwalk ... and lets her off guard when Fowlmouth takes her to the horror strike "Skunkophobia". <br /> <br /> All these story lines are fun and some of them overlap. The only complaint I have about this movie is that it doesn't make full use of the Tiny Toons list - Dizzy Devil and Mary Melodie have only one scene, Gogo Dodo only appears at the beginning and end of the movie and Montana Max, Sweetie, Calamity Coyote and Little Beeper are not anywhere. However, they are excusable errors in a otherwise perfect movie. This movie is quite rare nowadays because it is over 12 years old and has never been known on a DVD, but I suggest you watch it - anyone who is a Warner Brose animation, either classic or contemporary, NEEDS look at this movie.
