This is a great movie. The story begins in Romania, where Billy Crystal stands for an agent who can talk to someone. Here is a really funny scene where Crystal is a child, and talks about his father who is rabbi to eat pork (you know that this is a parody of the Crystal religion). He's mostly gifted, and he's trying to find the wrong one for his latest movie. After knowing that the entire film has a terrible team, it accidentally falls into a small river. Believing he's dead, some big hands come to him. Later he thinks he's in the sky. He thinks he's not, but he's in a monastery. Believing God saved him, he becomes a monk, looking for who saved him. Later he finds 7 feet out of 7 people he casts as a perfect cable (he also says Shakespeare!). Watch the movie and find the rest!
