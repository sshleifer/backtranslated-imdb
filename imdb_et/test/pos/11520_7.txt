Take out all the parts of the movie that were "day" and stay back. Then you would have had a great story. The best part was the story of faith and wolf and their relationship. Diaz and Eccleston were wonderful. Brewster was pointless to sit. Surprisingly, you see Blythe Danner as a mother. He was great. Also look at Patrick Bergen as a father, always like (Sleeping with Enemy). It is very hippie, save the world, such a movie. Don't worry much about it, but I suggest that you only see it for Diaz's performance. It has a great choice and should be used more. Eccleston is, as always, convincing. She's wonderful!
