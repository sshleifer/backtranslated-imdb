There are movies that are just another version, not remakes, but just like others, it's not. Although it speaks of mafia, it is viewed in a different way, and often it only looks like a secondary issue. I went to see this movie case (because the other theater was full) and I was finally satisfied. It surprised me because of this black irony or cynicism and more and more interesting objects to analyze. It doesn't follow the classic ways of film, it's just different and I think it's not the only one. I am also very happy because it is Italian, and I was afraid that Italian directors and producers are not bold enough to change the themes. In this movie you can also look at a new Italian style, but it is not blocked as clich√©s. I hope I am clear enough, I know it is difficult, I hope that this movie can be exported from our borders, it is a good exporting product. I also want to emphasize music, a very good soundtrack, this movie needs because of this long quiet break and it is perfectly covered by music. Many compliments to the director and thank you, the cinema needs these movies.
