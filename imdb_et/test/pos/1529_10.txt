The film rarely makes such intense drama and emotion. What makes this movie so peaceful is that the drama seems so real, it's hard to remember that it's just a movie. This is far from Madeline Stowe and Alan Rickman's career result. The film looks almost like a theater production, as it is staged and enlightened. The only bad thing about this movie is that it is very difficult to get a copy of it. I haven't seen it yet after Laserdisc. This truly powerful movie deserves a digitally remastered broadcast and special edition treatment on DVD. It's really so good.
