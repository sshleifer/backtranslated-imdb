It must be the ultimate chick flick ever. We made this T.V. years ago and I looked at it about 30 times over the years. I didn't see it for about 12 years and I recently watched this movie. I do not lie, I called out the credit at the end of the open credit. This movie repels your heart, even if you have no children.
