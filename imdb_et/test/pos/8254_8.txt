I offered this movie every Sunday when we shoot at London's Berkeley Square. David Niven, who was a gentleman, was unfortunately his last. We had a panic moment when the fake Krugerands (cast on film) trunk load a storm drain. Imagine a frantic team opening all the sewers to restore every last one. If you know and love London, you love this comedy rhyme - Richard Jordan, who died of a brain tumor, begins. Good movie, great team, great cast. Look for the current coronation street star by playing crowd scenes or extras. Car fleet and Ivan retail businesses were shot down in western London, Chiswick's entire shopping paradise and American used cars were dressed overnight. like shops. The restaurant suddenly turned into a funeral room. If you see a list of movies, try to see it! By the way, Sally Harrison, bank administrator, was married to Tony Curtis, a production designer. <br /> <br /> April 2007 Just thought I'd add a few more comments about the locations: <br /> <br /> Pub: Behind the Berkeley Square Elke Sommers Farm: Behind The Twickenham Film Studios Ivans Used Car Pass: Chiswick High Street and all the ring roads around the store. Workshops (rebuilding armored vans) From the roundabout of the factory to the Fullers brewery wagon (see workshops above) See Elke Sommer's cottage (this was a wooden studio stand used in many films, look for a gound of fiber in a number of films and wood depends on Computer Room at Honeywells Olympia Cemetery - Chiswick - outside the grave) Common Land Bank Interiors, Ceiling Empty, and Support Space: Twickhams Studios <br /> <br /> And just add David Niven's gentleman, joke and mix with the team, add-ons and so on ... join the coffee team!
