In this episode, Locke and Eko are looking for "?" The symbol we saw while locking the previous episode. Michael, shot by Ana Lucia and Libby, fights his actions like Libby's nearer death. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this episode (I think). It is at the end of business. Locke and Eko find the hatch on the first dead plane of the Boone season and the new training video ends with "Copyright, The Hanso Foundation, 1989". The next business graduate advertises a rather bizarre and non-typed commercial "Hanso Foundation" (planted commercial) and the advertised website (www.sublymonal.com) guides the visitor through the world associated with life outside the LOST scene. Must see all the fans!
