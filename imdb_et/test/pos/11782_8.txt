Of all the Star Wars parodies that have seen it, it's probably the most funny. Not because of the spaces, Star Wars, instead of simple electronics spaceships, but because of how bad it is. It has been purposefully crossed out and it makes it fun, and because everyone knows their intentionally overrun, no one has complained. Special effects were also deliberately terrible as possible and include a toaster on a visible string that seduces the toast and the egg on the beater's string. This short is funny for every Star Wars fan (which I don't have) or for anyone who has 15 minutes to kill. Great Short! <br /> <br /> My rating: *** out ****. 13 minutes. Not rated.
