Being the newest in college, this film reminded me of my relationship with my mother. Of course, my situation is not parallel to the situation of Natalie Portman and Surandon; but my mother and I have grown up with the struggles of a typical mother and daughter. There is always a mother who tells you what to do or not to be the mother you want to be with. I was at the end of this movie. Surandon's reaction to his daughter's east coast, miles away, reminded me of how I felt about being a small west coast town in New York. <br /> <br /> The film is for women who have children who have all grown up now. It's very touching, the movie was moving. The feeling of every movie character was absolutely real, you didn't get any fake sentimentality. I was sitting alone on credit for screening this movie, wishing my mother would sit next to me so I could hug her and thank her for everything. This movie is, of course, a bit bright, but it's all a trick. Her everything she can learn from her child; and what the child learns from the mother. 8/10
