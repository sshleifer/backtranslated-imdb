There's the whole theory of horror that some people follow exactly that monsters and violence should be away. Park Chan-Wook throws this concept completely out of the window and directly shows what he wants - and what he wants to show is something he can think of. Leaving it to actors and dialogue to create a nuance, it seems from a stylistic point of view that Park is ready to do something to get its point. Regardless of whether it is a long-lasting ensemble scene where the camera rises around the mah-jong table or for a whole week, which is limited to one scene between two other scenes, dialogue on scenes before and after their bleeding will not park in a specially structured style but more is focused on telling the whole story about a couple's relationship from virgin removal through complete self-sufficiency - and uses vampirism as a link and priesthood as a drama. It's so simple and complicated at the same time. <br /> <br /> You have to give him credit. Too many people are ready to compare all modern vampire films with Twilight, where Twilight is almost always less work, but here the stories are really comparable, but it's more raw and honest. None of this bright night in the window speaks, but everything that extends from the worst, most desperate and virginal sex scene to the abuse of a potential spouse when the two signs begin to power one another. It's the same thing - the boy and the girl meet, the girl finds the boy is a vampire, decides to join it, but never happily after, just a straightforward limited time because they are forced to get closer and closer to each other and the choices are over. Girls' motivation is particularly interesting as one of desperate desires and attention that is guilty of what a man who just wants to live as well as he can in a situation, but is hypocritical who cannot admit that he just uses his vampire as an excuse to to act against his moral training. <br /> <br /> The film is not perfect and it tends to stretch (here are three acts, five actions, no action, just the scene after the scene and the dysfunctional romance), but what is great is that Park Chan-Wook is ready to show everything honestly and honestly, while rejoicing tensions and gores. He also offers a professionally selected soundtrack to capture emotional high notes in a very effective way. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
