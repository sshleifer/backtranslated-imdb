I think the filmographic genealogy can go like this. Pay attention, please, because I had to look at it. In 1967, Peter Yates, a former car racing driver, runs an English capricious "Robbery", the most exciting part of which is driving a car through the streets of London, down the alleys where the crowd is played and all that. A year later, Yates "Bullet", starring Steve McCool, is thinking of McQueen, who has another outstanding car chase in the San Francisco mountains, with amazingly authentic engine sounds. that seem to include double-bonding, full-racing cameras, silencers, twenty-cylindrical engines with forty-foot hoods, supercharged, super-supercharged and all five thousand horsepower that work with full tilt. Lots of shots of McQueen's chewing gum visualization, which tries to get together when he tries to pull the other car out of the car, although the passenger of another vehicle has a shotgun. Chase is directed by Philip D'Anton. Bill Hopkins manages a criminal vehicle. <br /> <br /> One or two years later, by directing a good thing, Bill Friedkin leads the "French Community", which includes the command of a military car (Gene Hackman) and an elevated train in New York. Lots of shots of Hackman's sight when he wrestles a car caught in the streets. Chase is directed by Philip D'Anton. Academic Awards follow. <br /> <br /> Knowing a good year means that one or two years will bring us to the "seven tops" that include the alternation of a Roy Scheider-controlled car with lots of Scheider's passionate faces. he tries a second car, led by Bill Hopkins, even though the car of the offender certainly carries a shotgun. There are no mountains in New York, but bumps, but they are still sharp enough to lift cars a few feet. The caught car rides around the corner and strikes the street where a dozen children play. Shooting from screaming children when they scatter on the sidewalk and allow the car to zoom. But once is not enough. The kids run straight back to the street and have to repeat the return to the Scheider-carrying police car. <br /> <br /> I've ever witnessed high speeds in the streets of Philadelphia. Both criminals and police officers traveled on the streets for about 25 miles per hour, coming down at each stop sign and red light - in a very dark matter, compared to this film. <br /> <br /> Talking about this movie, it's pretty good. "Robbery" and "Bullet" were cool. All dressed nicely. But New York movies are dirty. There's all the garbage and the subway cars are covered with graffiti. Shoot out and beat ups take place in free batches surrounded by crumbling brick buildings, or in dumps at industrial freezers. <br /> <br /> Operation is pretty good. Roy Scheider looks bright. Other participants have a face for the camera, especially Richard Welsh. And the story is tempting, if not completely familiar. What is the best about the film is how this New York captures almost total indifference because of people's fear and nobility. At the funeral, limousine drivers go around with their collar, weigh their mouths, put their cold feet together, forever in ritual events. The film wants us to believe that the seven tops are an intact police elite who can't do anything to do the job, and here's a little sales. They always seem to threaten to do something unethical and illegal - to defeat hell from a suspect or physically harm a hospital and a helpless hood - but they always manage to do it. (If they did, their characters would become viable and unclear, and we would have more biblical heroes and crooks.) Very enjoyable, even if you have seen it before and you may have a very good one or more of your previous incarnations.
