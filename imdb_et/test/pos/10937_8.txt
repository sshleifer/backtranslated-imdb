This SEARCHERS splicing is one of the strange films I've ever seen in a strange, stranger, filmed by the British. It is often said that the best American films are made by foreigners who can get to know a friend. But this movie is something else. Although it seems obvious in post-war America, it is not America, which is recognized as a myth, a cinema, television, and so on. The film has the air of a timeless fiction, specifically dealing with Western mythology. <br /> <br /> Director Harvey uses a title horse to focus on linking stories, all related to the original and traditional Western clash of civilization. The first seems to be the upper hand. The great rubbing of the film landscape and the desert are intermittent, mature for the allegories of the mind. The only short places of civilization are the stagecoach of missionaries and landowners, and their hacienda, both of which derive behavior that is something other than civilized. <br /> <br /> The main story combines three stories. In one, pointless Deserter, Pike, lost his trading partner, steals a wonderful horse, Eagle's Wing, called thanks to his grace and speed. In the second stage, the Indian horse, the white bull, the owner of this horse, robs one female driver. In the third, the Spanish men who found him continued to ignore this endeavor for the murderous, looting joy. <br /> <br /> Although revolutionary to the West, Indian treatment is problematic. Unlike Pike, his character has never been clarified, forever incomprehensible, denied the voice, except for the frightening of the song. If he is not strange Other, he is a symbol whose role is not fully developed - at one point, this savage is brutal, otherwise he represents nature and freedom. <br /> <br /> But Pike first notes that the film deals with the period of primitivism that takes place before civilization. In several ways, film 2001 - A SPACE ODYSSEY, especially its opening order, resembles. Part of the power of the film lies in the relationship between three different characters, which forces us to look at mythical struggles and guests in different light. Indian culture and Catholicism are associated with superstition, ritual, greed and murder. Both Pike and White Bull are musical and alcoholic. White Bull is demonized by both Pike and abducte as a "bastard", unintentionally revealing the tactics of illegality used by whites who have been infantised by natives, becoming themselves "necessary" fathers. <br /> <br /> Unlike the traditional West, which is related to history, civilization and advancement, this film is a double detective story, listening to the past, tracks, remnants. <br /> <br /> What makes this film a remarkable uniqueness, which, in my opinion, despite Maltin's racism, is its Britishity. Climactic stand-off is rather an Arthur attack. The film itself abandons much of the dialogue by creating a visual and phonetic wall, Malick, who stayed in THIN RED LINE, and would have been afraid of a little Hollywood director. Existential doubling and aspiration motives are more of a European myth than American (similar to the second British Harvey Keitel movie "The DUELLISTS"). <br /> <br /> The most amazing is the use of nature. Most western countries use the terrain as a terrifying background: in the West there is little feeling. EAGLE WING is like Powell's and Pressberger's film, which is a naturally powerful, pantheistic character in itself - alive, dangerous, hostile, beautiful. There is an overwhelming scene that resembles CANTERBURY TALE when the jewelery trapped by White Bull's trees suddenly blows into the wind: there is a haunting, tantalizing, magical, exciting effect that resembles Arabic nights more than a horse opera. Heartbeat.
