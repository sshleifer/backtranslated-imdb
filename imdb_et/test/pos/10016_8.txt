I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. Of course, it is slowly moving in parts, but what else is waiting for Rollin? There's also a lot of nudity, there's nothing wrong with it, especially as it contains a lot of great Brigitte Lahaie. There are also some remarkably erotic women who are dead, perhaps, but most effective. There is also a sci-fi story with a brief explanation at the end, but I don't worry too much about it. No, here we have the most interesting study of the effect of memory and memory loss, and exactly to what extent it is still "rememberable". My DVD sleeve mentions David Cronenberg, and although it may not be as good as his best films, there is a similarity here, especially with the seemingly threatening and creepy use of seemingly intimidating architecture and interior space. As I've been trying to show it, it's not a roaring thriller, it's an enchanting nightmare like a movie that does its best, including stunning at the end of a railway area.
