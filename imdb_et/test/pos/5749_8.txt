Id just say the movie was good and touching. The film explains to you how you are rescued or born again, and which is very well described. Action was pretty good, but some improvements can be made. The Story Board is memorable and when my church had a youth service and we looked at it, 8 people gave life to Christ. Id just want to tell everyone who reads it, give their life to Christ and repent of their sin. Please visit www.lifeofacristian.piczo.com Thank you Andrew <br /> <br /> The word of God is not empty. So get saved and regret your sin!
