Well, I can say for sure that I'm a human, Wong. And I will not throw. I laughed. And laughed. If this movie made you bother, there is something wrong with you. But this movie is incredible. I bought it four days ago and I had been watching it five times already. Animal cruelty gets my heart but not long enough to blame. The film is shocking, nasty and vulgar. Operation is terrible. What else do you want from the movie? I'm a maniac with a hard cult film. Pink Flamingos is fantastic. This makes the Rocky Horror, as someone has said, teletubbies.
