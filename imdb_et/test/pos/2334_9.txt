I'm glad they finally released it on the DVD. I bought a video tape a year ago and watched it at least once or twice a year. For him, Grammer has the one who really makes this movie a success. Its formula is certainly not original, but it is still very funny. I'm very surprised that he didn't get higher in ratings. <br /> <br /> This is one of my all-time favorite comedies. It's just a fun little flick that makes you feel good. And sometimes it's all about the movie.
