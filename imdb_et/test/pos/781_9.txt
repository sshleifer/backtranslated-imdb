I saw this tonight with moderate expectations - when Tartan's films have picked up and freed what is generally a good sign, but I am not usually a fan of Julie Walter who usually dislikes his comedy roles (sorry for fans, but it's a personal thing - I just can't find her in a comedy joke). <br /> <br /> It was great - it was a great result for everyone, but Grint and Walters are extraordinary! Lots of laughs, a lot of sins, a great era and a wonderfully lively movie - such a film of the ages would not normally be something I would expect so much, but I can't recommend it enough - and see Rupert Grint as she matures into a fine fine actor.
