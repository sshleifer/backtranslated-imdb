Late film critic Gene Siskel said this film shows how easy it is to make a movie. He gave him a compliment, though now, which could offend those days. Although I did not always agree with Gene Siskel, I agree with her. Love Jones is a brilliant example of how a love story should be: in real situations with real characters realistic. Nia Long. Larenz Tate and Nia Long are more than just a beautiful couple on the screen. These two actually have chemistry together. You can feel the atmosphere between the two whenever it is on the screen and its fantastic. Isaiah Washington is as big as Darius's close friend, Savon, and I drink every time I see him in the movie. The boy is a big actor whose career is destroyed by the industry's low and childish games they play. You may believe that he named Gray's anatomy of his little blunt name but someone who knows how Follywood works knows better than to believe in any "official story" in the place of faith. Anyway ... Love Jones is a great love story full of interesting and pleasant characters that are in realistic situations that someone who is in love can also be involved. You love these people because they are believing and are not portrayed as gangsters and tramp. There are no obscure stereotypes here. Contrast this with novel movies. Exactly. If you like a black cinema, you would make a copy of this movie.
