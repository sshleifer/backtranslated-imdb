I remember seeing it in the movie theater and liking it. I was afraid of the net of fear last month and looked at it again and found it better with that age. First of all, for you, who describe it as a cheese of the 80s, if you compare it objectively with the horror clips of the last two decades, it compares quite well when it comes to films against a unique horror sub genre. In contrast to psychological horror like "The Shining" or "Exorcist". <br /> <br /> In addition, this film really provides goods for its goods (or in this case bad). The film has a certain kind of development in reality and it gives the notorious hull of the ship enough to get the atmosphere right before the characters were placed in the front door. The film also has a number of fun liners, and it gives the mood to have a horrible horror flick. When you compare NOD with modern big budget horror movies like "I'm Legend" (Vincent Price version was much better), this movie really looks like. Modern horror clamps are almost entirely dominated by CGI. Most do not have a graph or character at all, and they are completely predictable. Special effects dominate these films from start to finish and the characters are 24k plastic. If it's 80's horror, I'll take it over 95% of the current scrap of the genre. <br /> <br /> The final note saw that NOD once again reminded me of the beautiful Jill Terashita and wondered why I hadn't seen him more in horror or other ways. Jill has a strange chance that you read it - I think you are proud and should have been more in the movies. Finally, if you like the acts of horror, you probably like it.
