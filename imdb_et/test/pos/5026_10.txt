honestly, I loved Michael. though it was "give me the pillow I need for a sunny part," it was cool. I think everyone did a great job in this movie. and nora ephron is on my "ok" list. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see John Travolt as a pot-angel. it is not very often seen in the movie. some people may call it a boring movie, but I liked it. angels and everything.
