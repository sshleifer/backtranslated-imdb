Homegrown is one of those films that broke through the cracks but deserves better. When I first saw it, I had a warm-warm reaction. But over time it has really grown on me - no pun isn't ;-). The more I see it, the more I appreciate it. Writing is top-notch, as is the actor. Throw in a few surprising lights and good directions, and you will get very little movie. <br /> <br /> It's also good to see Hank Azaria shine in the head. And Thornton offers its usual quality. Even the relative newcomer Ryan Phillippe offers playing friendly innocence with hostility and nuance. <br /> <br /> Bye-bye, Homegrown is just a "must see" when you're a Billy Bob Thornton fan. It seems that Stephen Gyllenhaal was affected by earlier Thornton projects such as One False Move and Sling Blade (although Homegrown is certainly much more linguistic than either). And Thornton's characteristic role, both complex and underground, is perfect for the actor.
