I have nothing but praise for this movie and for the majority, especially Ann Margaret. More importantly, I commend my laws for the adopters of Warren and Frank in real life. In 1989, I met most of the "children" at the Warren wedding. This is an amazing story and it is even more incredible when I know the family and what everyone went through. I am also pleased to see how my in-law movie was filmed. It was quite accurate. My wife even enjoys small details like the toaster she reminded of her childhood. Yes, it is a hard movie to watch, but so amazing and cordial. <br /> <br /> The beauty of this story for me is how many children passed my laws, and as a result, marrying my daughter and taking Warren as a brother, how much I've met with me. For the past 20 years, this story has been part of my life because my mother has shared with me. That and knowing Warren. Because what's worth, Warren lives with his family in California. She married a high school lover who reunited with her 20-year high school meeting. <br /> <br /> In the 1980s, the exhibition "It's Incredible". They had a reunion with a family who had to respond to the show. <br /> <br /> For the benefit of someone, the DVD is available in the UK and Australia. In the United States there is a tough video and I haven't found a DVD so far.
