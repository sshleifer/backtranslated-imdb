cute. I just love the movie. I want to see this movie because Rupert Grint is a fantastic actor. his expressions are great, remarkable. the film was great. Julie Walters was also perfect. I think Rupert is the only red-haired boy I love. Rupert has a beautiful smile, a beautiful voice. and a wonderful accent. I think the movie was great and was great when Rupert was in another thing, but Harry Potter. and it is a very good actor so it deserves it and more. he just has a golden world, but he probably deserves the Oscar Academy Award. there are some participants who don't work very well but have an Oscar anyway. Does not matter. but he is perfect, brilliant and beautiful
