Ponyo is a beautiful animated film with some dark undertones. It has a story of longing and love with a child of ecological impact, but it is not preaching. Hayao Miyazaki has merged Andersen's little mermaid with Japanese native tongues and her own brand of steam punk flights, the result of which is very helpful. There are some terrible moments of ocean storms and floods, but they are exciting, not terrible. <br /> <br /> If you've ever wanted to spend on shore waves, drive a jellyfish as an elevator. make yourself completely or make life a friend, Ponyo is a fabell for you.
