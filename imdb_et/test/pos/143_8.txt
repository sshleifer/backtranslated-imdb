I'm the first to admit that Chan-wook Park's thirst is exceptionally well done, but spending two hours on Tae Yoga (OK-vin Kim) is enough for everyone to last for so long. Sang-hyeon (Kang-ho Song) is a priest willing to voluntarily test for those who want to inject themselves strictly for a specific virus that kills infectiously. Instead of legally dying, Hyeon becomes a vampire, always longing for a blood supply that gives him the opportunity to fight an infectious disease that returns to cause the symptoms that start him (..). ). Sunlight, as is known in the vampire genre, causes distressing death if it comes into contact with Hyeon for a long time. Hyeon falls into lust with the sick childhood friend Kang-woo (Ha-kyun Shin) wife Tae Yoga. Mrs. Ra (Hae-sook Kim), who was considered a puppy and practically used for household order, took the Tae drink. In this situation, Tao is unhappy and is going to happen with the mortgage he incites to Hyeon, soon manipulating him, perhaps killing Kang-woo. By giving up his priesthood, Hyeon dives in relations with Tae Yoga, which is about to be killed by kang-woo. The case that Tae-woo contributed to (.. using the boat, in the middle of the lake, both buried him under water, holding him on the Kang-woo again when he tried to enter again) haunts both when circumstances arise, as Kang-woo "missing" (Hyeon got rid of him where the police did not find his body). Soon Mrs Ra (stroke) will suffer, but one finger and the ability to blink her eyes will make a great contribution if the story progresses, showing that she is more aware than they believe) and Hyeon will give Tae Yue a special birthday gift .. vampirism. In doing so, Hyeon has created a monster. The Tae-yo admits (though the slipping of the tongue) that, in fact, Kang-woo never hurts him, and when he is bleeding, it is soon realized that the killing of the supply does not disturb him morally or psychologically. The Tae Yoga becomes so full, Hyeon must take desperate action if he wants to put an end to this threat, including. <br /> <br /> I say thirst is one of the best horror movies I have seen for 2009. This is a methodological approach Park takes and we are led to the dark path with Hyeon and Tae Yoga because they do terrible deeds that never have a positive union. Innocent people die because of the love of Hyeon (which once was the lust for Obesessive Love) for the Tae Yoga, and it ceases when it does not make a painful choice. We see in our heads, in their souls, and it's not always beautiful. 2 hours with them can be quite tiring, but credit to the director that he does not pull any strikes on attacking behavior and how vampirism abilities can give the wrong people. Hyeon, seen as a fairly pleasing soul, accepts "hell" for the Tae-yeah, so one could see Thirst as a unique love story, but not quite healthy. <br /> <br /> Violence, while Park has a tendency to pull out extremely graphic details, has enough sadism to turn the stomach a little. At least, the way in which violence is carried out must remain permanent. Sexual situations between Hyeon and Taeo may be quite hot and erotic, but they are also insecure and morally reprehensible. I think the film is still a rather difficult study of the lengths that remain in the object of lust.
