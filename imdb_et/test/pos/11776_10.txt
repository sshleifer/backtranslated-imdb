<br /> <br /> 14 of the funniest moments of cellulose. This short parody is at least as much a part of Star Wars saga as Phantom Menace, and much more interesting when you ask me. Hardware wars were the first long spoofers of the SW to form their own subgroup. I hate to describe it too much - it is so short that the assumption is almost the whole thing. Suffice it to say that many of Star Wars most popular and familiar aspects are fun for them. Home appliances such as toasters and vacuum cleaners represent spacecraft and robots, Princess Anne-Droid's character carries the actual bread rolls with her head, not the famous braided hairs, and Fluke Starbucker is even more dork than her original, if possible. Ernie Fosselius is one crazy boy who is also Porklips Now, the source of the Apocalypse Now spoof.
