Hong Kong filmmaker Chang Chang Ho's 1972 martial arts epic "Five Fingers of Death" is widely regarded by many filmmakers and kung-fu film fanatics as the martial arts film that started it. <br /> <br /> Being released in 1972, this phase was the second three-step process that led to the west of a martial arts explosion - "Billy Jack" (1971), the famous Hapkido showdown in the park, released a year earlier and Bruce Lee played "Enter the Dragon" (1973) Two years later, thus reinforcing martial arts films in the western cinema. <br /> <br /> But what are all about five "Deaths"? The film has its terrible duplication, explosive (if not very unlikely) sequences of action and technical flaws, and everything that has a plot, though very thin. Chih-Hao (Late Lo Lieh) is a young and dedicated Chinese gong-fu student who is selected to represent her school in a future martial arts tournament. His teacher is offering him to train himself in the Iron Fist style of fighting, with a deadly style so that he can easily kill only one shot man. <br /> <br /> In addition, Chih-Hao School Arrivals coincides with a violent conflict rival school, its students, and the heavy hits of Japanese murderers. Before you know it, a big setback will threaten Chih-Hao's training and his ability to represent his beloved school in the upcoming tournament. <br /> <br /> Let me say that the "five finger of death" is actually all it started. As another viewer mentioned, the "five finger of death" helped to set many standards in martial arts over the next three decades - Asian, European, and North American martial arts. Such standards include dedicated students, learning patience and resilience, conflict between competing schools, intense ethnic hostility between China and Japan, and a system for learning the motif of this good old fashioned action: revenge. "Five Fingers of Death" would also have a big impact on American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino's films "Kill Bill" (Tarantino borrowed this project quite freely among many others) so you know it.) <br /> <br /> Action is pretty good whereas it is a martial art film from the early 1970s, the best of which is Lo Lieh. As an atypical student of martial arts, his presentation is quite groundbreaking, although at first glance you would not really know it because the character's arc has been killed so many times over the years. He is quite humble in his behavior, doing everything he can to resist his enemies, not fighting their level of anger or stupidity or arrogance. Likewise, if it suffers from its great setback, it will make your heart a little, because it is so brutal and you don't know if it will recover enough to realize your lifelong ambition. <br /> <br /> "Five Fingers of Death" is a classic in every sense. It is not perfect and viewers would be crazy to wait for a caliber of "godfather" of martial arts films. What it offers is the ultimate example of the East-hand fight before the East Cinema was the main Western competition. <br /> <br /> PS 7/10 <br /> <br /> PS: "Insert Dragon" Bolo Yeung will also appear at the beginning of the movie as a destroyer of Mongolian Street.
