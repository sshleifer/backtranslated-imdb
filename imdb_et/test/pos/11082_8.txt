True stories create the best stories? There is always a pleasant story, be it novel or movie or whatever, just because it is real, making the story even more interesting. This film is based on a real story of two young American men, one government employee and bullfighter Chris Boyce (Timothy Hutton) and another Andrew Daulton Lee (Sean Penn)? These two will sell the secrets of the government, mainly the CIA, in 1975 to the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the human aspect of the two men and their growing personal problems (especially Penn's character ever) - the deterioration of drug addiction) instead of respecting their status in America, which would undoubtedly undermine the credibility of the film in the US. Boyce is gradually becoming more cautious and ultimately frustrated and paranoid, as their relationships are pulling and digging into a deeper treacherous territory. Daulton becomes more dependent and addicted to cocaine and heroin when he becomes more frightening and desperate to maintain a situation he has no control over, in addition to having problems with the law. The torture of the Boyce and Daulton families due to their way of managing their lives is also well illustrated and adds well to the idea that espionage against their own country, even if it is thought to be fair, leads only to major problems and destruction of life? including the deterioration of friendship and trust between the two main characters. <br /> <br /> Here's a breakdown: <br /> <br /> Good: <br /> <br /> - Hutton and Penn each made a thorough study of the characters to capture their individual look and feel, so that they are depicted with extensive depth and realism. <br /> <br /> - Operation is great. <br /> <br /> - Paranoia's atmosphere is built quite well. <br /> <br /> - The story is exciting and, of course, it's an added kick based on real events. <br /> <br /> --Nice kits. <br /> <br /> - The Soviet Union, working with Boyce and Daulton, is portrayed very well, not in a stereotypical or evil conscience, but in the interest of doing so. <br /> <br /> No Hurt it, didn't help: <br /> <br /> - The music is fine, there's nothing perfect. <br /> <br /> - Emergency effects are occasionally small? many movies from the seventies to the eighties. Bad: <br /> <br /> - Chris Boyce (Timothy Hutton) interacts with a woman we barely know. Thanks to Boyce's problems with US and Soviet governments, his life can be put at risk, but it is not as expanded as it should have been. A little problem though. <br /> <br /> Ugly: <br /> <br /> - The obvious simplicity required to sell government secrets is a bit irritating. Nothing is a constant countless state that the masses feel as dangerous as possible. <br /> <br /> A memorable scene: <br /> <br /> - Watching the first CIA report by mistakenly posting the wrong reason is, "a tough night." <br /> <br /> This was another film that caused huge delays due to the controversial content of the story. The studios and manufacturers did not see how the American audience could ever accept the film from two American traitors. Fortunately, it has been filmed and featured in high class and quality. Of course, this will help rogue anti-heroes to portray heroically more than a few young men who have made serious mistakes in their lives. As such, it becomes a very human drama, one of which is portrayed very well and very credibly. <br /> <br /> Action: 9/10 Story: 10/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Cinematography: 8/10 Character Development: 9/10 Special Effects / Make-up: 8/10 (Small Quantity, High Quality) nudity / sexuality: 2/10 (one scene in a striptease club) Violence / Gore: 7/10 (no gore, just violence) Music: 7/10 direction: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 0/10 Crappiness : 0/10 <br /> <br /> General: 8/10 <br /> <br /> You like movies about espionage and spies, you can't go wrong here. If you like dramatic movies that are heavily focused on the humanity of the characters, it can work for you. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
