Sometimes, you're late at night, sliding through the stations, your eternal mind, and wanting some light and fluffy romantic comedy that doesn't make you bipolar. And this movie fits this exact bill. Of course, the plot was ripped straight from the 1930s .... writing schmaltzyna Hallmark's greeting card company legendary poetry, and one-dimensional characters played cast, who were directly cast from the middle - but that was CUTE, and exactly what I needed last night. <br /> <br /> Lauren Holly and Costas Mandylor are with great chemistry - I liked this "Picket Fences", and I'm happy to say they have it 10 years later. Costas Mandylor, at 41, is still one of the handy men who want to love the screens because Ol 'Rudy Valentino strikes the buck 80 years ago. RRROWRR! Bonus points for casting this funny man who was previously on roller skates to show the cartoon. I always thought he was something about Hepburn-Grant's comedy. BRAVO! <br /> <br /> Some people will probably say it was ever made in the most crowded cinema, and I should probably agree - but come on! This is on the Hallmark channel. What did you expect? Just sit back, relax, eat some sesame sticks and watch a sweet little movie with two cute people and a bottle of Zinfandel. Trust me, you love and accept Schmaltz much more, and then you can go to sleep to dream of Costas Mandylor swimming in tempered chocolate sea where you eat fresh chocolate icing. YUMMO! (PS. I've got a little petit for four now. THANK YOU, HALLMARK!) <br /> <br /> I really want the evil girl to be cast with Rachel Ray and maybe this unpleasant food. Van Dyk's bearded fucking guy instead of announcer. Shudder! <br /> <br /> It would have been my night. But hey, look at "Just Desserts".
