I love this movie. There's something for everyone. If it's funny, sad, passionate and dramatic. A mixture of two completely different cultures creates a whole new world that the viewer cannot help but wants to be part of. I have to admit that I am a bit biased because Colin Firth is my favorite actor and so nothing he does is wrong in my eyes (!), But in this movie his enormous ability to act is obvious and is even more adorned by his co-star Nia Long . The problems that their love relationship suffers make this movie even more enchanting, ironic, credible, and simpler, such as the contrast of colors in Matthew's and Name's clothes. I enrich someone who can't move that story. I find it enchanting and watching it at least ten times a week ago!
