I saw this movie for the first time when Quentin Tarantino showed it to us who was at Austin Alamo in Drafthouse. He highlighted it as he was comfortable when he thought he was and how funny it was and in the context of his explanation it was HILARIOUS. I can see how this would be detrimental to some audiences, and the topic is not at all funny, but there are at least three lines in the movie that laughed so hard that I thought I was peeing. They will not come until after the half point, but if they do, God will die. Oh and Jim Brown is great. He's not much of a movie, but when he's there, you know who the movie is. Of course the best line of film (and more fun) is her; you can find out when you hear it.
