This is undoubtedly a good movie, but with some strange aspects. Without any violation, it will only take place in 3 locations - the Sicilian farm, the boat and Ellis Island in New York. All the shots are close, so we never see anything wide. I don't know if it was to save money? No street scenes and we can't even see the boat in the neighborhood. And the music ... what's happening on the ground, playing Nina Simone's songs for decades before they were out? I could have done without the dairy business ..... But hey, before you think of me as a pure misanthrope, let me repeat, this is a very good movie with heartfelt moments, great photography, great characters and more accuracy than normal (American) Efforts in Immigration Experience.
