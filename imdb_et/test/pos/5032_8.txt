Michael is probably too cutesy for most of the action fans and too Hollywood for the intellectual crowd, but I found it to be so funny and very touching, despite being both cutesy and formal. <br /> <br /> When three skeptics are sent, look for the man who claims to be an angel who will eventually send him to the middle of the West to find that everyone is in his heart who needs investigation. <br /> <br /> When you take a movie, like most of today's movies, there is not much new material, but as a whole, it is a refreshingly original approach and it is amazing enough to attract entertainment. <br /> <br /> Although it is not a "Family" movie, it fits all ages and good movies to share it with your whole family or with that special person. <br /> <br /> "Michael" is not a great movie, but it's definitely a good movie, and it's worth noting. <br /> <br /> KWC
