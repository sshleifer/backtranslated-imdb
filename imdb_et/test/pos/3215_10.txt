wow! I just have to say that this show is really cool! I fell in love with the show from the beginning! the idea of ​​the exhibition is very original and very soothing! it is also a pleasure to see a presentation given by two wonderful ladies, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel! they are just wonderful! I am especially a great admirer of Lauren Graham! He's not just a pretty face, he's also an actress "monster"! I'm not saying Alexis is not a wonderful actor ... I just happen to be better than Lauren! anyway it's a real pleasure to see them on the screen, "saving" words! immortal Jim Carrey said "B-E-A-UTIFUL!"
