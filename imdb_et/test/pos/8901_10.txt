After the second robbery in an empty village, the Vikings Timandahaf leader misunderstood his counselor Cryptograph that "fear gives the wings to the inhabitants" and believes that the fear actually flies the villagers. They decide to learn Chaul's fear from fear to learn to fly and make them invincible warriors. Meanwhile, Vitalstatistix's nephew Justforkix is ​​sent to Parisi from Gaulish to become a man and Asterix and Obelix are assigned to train a young man. The stupid son of Cryptograph, Olaf, listens to a conversation with cowboy Justforkix with Asterix and Obelix and kidnaps him. Upon returning to Viking, Justforkix meets Timandahaf's daughter Abba and loves each other. But Machiavellian and ambitious Cryptograf intend to marry her son Olaf Abba and become powerful. Finally, Asterix realizes that it is not a fear that gives wings, it is love. <br /> <br /> When I was a teenager, Asterix was my favorite comic book and I read all the Goscinny and Uderzo songs. This feature film shows all the original elements of comics and humor with delicious and wonderful animation. The romance of Justforkix and the proud Abba is admirable and the situation in Asterix and Obelix is ​​fun. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Astérix e os Vikings" ("Astérix and Vikings")
