Comanche Moon has somewhat criticized IMDb. I think this is for three reasons. First, the purists are disappointed that the mini series isn't exactly like a book. Second, it's not as good as the original Loneome Dove. Finally, people want to complain to IMDb and the world's biggest movies are bad comments. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that no movie is as good as a book. That's just the way it is. Lonesome Dove was not as good as the novel on which it was based. In addition, some things were turned off on the Lonesome Dove movie. This is just how he starts adjusting something to the film. So this is a pointless argument when looking at Comanche Moon. <br /> <br /> I agree that this is not as good as the original dove. But hey, nothing. I know people who lead their lives with the Dove lessons. If I'm going to compare every book I read, the movie I watched, and the TV that Lonesome Dove looks at; I would be unhappy forever. <br /> <br /> It's made for television seminars based on the Lonesome Dave (novel) preform and Dead man's Walk successor. This is the best TV I've seen for years. It's fun for Lonesome Dove. We learn about the Ranger history we knew and love in Dove. Zahn is doing an amazing job of recreating Gus McCrae. Elizabeth Banks and Linda Forenelli (sp?) Are also doing great jobs, creating signs that will help the robbers and Newt's past. <br /> <br /> If / when it reappears, I promise you will enjoy it more than any fucking reality.
