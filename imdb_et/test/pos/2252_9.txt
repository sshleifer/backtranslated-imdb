I went to see it because I have friends in Ukraine. but the film pulled me further when I was waiting for it, the perfect mix of laughing with a smile (alexic strange use of english), the difficulty of contingency comedy and depression. I loved this choice. it made me want to jump into the old car and the Ukrainian road. Alex (Hutz) plays his guide part perfectly and gives an excellent response to Elijah's forest poker, who was serious. The film shows the positive side of humankind, when the ppl of different cultures can be tied and doing the right things when they feel the sincerity of the situation, even when they went there with the imagined concepts and prejudices and how it opens the deeply buried memories of the doorways. there is a lot in this movie.
