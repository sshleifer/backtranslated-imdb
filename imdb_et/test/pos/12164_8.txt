I had never read (or even seen) the six-man British comedy group The Crazy Gang, but my positive experiences with my associates Will Hay and Arthur Askey - and especially Graham Greene's praise for THE FROZEN LIMITS himself ("The most fun English picture that is produced so far… it can be comparable to SAFETY LAST and GENERAL ”) - put me on the bone R2 DVDs with this network and their subsequent film GASBAGS (1941; see below). which appeared virtually this year without a fan. <br /> <br /> The British-made west is rare, but the British western robbery is still rarer (CARRY ON COWBOY [1965] was still around 25 years away). Incidentally, returning to the Greene mentioned Silent classics seems to owe the film to THE GOLD RUSH (1925) and WAY OUT WEST (1937). In addition, it also features a variation of "Snow White and Seven Dwarfs" (which was just immortalized on the screen by Walt Disney's animated masterpiece) and where the seventh member is played by the old comic and frequent Will Hay foil at Moore Marriott; Gang actually calls the real heroine Eileen Bell under the full name and there is even an amusing sequence where six of them are getting ready to go to bed and dwarf the dwarf song from the Disney movie! <br /> <br /> Six comedians (three comedy duo-sets: Flanagan & Allen, Nervo & Knox, and Naughton & Gold) can be the biggest such films - though not all of their personalities appear here: my favorite Bud Flanagan ( looking a bit like Jim Backus), straight man Chesney Allen and moustached, prickly voice Teddy Knox; but the lung Charlie Naughton often took the luminaire, because he was the one to whom others always seemed to be on top. Nevertheless, the Marriott, who steals the film from his first scene - rubs it to embody every officer in a ghost town in a broken theater! very young Bernard Lee is also a piece of villain. <br /> <br /> The Ore routine between Flanagan and Allen actually requires Abbot's and Costello's famous "Who is the first?" (film, actually souls) lot of word games for their humor - which may not travel, especially at this moment. Nonetheless, there are a whole host of fun sequences, some of which brought tears in my eyes: the opening place where Gang lootes the angry band of creditors; dress them up as Indians when they hit Jukon; gang roses to make all the rich with the same gold; they all embody a sleep disorder into the mess of Marriott to confuse (gag that may originate from its origin in the Marx Bros. fun mirror line DUCK SOUP [1933]); an on-site theater sketch that will entertain the fun melodrama; a surreal moment when rogues are attacked by one gang of a staircase that is part of the landscape painted in the theater; and especially at the end, when a group of singing police sings so slowly to rescue Gang (despite being spoken by an increasingly impatient Ranger hero). <br /> <br /> The happy soundtrack and the senseless nature of the Gags themselves made it difficult for me to joke, sometimes the subtitles were certainly welcome. Crazy Gang made only five films - the first two were well thought out, OKAY FOR SOUND (1937) and ALF's BUTTON AFLOAT (1938) and much later reunion (although Allen had worshiped Eddie Gray at that time) called LIFE IS CIRCUS (1960; directed by Val Guest who otherwise wrote both purchased Gang films and some of the Hay and Askey vehicles mentioned above!).
