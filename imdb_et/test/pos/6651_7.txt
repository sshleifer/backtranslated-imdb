This is an initial assumption based on the American Civil War, but it is ultimately a love story. We start at the beginning of the war, where the main characters (Kidman & Law) are obviously aware of each other and there is an obvious attraction, they have a passionate kiss on the day they leave for war. The main strength of this film is that the character of Law is returned by Kidman and his struggles to achieve it, and his struggles to survive until he returns. The reason why he cannot convince us that we do not see this relationship before the nature of the law goes to battle - is it hard to believe that two people will miss each other so much that they have so few contacts. Everything else is fine, Renee Zellweger and her older father and her companion are beautiful additions, as is the risk of gang searching. Of course this is a long film, but it has interest and cinematography is great. A test of honor that doesn't do it well, but is still worth watching.
