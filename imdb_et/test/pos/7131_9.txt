Dead Gentlemen Productions has produced an amazingly productive film, taking into account their budget. Anyone who has ever played a role play, especially any fantasy RPG (they play in Dungeons and Dragons) love this movie. Stylish performances everywhere - especially regarding the dual nature of the principles, playing their characters and their characters. Anyone who has participated in a film or film will appreciate the work and love they put into the project. This film (and its preform) is a game of fantasy films and role-playing games that Blazing saddles are for Western countries - the highest order parody. I have only a few small complaints about the movie itself, none of which prevent me from buying a DVD as soon as it is available (only 6 weeks - I read the days): <br /> <br /> 1. When the Lodge speaks to Joanna joining, he gives him a copy of the Dungeons and Dragons Players Handbook and says, "It tells you everything you need to know." The camera beats the book too long and it seemed really commercial at the moment. <br /> <br /> 2. Jokes are fun, but they look uneven in the movie. The last third of the film, after almost constant visual and verbal humor that has slowed down before, slows down a bit, as if the narrative were catching up with jokes. Strange, but Blazing saddles hit me so. . . and I also love this movie. <br /> <br /> One story telling strength is the unresolved nature of a romantic sub-block. Does Joanna become a GM girlfriend? Will he go back to Cass? Or do these three keep a platonic friendship that is exacerbated by the role play marriage? (Yes, it sounds gentle, but a few saccharine moments, especially when Cass and Lodge are at the end.) But the film goes on for a week: in terms of interpersonal relationships, these questions can't be answered for a week. The fact that the relationships between the characters have remained undefined strikes me better than the more classic choices you see in most movies, like the girl gets from her prince and they move to the castle, or the prince sinks into the north of the North Atlantic, a tedious and predictable hour. Writers really seem to understand the characters' psychology and see the characters (both players and player characters) in the movie, but not suddenly and unbelievably. <br /> <br /> I would like to hear more wisdom from Brother Silence. "The man who looks in the dark is ... fluorescence."
