The adaptation of Sarah Waters novel Andrew Davies was great. The characters from Nancy and Kitty were perfectly represented by Rachael Stirling and Kelley Hawes. The whole series was full viewing. It was trying to imagine all the tables, be they straight or homosexual. I wish there could be a sequel!
