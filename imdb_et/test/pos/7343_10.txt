Somehow, somewhere, somewhere .. you GOTTA see this movie. Breathing aerials and amazing talented performers of outstanding talent. for women. A superbly targeted movie that deals with the complexity of relationships and stays up until you're ready to go. This masterpiece concerns both women and men. Ned Far (director / writer) and ridiculously talented Dreya Weber (star / producer) had to say it honestly and sincerely. This movie hits the big - look, HOW - - or you're not a "loop" when it becomes one of the most talked about movies.
