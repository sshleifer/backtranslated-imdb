End of Suburbia (TEOS) is a very useful film. It is also important and provocative. There seems to be no middle ground, no anti-sprawl Master, James Howard Kunstler, with the film or its main source of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Although I'm not a big fan of new urbanism, my criticism is its small vision. In the case of the new Urbanist Peter Calthorpe - the second talk head - you will finally hear what is somewhat obvious and what special additional TEOS ... Calthorpe just doesn't understand the peak oil. <br /> <br /> I have used it as an economics study tool to get land as a production factor - the fact that the neoclassical economy has been reduced for a long time - and also as a tool: oil excellence, our land use, global warming, our endangered food production, public transport Endangered Future <br /> <br /> Move over to South Park! .... The video released by Toronto for Canadians for $ 25,000 and released in May 2004 sold over 24,000 copies by October 2005. \ t One major DVD lender recently ordered nearly 400 copies. <br /> <br /> Suburbia sales actually grew 1 1/2 years after its release, and it has also been available from one of the largest online video services since September 2005. <br /> <br /> Forward, Escape From Suburbia, is a work for August 2006.
