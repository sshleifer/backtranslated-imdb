Forever Strong is a type of movie we've seen a lot of time before, just in different genres. But by saying this, I thought it was a great movie, Sean Faris shows what type of potential usually actors land in a great era. Apparently this movie got a limited release because I didn't even know it, but I saw it in a video store and decided to take it when I remember Sean's performance at Never Back Down. I ended up with an excellent decision, I'm not a rugby fan, so that is never the case, but the film doesn't speak completely about rugby, it's about to stay alive, challenging itself, achieving its goals, there's a lot more than a simple plot. On the first day, we don't give the fuck that happens to Rick, he's a mouth, full of himself and totally arrogant, we feel he's a flawless person in his fate. Along the way we see the changes in his character, he starts hanging out with better people, he gets to know him better, we know how many negative effects his father has in his life, it's just a big difference and the movie did a great job of turning Rick's collapse into a good-hearted person . watch and beautifully choreograph. Combining a lot of young people with some veteran experience helped make this film tremendously, it just did a fabulous job, avoiding what could have been some kind of thing to make it a fun and effective drama. I also liked the controversial contrast between Coach and Garry Cole and Rick Sean Faris |, it made a very interesting story, and I loved to see her help Rick at the same time emotionally and heartily warm up. This is a real hidden gem I really am glad to discover that it made me think about my life and many times what I need something like that. <br /> <br /> Performances. Sean Faris is outstanding as Rick Penning. He reminded me of a lot of young Tom Cruise who was very charismatic and talented. It was a difficult task to turn the mouth of a teenager to a good cordial young man, but Sean pulled it out perfectly. He clearly put his heart and soul into this film, so big praises to Sean that he put so much effort into this big movie. Gary Cole is great as a preachy but pleasant trainer who wants to help children. I've always found it to be nice, it's always sort of present with my movies. Neal McDonough is fantastic as a selfish but compulsive Rick's father. For the majority of the film, the script brings you to believe that it is nothing more than a selfish bitter man who wants Rick to be exactly like him, but finally you will see how he actually came out, I felt a little bit of a pity on him. Julie Warner is an actor of good character and plays with a good heart but a helpless mother well. Penn Badgley is required to play a real jerk and the boy will never do it well. In many cases, I wanted him to pop up, so I have to say that this is a great result. Arielle Kebbel has an interest in love that is not a big part, she did it well. Nathan West has a somewhat mysterious character, he did quite well. Sean Astin is the main player for the film, but he does nothing, he did what he was supposed to do. <br /> <br /> The bottom line-Forever Strong is a great movie feeling, it definitely makes you stop and think about how your life was much better than you thought. Don't let it slip, you won't regret it. <br /> <br /> 8 1/2/10
