not Larry Mcmurty's masterpiece, but it is in itself a good western, any lonely dove. who ever takes the role of Woodrow's speech is a great style. It is also easy to see that they wanted to use it as a serial in the TV series (both versions) and that the writers knew how to keep the taste alive William Peterson was fantastic in this respect, the geeky CSI man is not the character he plays in it - this guy can do it all that seems. <br /> <br /> It is worth to enjoy those who enjoy Western <br /> <br /> 4out5 stars
