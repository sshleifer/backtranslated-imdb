I've been waiting for nearly 25 years to see that it's hard to find a horror thriller, and I finally did it because it was properly restored on the DVD. Of course, it didn't have the same effect for me if I had seen it in the 80s, but director Lieberman (his film "Squirm" is great) uses a good Oregon location and takes time to develop characters, not just to send them creatively. High note, Brad Fiedel's whistling music is really horrible and adds hopeless procedures that make this genre fun for fans. You have to look at whether you like undervalued horror movies. To describe it, it would be an intelligent "Friday 13" sprinkled with some "Deliverance". There are some very cool and original moments, like my favorite, when a couple swims by the lake and the boy disappears with the water to play the trick with his gal - just when you think it's a normal scare, he's suddenly waiting on the shore and ... I can't honestly ruin it - you have to look at it yourself. Finally, there is only one of them that you just have to believe in? it came out somewhere and it's strange and wild! The DVD contains Lieberman's comments.
