I've seen this movie many times. I read the book Englar Alheimsins, written by Einar Már Guðmundsson, who received the Scandinavian Book Awards for his work. The movie won't start at the beginning of the book. It takes place in Reykjavik and the main character, Páll is young and has a good girl with her girlfriend. But when she interrupts her, she starts to get some headaches that make her angry and angry. Soon he will have big mental problems and then the film begins. Soon he will be named "Kleppur" by the Icelandic mental hospital, and there you will see some great symbols, such as Viktor, who thinks he is Hitler and Oli, who thinks he writes all "The Beatles" songs and sends them to them for transportation. Ingvar E Sigurðusson, who plays the role of the main character Pálli, works so well that he leaves you breathless. SIGURRÓS is also the music of this movie, and you should see a movie for the cost of music. You had to see a big movie in general.
