This movie is almost unknown, but it is very good. The lonely Danish city is home to two old siblings who remember far young people if they were to succeed because of strict puritan education. Lonely, a decent saving lives until Babette arrives, who travels by the fear of Paris. After a while, he will be able to embrace his goodness and love. A good lottery prize gives her the chance to organize a big banquet following the best rules of French gastronomy. All neighborhoods are invited (all fanatical). They accept, but they do not want to show signs of joy or pleasure as it is a sin. But the delightful power of the delicious food they eat will be tempted by the sensuality of French gastronomy. Banquet ends very well, though quietly, with happiness. Love between people has awakened. It is a miracle that a person is leaving because of this way of thinking. The film is surprisingly good, but it's not for every taste. Nothing happens during most of the movie, everything is so quiet and so peaceful that you can only see the life of the city for many minutes. But as the film evolves, it becomes more valuable when Babette wins a lottery prize (after a 30-minute movie), the show begins. With perfect leadership, the author can show us how Babette prepares a banquet, how she mixes all the ingredients with the most wonderful (Love), everyone speaks quietly tastefully, perfectly with photography and action. Then, as festively goes, the quality shows us how the mood of all the eaters changes due to the meal, only with the first frames, impressively filmed scenes one after another is simply amazing. In addition, the tactics of color and photography are also excellent, almost every movie's scene is like a picture, so there's work. If you can admire good cinema and understand that sometimes it is more important to talk about something than what is said, this is your film. If you like good dining and just love good gastronomy, you probably feel interested because most of the film's feelings are familiar to you. Oscar was completely earned. The only problem is setting this slowness story, but I can forgive him (I hope for everyone)
