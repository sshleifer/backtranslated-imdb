<br /> <br /> Having read the critics of the unemployed, I went to screen for "Radio" without knowing what to expect. Luckily for me, a critic of the unemployed, a disappointed film director / film critic, will appear. His inspection is harsh and completely unwelcome! <br /> <br /> This is a movie that makes you laugh, it makes you cry and eventually gives you a break for a moment. <br /> <p> Paraphrasing the end of actor Ed Harris in Barbershop's last scene "... and all the time we thought we were teaching Radio, the truth is ... He taught us. He treats us all the time , as we wish, we treated each other, some of that time! ‚Äù<br /> <br /> Yes, the film's tugs are heartbeats. Yes, it is emotionally manipulative and yes Cuban Gooding Jr. Christmas Day Dance Scene), but you know what? HERE! Every time for a while, the American community needs to be reminded of what tolerance can be for our big country. We need to be reminded of how big we can be. <br /> <br /> I was particularly pleased to see that Mrs Epatha Merkerson, who is the mother of the radio, does something outside the law and order. I have always wondered if Mrs Merkerson is a great actor or is it the quality of a written letter Law and order After watching the movie, it's easy see that she is really a very exquisite actor. <br /> <br /> The addition of small but important and powerful roles is Alfre Woodard, a career at Debra Winger. - The role of coach Jones wife and Chris Mulkey as protagonist Frank Clay. <br /> <br /> We cannot review Ed Harris as a trainer with Harold Jones. Having grown up after thinking about this movie and going to the south, it's hard to really appreciate Harris and his contribution to this film. Like Coach Jones, Ed Ed is a quiet, rocky, missionary man. Trainer Harris does not let the city or the circumstances know his heart, it is right to do so. <br /> <br /> When you see this movie, make sure you hang the final credit. You're a suitcase when you see a real James Robert 'Radio' Kennedy, who is now in his mid-50s. Hanna football team on the field every Friday night. <br /> <br /> One final note. If you were a teenager in the mid or late 70s, this film is worth the entrance price because the sound is alone!
