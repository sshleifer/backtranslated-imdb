This is a truly wonderful love story. I liked the songs, but even if you don't, you have to love the story. Peter O'Toole is his best and Petula Clark is doing well. I saw it for the first time when I was about 13 years old and loved it. Now, in my forties, I still enjoy it, probably even more. Still makes me cry and laugh and feel good. This is just a new age to watch a movie or with yourself because it's a chick flick. But what's wrong with that. Need some romance and maybe a little cry, try this movie. <br /> <br />
