As one of the other reviewers (might have been @ Amazon), I was first introduced to a tourist trapped, obsolete old WOR-9 NY, in January 1983. Devil Dog: The hell of a hell I was expecting to have ended when he debuted for Halloween in 1978, and I thought I had a frightening day (to give up a smile - three eyes "Borgost" (sp? ) The monster Ike Eisenmann in her room is terrifying). <br /> <br /> As much as I like Richard Crenna, who carries the horror of his television, it was the first 10 minutes of the Tourists Trap that followed Devil Dog, which really remained a sign - and a month later it was the first movie I've ever recorded on TV. WOR played it quite often, often on Saturday afternoon at the Million Dollar Movie, as others have observed. This is one of those offers that offer a strong fear of a hit, a true left hook - and then practically all the rest, dances and jabbs, putting the opening plan into a larger context, then moving on to the true climax (see Night of the Living Dead, Re Animator). <br /> <br /> Two paragraphs and I haven't mentioned one dummy. Facing - Fucking things are scary enough without music and scripts. I can also remember some of the scary dress-dummies and the like in the attics and basements of various relatives and say what you like when the relatively easy approach of Schmoeller and Carroll is - no one has played it well before or after. In real life, a good mannequin will make you with a double key - and here is the last thing you will probably see when you happen to be in the Slausen Empty Wax Museum and Roadside. Yes, there's a point ("I loved her very much") where Chuck "Slausen" Connors is trying to pass on to Vincent Price. Yes, the plot could be taken off at all points in the early stages; I can't see that script is so thick. It doesn't matter. From the direction of competent action (Meryl Streep does not press hard, and here to help prevent), another useful and effective Pino Dinaggio score (see Carrie and several other de Palma films), different luminaires, film stock, use with different sound levels ... I I could go on - every element of this low-budget production is combined and you get a job that is much larger than the sum of its parts. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that it is scary as Hell? Stephen King talked about this film in Danse Macabre a year after its release and with good reason. Like much of his work, it may not be a great art, but it certainly tells a scary story and does it well. The rest of the majority may be relatively unknown (wasn't Jocelyn Jones in this Texas autofilm?), But Chuck Connors and Tanya Roberts were, and are, just familiar to the audience to think - Stephen King's style - that it may happen to you or your known with people. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with Psycho (plot) and Texas Chainsaw Massacre (overall look and feel), even if they are not my first connections, are valid. I just want to be able to comment on the DVD I am looking for when buying, because the tourist trap has become very close to the video because of the almost complete extinction of independent video rental sites, where he had a home wor and cable in the 1980s (although TMC / Showtime seems to do it regularly raising and playing it regularly). No, there is no spoiler here, I am afraid that you will not see any plot distribution - look at it yourself (everything is fine, it may be a little tiny, so browse if you want - better safe than damage). Mannequins are frightening scary and I show rather than say ... :) <br /> <br /> For a record, the tourist is also full of great features, from "we have a party! How do I watch how I look?!" , "you are so beautiful", "you can't hurt me", "I shouldn't hide it - it looks good!" (listen to this Vincent price fluctuation there again), inevitable "you're crazy!" (delivered at the right moment and in the right tone) ... and try - just try - to keep your hair down when you hear the mannequin head yelling "Molly!" - especially if you understand whose head was before ... :) <br /> <br /> P ... Charles Band was the manufacturer, I believe, and probably had Dinaggio's music rights. The band that I understood was the brain of Full Moon Entertainment, which can explain both the later use of music in the Puppet Master and the 40 commercial approaches that have been characterized by a full month of enjoyment of the Puppet Master and Subspecies franchises. to, uhhh ... Trancers and Bad Channels (sorry, BOC).
