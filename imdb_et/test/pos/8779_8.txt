I enjoyed this movie thoroughly, which in many ways, as Hitchcock did on several occasions, was the first attempt on the plot that he later shot during his career. Perhaps the most striking thing is how seemingly the leading figures are. After watching Murray Alper as a peculiar lorry driver, Vaughan Glaser, turned a blind "patriot", an unforgettable Freak Show and, of course, Otto Kruger as a smooth and complicated villain who all overshadows Bob Cummings, rather than flying on the wood (compare this bridge to jump) Harrison Ford-like stunt in Andrew Davis "The Fugitive" and Priscilla Lane, whose heart change and subsequent love for Cummings is never quite plausible. <br /> <br /> Another great contributor is of course Hitchcock himself, who is filming the movie with two extraordinary tricks. Many people criticize older films for their lack of realistic special effects. My feelings are that, due to the lack of technology, it is even surprising and successful that the director wants to show, an amazing achievement. <br /> <br /> Of course, this film will carry a fascist message during the second phase. World War, but being Hitchcock, it is never the most important thing and the emphasis is always on action. It is worth checking, especially for support roles.
