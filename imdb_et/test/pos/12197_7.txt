If vampire tales are the blood of your cup, this Goth festival, which is the basis of Anne Rice's vampire chronicle, should be a satisfying experience. The real Undead consortium In the modern environment "The Queen of Fucking" led by Michael Rymer is the story of the shadows and darkness and the unhappy souls who live there forever. <br /> <br /> Vampire Lestat (Stuart Townsend), a dull world that irritates her, has been sleeping for years; but suddenly, the sounds of the world he hears from his prolonged slumber change, and those who love what he hears, make him study. What she finds is a world full of new sounds, new types of music - driving and penetrating - sounds that attack the senses and make her live and welcome. And he knows that his time has finally come, that it is time for him and his peers to have an open and open world under their conditions. To achieve this goal, he becomes the forefront of the band - singer and performer, unlike any world that has ever been known. He introduces himself as a vampire and collects very quickly that goes far beyond London (where it all begins) and eventually leads to California at Death Valley, where he plans to give a concert that will be something other than anyone has ever seen or experienced. <br /> <br /> Lestat is powerful, without any doubt, but there are also those of their own who do not take on the fact that they have discovered them, one of which is Marius (Vincent Perez), a vampire that is a powerful self - vampire who "made" Lestas so many years earlier - and they collect, come together and make their plans to meet Lestat at a concert. And they don't go to music. But there is something else: at one point Lest is involuntarily awakened by the "mother" of the most powerful vampires, Akasha (Aaliyah), who makes his presence known to everyone and especially to what he has chosen to rule as his king: Lestat. At the concert, it is certain that Akasha will be without a failure. <br /> <br /> Don't make a mistake, it's Lestat's story, and Rymer introduces this atmosphere to a rich environment and some fine moments. although his film has less bites than to say, "Vampire Chat" or "Bram Stokeri Dracula". He sets a good pace and there are some scenes that offer some real thrills, but in general this film is not as dangerous as it could be, or as much as one could expect. Ultimately, the amount of burnt meat overcomes the actual rent of blood, although there is more than gore taste, and more than the fair share of lips and mouths that drip with red things. There is also good F / X, especially in sequences that emphasize the speed of vampires as they move and fly through the air faster than the naked eye. This is a decent job for Rymer, but he could have put more teeth when he played Lestat's implied alienation; As it is, you will get your exit feeling, but not enough to fully involve you. <br /> <br /> "In a Vampire Interview", Tom Cruise brought some charismatic powers to the role, but Townsend is even more effective, gaze and attitude that made Lestas great. She plays her feeling and, at a closer look, you can even find a hint and a longing. This is a good result and one that sells its character convincingly. <br /> <br /> Like Marius, Vincent Perez is doing a good job - he is actually one of the strengths of the film - although his character is a bit unclear; however, it is more related to his writing than Perez, which is quite good. Marguerite Moreau, like Jesse, is a young woman who is too interesting for her own, with significant performances; and proud Lena I was like Maharet, Aunt Jesse, who plays the final role in the drama of Lestat and Akashat. <br /> <br /> And like Akasha, Aaliyah is an absolutely riveting presence. The more you can say about him, if he is a talented performer with enormous talent and beauty. And tragically he left us too early. <br /> <br /> Supported by Paul McGann (David), Christian Manon (Mael), Claudia Black (Pandora), Bruce Spence (Khayman), Matthew Newton (Armand), Tiriel Mora (Roger) and Megan Dorman ( Maudy). Being a much stronger story than the usual offerings of this particular genre, Anne Rice's fans are particularly pleased with "The Queen of Fucking", a film directed and directed by director Rymer and her interesting performance. Rymer has paid attention to the real horror film, which is definitely mentioned above, and just focusing on the story of drama - and how it is presented - instead of focusing on just offering cheap excitement. wake up your appetite more the same. And that's the magic of movies. I appreciate it 7/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
