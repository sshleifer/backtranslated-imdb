I consider myself a huge fan of horror. One night I wanted to rent some newer horror movies. Then I rented Milo. I was so surprised. It frightened my hell. I can't say that very often. Usually Halloween only scares me. <br /> <br /> Two other friends looked at me and the feeling was disturbed. Feel good when you ask me after watching the horror film. If you don't touch, then what is it? <br /> <br /> This movie was original. It did not follow the usual instructions of horror films. That's why films like Valentine were bombarded by me. <br /> <br /> Of course, many have missed questions like most horror movies do. It is worth the rent though.
