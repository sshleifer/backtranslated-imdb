I like Tom Hanks and he is one of the few actors who pulls me into the theater no matter what doubts I may have. I'm worried that Hanks Hanks will return to "light comedy" because it is the arena where he made the transition from television to film - remember "Big"? Well, "Charlie Wilson's war" is not an easy comedy. It is a political satire and a very well written political satire. The script is the star of this movie and Aaron Sorkin's forging is the best offer this year. <br /> <br /> Mike Nicols keeps the whole composition, offering a movie that pulls in a very fast 90 minutes (timing is all in comedy and nothing is ever fun when it pulls). Nicols' choice of kits and lighting also resembles the 70's and 80's TV, a movement that is deliberately used to root a piece over a period of time. <br /> <br /> Back to model work and stock photography, digital special effects also enhance the retro look and credibility. Note to product designers who choose your stock shots: I know the difference between F-16 and MiG and Belli and Hindi. But it can also be a joke. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in Philadelphia. It was interesting to watch and listen to the audience. DO NOT get historical references to your history. History tends to recur because recidivists have forgotten what happened for the first time. <br /> <br /> Knit for both Hanks and Chameleon Phillip Seymore Hoffman. The Sorkin script is brought to life by these participants and the entire production team is on the front of their game. <br /> <br /> We heartily recommend.
