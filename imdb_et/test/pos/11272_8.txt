One of the most unique movies I've ever seen has been started. For me, this is more of a study and movement of sound, light, and darkness than a true story. The thing you see in the Museum of Modern Art as a video film is in a local theater. I am not trying to interpret mother-like pictures, wild animals in the shelter, the twisted and tortured body of her "child". Some things just can't interpret.
