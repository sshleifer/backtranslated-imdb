This flick was the introduction of many men to K Gordon Murray's work. This is because it was easy to find. It was in every public domain of the VHS era and before that late night. cult classic, double knee thigh blow. Besides, how do you resist the title? The Mexican ORIGINAL were at first strange; American borders and accepted horror film conventions were joyfully ignored. Beside the strange or ridiculous special effects, there were great, great designs and lighting. Nothing in Hollywood was so close that they were out and strange. Now, mix Catholic influenced social conventions, Mexican folklore, and we are no longer in Kansas. <br /> <br /> Add that to the English scripts they copied. Most of them are written by Reuban Guberman, who wanted the words to fit with the lips of the actors, not in the direct translation. As a result, American soundtracks tended to run into a burnt and right loop. For Murray, even the fan website that prints the best, most top lines for each movie. For the first time, film viewers complain about the temple, purple prose, product values, and they are told that it is when people laugh with the pleasures that are usually considered a deadly film shortage. All this must be very confusing if you don't have that taste. <br /> <br /> It was back in 1957 with two previous films; AZTEC MUMMY and AZTEC MUMMY COURSE. All three are now available in 3 disks AZTEC MUMMY COLLECTION (BCI) and it's about time. On one side is the version of K Gordon Murray, on the other side it is the original Mexican production. The contrast between the two is exciting. Many times when the original Spanish is not much saner. <br /> <br /> ROBOT / MUMMY starts with a nice long setback that brings you to the speed of previous episodes. window number two and it is downhill, logical. You can't even get Angel back or mention him in this last episode. Names, places, even family trees change between films. After a while, you start looking for consistency changes. <br /> <br /> By now, the Doc Krupp, a digger in the series, is bite-bite, almost demented, and STILL wants to steal the asters chest. Rosita Arenas is sent back to the past with another nice editing of the AZTEC MUMMY floor image and drives in the dark at night to help find that dog's chest again. The mummy isn't happier with it, he was the last time. <br /> <br /> The robot actually has a production credit. It was made by Viana & Co S.A. I mention this because it seems that the handles come in between, slowly take in the afternoon when the actual costume went. No. <br /> <br /> It was planned. <br /> <br /> Wait until you see the controller from where it works. X box where you were when Krupp NEEDED? Robot LOOKS ends with death, but actually came back to two more Mexican films. They had a FAN BASE .. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a funny peculiar reference to three movie series. Sit and have fun.
