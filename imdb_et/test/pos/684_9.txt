"Shurspeare shaking" could be considered the first class of "Our Gang" talk time. By now, Hal Roach's studios began to talk about taking pictures and "Shakespeare" is a happy result. <br /> <br /> Gang appears in Quo Vadis, a version made by Kennedy Cop's wife. Children do not find the game very fun to be in the theater and people do not know what they are playing. Among the more funny bits is Kennedy Cop like a giant who pulls his makeup to fight a benign man in a costume of a bull; and a terrible dancing girl (directed by Bob McGowan's daughter.) <br /> <br /> Several filmography mentioned that "Shakespeare" has the first pie fight. This may be true, seeing that they tried different speeds in the fight with the film. Buster Keaton's brother Harry is at the end of one of the pies. A very funny and early Gang talkie classic. 9 out of 10
