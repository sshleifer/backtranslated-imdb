When I saw Gone's wind, I thought there couldn't be better actors than Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable to play Scarlett and Rhett, but then I saw the Scarlet movie. I loved this dramatic story. I love Timothy Dalton as Rhett Butler, he's fantastic. This is a movie I could watch a thousand times and it still didn't carry me.
