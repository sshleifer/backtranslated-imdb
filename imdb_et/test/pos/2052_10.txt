I thought it was a great activity. Geena Davis's very good role. He is a very versatile actor. One of my favs next to Angelina Jolie. I looked immediately after I saw a new Tomb Rider movie. I thought, Charlie or Lara? Which wins the fight? Either way, both women are very strong, intelligent characters that are fun to watch. Especially when they hit the butt. I just hope to see Geen in another movie. He seems to have lit up a little too long. It would be particularly nice to see her in another movie with Samuel L. Jackson. Now they make a great duo. Watch this movie if you haven't. You don't have to be disappointed.
