I would like to say that I loved Campfire Tales! For me it was one of the original horrors that had a twisted end. As the movie's content wouldn't be scary or weird, you have an end. This is a very fantastic movie and I'm so happy to appear on the DVD on August 30th. I will not hesitate to copy this day. I don't think the film got all the credit or credit it would have been because all those other films came out soon and admitted, but if my brother didn't talk about this movie, I wouldn't have known it. What stinks, because I think it's much better than any "Scream", "I know what you did last summer," or any other horror at that time. So I hope you can see the movie yourself and at least see the difference. I loved it, and I was a horror junkie, Campfire Tales was for me a dessert!
