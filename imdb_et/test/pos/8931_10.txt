Well, my father traveled to Lee Evans back and forth to see some of the things done. This is a great movie! Bob Pugh walked away with the lawn mower, and he accidentally let go and went to the fence and fell over. <br /> <br /> Lee Evans was also funny when he saw me and said you were cold, I said yes and he said you worship your hands in your pockets! I think it was really funny and it's a well-known comedy. Like every other Lee Evans movie! They were very big people. they seemed pretty polite and funny. I'd like to meet them one day again. Brenda Blethyn walked down her caravan with her blood and knocked on her dirty hair and got really scared because I didn't notice her until she was behind me
