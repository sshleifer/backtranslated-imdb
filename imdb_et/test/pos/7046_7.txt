I rarely still barely watch comedy movies or television these days. They are inconvenient, vulgar, and most importantly, not funny. It can be considered a refreshing blast from the past. It's worth a look and I don't think it would be dated in any significant way. Classical humor is a classic humor and good writing is good writing regardless of the time it was created. <br /> <br /> I would like to see this movie again; it came to mind, having recently seen a somewhat similar summer school on television. Like a slightly newer film, "Meatballs" is funny, cruel, too sexual, or with a sense of humor in the bathroom. Of course, the key factor is how the nature of adults changes the life of a teen - or even a life-saving change - and how they both grow in the summer.
