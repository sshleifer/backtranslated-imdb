Although I lived in Australia in 1975, I moved a long way abroad, being constantly worshiped by industrial unrest, mediocrity of mediocrity, if no one is an athlete! - and the satisfaction of so many Australians who decided to ignore the pace of change in their northern countries. <br /> <br /> Consequently, I missed The Dismissal with many other 80's and 90's Australian TV dramas such as the wonderful Janus and Phoenix series I've ever seen with Wildside. <br /> <br /> The story of The Dismissal is fair and, as far as I know, it is accurate. However, in the case of public "outrage", it only shows one image, not how the families were controversial. I know my two brothers are not talking to me for months. <br /> <br /> But I think the comment is very similar. The inevitable fact is that, despite the fierce fires of the large community, the Australian electorate - and decided decisively - favored Fraser, as they did again two years later. <br /> <br /> It is historically accurate and excellently worked by docudrama.
