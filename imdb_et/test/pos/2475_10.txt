Death Camp Opera: Right Here, Right Now! <br /> <br /> Ten years ago I read a very special film directed at the polarization of our society. The author was a certain Peter Watkins. His picture was taken by some non-professional participants, like you and me, the citizens? and others. Atmospheric violence was described as extremely realistic. Was it a movie, a documentary? Both are actually so. <br /> <br /> Over the years I realized how difficult it was to find it. Maybe I would be a coincidence? Anyway, it's still an old story. I saw it a while ago. Totally impressive. My very favorite peace: the punishment park is its name. I love this "doctoral thesis", this "truecastmovie", this "realityhowfictionnal", whatever. After I saw all the hit films, I get the best of this strong and intense cinematic experience. I found a masterpiece. There are plenty of things to know about the film online. It's even buying DVDs, additional things. The only word I want to add is my own experience with this film. I can trust such a sincere and involved peace that concerns people and people, those who seek, act, or watch. Cinema, which is just a real human experience in the art adventure? or vice versa. <br /> <br /> So I'm not talking about all the "mucs" we see on television, especially "show reality", for whom their own concepts are interesting but usable in a stupid and perverse way. In the Park of Penalties, we see some real people living as they are. We'll put them in a very specific context, followed by a few lines, and let them have what they want. It is a kind of therapy, a way of "individual" inside the film and also of the active spectators in front of the screens. Then the director's touch ends with a short and sweet apocalypse film, a desperate laugh, a death camp opera where some people are after virulent trials. The Punishment Park is for those who want to grow. Watch this movie and you have the opportunity to choose your own morale. Grow and unify yourself with it! If you feel it! If you see it !! In my case, the punishment park inside me is forever, with all my love, consciousness, and will.
