Britain and France declared war on Germany in 1939, but by that time almost all of Europe had fallen prey to the Nazi war machine. When the war came, Britain started practically from scratch, with little supplies and with the air forces that Germany had over ten. But the British will was certain, as confirmed by their new Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who said: "We will never go down". <br /> <br /> On August 8, 1940, the battle for the British was. But for the first time since Hitler's established attitude to conquer the world, he hit the wall. Although the British Royal Air Force went massively, they went to the culprit, and in September and October 1940, the twenty-thousand seventy-five lost plane and crews of the German Luftwaffe went up. Hitler's rage was busy, but he had to call for a moment. Later, at the beginning of the year, Hitler launched a massive fire bombing in London on the Christmas Day of 1940. If I say that during this attack, London's real-life movie movies have never attacked the catastrophe, it would be too little. Perhaps the most surreal effect of this chapter would be in the "Why do we fight" series so that British citizens get out of their underground shelters after bomb attacks to continue their life on earth. Even if you look, it is not possible to understand the living horrors that these people have to go through because the city of London was a virtual ruin. <br /> <br /> But the Nazis were stunned and also bullied. All that Hitler wanted to believe in freedom and democracy was now turned on with this head. Instead of being a weak will and dissatisfaction like the French, the British are not going to give up without a fight. And they fought, attacked Germany and responded to non-monetary attacks on German homeland. It was a turning point, forcing Hitler to rethink his strategy.
