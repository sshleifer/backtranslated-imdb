This is a classic sequel to Bleu, as well as a great movie where Juliet Binouche is the main star, moreover, she is here in the city of Lady, in just one second. But this movie, really red and very sweet, though very sad, is a real winner. The main heroine, always played by great Irene Jakob, is a successful photo / fashion model. He leads a full, active life, but blinds his traumatic relationship with his strange friend Mike, who is in England. If she is happy, she will become an old judge friendly, spending time with her neighbors to listen to private phone calls. The story begins to narrate further and we see him in court, being almost always condemned for his pastimes. He is the only one who knows him for his compassion for his lovely dog ​​Rita and his sons and the people around them. We are also seeing the breakdown of a young lawyer and his lady's happy couple, and their strife is supported by this phone scandal ... But the film is not even about that. It is mostly between loneliness and deep attacks between people, far and near. When he rides a ferry to England, where this lawyer is a co-user, just as Binoche, who celebrated Bleus, saw the ship open and see the awful appearance of the judge when he looks at the news trying to guess whether he lived. He did it and we still feel very hard. Mr. Kislowskil managed to lead loneliness, misunderstanding, mysteries and pain. Deep, dark personal pain that is lost and lonely. Brilliant movie.
