I sold the dead is a big, sloppy horror comedy that refuses to take it too seriously. It has advantages and disadvantages. The movie's 85-minute air and film are sometimes funny, sometimes frightening, sometimes fun, sometimes all three, but the single bits are much better than the sum of the parts of the movie. The story, as it is, follows Arthur Blaket, a professional tombstone player (played by Dominic Monaghan). Arthur's partner-in-criminal Willie Grimes (Larry Fessenden) had just had to break his head and Arthur had one night before his own head had lost the same crime. Arthur emphasizes that he is innocent of murder, but there are many other crimes he is willing to admit when a Catholic priest (played by Ron Perlman) against Irish whiskey. <br /> <br /> Since the movie, Arthur has recognized a series of anecdotes of grave attacks, it becomes a kind of horror anthology - a number of divergent stories that all relate to similar pain (Arthur and Willie) and a similar topic (grave robbery). Like most horrorantologies, there is no consistent mythology as all mythologies are true and occur at the same time when they are in conflict with one another. <br /> <br /> Probably, I didn't see this movie with Trick that night, 'R Treat, a horror anthology that avoids all the traps I sell to the dead. In fact, Trick 'R Treat, created as an anthology, tells a more coherent and consistent story than I sell dead, which is meant to be a common story. <br /> <br /> Another problem with the movie (and I know it is crazy) is the way the movie plays fast and loose with history. Grimes are killed with guillotine. Perhaps we can draw a point and say that it is being killed by the French guillotine predecessor, Scottish Maiden, but Scottish Maiden was abandoned in 1709 and this film has been set one hundred years later, since Burke and Hare have been mentioned and executed in 1829 for condemnation. The grave abduction as an industry became obsolete with the passing of the Anatomy Act (1832), so the film must take place before that. <br /> <br /> I know that building it is the ultimate historic nerdiness and we are clearly dealing with the universe where all kinds of dead, dead and legendary dead are possible, but the easiest way to affirm the fantasy to persuade the audience to stop their infidelity is to use something real and authentic to bounce the fantasy away. And it's not like the history of tomb robbers or body snatchers or the resurrection of history (name what you like) is a boring story. <br /> <br /> The most depressing thing is that the writer Glenn McQuaid clearly knows the history, especially the good bit. For example, when Grimes first takes Arthur as his apprentice, he rightly explains to Arthur that as rescuers, they do not steal clothes from the dead, because stealing the corpses is a misdemeanor punished by a small fine, while the clothes are stolen by a small fine punishable by deportation or even death. So you should expect Wille and Arthur to push the body at this point (and the rest of the movie), but of course they won't. You can blame the director for ignoring your writer's script, but not when the writer and director are the same person. <br /> <br /> My point is not that there should have been many abandoned corpses in the movie, my point is that if you intend to raise this law and make it clear that Willie and Arthur will follow the law, no matter what how stupid is it if you think that you should follow this thinking as a logical conclusion even if it means that Willie and Arthur stop the zombie through the graveyard, trying to cut off their clothes and put them back into the empty coffins so that they do not send the deported body clothes steal it, otherwise it will not produce it at all. <br /> <br /> Historical hunger aside, I sell dead is worth renting as a light but funny horror film that could have been much more.
