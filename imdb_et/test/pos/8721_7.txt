In addition to the discotheque scenes that reflect the jerky sixties (especially when everyone dances into instrumental versions of the Monkeys hits), I am surprised how well this lightweight farce will rise up to 37 years later, but indeed it is due to its cheating fatigue. and a three-line sharp interaction. The 1969 comedy headed by GÃ¶te Saks, the doubling director of Gene Saxony, is Julian Winston, a successful Manhattan dentist and a certified bachelor who pretends to be married to avoid a long-term commitment to his young girlfriend of the year. Toni. In response to Toni's half-hearted suicide attempt, Julian agrees to marry her, but Toni first calls her wife to meet her conscience. Enter Julian's dedicated sister Stephanie to play his wife, and white lies in inevitable complications grow into larger sons, leading to expected couplers and de-couplings. a fraudulent dentist in his usual sardonic sense, but he lets his two female star cards go down with the picture. With its big screen debut, the 24-year-old Goldie Hawn still retains his ridiculous "Laugh-In" personality, but offers unexpected savvy and depth like Toni. He and Matthau have great, untold chemistry in their scenes. Screen Legend Ingrid Bergman, who is still calm in the 54s, has obviously played the ball with Stephanie, originally starchy and quick, but flourished in the liberated spirit as the story evolves. I especially like how casual he appears after staying overnight. Rick Lenz is a great supportive work for Harry, the friend of Toni's bohemian neighbor Igor and Jack Weston as Julian's fragrant actor. Billy Wilder's long-standing partner, I.A.L. Diamond, gives a glittering scenario and opens its story outside Germany, which is not a cinematography of directors. After a couple of trailers, there are no significant additions to the DVD.
