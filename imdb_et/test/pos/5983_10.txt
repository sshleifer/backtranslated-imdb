In Belarus in 1942, the Nazi-friendly Belarusians seized two Soviet soldiers. In captivity, the attitude of the two men towards their fate varies greatly. One of the soldiers can find the inner strength and spirituality that is incomprehensible to another person. Larisa Shepitko's latest film is one of the most beautiful films in the history of cinema. Vladimir Chuchnov's cinematic art is incredible - especially in the opening system, where the loneliness and almost desperate character of rural Belarusian lands are depicted by long, slow, observational photographs that set the mood perfectly. It is easy to compare Tarkovsky's films, all the more so because Tarkovsky's alter ego Anatoly Solonitsyn has a small but important part in the ascent. The action is generally brilliant, especially by Boris Plotnikov, in Sotnikov. The film highlights the old-fashioned belief in the strength of religious passion, which seems to be related to characters such as Dostoevsky's Prince Myshkin or Tarkovski Stalker. But this is not the weakness of the film, but rather one of the greatest strengths. Religious content seems so honest and human that it cannot be moved. The emotional wealth of the film cannot be overestimated; the answer is not as simplified as you think it would be a short summary. The slow development of the characters and the emphasis on these complicated relationships with each other somewhat resemble the great Soviet film. The rise deserves a second view, as well as a third and a tenth. It still offers interesting ideas, beautiful images and emotional complexity.
