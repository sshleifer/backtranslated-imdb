There was a recent documentary film about a long list of actors and directors who talk about what he wants to make films. One common theme was that you could have a great script, a great cast, the best director and a lot of money and still create a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Periscope is proof of the consequences of this theory. Not an original or terribly well written scenario. Some solid actors, but mostly unknown, and this movie makes you laugh loud! It would be easy to say that Kelsey's grammar wore this movie, but that's not really the case. Other characters, such as Rob Schneider, and fun at Harland Williams, greatly increased the enjoyment of the film. <br /> <br /> The cast dynamics or mysterious "movie magic" is actually what happened here, the smooth flow of movie creation, the well-done transitions and the line after a well-written and well-conducted dialogue. <br /> <br /> Uneven assumptions, many technical inaccuracies, and simply planning stupid things that could not have happened to the real world or the real navy, but you just don't care. As a sailor, I found that the overall feeling of the film, although not believable, was not far from the sign of living on the sea. <br /> <br /> This is a very funny movie of a good family film, especially if your fan, a lot of Kelsey grammar, sarcasm and just fucking funniness.
