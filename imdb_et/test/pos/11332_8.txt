The title of the Chinese film "The Mood of Love" is "fa yeung nien wah". It can be interpreted as "those blossoming years (which were once)." <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a well-made piece. A simple, complex story about love, spoken with a visual approach. Wong Kar-Wai, a writer-director, has choreographed a dance of hearts - it's her, it's her, it's love. I hear Galasso's theme: dum dum-dum, dum dum-dum and strings - almost like heartbeats. Preluud, stanzade and epilogue piece. <br /> <br /> Director optimized the use of music (Michael Galasso score, Nat King Cole singing in Spanish and Chinese songs / stories). Rhythm and words require viewers to see what he or she is rather a feeling / thinking than a verbal dialogue. I hear Nat King Cole, who gives us clues: "Aquello ojos verde" (this thing, flowing, eyes green) plays when two meet, and "Quizas, quizas, quizas" (or ??? > <br /> Nostalgia passes through the whole movie: details of the design are rich: handbags and ties; novelty of the Japanese rice cooker; green pattern of green glass cups and plates and plates (I remember daddy deserving them at home); mahjong sitting; kitchen; bedroom furnishings, thermos designed for extracting noodles that it swings as it walks.
