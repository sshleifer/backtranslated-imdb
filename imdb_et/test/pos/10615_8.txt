*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** It's easy to see why this movie script won the Oscar. At least in the first half. My head spinning from all the shining lines. Noel Coward plays the New York publisher ("Why don't you publish nice books?" - "What? And the public corrupt?") Who competes and manipulates with many of their clothes hangers. Then he dies during an air strike and the story becomes a strange start for Flying Dutchman, where Coward must find someone who really mourns him before his soul can rest in peace. Very enjoyable until it becomes strange. Review of Cinefest in Syracuse, March 2003.
