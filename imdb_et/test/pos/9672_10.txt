Family Guy must be my favorite movie of all time. It is definitely a more fun TV show that has ever been made and what is better than the Simpsons. The exhibition covers plots, characters and themes. There are very few topics that have not been addressed by Family Guy. <br /> <br /> I've seen almost every Family Guy episode ever done and done it. we have to say that the show was better in the first two seasons. My favorite characters are Peter because he is very funny and it is the best character of the show. My second favorite is Stewie, because she's a funny guy to show on the TV. I hope this exhibition never ends, because it is a comic genius! 10/10
