I am a big fan of Larkin's works, I believe he was among the biggest poets of the 20th century. The film itself makes Hull a great justice. All participants in their role are admirably admirable. Bonneville makes a service for sexually repressed Larkin, avoids the impression and tends to remain a caricature. The use of his poetry was to highlight the object. Instead of thinking about Larkin's massive intensity, his words give a better view of the plot and add a much more exciting but more exciting atmosphere. Most enjoyable.
