Lost writers have crossed over. The two season finals are even more heartbeat and more intense than the season's first finals. The lack of Locke's beliefs has not only led to spiritual consequences for himself, but to tragic physical consequences for other hostile lives. Michael's betrayal gave him success, but can he escape from the island? He must, if he wants to survive in life. I have no doubt that one or more of his former friends would like to kill him with revenge. This final has left more questions than the previous final; and i can't wait to fall. <br /> <br /> Side note: What is posting a review to write all spoilers? Where is the joy of all the others? The current overview on this page is nothing more than a great fat spoiler fest, barely built in barely readable English, which is designed to make someone crazy. Good work.
