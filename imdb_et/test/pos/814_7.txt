The story is a working girl (Ann Sothern) with a pretty thoughtless boy (Paul Kelly). This boy is so busy that he is trying to start his own business, which again and again forgets dates or shows late. The final shoulder is when Sothern has a birthday and Kelly says she is too busy to celebrate her. So she doesn't just want to stay home, she goes for a dark time, which turns out to be a very rich young man (Neil Hamilton). Sparks fly, but it also appears after Sothern interrupts his relationship with Kelly that a new boyfriend, Hamilton, is "love" and to leave an "em" guy. It is not too difficult to predict how this will all be resolved - it is simply enough to say that everything will eventually work perfectly perfectly. <br /> <br /> This is a very modest little movie from Columbia's picture - a relatively small budget and second level stars. This is clearly a "B-film", despite the fact that Mickey Rooney and Jane Darwell play small roles - as both were still famous. Now it is NOT to say that these are bad actors or production is not good. In fact, given the production values, this is a pretty amazing film, because everything seems to work so well, despite the rather usual and somewhat predictable plot sketch. The reason for this is that the actors and directors did a very good job, giving the story. In addition, the writers did a good job of making and caring for humanists. Especially it really ends up sweet and practically my little pipes were running! Because of these factors, the film earns from 7 out of 10.
