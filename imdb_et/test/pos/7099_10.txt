The look and feel of this film has been put together in a daily fashion like Plan 9 From Space Space. Nonetheless, it is still a classic grade among my favorite features. ***** POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD ******* Count Dracula and Larry Talbot; namely, Wolfman, arrives at Dr. Edelman's laboratory to look for his social social behavior at night, such as killing people. In the meantime, dr. Edelman Frankenstein's monster body. Becoming obsessed with revitalizing it (the common trait of the scientists, crazy or otherwise), he contradicts his better judgment, resulting in monster chaos and madness. One of the most universal classics of that time (Abbot and Costello meet Franken after 3 years), it evaluates 10 with this reviewer. Onslow Steven steals the exhibition as a good doctor, who is bad after being infected with Dracula blood and becoming a werewolf / vampire for a tragic purpose. 1 hour 7 min. it packs a pretty punch. A worthy addition to my video collection. <br /> <br /> Rating: ***** *****
