I usually run away from film festivals and don't enjoy slap comedy, but I have to say that this picture was great. I immediately recognized David Krumholtz's "Numbers" TV show and Lorraine Bracco, Roseanne Arquette and Karen Black were their best. It is a comedy with an incredibly high level of visual, spoken, and satirical intermediaries that kept the audience and me laughing at a pretty deeply rooted plot. <br /> <br /> To weave Mr Parness to the delicate but real subject in a way that his audience can make full use of at every level of intellect. The plot remains intact throughout the film and the comic relief adds to the message without being so thick to distort. The mixing of the Segway is beautiful and the overall product is delicious. <br /> <br /> I can definitely say that this movie is one that goes a long way and should be viewed by viewers of all ages; the problem is real and thus the strong impact of its production.
