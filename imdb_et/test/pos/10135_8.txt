Corniness Warning. As many IMDb colleagues already know, I am not a bright, cheesy person. If you don't want to read this review, go. <br /> <br /> To tell the truth, you hear it from a man who laughed at Titanic and almost shattered the constant rewind of his parents' tape propeller scene. last year in august. Drill trailers rolled until one started so calmly. It was for the radio. The moment I saw the trailer, I just had to see this movie open at the weekend. When this weekend rolled, Scary Movie 3 was too much out, so many teenagers had been waiting for that Friday night. It turns out that the movie was sold out and these teenagers were so desperate to see the movie, they went and sold Good Boy and Radio. I didn't get a ticket and in the following weeks I was busy with the most important things. About 5 months later my friend rented a radio. He allowed me to borrow and I watched it in my room. I'm telling you this now, it's the only movie I've ever seen that I've ever cried to. When Radio's mother died, it automatically came out. The next day I went to Blockbuster and bought a DVD. <br /> <br /> Well enough for my stupid personal story, let me tell you about the movie. <br /> <br /> Stars like a person with a mental challenge called radio. Ed Harris celebrates and is directed by Mike Tollin. Based on the actual story, Radio is a teenager who has a life, spending most of his day. She goes around with a shopping cart that receives everything she gets and is always around. He has his own collection. At the end of each day, she goes to her mother. He never went to school later in school. One day, the radio goes through a local high school, while the football team is practicing. Football flies over the garden and the radio takes it up and continues. Ed Harris plays football coach Mr. Jones. They meet and this is the life of the radio. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, radio and coach Jones spend a good time teaching each other. It's nice to see how the movie goes to the highest levels of joy, the lowest low places, and just see how the radio lives. You laugh, cry and live with the life of the radio. This movie has a special place in my heart with Toy Story and elsewhere. It is for the whole family, for yourself, or if you are someone who just wants a big drama, you have to see it. Radio is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. I will never forget me. Never. <br /> <br /> Like Ed Harris's sign at the end of the movie, he said: <br /> <br /> "We don't teach the radio, the radio teaches us." <br /> <br /> My Rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
