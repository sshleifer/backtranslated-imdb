Unlike some former commentators, I was (and am) an avid fan of woodworkers. Faced with Christmas, Christmas without Carpenters would never be Christmas. That means I believe the film did a good job, not a good job of portraying Karen's life. The movie was pleasant to see in primeime on TV, but the content fell slightly. I suggest you all look into receiving some of Carpenters special offers that appeared in the 70s. You can't believe how big the drummer Karen was. Cynthia did not hit Karen's talent. Karen was also beautiful, but she had a bad hairdresser. My choice for playing Karen is Hilary Swank. I would like to see a more substantive story, because Karen was more than the one that meets the eyes when we hear that we have just started. I have tons of unpublished Carpenters music and it's absolutely great. (Dreamin singing in California must die).
