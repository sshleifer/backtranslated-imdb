Another director of Cohen's Second World War comedy trilogy (others are up to the road of death and part of "Adolf Hitler - my part of his fall") is the BBC's long-standing (and much loved) film version of comedy. Like most TV broadcasts, this film suffers from lack of film and is more of a set of sketches. Some of them work better than others, such as a scene where a high-level army officer swims by the river is a memorable, surreal moment. <br /> <br /> The joy of this movie is that it is a past that probably never existed and England, as defined by the picturesque countryside, and the chance that she will see veterinary scene stealers like John Le Mesurier, considering their biggest film roles. Arthur Lowe is great as Captain Mainwaring, a bungler who, when the chips are down, shows great courage and saves the day (the climax is probably the biggest moment of the character). <br /> <br /> The episodes of TV series are of course more fun, but as a British legend, you won't find anything better.
