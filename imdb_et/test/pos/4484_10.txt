This is one of the best films I saw this year! I don't agree with the person who said it was boring. Of course, some people may not scare the film at all, but I personally spent a very good moment. This movie exchanges very scary scenes. There is also a pleasant sense of humor. For example, if a woman tells her husband that her father has abused her childhood and then says her husband, "How can someone abuse you," and then she tries to fix her in the bed of sexual games: D Very funny! I recommend this movie to everyone and by the way, I apologize for my bad English (I'm from France).
