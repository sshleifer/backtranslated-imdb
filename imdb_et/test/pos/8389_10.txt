Inglorious Basterds does not apologize, does not ask for forgiveness, it is not an obstacle to the senses. Tarantino doesn't care if he insults when he moves over stereotypes and clich√©s, making this film the cleanest. It's nice to see a filmmaker whose work isn't obviously disturbed. Tarantino is a master of great tension effort and suddenly, with a stir, laughs out loud; you are not sure if you should look laugh or rob with a smile, whether it is a roller-skate and one should not stay! It's not for everyone and I'm not sure how the Germans are taking the film, if you are not a fan of the Tarantino style, it can be a little hard to swallow, but never, it's a movie that just has to be seen. No independent film fan should leave it. And Christoph Waltz's performance ... Oscar doesn't dare to ignore him !!
