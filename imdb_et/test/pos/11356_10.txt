I think Elvis Mitchell, a New York Times film critic, wrote a review of one of the best in The Mood for Love when he said it was a "romantic spirit that has disappeared forever." How true are those words! Truly romantic movies are so rare, but movies that contain a lot of sexuality and nudity (often depicted terribly and free) are numerous. So, given this cinematic climate, Wong Kar-wai's last film seems to be the most necessary breath of the freshest air. In terms of love, two neighbors are talked about (Mr Chow, Tony Leung and Mrs. Chan, played by Maggie Cheung), whose spouses have an illegal thing, as they try to be like them. "But after hanging one after the other (if their spouses are away from" business "/" caring for a sick mother "), they get crazy in love and have to respond to the temptation to go too far. The Mood for Love among the "classic" romantic melodrams, the best meaning of this concept. First, the specific period of the movie (ie the 1960s in Hong Kong) will be restored faithfully in detail. Secondly, Christopher Doyle's award-winning, breathtaking cinematic environment, which not only surrounds its two main characters, but seems to be a romantic longing for each of its rich, carefully crafted frameworks. Don't make this mistake: For the sake of love, 2001 was the most amazing film. Eve Eg: Chan walked in her elegant dresses, Chan and Chow over each other as they passed each other along the stairs, and other beautiful scenes that eat in memory. The main result - which makes its instruments sound as if they were literally crying - is heard eight times at different points in the film, and it reveals the sadness and longing that the two main characters are feeling. Fourth, Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung give great performances (Leung won the Cannes Best Actress Award) and they succeed in creating real chemistry on the screen. <br /> <br /> The above elements combine and work so well together to create a movie that knows timeless, "dazed romantic" and the word "magic". In love with love, maybe more than any other in 2001. year movie, reminded me why I love movies. And I think this is the highest compliment I can pay for the film. <br /> <br />
