"Broadcast News" is directed by James L. Brooks (Endearment conditions as good as it is) and has a great cast, including William Hurt, Albert Brooks and Holly Hunter. Everyone gives a good result, but they are too unlikely to really care for them. <br /> <br /> Some movie parts are really brilliant, like a prologue and short scenes with Jack Nicholson. The main reason why it does not work is the film that is based on the fact that the characters are fun, not fun things with them. <br /> <br /> You could not only do it drama, but often too silly to be there. However, the script makes it worth watching. Definitely not for everyone. <br /> <br /> 7.0 out of 10
