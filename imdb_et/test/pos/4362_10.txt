Little Dieter needs to fly to my first film at the 1999 Gothenburg Film Festival. Since I was extremely tired tonight, I was hesitant to see it, but IMDB's kidnapped overall score 9 made me there. <br /> <br /> It was 80 minutes of pure vitality! Dieter Dengler's life experience in his own words was enchanting. <br /> <br /> SEE! And if possible ... look at this cinema!
