Jazz's soundtrack makes it seem like Clint Eastwood's film. <br /> <br /> Actually, the whole thing hits me like Burt, who makes Clint. The story is good and the film is full of one lining that I still carry. (Reynolds to the bad guy: I'll pull you into the chain because you're my city. And you want to know the worst part? You're out of the country!) <br /> <br /> Highlights: Technics 1500B roller reel is a nice set that is for audiophiles. <br /> <br /> Charles Durning is unlocking while listening to phone words (prostitutes). (You have to see it, trust me, it's fun.) <br /> <br /> Brian Keith plays against the type as a tough guy. (And do it well!) <br /> <br /> Bernie Casie's concern with Zen. <br /> <br /> Rachel Ward. WOW! (Where did he go?) <br /> <br /> Doc Severinsen and the Tonight Show band play normally. (Joe William guests singing. Manhattan Transfer re-recorded "Route 66".) The soundtrack gives the class everything. <br /> <br /> Can I say more? It may be Reynold's best film ever. <br /> <br /> (Yes, he plays himself as usual, but it works!) <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
