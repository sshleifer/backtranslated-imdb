I watched the TV guide for films from Germany and found one called The Bunnyguards so I looked at it and I laughed foolishly! I wanted a DVD, but it's not available here (I can order it from Germany, but it doesn't have subtitles) It was played again so I stuck it and watched it from time to time. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was looking for information about it and I found out that his real name is Erkan & Stefan, but I know it with my Australian title: The Bunnyguards. Some people I know from Germany don't like Erkan & Stefan because of their accents, but not myself in Germany, I didn't notice anything. Jokes are good, but some Germans can find their focus. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is funny and if the DVD has all the English subtitles from the extras (with a 2-disc edition only having a subtitle would be bad) I'd buy it now! <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone looking for a smile and a pretty good story.
