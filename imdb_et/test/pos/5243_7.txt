John Wayne is one of the few film history players who have failed in their first big break and succeeded the second time. Of course, everyone knows for a second time that the classic Stagecoach is driven by John Ford. Raoul Walsh, co-director of John Ford, noticed a set of one Ford movie from this high child and thought he had the potential. He wanted to lead him with a big budget in the western part of what Fox was going to do. The proposed film would be a tribute to the famous classic quiet western covered wagon. <br /> <br /> Following the big track, I was struck by how similar Wayne's Breck Coleman is here to Ringo's boyfriend in Stagecoach. Both characters were fond of young cowpokes, but both were on a revenge mission. And of course, both films were made on the spot and the cost of making them was shown. There is no studio product with a western set here. <br /> <br /> I also don't think it was an accident that Wayne got this break at the beginning of the sound. Raoul Walsh, I think I looked around Hollywood and probably didn't think the whole cowboy of the movie would sound sound. This is something else Walsh spotted Wayne. <br /> <br /> According to what I have read on The Big Trail floped because after all the money was spent to make the film in the early wide screen process, the Fox genius realized that their theaters were not equipped with a widescreen to show it. And when the great depression hit, Fox wouldn't have the money to expand their screen in the movie theaters. So the Big Trail got a limited release, even if we called the formatted version, and lost money for Fox movies. <br /> <br /> Marguerite Churchill is good at Crinoline's heroine, who Duke wins, loses and wins again with Ian Keith. Keith, Charles Stevens and F. Tyrone Power are the trio of fools to deal with. <br /> <br /> F. Tyrone Power is the father of the famous legend Tyrone Power. He was a big and familiar man who had a great background in classical roles on the screen and on stage. I would not be surprised if his son, who would have been 15 years old, might not be able to hang over the set. <br /> <br /> Also look at Ward Bond, though you may have trouble with beard when his big blinds appear. <br /> <br /> Looking at the big trail, it is now interesting to speculate where John Wayne's career could have gone if the Big Trail had been a big hit.
