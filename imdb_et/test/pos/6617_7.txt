Let me first say that I spent before I realized that I was totally uncoordinated, spent about two minutes in rollerblading. I've always thought it's cool, looking at cats who know how to make their things extreme, but I've never been a skateboarder and have never been involved in sports. With that in mind, I thought it was a very informative and interesting documentary. Some reviewers have said that these dudes were somewhat wavy in their flags, but what the hell? It seems to me that these guys probably deserve as much credit as someone who hits the world of rollerblading and they have given a good picture of their innovations. This is a great way for viewers to see these men so then and now, as well as the Cote's grown-up teenage shots offer an interesting nostalgia that goes a little beyond skating sport. I would never have figured out where the extreme skates came from, but this film somehow binds all the pieces together and gives us an informative documentary. I'm sure it's at least biased, but not all documentaries? It is worth looking at people interested in sports or, as in my case, people who grew up in the 1970s.
