Excellent cast, story, performances. Fully believable. I understand a close group that illustrates Marine Corps. But this movie brought my heart in fear. Marines let the principles damn. It seems that this film was based on real incidents. This shows how difficult it is to go against the agency. Anne Heche was absolutely convincing. Sam Shepard's idea of ​​a sailor was nice. And Eric Stoltz, as his lawyer, balanced both his loyalty to Corp, but also his loyalty to his client while he was up to his tight. He knew what he was doing. But he pulled out of his maritime principle of watering, loyalty to the body. I sat on a rivet on the TV screen. All in all, I give it one in 10 out of 10.
