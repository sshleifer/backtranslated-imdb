Fantastic music featuring Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth. She has a nightclub where she dances. She is not a star, but she gets a big break when she is chosen as a Vanity girl, whose owner was actually her grandmother in love. When he sees the similarity, he immediately chooses the race for his magan. Hayworth's newcomers first admire the Kelly club, but his star rises so fast and so high that his grip on him begins. This is not the most original plots, but these two really work. It also helps the scenario to be great. Kelly hasn't reached the top, especially her top actor. But his dancing was powerful. Hayworth is a star, but Kelly claims the most memorable moment of the film when he is passionately dancing with his reflections. This is obviously the move of Fred Astaire's shadow dance during Swing Time, but I think Kelly is one that is hardly believable. In fact, it must be the most amazing dance sequence in film history, except a few years after the Paris American Paris final. The rest of the songs are also excellent and the musical number is even better. Too bad Rita did not sing her songs (well, she may have a couple of them because her singing voice seemed to be different at times). His dancing is wonderful, just like the rest of his actions. It's hard not to love her. She is indeed one of the few truly beautiful women of the classical age. Not plastic, like many of them; no, you really see the warmth of this woman. His smile is so removable. Phil Silvers is the best friend of Kelly and he is also very funny. The Kelly-Hayworth-Silver trio is obviously the core that became the Kelly-Reynolds-O'Connori trio Singin for eight years. One of the greatest musical numbers in the film seems to be almost blinking with Singin's good morning number. I think Singin 'is Rain is a better film because Cover Girl is a little rough on the edges. This hardness, however, adds charm. In this movie, there are aspects that beat Singin in the rain and even the American in Paris. For example, the central relationship is more emotional. Instead of the dominant older man running behind a little girl (Leslie Caron and Debbie Reynolds were just teenagers), we have a very nice relationship with two people who seem more equal. Not upside down - this aspect that unfortunately makes a lot of the best music a little sour, you must admit. Kelly and Hayworth are a couple from the beginning and when it starts to scare, I really felt it. 9/10
