Rita Hayworth is exactly where she should be - "Cover Girl" - in the 1944 Technicolor film, where Gene Kelly, Phil Silvers, Eve Arden, Lee Bowman and Otto Kruger also play. Rita plays a beautiful example girl, Rusty, working at a small club owned by her beloved man, Danny (Kelly). Every Friday, they go to the oyster with Genius (Silvers), a club comedian. They all hate oysters, but they're looking for pearls. If they find one, they all have three luck, they believe. <br /> <br /> Rusty auditions and wins the cover role for the magazine - it starts with other competitors because the magazine owner (Kruger) sees the similarity with Rusty and her once loved girl who turns out to be Rusty's grandmother. When she becomes a girl, the world opens her up and her dreams of appearing on Broadway are fulfilled. Danny wants him to succeed, but at the same time he realizes he's lost. <br /> <br /> "Cover Girl" is the dance numbers and songs of Jerome Kerni, where Rita is dubbed Martha Mears. At best Rita plays both Rusty and grandmother old. Such a sexy, desirable and proud woman was probably very insecure and always dominated by the male thumb. None of this showed on the screen nor did he want to be a movie star. He is one of the true goddesses and brought everything he did in life. Gene Kelly plays a serious role here, but she gets a lot of opportunities to dance and sing. Phil Silvers is very friendly and funny as a comic and best friend. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie with no boring spots. The only problem I had was the idea that Rusty must choose between a successful career and a loved one. When the supermodel Jinx Falkenberg, who plays himself in the film, talks about marriage, his boss has warned him not to be too much for modeling. We are not told if Rusty will continue his career or go back to work in Danny - but all the signs seemed to the Brooklin Club. Why didn't he get that? However, you can't hit "Cover Girl" for top entertainment, beautiful color, cute music, great energy, good performances and the most fabulous, famous Rita Hayworth.
