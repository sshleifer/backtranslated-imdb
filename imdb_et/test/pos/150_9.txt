Than's biggest thing, Chanwook Park's newest movie, is that it's Twilight. Some of you may take it as a minus, but in fact it is a big plus. Park takes the vampire method seriously, as well as the terrible love between Sorr-hyeon and Tae-Joo. We see the conflict between both characters - Sang-hyeon is a priest who undergoes a medical experiment unknown to him, making him a sick, but truly blue vampire, and the Tae-Joo mother and his "idiot" brother are killed by a very strong melodrama by Sang. At some point, there is nothing terrible and uncomfortable about the story and the characters, and the consequences of religion early on (for example, Sang is considered to be a healer because he rose from the dead due to his vampireism, even if he does not get it and know it) it up to another plane kinematically. <br /> <br /> This thirst also rises to the best art techniques that Park is showing with Oldboy, Lady Vengeance and I am underrated by Kyborg, but that's OK, should be given. Jan is a film with juicy narrative and odd suburban characters, and it is made and edited in a mood that is part of satirical, partly romantic / erotic, part of the dramatic and ultimately fantastic. And it does not always deal with vampire as a simple horror film (although, as a horror movie, Park is more than his scary scene). It is more like the Dark Dark movie, which never mentioned the vampire, but let you know that it was, and treated it sincerely and with firm passionate observation, and that the disease itself and its impact on human existence is perhaps worse than killing or bloodshed. If you see one vampire jump really high or heal that wound, you've seen everyone. <br /> <br /> thirst is also with a sense of evil humor, like Oldboy, only here with a bite (the aim of the pun is to emphasize strange physical states. This example can be found if the priest's predisposition to take blood from people by taking their blood tube and breastfeeding it Or the way Tae-Joo keeps one's mother alive for one's human remains, even if he has a stroke and can only blink into his eyes and touch one finger as a tool that reacts to blood mammals has brought pain and horror into his home. The moments are like a cake to make it a complete experience. What makes Thirst's mind is how the elements come together, drama and existential pains, a bunuel-surreal Catholic feeling (I especially loved the dynamics between Sang-hyeon and the other priest who gives his a hand on blood sucking but really wants to be a vampire)) and erotic: the scenes where the priest finally gives to Tae-Joo are incredible their speed and frame and the reality of this. Not in the pornographic sense, but in the sense of releasing and escaping characters that do not last a story. <br /> <br /> If it's not as big as Oldboy, it's not a carp. Not all of the films that Chanwook Park is leading to, do not reach the reputation of their masterpiece (and at least they are always known as the person who directed the film). But Thrist is a great addition to his creations and the overall seriousness of vampire films. Making a movie is crisp and exciting and even dangerous (and what white day "daylight" characters live!), Humor is dark and fun, the actor is intense and spirited - especially from the fine hit of Song Kang Ho and the peculiar evil and surprising Kim Kim vinyl and the end, when it finally comes, is one of the finest end of the vampire movie you have been talking about for years in good ways. In the battle between the division and Twilight, thirst takes the first round of thirst. Sometimes Let's Right One or Near Dark has a harder call. 9.5 / 10
