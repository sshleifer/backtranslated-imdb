I thought I wrote a comment on this movie, but I can't find it here. anyway, i will rewrite it. I found this movie accidentally in the collections of the college library. It was free to look, so why not. <br /> <br /> I'm definitely glad I was watching it. I love this movie. I've seen some Russian movies before, most of them have serious issues. I'm surprised that this was one good comedy. I had a big laugh while watching it. and this is the movie I want to buy. this thing is so funny. and they're not just funny funny, these plots were very original and well thought out so they don't look stupid at all. I'm surprised that this movie didn't attract many viewers. This is a classic that you can watch over and over again. <br /> <br /> These actors were also very authentic, their action is real, not fake. if you haven't followed it, go straight to the copy! definitely recommended.
