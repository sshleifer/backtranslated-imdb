John Cassavetes is out of the law. He's at the bottom of the pile. He sees Negro Sidney Poitier as equal, and they quickly become friends, forming some kind of interface with Jack Warden's performer bully. <br /> <br /> Like someone who has been working in the store for the younger ones, I can tell you that warehouses that are full of drum packages and collide with grips are just as realistic. I've been in struggles like myself, though no one died. <br /> <br /> The introduction of Sidney Poitier's widow is a variation of Shakespeare's Shylock "Don't I Bleed?" This is an anti-racism film that was very necessary at that time. <br /> <br /> All three main characters - Warden, Cassavetes and Poitier - are excellent, with Warden being the three most outstanding.
