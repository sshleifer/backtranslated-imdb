It's just ridiculous how this film is underestimated. It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It will never be left behind, it will never slow down, it's a film that has a flow of admiration for the scheme. This, together with excellent writing, makes it a fantastic movie. Amir and Salman are outrageous, even Raveena and Karishma are funny in this movie. Paresh Rawal and Shakti bring with them a lot of bad comedies, but Viju Khote and Ajit-wannabe are the best with their disappointed intentions. If you want to laugh and enjoy the movie, watch this movie, do it with family or friends, then you won't regret it. Most of the Indian movies will eventually rob me because they are 3 hours long. This movie is the same length, but I wish it ended more because it is an amazing flick.
