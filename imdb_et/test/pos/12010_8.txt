I was surprised when I watched this movie, how much it had captured me. No, the actors didn't act like typical Hollywood actors, but it's not always bad as this movie proves. Unlike the Disney standard, it's refreshing in turn! They also give you the taste it probably liked without being educated. Everyone should see and enjoy the movie. Many people love the "precision" of this type of film, but there is a lot to offer when it comes to the basic idea. Easy grip; East and West Germany, viewed on any map, would be on the left-hand side of West Germany, east. Sometimes the movie returns a little back, because about half of the scenes are on the right side of the screen in West Germany and at other times on the left. Even at the same events, they move back and forth. Perhaps a little greater consistency would have avoided this easy attention. Go look!
