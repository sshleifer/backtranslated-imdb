This is a great and impressive film. I saw it on television as a little boy, almost tearing down my throat and again on a perfectly restored Criterion DVD today. <br /> <br /> Cranes are the essence of the war review. Imagine a Cherbourg sunshade with no music or color, or a Waterloo bridge with no class consciousness. <br /> <br /> Tatiana Samoilova, a cross between Vivien Leigh and Bjork, deeply affects a girl whose fianc√© is neither writing nor coming back. <br /> <br /> Boris dies in front of her and his death scene is romantic. Very brave too, because so close "up". But this scene will stay with you. <br /> <br /> Although the Soviet War was so defined in World War II, this film is quite specific and powerful. Pre-war and post-war scenes are very 1957. The whole film becomes stylized until the Siberian scenes that feel like a modern opera set (this is a compliment). The cathartic last scene is milked to the last drop - again comparable to Cherbourg. Production seems like a big budget (these stair scenes have to cost a real kopek). <br /> <br /> Go to it. Do not expect a bitter socialist pill (although this is, of course, very sad). Cranes on Flying is an impressive part of the world of cinema, quite advanced, considering where and when it was made.
