Burt Reynolds hanged against Clint Eastwood, who infiltrated his ornamental comedies with his red comedy to make his Dirty Harry Chicago-style thriller Sharky's Machine. Originally designed for John Boorman, but finally a star-driven star, this is an out-and-out business package with a Reynolds daffodil who has broken down a subgroup (literally - they are in the basement) who puts the mysterious criminal master of nails supporting the next governor Earl Hollimani. . You can guess the rest, but even though Reynolds has a story sometimes seen, he has eyes in front of individual scenes and almost first gets a high-quality whore from Rachel's church. The romantic sub-platform is unusually well developed, with some good action models and some nice touches, such as Vittorio Gassman's exterior hero, hero or Reynolds mirror image, and a killer, both of whom set aside a neighboring apartment witness building. One of the stars' best films of their days of glory is not classic, but it makes more than an effective Saturday night special.
