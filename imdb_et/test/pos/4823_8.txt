I honestly found that Wicked Little Things is a very cool and fun horror movie. My friend had given it to me and I really saw it as a crazy low-class horror movie. Then, after I watched it, it was wrong very cool and very good, and although Ill say it seemed somewhat unnecessary at times, and although it may still not be the best horror movie, I thought it was very good, especially the girl who plays the mother (she seemed very plausible and very pleasing to me.) And though it is a little clich√© and up on her good.Generally I have to say whether the Afterdark Horror Fest movies are not your style, you shouldn't look at it, but If you like horror movies or bad times, watch Wicked Little Things. 8.0 out of 10 stars
