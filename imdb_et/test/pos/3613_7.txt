Again, John Madden has given us an excellent movie. A simple but beautiful story in true paradise and music can't be better, Stephen Warbeck rejoices us again and good deeds, but ......... why is Penelope Cruz here? I asked myself the same question while watching this movie. Of course, his Greek accent is not plausible, he can't function properly even in one scene. Not even in the end he did a good job, after so many events, after years he could finally see Corell again and he couldn't change the foolish face we had to wear throughout the film. Anyway, Cage was very good in one of her best characters; Hurt is also great and all the rest did a great job, so the end result is a movie that's really worth it. This is a beautiful movie even by pr. Cruz couldn't fail. So far, I think it's Madden's best job, so no fan would be disappointed.
