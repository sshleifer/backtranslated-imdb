It is clear that my assessment of this does not mean that it is comparable to stylish horrors such as Argento, but with the low budget of the 70s, with a ticket and in this department it is classic. Lack of money shows (Does anyone care too much?) Operation is more than enough professional (does it make it more realistic?), But unlike so many other films, not just small budgets, it doesn't drag a moment. Crap it may be, but not stop the stop, your face crap and while inevitably a bit of campy at times, this is a must see for anyone who has what I am talking about. Sometimes this crazy little movie, filled with crazy characters, is obviously entertaining and fun to watch.
