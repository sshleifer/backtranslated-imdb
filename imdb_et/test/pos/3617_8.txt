I must admit that I approached this film with expectation and fear. Louis de Berniere's best-selling novel is one of my favorites and anyone who has read it understands that there is no chance in hell that every screen can be 100% loyal. <br /> <br /> I found myself convincing that the film was not successful and had taken the plot back so far as to be superfluous. The end is, however, much better than the novel and I couldn't think of it after the movie. Still, the benefits (John Toll's excellent cinematography, Stephen Warbeck's big score, etc.) felt that it did not exceed his initial negative factors (Cage's failure, heavily diluted script). <br /> <br /> But two days later, I was yet to see Corelli, and although it is not perfect, I have to admit that the film is the best one could have expected. Cage is actually an excellent role that even de Berniere touched was not completely rounded: his carefree spirit, which gives way to broken regret, is on-site and perfectly complements Penelope Cruz's and John Hurt's double action. David Morrissey is quietly effective as Weber, a Nazi officer, who is trying to find his feelings about his newcomer friends in Italy and his inbred. And the fine Greek-Italian casting brings de Berniere brightly to the world of Cepholonia. <br /> <br /> When I left the cinema for the second time, I finally lost my passion for a novel that prevented me from fully appreciating the story of WW2 Cepholonia cinematically. My hat goes to John Madden, who, despite the almost critical criticism he receives from British critics (every director who has had great success as Shakespeare in Love, is always the target of their moaning ninnes!) with such a heart, vitality and humanity (the main virtues of the novel) that he has created another classical love story that is likely to be judged only when the dust has become a couple If you are a fan of the book, like me, it's hard, but try not to do the same error in your initial viewing. Try to delete the book in your mind for two hours, swim in the famous Mediterranean atmosphere and discover Corell, Pelagia, Mandras, Dr. Iannis as if for the first time (pretending to look at something from the original scenario) and I guarantee you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I look forward to waiting for you to have a copy of your enjoyable movie on video or DVD. <br /> <br /> 8/10
