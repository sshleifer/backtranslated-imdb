Tromeo and Juliet (1996) is another jewel in the Troma Studios Film Archives. Like Toxic Avenger, Troma War, Nuke Class, Terror Firmer and Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D. this movie is a classic Troma classic. James Gunn refreshes the medieval tragedy of Romeo and Juliet and is again a punk-drama of today's street. If you have seen or read a game before it has changed, except that it is "tromatized". <br /> <br /> Lloyd Kaufman adds his twisted vision to the scenario and makes it a very enjoyable movie. Participants communicate very well with the script. I was surprised how well they did the dialogue, much better than some of Hollywood's big budget participants who used the monster budget and expensive kits. I enjoyed this movie very much. Lloyd Kaufman doesn't have to be disappointed because you know what to expect from his movies and other Troma productions. I'd rather look at one of his films and entertainment when I look at a boring expensive movie that was attracted by hired actors, flat scripts, lazy directors, and these terrible C.G.I. special effects. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. If you like movies with fun special effects, this movie is just for you!
