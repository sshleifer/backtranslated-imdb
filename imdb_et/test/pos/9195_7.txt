Isabel has just come out of prison. He has decided not to come back, but life is hard for the former convict, especially when they are homeless, like Isabel. When he finds that he was his boyfriend Rufo, he sees the light of hope, but Rufo is not only a junkie, but also AIDS. It does not make Isabel a surrender, because if there is a will and he plans to fight his future, normal life, house and family. A very hard and touching film that has been unknown to most Spanish cinemas, the actors are great and the story is very touching, maybe better treatment of secondary characters would have made the film better, but it is really good. I recommend looking at it, but keep in mind that this is not a Disney's happy movie, it's hard and dramatic.
