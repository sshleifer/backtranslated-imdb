Chop Shop is a treasure hidden in theaters! I can't start describing how wonderful the performances in this movie are. This movie is for everyone who wants to see a powerful story and see what the contemporary movies should look like and be. <br /> <br /> This movie is a young boy, Alejandro "Ale", who works and lives with his teenage sister Isamar "Izzie" in one room with a small attic in a car shop. The story takes place in New York (which I didn't even know - Willits Punkte) with endless junkyards and body shops. Here, the Bahran story tells of two forgotten children who want to buy food and packs. <br /> <br /> Ale makes money in a car shop, and Izzie helps with food; both earn extra money from the side. Ale sells football movies and stolen cars; Izzie's results are sold by herself. Their life is surrounded by sharp and bad, but although both witnesses, living and barely surviving in their harsh world, their love for one another is never dirty. And sometimes they can laugh and enjoy the moments of their childhood that are stolen by the reality of survival and fighting each other. <br /> <br /> The best comparison for my Chop Shop is that Bahrani is an innocent love between family members for such a humid atmosphere as powerful as Pasolini Mama Roma with the struggle to grow too fast in an unfavorable environment like Bresson's Mouchette ' il. <br /> <br /> Having co-written, directed and edited this film as well as his first, Man Push Cart (which won awards all over the world), Bahrani is the filmmaker of the entire package. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that his films are not hidden treasures for a long time!
