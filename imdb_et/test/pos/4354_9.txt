Although some of Herzog's work may not be as entertaining, Little Dieter is one of the world's largest filmmakers. From the traditional topics of Herzog, the Little Dieter is an exciting and uplifting characteristic study of a brave man and his efforts to live after a life-changing traumatic experience. <br /> <br /> Dieter Dengler wanted to fly at a very young age and the Vietnam War gave him this opportunity, but while driving in the cockpit he grew most of this ground. Dieter largely talks about his story beautifully and passionately, sometimes from Herzog. Herzog makes very few voices during this time, but gives a lot of exquisitely powerful sound images and visuals - which shouldn't be surprising to its acquaintances. <br /> <br /> Dengler is an exciting and extremely pleasant person. As a person and as I came, I found that his life and inspirationally self-evident personality is a story. Thanks to Herzog for introducing us again. <br /> <br /> The film's scope is not so sprawling and the drama is not as harsh as many of the earlier films that made Herzog power. thought. However, I recommend it to my fans and those who enjoy documentaries. This is a very interesting and well executed film.
