Different Law & Order and CSI franchises were better than Dolomite did. Lady's policemen, ADAs and coronaries would be all amazed and men would be subjected to such breaths, a melting of the sign that would be melted at speed (Wouldn't you just like to see David Caruso Horatio and all who know it in CSI to get the Dolomite Hush puppies pulled their respective donkeys) Ice T can start crying and get back to Playa Trail. <br /> <br /> Low low budget, bad but enthusiastic behavior and vision of what gutbucket nightclubs offer to their patrons; soul singers, the latest vests of the old style Chitlin Circuit entertainers (this strange dance audience) James Brown, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, and many others came from these clubs, while their peers worked at local or regional level. From this background, the character of Rudy Ray Moore and the Dolomite was a blend of courageous Black Badasses who have been beaten. He should not have gone together, the pigs did not have the right, how his middle-aged, blubbery himself kept loyal to the kung fu wenches, is a mystery that can only be explained by a cult student, but everything that is next to the point. It is a glorious performer of the legendary feature of the home film that, compared to actors ranging from Hollywood to indie film snorefests, it reaches its mark. Fun tummy movie!
