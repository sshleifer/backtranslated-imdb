This movie is great, has the first small film "Pi" and "Clerks" at the same low budget, but has the style "Memento" (also writer / director Christopher Nolan). Score, sound effects, photography and editing are almost "Memento" prototypes, and the story shows that Christopher Nolan is best for writing and directing. Do not push it with a low budget look and feel, or even a short movie length and watch it!
