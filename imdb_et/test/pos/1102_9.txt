I saw this movie through the agents of one of the actors and it certainly corresponds to a lot that comes out of Sth. Australian general * tone *, which is rightly dark and moody. <br /> <br /> I thought the little boy in the movie was great. Mostly, the child's actors are * bullied * and embarrassed, but not in this case. He was really very good. What is the subject of * surrealism * mentioned by Jingo, I think this film is just "weird". It's a strange movie with strange places, storyline, strange things all the time. But "good" weird, not "bad". <br /> <br /> It's hard to think of other nice movies, but it's not like CARS ATE Paris, perhaps REPULSION, but I really think more like a 60s Hammer movie. There is certainly an interesting idea behind it. <br /> <br /> JINGO, my question is also about the title. Why Modern Love? Someone? Also jingo, what did you mean by "god forsaken" when you talked about australia, hmmm? Just curious
