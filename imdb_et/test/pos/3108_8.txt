Jackie and Candice are terrible in this movie. They are well suited to their roles and have several ways to shine. In particular, Candice's words "Puerto Rica" are very funny because she is kind to be, but at the same time shrinking. I had seen the original of this movie called "Old Dating", featuring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. They're supposed to have missed, because because the movie is a female friendship, it can be a problem. Here, the actors clearly see each other. Hart Bochner and Meg Ryan have supportive parts and they are both excellent, especially Bochner, who has never kept me in the movies. George Cukor did not make another movie after that, so it was good.
