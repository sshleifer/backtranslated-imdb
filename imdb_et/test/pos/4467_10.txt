This is her best Lucio Fulci. If only all the films made after that were such. <br /> <br /> This extraordinary movie is just as intriguing as Dario Argento's "The City with Crystal Plum" ... <br /> <br /> You are a fan of Argento, but you don't like Lucio Fulci's movies like <br /> <br /> "The Beyond", "Manhattan Baby", "The House by Cemetery", etc. we do it to others ... this is what the Italians call "giallo" ... which would be something that is "made-to-film" in short. <br /> <br /> You don't know who the killer is until the last moments of the movie. <br /> <br /> But there is also a plot: a maniac living in a small town starts killing little boys ... Journalist (Tomas Milian), sexy young woman (Barbara Bouchet), priest (Marc Porel), her mother (Irene Papas ) and the witch (Florinda Bolkan) are the main characters of this messy and bloody story. <br /> <br /> Speaking of actors, I want to say that Tomas Milian is great (as always) and Florinda Bolkan is a terrible s witch ... <br /> <br /> Do you want to know who is the killer? ... <br /> <br /> I can't tell you ... but I can tell you that you have to watch this movie! <br /> <br /> (10 out of 10) ... of course!
