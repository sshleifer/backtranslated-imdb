Familiar with Hartley's "The Go-Between", though, both in his original book and in the disappointing Pinter-Losey film application, it was interesting. "The Hireling" shows a mirror image from time to time; a little less distance to the main part, which includes the British class system display and contains the set of sports competitions (boxing takes the cricket), which shows quite a lot. <br /> <br /> This refreshes your small focus. You don't know exactly Lady Franklin and Leadbitter in a novel sense, but this distance has been appropriately played to talk about body language and slipping from actors. Your distance from every complete sympathy to a true character reflects a standing "difference" that has a central relationship. Miles and Shaw are wonderfully fine and we see more of our "less"; these are never exemplary, exemplary performances. They are appropriately Stanislavski's interpretations that give the impression that these characters have a life that is within the boundaries of the film. All the other parts are treated very satisfactorily, although they are much smaller in this film than I expected in the novel and indeed compared to "The Go-Between", the stunning work. <br /> <br /> The popularity of this movie in the middle of the film is so sad and shifted to later scenes where Shaw kisses Miles and has been rejected and when Drunk Leadbitter is standing in front of Cantrip and Lady Franklin. It is a scary shame that what would have been damaged, destroyed on both sides of the screen by the extremely incredible end of the screen, is "decorated", which is definitely a weird one. One is completely puzzled when he jumps in a tone like Shaw's Leadbitter strikes and ironically sings "Rule Britannia" and "God Save the Queen" when he runs his car stuff. The political point is heavily burned with this bomb-proof, rather embarrassingly operational end. The feeling of subjectivity that has been effectively communicated so far has disappeared because the indirect point is heavily and noisy. Agit-prop certainly has no place in such a delicate periodic drama. <br /> <br /> In general, however, it cannot be too harsh. Although this absurd end is a big mistake, the rest of the film has to be praised as a sensitive, revealing film, sadness and detailed observation of how British society was in the past. Hartley's colds, but crystal clear touch is very much evidence. It's just a shame that we don't end up with Shaw's drunken scene. The tragic, deceived figure of Sarah Miles' Lady Franklin is drastically denied to her in the epicenter of the film, because a great human drama is mistakenly slipping into the evaluation of political points. Shaw - even the driest and deepest of the participants' feelings - betraying the movie. So; a fine, small-scale triumph is sabotaged; but we have to remember many good points. <br /> <br /> Rating: - *** 1/2 / *****
