I liked this movie between love between two adults in postwar UK. The high standards of BBC TV are obvious in production, and excellent leading actors (Claire Bloom and Joss Ackland) make it an uplifting experience. Bloom and Ackland have worked together in theater before, and their chemistry and communication are great. I recommend this version of the 1993 version of Shadowland.
