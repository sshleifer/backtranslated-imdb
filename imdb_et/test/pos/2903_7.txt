I would give this film to cinematography and performances. I just read the user commentary as an actress who plays with the players of Toyo, who is a leader. I remember this actor's mini-biography after the movie was last seen. Apparently he was a Holocaust refugee discovered by the French husband and wife in the film industry, who was taken with his extraordinary beauty. He died in a very young and tragic environment. Geen Tierney is also outstanding in this film. Like other Neo-Biblical films from the 1940s and 50s, "Egypt" reflects the morals and values ​​of that time, but is still a great entertainment because the performances are terrible and the story is so well-said.
