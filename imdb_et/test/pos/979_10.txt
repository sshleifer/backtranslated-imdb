Big Fat Liar is what you get when you combine terrible writing, great production, and emphasis on sensible ideas for the adolescent priest. Two stars work great and - what can I say? Amanda Bynes looks like. "Irkel" and Lee Majors in the film were superb. Watch this movie with your kids. If you don't laugh at it, you should not pay attention.
