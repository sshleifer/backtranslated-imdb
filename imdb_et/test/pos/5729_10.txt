Ladies and gentlemen: The exhibition begins with this documentary. It is structured into three chapters, each of which is chronologically positioned. The first presents classical physics and links to Einstein. Another study thoroughly quantum physics and enters String theory. The latter reveals everything theory ... The sophisticated concepts used here are presented in a very simple way with everyday objects; though you must believe them without self-control - if you are not a scientist (and even if you are a scientist!). Film is not a masterpiece of this fabulous technique or how it is produced; what really import is the story and READ OUT!
