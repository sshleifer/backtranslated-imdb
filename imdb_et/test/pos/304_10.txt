Even the entire cinema that deals with the Vietnam War trauma (Jacob's ladder, deer hunter, apocalypse and taxi driver to some extent) feels we don't even know what happened. Even in horror thinking, it seems inhuman. And progress - or withdrawal? - The inhuman situation that is imperative is Apocalypse Now, Coppola's greatest and one of the most important films ever made. Of course, Joseph Conrad's 1902 classics, "The Heart of Darkness", which crowns the loss of reason and morality that accompanies civilization - the natural nature of the soil, as it was, the Lord of the Sheep - brings a tale of physical and psychological travel to Vietnam. The story is from Willard, who has ordered a special mission in Cambodia after his first journey in Vietnam. At the beginning of the movie, Willard Saigon is stuck, psychologically unable to go back home - Nicky The Deer Hunter replayed intimidatingly. So he is contacted: his mission is to kill the renegade Green Beret, who has separated himself from the far outpost on the Nung River and who has allegedly gone completely mad - worshiping the gods of indigenous people and killing indiscriminately. This man's name is Colonel Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando in his second best role in his career (the best is Stanley Kowalski in the name of A Streetcar). When Willard rides on an army with a soldier, his horror and madness, and its all-encompassing nonsense, will give Kurtz sympathy with compassion and identity before they even meet. By the time they do, Kurtz's methods don't seem to be wrong or as they should, and they certainly don't seem too unusual or at times. Apocalypse - a place that transcends morality, an outpost at the end of the world. Loss of civilization, loss of judgment, of itself. Kurtz's monologue in the form of Green Beret and his later revelation are one of the coolest and well-communicated speeches in the history of the film. The film is about trauma, the human spirit and its breaking point - here's a lot like The Deer Hunter and just as good. The apocalypse, however, limits what we can tolerate on a global level - Coppola's extensive picture of the Cambodian damp, dark jungles and the explosion of explosive forests and orange skies helicopters - the soundtrack of strangely fit doors has been set - also scenes from rivers and air strikes from Wagner's speakers (a scene that has never been one of the most cool, darkly humorous and amazingly meaningless war mushrooms) - all this contributes to the feeling of Apocalypse - the end of the world - and not at any moment in the future, but now and forever. The fear hunter is much closer and more personal, you can even tell by the title and show the total impact on the individual psychic of the trauma, the disintegration of the human soul and its ability to either completely give up to the forces of darkness or to break it. That's why both movies are equal - these are the two parts of the same thing. In the "Heart of Darkness", Kurtz shows a contradiction between morality (civilization) and his inner ferocity. In Apocalypse, Kurtz has left behind all conflicts. He's out of good and evil. He has let go of morale when a drowning man saves his hand at moments before his death. Kurtz is really just waiting for death, citing T. S. His last words and the words repeated at the end of the movie are: "Fear ... horror." He refers to the infinite void of existence, the human psyche and the blind empty void in his mind, where cruelty is born again. The experience of watching this movie cannot be expressed in words - a brief experience of Willard's experience on his journey. The final, on the front, almost actually comparable to his brother's scene, The Dreadful Hunter, is one of the most profound, peaceful and seductive things I've ever seen.
