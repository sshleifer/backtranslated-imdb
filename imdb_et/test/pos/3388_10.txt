It's a great movie, all 3 were. The latter was not as good as the first 2, but it was done after that and it pulled on the shoulders. But you want to watch it because it says the end of the story. Just not how we should think it should end. <br /> <br /> These films made me want to be there in all the difficulties, love, tears, and laughter that the people of this film got into. This is one of the few movies that is good every time you see it, no matter how many times it is. <br /> <br /> There are some parts in the movie that small children usually understand and parents are big. old enough to look. but this is a great movie that goes back over 20 years.
