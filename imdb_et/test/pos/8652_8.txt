A very interesting addition to the Scandinavian surreal collection. Recommended viewing for those who love their movies. My understanding of the "strange" end would be that Andreas's trip ends in hell. He does not like the empty consumer-led emptiness; sort of "lively", but not progressive, i.e. not reaching there - even the city's subway trains do not stop at stations. It has a subway system, as you should be able to travel, freedom, escape, but you can never actually drive these trains. He cannot reach the scent-like, sensory sky and continues to reach the final destination of his bus journey. Hell's old Norse version (Hades, NOT Hell, land-based city) does not burn hot like the British version, its cold, freezing, the land of Niflheim (the cold and fog land). It seems to be where Andreas arrives because he did not reach heaven through this tunnel.
