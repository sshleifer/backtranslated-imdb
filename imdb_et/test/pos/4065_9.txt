"Showtime" is a funny movie with funny Robert DeNiro (Meet the Parents, A Bronx Tale) and Eddie Murphy (Shrek, Dr. Dolittle). The story is: At the beginning of the movie detective Mitch (Robert DeNiro) and another detective, he entered the TV, trying to break some criminals. When the police arrive, the policeman (Eddie Murphy) tries to arrest Mitch without knowing he is a cop. During this scene, there are many funny things that hit the TV manufacturer in the eyes of Chase Ritz. She's so excited about her adventures when she decides to make a showtime Show, starring Tray (policeman) and Mitch (detective). But it's just a funny part. The rest are strictly temporary and operate. It is a stranger who sells and makes extremely dangerous weapons. DeNiro and Murphy play at LAPD shows and do it in real life. On a scale of 1-10, I'll give him seven or eight.
