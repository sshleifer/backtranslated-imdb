I've already seen this movie twice and impressed it. <br /> <br /> The name and conversations between her mother and her name and Matthew are very touching. The Nigerian community is very genuinely and colorfully shown, as usual. <br /> <br /> While some things could have explained a little more; if we knew why Matthew was first in southern France, his post-Matthew scenes would be more understandable. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, there is a website that has detailed production notes to help you better understand such scenes when it comes to optimal release. <br /> <br /> I'm going to look at it again, but unfortunately it was in London with limited spread and no longer visible. I hope the video will release it to a larger audience because the film deserves it.
