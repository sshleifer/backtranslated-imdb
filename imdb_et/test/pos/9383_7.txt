I can honestly say "Death Bed: Bed That Eats" was a much better film than I expected. Let me explain the plot if the title of the movie is a little too vague - there is a cutlery. Bad bed. It eats people. Several unsuspecting women are somehow "on the go", colliding with the "sack" of the sages, and ultimately falling into the famine. The bed forging process consists of a yellow foam that absorbs people into its inner ... stomach acid; all with chewing sounds. It is a very strange cult strike and the only George Barry movie that had forgotten that he did it until it was verbal about his renewed cult status, and he decided to release it on a DVD. It's not a bad movie if you can look at the sad action and enjoy the hockey effects - the most laughable is the man whose hands are eaten and have only plastic-looking skeletal fingers. too, which are going to be very surreal and abnormal - mostly the whole thing, which is the story behind the artist's painting and the demonic back of the beds. If you like a bizarre budget, strange flap, be sure to look for "Death Bed".
