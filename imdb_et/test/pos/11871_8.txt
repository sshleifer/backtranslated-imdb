This movie is never on the list of the top 50 films of all time, but if you make a list of "fun movies", this starting point is not bad. Liv Tyler is amazing, enchanting and luscious, and all others are dead for their parts. This is the equivalent of the 21st century "Tom Jones" - in other words; just good, funny fun. I think it can be Tyler's breakthrough movie with great fame. Without nudity she wakes up in this movie for sex. No wonder all the boys give their toys. How can they help but do that helpless, innocent, like the Livonian jewel?
