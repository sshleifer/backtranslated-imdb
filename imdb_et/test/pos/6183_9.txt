Lubitschi Touch is more than ever in this movie. Humor at any time and very fine. The plot is simple, but the director turns it tastefully. Cutting a movie is very smart and adds comics. True comedy, not so old for the XX century spectator. The characters are operated by Gary Cooper and especially Claudette Colbert so smart and think about this poor Micheal in the movie. He avoids any trap from his wife and makes this situation very funny. And with Lubitsch, there is always no happy end to the problem. A film for men who are too confident about women. Don't let your girl watch this movie ...
