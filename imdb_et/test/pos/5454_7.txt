I read a book written by Bill Carter, which is based on years ago. The book is definitely stronger than the movie. This gives more details than the film can offer, the end result is that I thought the film seemed like a handful of handful of tricky items. Looking at all the things and the limitations of the film, the film has a completely fun and informative overview of the battle between Jay Leno and David Letterman in the early 1990s to host "The Tonight Show" after Johnny Carson retired. <br /> <br /> Highlighting is a clear representation. I don't think anything harder for an actor than to play a character who is still alive and well-known and regularly on television. John Michael Higgins created Letterman perfectly. His look was like watching Letterman. Daniel Roebuck bravely tried to be Jay Leno but somehow did not pull it so effectively. His whole "look" seemed fake, and he just didn't look natural in his role. In a less central role, Rich Rich didn't surprise Carson's voice, though the look was a bit behind. The most interesting central characters in the book were probably Leno's agent Helen Kushnick. In the film, Kathy Bates was perfect in her role, though not quite as controlled as Carter's writing of a woman. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's easy and entertaining viewing. The topic is not particularly important in the general context of things, but it is fun for a memorable time behind the scenes in the entertainment sector. 7/10
