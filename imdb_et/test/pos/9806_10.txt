I believe it's a heart-pulling film. Richard Donner (director, top brand film "Superman") had done an excellent job of managing this movie. Some of the mixers were good and many were terrible because Bobby (Mazzello) was beaten by the king (Baldwin and especially their dog, Shane attacked the king, which meant he paid for what he had done for Bobby.)> <br /> Elijah Wood represented a good role in this film. In this memorable scene, he dreamed that he took the buffalo's advice on how Bobby was beaten. Lorraine Bracco (Pre-Soprano) had played an impressive role. br /> <br /> I give this movie to four !!!
