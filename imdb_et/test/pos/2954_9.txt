I always thought my father had another life and was looking forward to 51 Birch Street developments when I first sat down and watched it. Amazingly, this film journey led me to places I hadn't been waiting for and made me think and think. A truly remarkable personal story was spoken smartly, but simply. I especially liked the filmmaker to use my mother's daily diary - very effective. I read the previous comment and I would like to note that the sound was good when I looked at it and I suspect the film has changed somewhat or the theater could have contributed to the poorer quality of the sound of another writer.
