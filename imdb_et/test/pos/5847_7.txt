I liked this movie. Unlike other thrillers, you know the killers very well. You'll also know these two detectives. Killers are two high school children. They are very intelligent and want to prove they are more intelligent in the police to plan a "perfect crime". We all know that this crime is not perfect. We do not know whether they have been caught or there may be only one of them, or even not. I hope they both give up, although I don't know if it was the purpose of the films. <br /> <br /> The story is spoken in a nice way. You have started to get involved. Sandra Bullock's character is pleasant, but she has a secret that works against her. Ben Chaplin is pretty good when Sam and the two kids are both big. The scenes between them are better scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> I think you can say the movie is pretty good and not as predictable as you think. Good evening with the movie "Numbers of Numbers" is good.
