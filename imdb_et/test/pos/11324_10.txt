I just wanted to say that when I was young, my favorite t.v was hot at night. I loved the characters and the plot of the exhibition. I thought it was a great show and still today. I like watching rarunas and I'm a big fan. I love how characters played off each other. I'd always be late to see my favorite show with my mother, who was also a big fan. Now I can enjoy watching my show again and listening to the song song. What I thought was a cool song. My favorite characters were Scott Hylands and Jeff Wincott.
