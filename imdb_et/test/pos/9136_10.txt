I decided to write a comment on this amazing movie, because it is mentioned in IMDb that John Woo, a mediocre director who made some decent films during his pre-American years, completely destroyed his last reputation in US films. plans to do this. Well, here are some of the reasons why this is one of the most stupid ideas for reuse: the plot of the film is simple and even clich√© according to today's standards, but what makes a movie a masterpiece works by four leaders, a unique Mellville direction, cinematography, music and its style. Nowadays, no leader can make such a movie, it is impossible to create such an atmosphere in today's Box-office film business. <br /> <br /> John Woo made more or less decent films that were borrowed from Melville's Le Samourai - The Killer, but remember that this was when big budgets and expensive (salaries) the director was not violated. cheap (acting). So what I say is that it is one of the biggest films ever made with another Melville - Le Samourai movie. Look out. And even if the remake is done, try it before you see a great original.
