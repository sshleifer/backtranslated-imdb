'Mulholland Dr.' case history is known: what should have been the second tour (after "Twin Peaks") in the rival field of televisions, which ended sharply after the pilot was finished. It was too risky and twisted that manufacturers invest. Lynch used all the filmed and cut material and started a new game to finish a brand new movie. Result: One of the most impressive cinema experiences of this decade that can be considered one of David Lynch's best works. His earlier films "Eraserhead", "Blue Velvet" or "Wild at Heart" keep an annoying side that pulled the viewer into the role of poet, but did not participate as part of such a plot as here. 'Mulholland Dr.' there is a puzzle where there are no pieces, others are probably taken as "Eraserhead" and "Lost Highway", but it never seemed like unfinished work. On the Internet, I got a lot of instructions and essays to explain this movie. I know now that he will lose his magic if you try to decipher it completely. All these detailed explanations of the solution are not only waste, but also a questionable attempt to provide a response that does not require such a thing. Imagine this scenario: A small child breaks his teddy bear to find out where the secret and specificity of this bear is. Is it because he wants to destroy his toy? Is the secret hidden in the teddy bear or actually in the heart of the child? Its transmission to "Mulholland Dr." means that innocence is one of the most important conditions for monitoring and evaluating it. <br /> <br /> David Lynch manages not only to depict the surface of human behavior, but also to grasp it. Human desires, dreams, obsessions, and fears - everything that is left unspoken; emotions that are often repressed. "Mulholland Dr." has an intensity that requires a substance that is completely inconsistent with the substance. Actors and actors ready to follow the director's vision with confidence.Laura Elena Harring, Naomi Watts, Justin Theroux solves his task in such an impressive way that you would not want or could not imagine you casting. Though their initiative seems to be a little seemingly, you will soon realize that this stereotype is set to manipulate the viewer and disturb him as soon as the red thread of the film is visible. <br /> If you claim that a well-made movie criterion is capable of losing itself and diving into a visible spot, Lynch has managed to make a masterpiece. A contemporary masterpiece that depicts David Lynch's status as one of the most important, creative and bold leaders. Like every filmmaker who crosses borders, he faces criticism and ignorance. It will disappear as soon as you find an individual key in the world of Lynch movies. "Mulholland Dr." is more than just a sleeping place? it must be for everyone who loves ambitious cinema. In addition, the film is cost-effective with Hollywood in the form and content that had been struggling with this distinction before.
