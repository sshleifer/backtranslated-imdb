I just started watching this exhibition. Ireland's television at RTE1, Ireland, is at 12:30 in the afternoon (July 26, 2006). <br /> <br /> This program makes me literally laugh out loud and I can't boast that most sitcom (except the UK's Office) with Ricky Gervais. <br /> <br /> Today's TKoQ episode (July 26, 2006) was where Carrie starts a new job and invites his friends home and goes out for coffee, and Doug wants Carrie to have no "out" friends she would raise her top spot and show her "belly hair!" and licking plates for dinner! But another funny episode was the second week when the old bee (who is being carried by the father) won Bingo and this episode made me laugh, especially when they went out and got a substitute and carried the father standing there watching it and thought it was new. <br /> <br /> So I don't know how long this should be on Irish television or at what stage (the year is recorded), but I hope it won't end soon because I'm really enjoying it. <br /> <br /> To sum up, there are some great writings, some great characters and comedy (namely Carrie, Doug and Carries father) who have great punchlines and are well served - a little bright and close Mark sometimes (send the kids out of the room!), but I think this US Sitcom is a winner and very funny.
