Saboteur (1942) is another example of Alfred Hitchcock's inability to make a bad movie. Robert Cummings plays Barry Kane and he is really good at Priscilla Lane with his good looks playing Pat Martin. . Otto Kruger is a major major offender than its leader, the Fascist Group, Charles Tobin. Norman Lloyd, who still lives in the 94's, plays Fry and makes a very incredible bunch. Vaughan Glaser is the most sympathetic character as the blind man Philip Martin. Dance Hall Sequence is fantastic.And also moments of circus train. After all, we are at the Degree of Liberty.
