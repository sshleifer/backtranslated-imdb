No music. Not foolish masala. A reasonably realistic picture of the Indian police system, based on a real "meeting" with Indian Daya Nayak. This is Ab Tak 56 (56 symbolizes how many criminals are leading "Sadhu Agashe" has killed "- well you know a little bit") Brilliance expresses Nan Patekar as a relaxed and computational Indian policeman. just as interesting, but one of Ram Gopal Vermas's works that are either decent or really good, Ab Tak CHappan is incredibly good, and the top 70 films are released from India, commercial and artistic. that the story is relaxed and the end result (Indian flick) shows how the police network works, but seriously one of the liners is funny as hell (although I don't know if the subtitled version appears funny) Manufacturers are trying to release Cannes, which is interesting. debut director Shamit Aman (I think this is his name). <br /> <br /> Again 55 years Nana Patekar i Stylish away from her stupid vision of the past, just shows what's good the director can do a good actor. Really good things. If you are interested in Indian movies and are foolishly meaningless, some of our boys will eat, so this is definitely a relief. <br /> <br /> Again, Patekar is a guy who happily carries a movie on his shoulders and is a movie style - relaxed, funny, intelligent and computational. Good dialogues, good actors, nice direction. Recommendations: Gang pid, Ram Gopal Verma Company (both Indian Cords)
