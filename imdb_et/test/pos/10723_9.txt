Life was great for New York's advertising artist Ted Kramer. She had a great job and a loving woman. No, in fact, her husband was not so loving, because when Ted returned his work back to work, his wife, Joanna, was a suit packed and went to the door. He tried to stop him, but he just stepped out of the elevator and Ted's life. Well, now he's remembering both his house and their 6-year-old son, Billy; Ted assured his superior that his wife's departure had no effect on his work. However, this affected his actions as a father. He blew up when Billy flowed into his customer art! Some time later, Ted and Billy received a letter from Joanna, and it was obvious in his letter that he was not coming back. Ted was disappointed. Well, she went home from work to Billy's birthday, which made Billy painful for her. <br /> <br /> Ted was working late one day and his boss yelled at him because he had forgotten a very important client meeting. When he arrived home, he yelled at Billy to slide with ice cream at dinner. Later he told Billy that the breakdown between him and Joanna could be his fault, not Billy's; Ted called a good friend, Phyllis Bernard over this night and well, Billy got his first look at the naked woman. When Ted took to Billy Park the next day, he dropped a gym in the jungle and grounded his face on the playground. Ted literally ran to the hospital where they had to sew. After that, life began to fall on Ted. Then one day a phone call came out of the blue from none other than Joanna! They met in a corner cafe. At first they have a pleasant conversation, but then Joanna tells her that she has returned to take her son and take her with her. Ted wouldn't have any of that and tired. Well, life got even worse for Ted when his boss, Jim O'Connor, took him south and took him sharply. Not only that, but Joanna decided to dig for Billy and Ted couldn't win hell without a job. He hired himself as a lawyer, John Shaunessy, who asked for a pretty penny: an exact change of $ 15,000. And if they win. <br /> <br /> Ted was also able to find a new job. In fact, it was a step away from what it used to reduce wages significantly, but took a big decision. Finally, the date of the judgment was 9 January 1980. Judge Atkins. Joanna stood up and Shaunessy asked her why she left Ted and about her other relationships and how they had failed. The next day, Ted took a stand and Joanna's lawyer really like him a cheeseburger. Ted's good friend Margaret also took the billboard and she didn't really help. Well, the judge took enough time to think and be sure, one day Shaunessy told Ted that she was lost. Joanna got exclusive from Billy. How typical! Always decide for the mother. Well, Ted and Billy just devastated the ways of leaving. They had a sudden goodbye when suddenly Joanna stopped. Ted and Ted have little to talk about and well, instead of just ending the end, let me assure everyone that everything turns out to be right for everyone! <br /> <br /> It was a very good movie. Dustin Hoffman was very good. He earned this Academy Award. I've seen him in Hook, meet Fockers and Rain Man, which he also won for the Oscar. Meryl Streep was good. He also became an Oscar. Justin Henry was also good, so where was his candidate? I think the Academy had a rule against giving Oscars to children, but the rule was canceled when Haley Joel Osment came. This movie has a great drama, a light comedy and it's very subtle. It's a good job to keep your attention. I looked at Rain Man on the second night at TCM, then it came on and I just couldn't look at it. And what you should do. If you like Dustin Hoffman or Meryl Streep or movies of this genre, I recommend Kramer vs Kramer! A captivating film of bullying by two divorced parents fighting for their child. I liked Ted's small speech, which was about the decision of mothers all the time. What was it about sex that makes good parents? In fact, they have a child. But seriously, he's right. Why always lead a mother because she is a woman? George Coe, Howard Duff, who died in 1990, and Howland Chamberlain, who died in 1984, were also cast. Make sure he is in the future on the JoBeth Williams Corridor. Anyway, see Kramer vs. Kramer today !!! Good movie !! <br /> <br /> -
