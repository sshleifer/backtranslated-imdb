Although Wirey Spindell's various scenes can be described as "top". I thought it was refreshing to see something that was ready to go to the almost taboo twisted comedy level. <br /> <br /> Wirey Spindell is a great movie with excellent dialogue. I wouldn't say this movie is for everyone, but the movie is on my top 10 list. <br /> <br /> If you can look at this accidental insult and watch it for a movie, I would like you to see it in the same light that I do.
