Originally filmed in 1999 as a TV pilot, "Mulholland Dr." was rejected. Next year, David Lynch received money to film new scenes to show in the theater. He did it - and created one of the biggest, bizarre and horrible films ever made. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't really have the main characters, but if there were the main characters, they would be Betty (Naomi) Watts) and Rita (Laura Elena Harring). Betty is a perky blonde who is in her aunt's apartment when she listens to movies for parts. She finds Rita's aunt's apartment and decides to help her. You see, Rita lost her memory. He has no idea who he is. She bears her name, Rita, from the Gilda poster in the bathroom. So these two tried to find out who Rita really is. <br /> <br /> David Lynch is known for making some strange movie, but this movie is strange. It is odd, spooky and absolute indescribable. It's like a movie that's on the film. After a 100-minute point, the film has become very confusing - but if you look closely, it's perfectly reasonable. After watching the movie and then reading an article on the Internet that refers to things in the film, I fully understand the film. <br /> <br /> Actress is very good. Watts is terrible. Justin Theroux is very good as a Hollywood director who is facing a local mobile. Music is great. Angelo Badalamenti offers its best points. And management - ah! David Lynch is the same masterful filmmaker ever. <br /> <br /> Is this your movie type? It depends on it. Before watching a movie, you should probably look more at Lynch's work. You have to be patient with the film and probably look at it for the second time to draw lots of tips that Lynch has left throughout the film. For Lynch fans this is a dream. <br /> <br /> Mulholland Dr. is a masterpiece. It is brilliant, enigmatic and masterfully filmed. I love it.
