I've seen Wolfgang Petersen's movies pretty good. He knows how to act, create tension and interest you. Eastwood tends to be great, sometimes great. This applies to both its operations and its management. They both go here firmly. The concept is not bad and the cat and mouse game works well. Malkovich works quite well and he and Eastwood are playing side by side with the movie. I think it doesn't bring anything new, really ... but it never claims to be needed. It's two great actors, each playing a key role in proving their success in other parts of their careers and being able to do a good job with a great leader. Really, it's fun, well done and it just offers. Editing and cinematography are good. Action and character writing are also. The film can be tense and intense and, if you let yourself, you will probably be entertained and entertained, even if there are better movies. Stimulation is pretty much on the ground. I recommend it to fans of the main actors, the director and / or the film of this type. 7/10
