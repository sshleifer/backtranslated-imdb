No, I have not seen the original series and I will not compare the two if I have. This series has been filmed in Vancouver, Canada, and Victoria in British Columbia. The series is in a different story every week. Some of them are scarce, but most of the time the story tells you. I loved the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the Deprogrammers episode where there was an irresistible Brent Spiner as a Deprogrammer in a world where people have become slaves of lizard reptiles. It's funny how lizards and reptiles are our favorite evil aliens like V, but anyway he has three days to program a person who is completely brainwashed to serve alien species on earth. Stories are usually little but very interesting to watch.
