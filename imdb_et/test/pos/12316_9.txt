In his latest film, John Huston led his daughter Anjelicat by adjusting James Joyce's "Dubliners" story and gave us one of his best achievements to remember him. <br /> <br /> Joyce is about as impossible to shoot as someone, but "dead" will present at least a traditional story. Much (indeed, almost all) story about important information is in the area between the lines, in the thoughts and expressions of the characters - there are great moments, but they are the brain - they are not the things that you film about. But somehow, Huston gets it right, and he drives almost flawless adaptation. <br /> <br /> Anjelica is great and the movie is haunting and powerful. <br /> <br /> Rating: A
