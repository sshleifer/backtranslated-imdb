There are 3 of these films, all similarly designed and very fun for everyone. Red plays Wally Benton, also called Fox, who gets into real crimes with his fiance, played by your typical military girl, Ann Rutherford. Many disposable liners and coats are stupid and probably were in the 1940s I was expecting. But just as much did I laugh out loud, which was the least unexpected. Red Skelton has a surprisingly strong screen presence, surprisingly, because I grew up with a much older man who is truly amazing in my fearsome years. I have to pass these films though - if you feel this type of nostalgic price. I almost threw in a white heart, but really people can waste and beat and dare say that the break is above average. Like most movies of this era, he gets a PI (politically wrong) rating for reasons you can imagine. War is funny as I think, and so are the movies again. Look at one, look at them all.
