The film made at the height of the Black Power movement is an African-American Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson), who became director of the company after the death of the White General Director (white leaders hate each other and cannot decide who should be a successful previous CEO). Once he has come to power, he decides to turn it into a military organization. <br /> <br /> I don't know how Robert Downey Sr did it, but he did it! "Putney Swope" is the final beating of the American power structure. This is something that seems to have come out of Richard Pryor's mind. This is the classic word of comedy in every sense. A real masterpiece. Fun.
