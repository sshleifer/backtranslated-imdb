This groundbreaking movie is really a work of art. I went to the Indiana conference for screening with very low expectations, having already seen two other films with the "gamer" (both were so bad that the other I was out of). my eyes with my drinking rod and the twisted paper clip I found between the cushions). But the opening credit for "Dorkness" was for me. Moderate Northwest Stories set a beautiful backdrop to the drama surrounding the play game, Lodge (represented by Nathan Rice) and a band of inaccurate friends who set aside the real dramas that they face in fantastic dramas set in the mountains in everyday life. After the first scene (where they live in the fantasy world), they forcefully return to a world they are desperately trying to escape. It brought so many comparisons to my life that I moved into tears. Rice's acting is such an amazing caliber that I really believed in the first 20 minutes of the movie that he was really twenty men who suffered from frustration, men's baldness and a tedious group of "friends" who didn't seem to gripping terms like right and wrong. Here are some of the friends of the Lodge: Leo, the oldest and most difficult of the trio, seems to be the only other kind of job, leaving aside. Yet he seems to be socially attending Gary, the youngest group. It just seems a little strange, until you realize that Gary is actually a sexually confused sociopolis with very little prospect outside his "fantasy" world. This dichotomy serves, not to confuse, but informs and raises the public the importance of diversity in our society. My only complaint about this is that leo (Scott C. Brown) and Gary (christian doyle) sometimes play smiling signs as if they were informed that they were acting in comedy hard hitting action / drama. Speaking of action, Brian Lewis makes his film debut as a member of Cassina, the third and most influential lodge in the dirty team. The tension is always high when it is on the screen, as it passes passionately about its convictions to the lodge or when it presents its fantastic Martial Arts skills as "Silence" in its fantasy character. Or even when he suddenly turns around to face the audience and you see the audience that his fantastic chin won't hit him. Lewis lights up on the screen, no matter what he does, and I hope to see him more in the future. When the action begins in this movie, it just doesn't go out. Drama and action blend so smoothly from time to time that you can tell whether your mental sequence or the dramatic moment is concerned. A really exciting ride on Epic proportions, I would recommend "Players: Dorkness Rising" as needed to watch anyone who loves the movie. It was almost worth losing sight of. <br /> <br /> Chip Deedlenick
