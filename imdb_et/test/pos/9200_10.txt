I usually don't comment on movies or TV shows, but I had to post a comment about Las Vegas. <br /> <br /> Of course, we are about two-thirds in the United Kingdom during the third season, and although I have managed to see the last series of the 3rd season (otherwise), I am still glued every Friday at 21.00. <br /> <br /> Since the first episode of the first season I have been a big show provider and all in all 3 season DVDs, so I can't wait for the 4th season to start in October. <br /> <br /> So why do I love this example so much, then I have to agree with the last poster .... James Caan, I know one person can't do the team, but Big Ed Deline was made for Caan or maybe it was the opposite, I read that the producers weighed Martin Sheen on Ed Deline .... Nothing! ! I also agree that Caan's character is very soft, I also prefer that the harsh does not take * t Big Bad Eddy D, which we saw in the 1st and 2nd seasons, seems to be soft. <br /> <br /> I said no person is doing a team of themselves and of course other members Josh Duhamel / Danny, James LeSure / Mike, Vanessa Marcil / Sam, Nikki Cox / Mary, Molly Sims / Delinda, all well , even outside the cast members like Cheryl Ladd as Jillian Deline, Harry Groener as Gunther, Dean Caine as Casey, Mitchell Longley as Mitch, who can play 6 or 7 times during the season, just as well if they have been in every single episode from the first day <br /> <br /> This show has everything, drama, action, intercourse, laughter, romance, splendor, glamor, and great celebrity who often play themselves. <br /> <br /> Many may disagree, but this is one of the best shows on digital TV and I hope it can continue for a long time after the 4th season.
