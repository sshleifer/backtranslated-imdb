I remember this movie as children of the 1960s. It took my breath away from a young age. I was glued to my seat in front of a black and white TV. The cast was one of the best I've ever seen in my life. The musical was one of the greatest ever written. Please, to Gershwin and Goldwyn, please publish it on a video or DVD so that generations now and in the future can experience what I'm sure of so many of us when we saw this great work of art. not this great man's work has been invisible for years. I pray and hope that the hearts of these families will soften and let the world see this great movie.
