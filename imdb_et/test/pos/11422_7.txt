This Stan Laurel comedy is a cute little parody of Valentino's movie BLOOD AND SAND. If you have seen BLOOD AND SAND, you will probably appreciate this movie and laugh at some of the scenes that mock Valentino's movie. However, if you don't see this movie and watch this movie, you may not be very impressed - although I really liked the title cards, we used the word "pull" repeatedly in a very funny way. > <br /> Stanly plays "Vaselino" bullfighter, who looks pretty dark and wins only because the bulls seem to be lazy and non-aggressive. Even at the end of the movie, a bull that has allegedly killed ten men is clearly a domesticated bull. <br /> <br /> In no way is imagination a big movie, but a cute and harmless film.
