Light, exaggerating and interesting film. Watching Irene Dunne is a pleasure! When you look at him, he stops being Irene Dunne and becomes Paula Wharton in every way. <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed Irene Dunne in all the movies I've seen and almost everything. What a shame that most of his films need such a bad recovery. I hope that Irene Dunne's film will be restored before they are too treasured. Thanks for the goodness, it's not over 21 years old. serious records. I agree with the previous comment on "World and Apple Pie", one of many movie highlights. I read somewhere that Irene Dunne helped in writing to speak with Director Vidor (Irene Dunne was a very good and charitable person in private life) and it certainly seems to be in her films.
