I just saw Mar Ardentro and I felt I had to comment on this movie. Euthanasia is a difficult subject in every field and, unfortunately, it can sometimes distort the actual value of the film. Many people have treated excellent casting and its beautiful shapes / camera work. Certainly, Javier Bardem is an actor who brings something extra to every film. To say that he covers the real Sampredo is a bit stupid, because I don't think any reviewer would have known Sampredo personally. Lying and using a certain magic is an acting skill that, while well done, does not constitute "perfect" performance. Bardem does what he does well ... and that's it. Camera work is beautiful and creates feelings and perspectives that the film itself does not have. Sampredo is shown here as a man who dies so much that he leaves his loving family and marries a woman who is looking only when the other does not help him in seeking a dignified death. Now I am not here to say anything about the right or the euthanasia. The problem is that commenting on such movies can hardly be avoided. The subject of the film is so strong that you are almost forced to discuss the film on this strong topic. I find the film's weakness unintentionally - depicting Sampred as a symbolic character. Someone who is more intelligent than his family, as depicted in a simple cousin who doesn't get "him" a double-layered poem directed toward him. Someone who leaves a loving and caring family because HE thinks his life is indecent. A scene that is equal to a female lawyer who, according to the film, makes the wrong choice, which reaches far into the state of dementia, indicating that Sampredo's choice was right. The woman who is constantly looking for her is almost neglected by a beautiful lawyer, but suddenly she is married to Sampredo when she agrees to die. These choices make Sampredo a calculated figure, no matter how wonderful Bardem represents him. Argumental I would say it does not convince completely and I think Amenabar did not intend to add this unbalanced element of the film. For a young director, it is still an impressive film and it is definitely a strong moment (for example, a discussion between the priest and Sampredo). Camera work is impressive and the movie works well. But out of 10 out of 10 ... the film will not achieve this excellence.
