This movie is hard to find! This is the story of Juliet, a very ordinary cleaning industry, working in a large yogurt industry and the same president, Romuald. He does not recognize him, he does not take anyone to know until several plots put his business away while he was hit. He's lost, nobody turns and nobody trusts when he discovers Juliette. Like a cleansing woman, no one pays her any attention, so they say and blame her for being smart enough to help her helpless and unhappy boss. The complications are natural, it is not as normal as it seems to be with the children of five different ex-spouses who are still very much in love with him and he is not as clever as he thinks he is. This movie doesn't follow the predictive path and it will follow you. The actors are great and there are very moving moments on the journey. In the working class it makes more sense than those above them, almost the same way, "Gosford Park" showed that the upper shell is not all that is spiritually quiet. I recommend this movie very much. Look at this! 9/10
