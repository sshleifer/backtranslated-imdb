I just have a hardware wars DVD, a shiny new package that looks irresistible. Put it in my DVD player to find amazing things. The additional content of the DVD is even longer than the movie. For those who are (shame!) Ever seen hardware wars, this is one of the fantastically silly Star Wars spoofs (of course Episode IV). Home appliances (such as irons, toasters, vacuum and wafers) are for Ty-fighters, X-wings, R2D2 and a dead star. Instead of Princess Find, we have Princess Ann-Droid, along with Cinnabon's hairstyle. You're sure I'm sure. Mad stupidity and a fun ride to any Star Wars geek (like me!) <br /> <br /> Now - DVD! The director's comment, where he basically gives up the movie, amusing himself and the project. Interview with Fosselius about Creature Features (remember this!!) And a fun "director's paragraph" and the film's "foreign version" (all jokes of course). Anyway, it's great. I liked hardware wars in the theater and I'm so glad I have a DVD in my collection. MST3K: Movie and Thumb Wars!
