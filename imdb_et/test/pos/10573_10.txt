This movie was incredible !!!! I didn't know about it in the back story, so I have to push this DVD before me. It had many turns, but the story was still fresh and exciting. Elaine Cassidy was both Brilliant and Sally Hawkins. Style is abundant with both credible events and current fresh ideas. <br /> <br /> The eyes of Mrs Cassidy are really something that leaves a "mark". This film is a refreshing look at the way we look at "Victorian times" and how we see this society. Very worth a look.
