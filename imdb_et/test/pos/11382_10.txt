What a movie! It is undoubtedly an entertaining theme (if you are not a bride) and a mature, funny and complicated script by Paul Thomas Anderson (Magnolia, Hard Eight). PT Anderson has undoubtedly been around for a while. The evidence here is an epic and ambitious masterpiece. Each character plays professionally and touches and is fully designed. Burt Reynolds like Jack Horner (director) Julianne Moore (his film star) and Mark Whalberg (Dirk Diggler) are all fabulous. And the story? WOW! Honestly look at business and failures and consequences and family. One of the best movies of all time! I'll give him >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> A +
