The funny and devastating criticism of Russian society and culture in the transition from communism shows OKNO V PARIZH in the unfavorable light of the West. A group of Russians living in St. Petersburg (a large western window in St. Petersburg) finds a magical portal that will take them to Paris right away. Mamini's movie is really fun, and just "weird" constantly keeps even a hidden filmmaker on his toes. Songs of both cultures, dream sequences, and delightful frustrating peripheries combine a memorable and meaningful film. Anyone trying to understand the feelings of Russian culture after the fall of the USSR should start here.
