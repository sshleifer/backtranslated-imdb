First I played another monkey island game and I liked it despite the low quality graphics and sound. Then a few months later I found a new game. I tried it out and liked it a lot. The first thing you notice is excellent graphics. The areas are large, colorful and detailed, much to explore. The game requires you to use your brain as always. The game is complex, with all the points and click games that are frustrating. Jokes are not old for the third time. Animated cut scenes are also a great addition to the game. This is the best MI game out there, maybe the best P&C game! If you like cartoony games that play like a movie, get this game!
