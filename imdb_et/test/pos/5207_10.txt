When we compare the film industry to the ocean, we have a tendency to track only the surface. By a strong Hollywood marketing force, we saw all the war movies like Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket. However, splashy waves grow quietly, from time to time, lesser-known pearls. If you choose one and look carefully, you don't know why this pearl is almost unknown and why it's not already in the crown. <br /> <br /> "Stalingrad" is such a pearl. Why are there a number of millions of dollars worth of participants? Is it thousands of extras? No. It's breathtaking, outstanding, shiny, electronic visual effect? Not at all. So, what's so special? Well, in one word, it is a pure past reality that has been restored and transferred to cellulose fifty years later. Here is the most bloody battle in the history of tragedy. Dirty, wounded soldiers, Russian civilians who lost everything during the invasion, burning villages, shrinking buildings, broken suburbs, firearms, explosions, flame tanks, soldiers, alive burned, dug or crushed - all. But the real horror is elsewhere. People are simple pawns without having to change anything. The soldiers tried in the movie try to leave the zone and they can't. Civilians remain somewhere in the middle of worship, but cry for their children. Mercyless, the enormous grinding machine for war, melt people, equipment, villages, cities - and asks for more sacrifices and destruction. <br /> <br /> In this collective madness, a group of German soldiers are fighting to survive and maintain at least a minimum normality. They make their commitment and fight bravely. But as everyone knows, the battle is almost gone when people lose confidence and faith. We see how all these people have been abandoned, how they intend to desert, how they fight the last Berlin plane (wounded), how a very bad injured soldier was treated as a simulator and shot how they were forced to fill a small group of Russian civilians, including the young boy, how they later discovered a place that is literally full of food and drink ceilings, which are only for some "higher" officials. One by one they fall dead. The end of the film is one of the bitter, frustrating and touching end I ever saw in the excellent score of the Philarmonic Orchestra in Munich. The war destroyed everything on its way. <br /> <br /> This movie is visible to everyone. A true movie lover should have it in her collection. A strong anti-war message must be a warning to all of us. Unfortunately, neither humanity nor politicians learn. Self-destruction is in our DNA and human pain seems to last forever. Can we be enough to end the war?
