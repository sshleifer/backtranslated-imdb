It's a classic 80's humor. If you were a teenager in the 80s, it was a summer break. It was an early look for those who are now superstars. This and better dead are just fun and foolish movies to sit and enjoy. Everyone can admit that they had a teenage summer crazy summer. Even the crazy family and friends like these characters. For some of these characters, the introduction was so much fun. Uncle who is crazy, waiting for every wake-up time waiting for the radio to win a million dollars, grandmother who likes only grandchildren and gave the kids a bill after dinner, twin brothers who don't see anything like that and met hoopz, had so much fun. It may not win the prize, but it's just a fun movie to lose in one afternoon.
