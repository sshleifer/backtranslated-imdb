I was not surprised when I read the director's comment that he made this film a counter-product to all those "DVD games", as it surely hit me. I confess that I have the certainty of "meta", but I found that this film is very accessible and entertaining, not even in a laborious, self-conscious way, which is certainly a bit of what you expect in the film about making a movie. It is very "french" that "making" (and even sexuality) movies has many extreme but sometimes persuasive theories, but since the director doesn't play (using avatars), we have many choices (since I'm pretty sure that he is constantly in conflict with himself). Apparently Catherine Breillat specializes in a hard-to-track movie, but I would definitely say it doesn't qualify. I really enjoyed the dialogue, the balance between the cinematographic and the natural relationship, the relationship between the director and his assistant and actor, and so on. Highly recommended.
