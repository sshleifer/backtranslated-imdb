I'm sure the US people don't know anything about the rest of the world, but I think they shouldn't talk about what they don't know. And they have to remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocritical as the US. The only places where the consent between teenagers is illegal is the US and Islamic countries. In France, for example, there is an age of 15. Brazil has 14. In Spain, it is 12. So teenage actors who are 16 and 17 years old during production are doing nothing illegal. Nudity is not considered a major factor in almost all civilized countries. And only a freak can consider teenage love as a childhood.
