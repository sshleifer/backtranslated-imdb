A well-made documentary that focuses on two Sudanese refugees relocating to the US. This is your main fish that is not in the fiction. I found it exciting to see how Peter and Santino lived before coming to America and how they came here (Houston, Texas). They were waiting for a sort of heaven, but found it to be much harder than it seems to be going well in the countries. They go to a somewhat more realistic skeptic than the promising idealists. Wherever they go, they meet bureaucrats with paper lines that most citizens can take for granted. They frighten them that they are drier than African-Americans, and they don't feel like that. One "lost boy" can leave Houston to go to Olathe, Kansas where he finds the conditions a little better, but still less than ideal. There are people who try to help them and try to hurt them in this movie. Not shown, but talked about, are those who put the gun in their heads and kidnapped them, directing one missing boy to comment negatively that "all black people in America are not good." I also found it interesting that they arrived in Houston in August 2001, one month before terrorists attacked the World Trade Center. I was hoping to see their reaction to this tragedy, but it is not mentioned at all. All in all, it is a well-made documentary without narration. No one is needed. "Missing boys" are doing a good job of explaining the events around them without any help, thank you very much.
