There are worse ways to spend the evening than watching this movie, though it's predictable. Drew Barrymore is doing a great job for the nervous nerves of this movie - a great choice. I found it somewhat difficult to believe that popular girls would end up accepting it - my experience is that the crowd's memory is longer and knowing how AWFUL's Drew character was (the year's ostrich)? kept them miles away, no matter what rumors his brother drums. (And does "Kole Slaw Food" really make him all this popular? I doubt it). As for the rooting of Drew's character to win big as a reporter - well, I would have hoped that he could have found the story long ago. A little alive. Having said all this, it was a fun piece that is fun if you don't expect too much.
