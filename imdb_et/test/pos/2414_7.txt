<br /> <br /> For the first time I watched this movie right after it was put on a video in 1995, I rejected it, saying that Julie was not Daniel, never giving her the chance and saying it was terrible. /> <br /> But here it is 5 years later in Disney and im again. And I find it not as bad as I did. Miyagi is still Miyagi, just like a school like never before, the musical result is still as pleasant as ever. And Swank's character is not so bad that his behavior is pretty good in the script. It wins the third installment with a wide margin. So my initial estimate 4 has been raised to 7.
