The first time you watch this movie, you can hate it, but the second time you see the movie I guarantee, it laughs everywhere. Dog owners are so ecological that you can't help but watch and laugh. The softest toy bottle to the whistleblower will make you laugh. And you can learn the existence of every nut!
