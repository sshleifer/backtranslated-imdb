This film speaks of a spacecraft crew that strikes the earth on three suns on a strange light planet. Among the passengers are the sentenced sorcerer Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel) and his nemesis, Johns (Cole Hauser). Although the wreck survivors get their bearings, it happens in the shadow of all three suns. Shortly thereafter, frightening creatures will begin appearing and begin to take off the crew members one by one. During Eclipse, Riddick gets into his eyes because his eyes have been surgically excited, giving him night vision. The team must trust him to make them safe. <br /> <br /> This is a very stylish movie where the color of the sky changes according to the scene, giving it a very strange look. Vin Diesel is great as Riddick, really threatening, but forced to help people who would otherwise see him as a threat. There is also humor in his performance that adds another dimension to the character. This is the kind of role Vin stands out, an anti-hero whose character is not as one-dimensional as the first. I can't imagine anyone in this role, it could have been written to him. <br /> <br /> The Riddick Chronicle!
