At first glance, this is another high school anime that has many excuses for "fan service" but there is much more. "Fanervice" is part of the plot, the main character is tired of cynical (unusual) and most importantly, wise episodes that link all episodes together and create interesting questions. Episodes are deliberately non-chronological and the series is definitely worth repeatedly in chronological order. <br /> <br /> The series is worth the attention because there are many random tips that show and explain things, plus a lot of fun about other series, anime, and others.
