The story is incredible, it begins with a new baby in a town called Roy, while a school bus drives, he notices that the boy runs without shoes, and that day he broke the big tempters trying to fight him. Roy will soon discover that the boy is a runaway, and he and his step-sister are trying to confuse, which could kill all the beautiful owls that live there. Roy decides to help him in the struggle, whether they will win this fight before the smart but worshiping policeman Dave Delink (Luke Wilson), who will face them. Nice movie, funny and adventurous. I admire Luke Wilson for this role. I don't think his brother Owen would take this role.
