This young filmmaker has a talent to quickly capture its audience with unusual camera and rare but intense scripts. The concept of animation and the combination of real-time footage is remarkably well done and the sound is very good. <br /> <br /> Deciding to release a movie from twelve parts of the network will make the director's task exciting enough for every episode to invest in every future episode. All I want is for all movies to be such a commitment to their audience's entertainment throughout their stories. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
