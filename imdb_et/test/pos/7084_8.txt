One real thing proves that it's a filmmaker. Streep will surely get the Oscar nomination for his role. Beautiful drama, One True Thing is the best film making in the late 1990s - there are still people who care about making movies and watching beyond the million dollar special effects of big blockers. It's not the best picture and nothing ... don't be foolish. But the amount of emotions that both the actors and the writer gave me hit me like a shock wave. I cried twice in this movie that says a lot to a 24-year-old man.
