Cure is a fantastic movie about a boy with AIDS. I've been crying about four times while watching this movie and it's just so sad. I can't allow anyone to look at it, but it makes you do it. Very emotional and very sad, Cure is a must-see film. It shows the meaning of friendship and love and is an extremely large film. <br /> <br /> At first I didn't think it was so big and I was wondering why my mother always shouted at it. But now I know it's a wonderful film that is so original and so close to real life situations, unlike most other nonsense movies. Words can't describe the size of Cure, you just have to see it.
