Just got back from the premiere of European players: Dorkness Rising. <br /> <br /> What I can say is that if you are a player (CRPG, RPG or LARP), this movie is for you. And if you are not a player? Well, it's still very fun. <br /> <br /> The actor is definitely not an Oscar-worthy, but in the whole element of the movie it adds, it is a charm. Humor is everywhere, with some very nice touches (tribute to Gary Gygax is especially well done when you notice it). There is a great deal of appearance that fits the ordinary people who enjoy the usual hobby. <br /> <br /> The sound and visual quality of the film is sufficient, but again it simply adds an atmosphere that helps to define the film as Dungeons and Dragons, which players play and play. <br /> <br /> They are not afraid to use the specific terminology of one system, but they will still be able to allow product placement to be part of a movie, but in a very understandable and perfectly fair way. It also touches on some perceived prejudices that some players may have with other players and can handle it relatively well. <br /> <br /> The entire movie is inspired by a well-balanced equal balance between character, plot and entertainment (Bard is an amazingly good value for money). <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie's evaluation is quite difficult, so I've given it 2 scores. <br /> <br /> Score (for non-RP): 7/10 (Some moments may go overhead, but the main parts of the movie work so hard and get so much more.) <br /> <br / > Score (RP'ers): 10/10 (Everything is matched, in perfect quantities and with perfect charm and mood)
