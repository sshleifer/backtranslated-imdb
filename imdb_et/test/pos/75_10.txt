This often outrageous film is indispensable for Blake Edward, Julie Andrews, Henry Mancini or Hollywood musicians. Other writers have commented on shade changes, plot confusion, etc., but the film has many recommendations. The result is one of Henry Mancin's finest (and he has written a lot of wonderful things), how many songs sing Andrews perfectly, Julie's play is nuanced and she is decorated with beautiful clothes (she's completely loved here) is the breath of on-the-spot shots and some funny inspector of Clouseau-like sight. to be launched. Rock Hudson basically called in his performance, but he is passively good. The real curiosity that this was the last big movie Julie made about ten years and is in many ways Victor / Victoria's predecessor. It's nice to watch and listen. When is it available on DVD? If this is the case, I would like to have both versions for one - the longer and shorter the director cut. Because it was S.O.B.
