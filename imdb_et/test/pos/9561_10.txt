This flick was even better than "Waiting for Guffman". The great strength of these two films lies in the ingenious character of the guests and the troupe of the second small town of Levy. If a person finds this film boring or meaningless, then God helps, they just didn't get it. It's a mockumentary, something where Guest and Levy are genius. At the end of the movie, where the guest's southern dog lover tells us to relax after the show, he went to Israel to work with "caboose" or when he tells us that ventriloquism is an ancient art and we see the hieroglyph <br /> <br /> ancient In Egypt, where he had a small ancient Egyptian, I realized that such moments make life worth living. Thank you, Mr.Guest and Mr. Levy, and God bless you.
