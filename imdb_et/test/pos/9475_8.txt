This is the first James Cagney movie I've ever seen. I had never been interested in my movies before, because I thought I wouldn't like something like a cinema style and since I've heard most of Cagney's movies are the same. I have to say that I really liked it. According to today's movie standards, it wasn't special, but I found it surprisingly fun. Cagney was not a tough guy, but he played this part very well.
