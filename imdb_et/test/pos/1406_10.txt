Haines is great, because the West Point's alleged fucking cadet is indeed something he has now arrived. Haines shows his simple, funny comic that takes on the local beauty of West Point and Joan Crawford. Great fun in the first half. And with the amazing touch of Haines' character, footage shots go too far and almost away. New, humbly filled Haines can get in a few minutes to play against the navy in a football game, and win the game despite the broken hands. Great, MGM's pleasant entertainment in this Haines formula film shows Billy his best. William Bakewell also considered a lean follower. The nice-but-goony character would be played by Clark Gable, Cary Grant, Gary Cooper and others in the later decades, the other taking the beautiful but daffy dames played by Carole Lombard and Marion Davies. West Point is the winner!
