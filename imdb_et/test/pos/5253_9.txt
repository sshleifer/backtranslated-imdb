I had my son at the weekend and my parent called me up and said they wanted us to meet in the movies. When I got there, my mother said she really wanted to see "women" and asked if my son and I were thinking about being labeled chick flick. I agreed reluctantly to think that this is another "First Wives Club" movie. I have to say that I was very surprised when I discovered credit for the movie openly from the scene. It was a big production and the cast was perfect in its roles. My son and we found that we were laughing at the whole movie and we were glad we saw it. It made a great Saturday afternoon movie and I recommend it to someone, a man or a woman.
