This movie is a topic we all see over and over again - Posiedan's adventure in space. The characters are all the characters in the stock - the heroine hero, Judas, cowards, etc. The only question is really who sucks next to it. Sometimes this tried-and-tested formula - as in this case - works more often than not - as a truly meaningless "Red Planet". So why does this one work? Because it's stylish. Operation is above average. And above all, it's not predictable. The conclusion is not marked. I really had no idea how it would end and be surprised how it ended. That alone deserves my book first. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting and fun movie. And even though we never knew the cinema's face, it didn't hurt.
