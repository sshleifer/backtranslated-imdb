This movie is great. Not because it does something special or new, but because it is consistently high in all parts. No part is distinguished by "groundbreaking" or "stars", but all parts are above average and this makes me a great movie. <br /> <br /> I have several copies of this movie and can acquire it on a DVD or Blu-Ray collection one day (adhering to high blu-ray prices now and, of course, I don't have blu-ray players ... but it's next to this review point). <br /> <br /> It stands for the usual, but quickly turns into a drama full of tension, some action, heavily depicted characters, and a well-run plot that keeps you interested until you wait, no, it won't start from the usual. <br /> <br /> It starts out like Qun. TÃµrv. the film wants it to be. With a fantastic scene where an attempt to buy coffee and donuts goes ... very, very wrong. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie there was nothing like it seemed, and some people are dead, and some people are very wealthy. I won't tell you who ... look and enjoy! Overall rating: 10/10, A **, Excellent!
