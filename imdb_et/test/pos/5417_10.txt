This short was called the Academy Award, losing Anna and Bella. Not when the doctor at Strangelove has had the core war so much fun! Condie takes the situation and turns it on the ear and then gives a spin for a good measurement. Visual gags are abundant in Condie's work and I always see something I looked at each time before. The world's biggest animations that deserve this and many other shorts. Recommended.
