Nevsky is one of the great epic war movies. Of course, others, like the birth of a nation and Napoleon, had come earlier, but it is just as influential. Action is in stock, but anyone who knows Eisenstein's first thing would know it was part of his film theory. This film, unlike many of its silent works, touches the heroic person as much as it is about the group. This reflects the Stalinist philosophy that had arisen by 1938. However, his film shows us the power that people who come together to fight against what they perceive as evil can come together. Nevsky is just one of many men. He is a prince because he is the strongest, but not because he is somehow different from the rest. The romantic corners of the film give a more personal story than Eisenstein had previously promised. Not all elements work and the film is probably a little too long, but it still resonates.
