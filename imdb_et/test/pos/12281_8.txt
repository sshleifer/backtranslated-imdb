The whole city of Blackstone is afraid because they created Bret Dixon's brother - and he comes back for revenge! At least that's what they think. <br /> <br /> Great Johnny Hallyday and a very interesting, early Mario Adorf star in this Italian-western, probably filmed in the Alps. <br /> <br /> Bret Dixon goes back to Blackstone to investigate why his brother was closed. He is lonely and gunslinger par excellance, everyone is afraid of him - Mexican bandits (fighting for the Gringos who took their land!), As well as "decent" citizens who brother Bret. They lynched him because they thought he stole his money instead of putting it in the Dallas bank for safety. But this is only half the truth, as we explain in this psychologically interesting Western process. <br /> <br /> But be careful, it's a sort of frustrating film, because everything turns out to be innocent and definitely bad for everyone ... <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it very much and gave it 8/10 . Strangely enough, less than 5 people voted for this movie on January 12, 2002.
