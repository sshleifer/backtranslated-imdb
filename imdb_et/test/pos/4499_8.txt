According to Khaled Hossein's best selling novel, Kite Runner is a story of friendship, betrayal, and struggle for redemption. In Afghanistan, before the Soviet invasion of 1979, and later under the Taliban regime, all elements are located for a great drama, but under the leadership of Marc Forster (Finding Neverland), the film has no such emotional effect. which makes it a memorable experience, although it is fun, well-functioning and occasionally moving. <br /> <br /> In 1978, filmed in Kabul, but filmed in Kashgar, China, because of the dangers in Afghanistan. The film between the two young boys is very real, even though they are far from social and economic. The 12-year-old Amir (Zekiria Ebrahimi) lives with her rich and educated father, Baba, who is played by the great Homayoun Ershadi, although her wealth seems somewhat uncomfortable in some of the world's poorest countries. Although Baba is a loving father, he admits to his friend and business partner Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub) that Amir is too soft and that "this boy is missing". The family has a servant Ali (Nabi Tanha) who puts her every need and whose son Hassan (Ahmed Khan Mahmoodzada) is Amir's best friend. <br /> <br /> These two are separated not only by classes, but also by nationality. Growing writer Amir is a majority member of Pashtun, while Hassan is a Hazara, a minority (10% of the population). Although we learn little about our tradition or social situation, they are linked to their love story, popular sport in Kabul, and Amir's reading of Afghan folk songs to illiterate Hassan. The annual pup competition is a big event in their lives and the CGI's influence is breathtaking. Kite strings are covered with glass particles and the winner is the one whose dragon string can cut other kites in the sky. Hassan is a dragon runner who has the surprising ability to find fallen kites and bring them to Amir as trophies. After Amir has won a major competition, a sad event will be created that will shape the rest of her life. <br /> <br /> Tempted by Elder Assef (Elham Ehsas) who later appears as a ruthless Taliban leader to attack Hassan because he is Hazara and is cruelly raped (camera) while Amir is too scared to try it and prevent it. He cannot resist his lack of courage (although one must ask what he might have done to help Hassan), his guilt becomes his relationship with Hassan and their friendship becomes intense. In one case, Amir throws pomegranates to Hassan as if he had asked him to drive back and punish him for passivity, but Hassan would not take the feed while remaining loyal despite his friend's coward. When Amir calls his father to dismiss the servants and accuse Hassan of stealing his watch, Hassan confesses to theft, even though he is innocent. In the end, Ali and Hassan are shaming. When the Russians invade Afghanistan, Baba and Amir leave, fleeing to Pakistan and then to Fremont, California, where the story is picked up years later. <br /> <br /> Baba is forced to work at a gas station and sell trinkets. on the open market, while Amir (Abdul Salam Yusoufzai), seemingly going through a living movement, learns to write in a local community college. After she falls in love and marries Soraya (Atossa Leon), daughter of Kabul's daughter, Amir finally publishes her first novel - the ash season and things seem very positive. When Amir receives a speech from Rahim Khan, asking him to visit him in Pakistan, saying to him "there is a good chance again", the guilt that despises him all his life calls Amir to go home. He returns to Pakistan and is returning to Afghanistan, which is now under the control of the Taliban, to fight the demons of his past and discover the amazing secret of the process. <br /> <br /> Kite runner is a sensitive film that deals with the inner pain that comes from knowing that you were not true to your best instincts and allowing you to overcome the shame to a new level of responsibility. Nor does it hide the pain of pain and pain caused by the wars and the revolution in Afghanistan, which may be represented by patient Hassan. Unfortunately, it reduces difficult situations to the level of good boys and bad guys and distorts what actually happened, relieving the United States of its anti-government, hidden acts, of any responsibility for a catastrophic war that was over one million dead and millions more banned. Although we are inspired by outstanding children's actors and are moved from the freedom that the dragon is driving, Kite Runner has given up its power when it comes to replacing melodrama in history.
