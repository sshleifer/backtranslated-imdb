I am from Ireland and I thought this film had a few minutes or two, where the accents were a bit behind, but no worse than any Brad Pitt or other American accent. In addition, I have rarely seen any British actor not attending an American or Canadian accent, except for Colin Farrel's minority report. This movie is a small movie and it was fun. No, it wasn't a blockbuster Hollywood production, but frankly I'm sick of this ill. I laughed more than a few times and I had a good time. It was definitely worth renting. The main character is the scam of other heavy British gangsters. At least that is how I saw it. If you're going to wait for $ 100 million in production, you're frustrated. Enjoy what it is - a small entertaining film.
