I got it a couple of times on television in the late 1970s. It was only played late at night (midnight past). <br /> <br /> Peter Lorre plays a friendly, happy man whose face is scattered by fire. She has been rejected by a girlfriend and left alone and full of despair. He turns to crime and will eventually become very successful. She makes the masks hide their hidden qualities and falls in love with a beautiful girl (Evelyn Keyes) ... who is blind! He's trying to go straight to him ... but he can't escape the crime of his life or his hatred for his beloved face. <br /> <br /> There is no B movie. Very short (lasting just over an hour), but Lorre has done well and worked great. It is much deeper than you would expect from a B-picture. In particular, Ankers takes on the role of a grateful "girl" and makes her character fresh and attractive. Unfortunately, it has disappeared from the TV and it was never put on video or DVD (as far as I know). TCM recently showed it and it was nice to see that the movie is still up. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
