The labyrinth of Chris Nolan like Noir about Voyeurism and Identity is amazing from start to finish. The first film is as complex as "Memento" or "Prestige", although it may be a little harder to get a handle. However, it is an originality and a creative drive, and it has an intellectually challenging "twist" because it is a realistic cellulose. Few filmmakers have made their editors both good and attentive to the narrative that Nolan has. The story is about a boring writer who loves to follow random strangers on the street until he follows someone who has noticed him following others and has been followed by a colon, and then the complexity and identities begin to reorganize. More naturalistic and realistic than the later works by Nolan, but just as sharp.
