"Closet Land" is sponsored by Amnesty International and has many political records, but there is much more to this richly mixed story ... <br /> <br /> This is not just political tension in the late 80s - it's personal persecution a woman puts herself through a child whom the family's girlfriend redeemed. We see a subtle hint of the paralysis of dishonest government / society structures and the culture of sexual robbery, where one in four children is molested and one in three women has experienced some kind of rape. <br /> <br /> I, it raises the issue of chilled chicken and egg: is the attitude of our sexual repression and predator attacks a political environment of fear and censorship or a socio-political dysfunction of a culture of sexual robbery? Even the psychological consequences of this question force us into the place where we have brought our responses to development. <br /> <br /> Finally, our young lady writer (Stowe) is like the moment at the end of Hensen's "labyrinth" - she understands at one glittering and glorious moment that the idea of ​​a secret police (Rickman) stealing her power is an illusion. No one can steal your power - they can only trick you by giving it, and then you have the right to withdraw it at any time. <br /> <br /> This is not an easy-to-film movie, and you will surely enter it. Minimalist aspects with child-like animation create deeper parts of the psyche and leave no viewer unchanged.
