Harsh life gets tougher if three mothers of one mother are allowed to be sent to separate nursing homes after their early break. <br /> <br /> To stay together, the older boy is planning a bold, high-risk escape to find a distant lost uncle - their only surviving relative. <br /> <br /> Their trek will take on three terrible rails taking place in the desert through classical beetle, deceit, hungry, desperate, terrorized by criminals, and also young people driven by ever-threatening civilian powers. <br /> <br /> What the film lacks in action and plot realism is honest in human needs, which must be part of a full and complete family, even if this family is a spare part of a broken life. <br /> <br /> Of course, the end is forced and too critical for the critical movie mover, but every heart strikes the same cry of family society and <br /> <br /> With all my weaknesses I give this film a strong recommendation.
