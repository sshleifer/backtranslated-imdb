This is a London catastrophe. The multiple hurricane, the superstorm and the tornado in Scotland are all around the east, below the English coast and later on in the south. After several hours of heavy rain, London's barrier over the Thames is short and overflows. Then there is the threatening oriental carriageway that irritates the East, causing devastation and the lives of millions of Londoners. At the heart of the story is a climatologist (Tom Courtenay), a climatologist who is trying to save the consequences of a giant wave in London, trying to convince the authorities that the city cork was dangerous, in addition to the sailor (Robert Carlyle) and his former wife, Samantha (Jessalyn Gilsig). They stay under the barrier and fell to the sea. Meanwhile, the secret government of Hash Nash (Joanne Whalley) is trying to control many displaced people and prevent the deaths of about 200,000 people by directing a deputy minister (David Suchet). They have little time to save London from the disaster. <br /> <br /> A perfectly acceptable drama disaster that works well. A great Tom Courtenay as a climatologist who predicts a catastrophe and a wonderful Robert Carlyle and Jessalyn Gilsig as a former marriage reviving their love. The film offers impressive flood scenes inspired by the breathtaking special effects of a computer generator, better than the classic class of the 70s, such as the "earthquake, Inferno tower" and similarly "Armaguedon and tomorrow". Although this is not a clear denunciation, we know that the flood is caused by the greenhouse effect and the global warming that comes from the ozone hole. The film is well run by Tony Mitchell. I recommend this movie to people who like disaster movies. Other flood adjustments include: "Flood (1976)", directed by Earl Bellamy, Robert Culp and Barbara Hershey; "Hard Rain (1998)", directed by Mikael Salomon with Morgan Freeman and Christian Slater; "Flooding: River Rampage (1979)", directed by Bruce Pittman and Richard Thomas
