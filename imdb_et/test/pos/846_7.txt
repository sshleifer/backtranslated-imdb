The only consistent yarn that held the series together was the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as two Taelons in a quiet idealogical conflict. If not their talents and well-written dialogue, they would have been two strange swing chicks in the B-film series. <br /> <br /> If only this series was finished in Season 4 and later SyFy ...
