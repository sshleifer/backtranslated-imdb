I love this movie !!! <br /> <br /> This beautiful, charming love story drew me immediately with my beloved characters and a warm-hearted romance. I got all the characters in the movie so I felt like I knew them personally. The story is very enchanting and it brought me tears in several touching moments. Duchovny and the driver have a very lovely, courageous relationship that you can't help. It's worth more than once and show to all your friends. I'm just curious about why it wasn't a big hit? <br /> <br /> I'll give it to 10 out of 10! Spectacular movie! (And it comes from a man who thinks 9 out of 10 movies aren't even worth it.)
