Gerald (Richard Carlson) and Kitty (Veronica Hurst) recently graduated from their family and friends in France when they receive a letter asking him to visit an ancestral castle in Scotland. Gerald's uncle is said to be ill and has asked Gerald, the only heir, to be there. Gerald goes to Scotland leaving his future bride behind. A few weeks will pass and he will not come back. Worried, Kitty sends out telegrams, but doesn't listen to her groom. Four weeks later, Kitty finally gets a strange answer from Gerald, calling for involvement and telling her to move on with her life. Not willing to give up his relationship and look for answers, Kitty jumps on the plane and decides to visit Gerald. Traveling with her is her high-level aunt Edith (Katherine Emery, the best known for her main role in the classic cooler ISLE OF DEAD). When Kitty and Edith arrive at MacTeam's legacy, they are immediately suspicious of something strange. To begin with, Gerald seems to be twenty years old in a couple of weeks. Secondly, this once nice and charming man has become a full jerk who repeatedly demands that they leave the castle and never come back. When Edith has gotten cold, Kitty uses this excuse to settle there to try to get to the bottom of things. <br /> <br /> Why is Gerald so cold and cruel to a woman who was getting married? Why is Gerald against the company? Why are house rules saying that guests must be locked in their bedroom at night? Why are guests not allowed to enter any estate area, such as Gerald's bedroom and a large hedgeist? And what makes these strange drag the noise every night? These are just some of the questions MAZE poses. The film actually does a good job that creates secrecy and intrigue. You are really interested in what is happening and patiently waiting for a resolution to explain the strange events that are going on. And then it happens ... I definitely don't want to ruin the end of this movie because you're not better to know, but it takes one of the most unbelievable and jaw-strange moves I've seen in every movie. It is strangely ridiculous, but it also takes a pretty strong little b / w mystery and sends it directly to the Z-Class Schlock territory. And this ending seems so unsuccessful, you will probably not forget it immediately after you see it. <br /> <br /> Despite ending (or even partially ending), I really enjoyed this odd bird. This is a very talkative and slow movement during the talk time, but it was in my interest to keep it going. Director William Cameron Menzies (who made many more famous masters of MARS in the same year) is known as the double Oscar winning artistic director and his designs here are also very interesting. From time to time, the film is almost silent, with some exterior designs, some painted backgrounds and sparsely decorated interiors with very high ceilings. As with any good castle, there is a secret passage and a long staircase. It also throws some rubber bat-on-strings into good action. <br /> <br /> Some actors are a bit stiff and uncomfortable, but I liked most cast. Hurst is one of those hidden and mostly unknown actors who unfortunately never seemed beautiful and talented. Emery, who also plays the narrator at the beginning and end of the film making, is decent enough to be a superfluous aunt. But my favorite was Michael Pate as a hot-haired servant, who makes it upright when he goes up the zombie when he steps up the stairs. There are also smaller roles with Hillary Brooke (who played the role of Sherlock Holmes in Mystery "WOMAN IN ROHEL") and Lilian Bond (Whale's OLD DARK HOUSE). Of course, Carlson also played IT CAME FROM OUTTER SPACE, CREATURE OF BLACK LAGONON, and some other horror files so you have been given a decent form for genre genres. I'll say it out!
