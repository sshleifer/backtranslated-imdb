I have a good common logic to know that the oil will not last forever and I am very aware of how much of my life in the suburbs is turned around in petrochemical products. I have been an avid consumer of novel technologies and there is still room for power sources - so I know even the energy crisis associated with Peak Oil is making a difference to my life. <br /> <br /> The end of suburbia shows rationally and entertainingly how much of my family's lifestyle must change in my life. I am particularly concerned about future generations who have to take up their superfluous tables, but filmmakers hope that they will recognize the ingenuity and determination of people - and the sense of community that tends to create shared difficulties. <br /> <br /> There is no point in trying to pretend Peak Oil is unjustified propaganda - or treating it as an approaching radioactive "On the Beach" (ie ready for suicide bombs). Even with our best efforts, time is more complicated, and I hope there is enough compassion and humanity.
