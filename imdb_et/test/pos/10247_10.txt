Some people may call "Cooley High" a similar thing as "American Graffiti" but I wouldn't. To begin with, "AG", all were white, while "CH" they were all black. What's more, it has a Motown soundtrack. More specifically, in 1964, the film focuses on a number of work-class students in Chicago and their master classes. The film focuses on home life and relationships. In our apartments, we see that there is never a father. But these young men always know how to live life completely. <br /> <br /> One thing that really distinguishes this movie from most other black people is that the teenagers of this movie are portrayed as a very responsible, worryingly missing school. The two really funny scenes are the gorilla scene and one white guy in the movie. Generally, the head is a soundtrack. It's really one of the best movie music soundtracks (we even have it at home on vinyl). The classic word in the real sense.
