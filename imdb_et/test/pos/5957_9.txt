I just saw this movie last night and I have to say I loved every minute. If it is taken in the spirit of the Bond-esquire movie parody, it is really good. The true comedy of the film is a blatant disregard for political correctness. In this genre, the cultural mystery and almost ridiculous machoism is used as a great comic. It is also called the task of illogical and formal elements, where agent OSS 117 is constantly uncomfortably learning difficult things (such as Arabic and how to play traditional means) while leaving some pathetically obvious hints. Some of the lines in the movie continued to laugh at me after hours of movie ... and I have to say that I've learned some ... interesting French vocabulary that would probably be quite upset by my professors. All in all, I thought this movie was great. An intensely funny and first movie I've ever seen that parade all aspects of spy film.
