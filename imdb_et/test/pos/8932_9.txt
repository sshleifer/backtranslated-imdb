I've seen this movie on Sunday night and I have to say that there is no better way to finish the weekend. I'm completely happy with the humor and warmth that this movie offers. It just leaves me in a pretty mood. Watching this movie means a good time and a warm feeling. <br /> <br /> The film offers sharp black British humor and feels very fresh. You really enjoy the story and the characters. Brenda Blethyn is so big. I don't know exactly why. She's too old to be a love for me and too young to be a mother. But I feel comfortable when he appears in the movie. <br /> <br /> Some may say that the story was thin and predictable. But who cares? Just have a happy ending, dancing in the sunlight! Are the characters stereotypes or cut-outs? I don't know - better, I don't care! I just loved them and enjoyed watching them. <br /> <br /> Besides, I have to say that I don't usually like romantic comedies. But it is outstanding: black comedy with a golden heart !!
