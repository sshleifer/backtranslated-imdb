My comment is mainly a comment on the first commentator (to be added to the film) and his unfortunate assessment of the film. I think his perspective shows why the extra is extra and the director is the director. The film was sweet, it worked quite well, it was an experience of watching it for a nice working week. It was not "Hours" (active) or "Matrix" (special effects) or even "Color purple" (direction). Most movies are not. But it wasn't that "brother ..." would make you believe. Sorry dude, just 2 cents. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, it was ultimately very gay affirmative (+ # 1). It showed the world full of diverse and less perfect people - you know, like us (+ # 2)! It opened the door to one culture, without excluding other cultures (+ # 3). And I liked the music (+ # 4).
