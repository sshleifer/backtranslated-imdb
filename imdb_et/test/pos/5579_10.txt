Well, how can I categorize Farscape without using high speeds? Ok, here goes! Scripts are fantastic, every episode offers so much entertainment, drama, humor and traceability. Casting is perfect, especially what Virginia Hey played with Zhaan (the blue lady), each symbol is deep, which is not just in the Star Trek series. <br /> <br /> I think I have an Australian spin show doing it for me, Australia has for years eliminated high quality movies and Farscape is no exception. <br /> <br /> I have only seen the first four episodes in the UK and have a quality that makes every 45 minutes of the show (in the UK) more prominent than a movie in a weekly TV series. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> The episode I really have is "I, ET", that transforms the alien concept around Moya (a living ship, even a spacecraft is very characteristic) is forced to land on a planet that has not yet made a "first contact" and is surprisingly earthy and Crichton meets a radio telescope operator and * he is a "little green man" to them . In short, the effects are great, the scripts are top quality and the main characters (none of them are really more important than others) are interesting, not always "good" and well just great. <br /> <br /> Roll of the second season!
