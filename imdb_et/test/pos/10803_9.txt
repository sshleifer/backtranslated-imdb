This movie is more than a story about Danton. It was a joint production of French French that was filmed at the beginning of the end of the Soviet system. This is likely to have contributed to the movement of solidarity to the activities of the Union. It is more about Poland in the 20th century than the French Revolution. Solidarity began at the end of the system. This film itself is historical because it already exists .... the rest is history. <br /> <br /> Robspeer, aka. totalitarian leaders. Danton, aka. Wales. When watching a movie, remember the snowball that started in Poland. In fact, it may be useful to see superpower struggle under the only superpower.
