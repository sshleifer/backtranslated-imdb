In 2000 (remember, two years ago, not four) two men had the motivation to create the most wonderful piece of art on this side of Mississippi. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Jere Cunningham and Tom Flynn, the world can now enjoy the Second String, a delicious TV movie that represents the story of other heroes (hence the title) that has reached the thrust position in the order of bad oysters. <br /> <br /> Both director Robert Lieberman and the last minute QB, Dan of the Buffalo bill give "Hell" to Hell (depicted by Canadian actress Gil Bellows) as the ultimate Super Bowl snake -bitten Bills are in the final position. <br /> <br /> The intriguing blend of internal and external conflicts, the story of love, comraderie, that only a good sport of football can bring, and the general theory that the underscore compete, Second String is a great film that deserves to be viewed at every possible moment it will appear on TNT. <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be bad about this production is the spellman's name Jenifur Jarvis spell. <br /> <br />
