This is one of the best movies I've ever seen! How can anyone just capture my film with my imagination! First, the performances of Gooding and Harris were just remarkable, especially Gooding. This is the only way I will show you acting: remarkable! You have to imagine how difficult it would be to play and draw such a character; then you see Gooding and his performance was magical. As far as the plot is concerned, what is based on a real person goes where the lives of the characters go. For all, this may be a bit slow, but it is not a movie. I will definitely give this film 10. It deserves nothing less!
