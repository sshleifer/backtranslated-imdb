Warning, includes spoiler! <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Italian sleaze movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> The plot has a teenage girl who is interested in occultism and has supernatural powers. Her mother is a member of the Satanist group and is afraid of affecting her girl. No need to worry, the girl knows what to do and there is no return, she belongs to Satan .. <br /> </ a> During the movie a couple of things happen in a typical Italian, there is not too much logic, but this is just a good thing. how fun these movies are .. In the last battle we see him and his mother against each other (naked) and of course mysterious rituals, you might think who wins ... The final pictures of the movie leave the mouth open and wrong, why can't such movies get any more? <br /> <br /> The whole movie and the actors in this type of movie are pretty good, better than usual. Especially Anne Heywood looks and works good. glesid and other such things, so it's not boring boring. My rating is 10. <br /> <br /> Hopefully it will release it from the DVD.
