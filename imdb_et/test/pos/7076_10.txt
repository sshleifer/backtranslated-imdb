After letting one night out for another night, I've learned to respect my family and not take my health for granted. I've never seen a real picture of a cancer victim like Meryl. He deserves the Oscar nomination, but he has tough competitors. All I can say is a beautiful film that works great from Streep and Zellwegger. Meryl Streep discovered her a real ability in this great movie!
