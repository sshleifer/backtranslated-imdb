I rented Boogie Nights last week and I can tell you when I watched the movie. If you think it's porn when you watch a movie. I mean, if you are not a porn person who can not bother him if it is not a movie to see. But the thing is that the whole movie isn't really porn. Well, halfway through the movie, there is about the porn industry, but the other half is about the character and bad situations that these characters go through. Participants played perfectly there, especially Mark Wahlberg, John C. Reilly and William H. Macy. Sexual scenes are, of course, terrible, but mainly focus on the characters' jumps in porn movies until there is a fight. Great movie, one of the best! <br /> <br /> Hedian outlook: 10/10 **** A +
