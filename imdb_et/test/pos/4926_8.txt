I love this movie ... it can make me laugh! = ^ _ ^ = What's hard to do. This movie is one of the best cartoon adaptations. It does not distort signs like other movies there. Everyone is by nature and plays its role! <br /> <br /> The movie focuses on Buster and Babie, who come across the river (Buster's courtesy) to make Plucky go with Hamton (fun things), Elmyra, who runs around torturing animals (as usual) after Fifi's the autograph was shattered, and Shirley and Fowlmouth go to the movies. and Babs segmented so much though they had significant dialogue and jokes. I have to say that the parts of Plucky and Hampton 'Vacation' were the best! Hamton's family is HILARIOUS! I especially like Uncle Stinky. The Fifi hotel was also fun. I love this scene actress. : D <br /> <br /> Probably the most famous part of this movie, IMHO, is when Fowlmouth and Shirley are in the cinema ... LOL! You have to see it to evaluate it! And if Hamton and Plucky go through the tunnel to make a wish ... :) <br /> <br /> Although this movie moved slowly during the Buster / Babs parts, the rest is pure gold! I appreciate this movie 8/10. Show it to your children one day ... or even for adults - Watch this movie! You won't regret it.
