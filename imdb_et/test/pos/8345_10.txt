I am a college student and I bought this movie from a used bookstore because it looked very funny about the description of my back. Nothing would prepare me for what FUNNIEST MOVIE EVER MADE! <br /> <br /> It's especially good to see if you're an atheist like me. Because then you see how these Christian people are stupid. They seem to think that non-believers want to live in really nasty, dirty houses and do nothing but drink beer and be central to their neighbors. It's LAUGH RIOT! Watch this movie NOW! <br /> <br /> We hope that Rich Christiano will do more to attract us to the Gentiles!
