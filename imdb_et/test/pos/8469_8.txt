It was Day 1891 as Scottish inventor William K.L. Dickson surprised his boss, Thomas Alva Edison, with his remarkable work on film development. After several attempts, Dickson was now able to play scenes from his real life with his camera and play them back with his Kinetoscope, as the time fragment would remain in the celluloid. Soon, Dickson's Kinetoscope would become a huge new form of entertainment, as many people want to pay for the nickel accused of watching people dancing, or acrobats that perform tricks through the "peepshow" of Kinetoscope. However, the invention was not complete to allow the film to capture real life, as we know it, sound was needed in films. So Dickson was experimenting and this short test, Kinetophone's first film, was the result. <br /> <br /> In this experiment, "Dickson Experimental Sound Film" was directed by William K.L. Dickson is standing in front of a cylindrical recording cone (the earliest method of recording sound), with his violin playing a song called "The Bear Boy". The idea was to record the song in the cylinder while the camera recorded its movements. To show that this is a movie, Edison's two "Black Maria" labs decided to do a little dance in front of the camera. Unlike what Vito Russo stated in his book "Celluloid Closet", this dance had nothing to do with homosexuality, as it is obviously a reference to the environment of the loneliness of the laboratory, which is similar to a single sailor to whom "the song" the boys of the cab "dedicated (Russo suggests," Gay Brothers is actually anachronistic because "gay" was not a homosexual connotation at the end of the 1890s. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Dickson could not really create the synced audio with images, though he was in the picture. sound and celluloid cylinder, the synchronization of these two elements was not exactly effective, and the sudden appearance of Auguste and Louis Lumière's Cinémographe called Edison's team to focus on projection systems, and finally Dickson left the company. test as intended in the end, "Dickson Experimental Sound Film" could be heard with a synchronized sound as its creative inventor had anticipated. Although it was not a successful test, this outstanding film is a huge genius of Kinetoscope's father. 8/10
