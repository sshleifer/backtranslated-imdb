What a crazy movie! It takes 12 (!) Hours and you don't understand who these people are and what they do! The main piece is about a lot of helpless participants trying to bring the scene "Prometheus", but there are lots of sub-plots like Thomas and the missing boy who are looking for Monsieur Warok ... what does it all mean?
