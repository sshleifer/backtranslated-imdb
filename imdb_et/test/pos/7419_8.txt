This film has one of the best club scenes, a great soundtrack (if you like techno / trance music). <br /> <br /> Some situations (as the main character Carl starts taking drugs, for example) are a bit of a reality, but the plot is fun, but the characters are a bit small ... <br /> <br /> I don't recommend you see the movie if you don't like techno <br /> <br /> For plot / solo action, this movie is 4/10, where there are really cool special effects and club scenes and a soundtrack that is 7/10, but if you want to go to the movies to listen to nice stories and grab a little club feeling, it is 10/10. <br /> <br /> Special effects are sometimes hidden, sometimes clearly visible. (i.e. fast moving clouds / sun / moon, morping background, morping cuts) <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it very much, shame that there was no dance floor in the cinema;)
