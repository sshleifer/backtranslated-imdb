Another "must be" movie. Henry Brandon is your favorite! I was so surprised when I learned years ago that she was from Germany because she sounds and looks so usual in America! And wasn't he in "The Searchers" like Char Scar? !! Another of my favorites, I have it & again. Now that I could add it to my collection, it would change my day! It is a wonderful story of nature and film of all ages. The landscape is so beautiful and the difficult situation of endangered snowboarders is said to be so emotional that it is of interest to endangered species in all, especially children. If I could give a copy to all my sons and big sons!
