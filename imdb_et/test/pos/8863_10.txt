John Carpenter's The Thing is the hands that put down the best horror film ever made. Not only that, but also my personal favorite movies of all time. What makes the movie so big? It's hard to put my finger on it. Everything seems to work in The Thing, this is one of the rare cases where everything just seems to be in place. The film is even better than Alien to create some kind of atmospheric devil. The fact that it does not only concern gore (which is a great btw) but can create paranoia that is unbalanced in movies. A truly wonderful film that is worshiped by all horror fighters and everyone with a good film taste.
