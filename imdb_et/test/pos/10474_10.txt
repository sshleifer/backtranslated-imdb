Gentle story, angry hate with a redeeming message and a glorious party. Photography is wonderfully well done. Filmmakers watch such a movie to boost their craft not only for what the eye can do to improve the story, but what the correct camera vocabulary can do to boost emotion. Feeding the blame is by its very nature the address of the movie, but with the grace and the grace of the supply, which simply no longer happens, at least with such taste, restraint and finesse. If you care about story and character formation, it is also a great movie that can be seen, for example, what simple lines and proper delivery can do to fill a person's execution. All this with a movie point that is almost minimalist in nature and perfect, and you get that movie.
