I looked at it a second time today and I have to say with all my heart that the devil's time is a film about us as people who are not spiritual beings. Such a waste of human life, if it was a story, may be good for it. And Eric is hotter than ever. Often, the Primary People are considered to be non-everyday. We are always portrayed as chief or medical. Hey, we're like everyone else. And this movie just showed that. We hurt if injustice is done and we can win in the quest for justice. It's really bad that big movie companies don't see it. I can't wait until it appears on the DVD. Thanks to those who decided to show this story as it really was.
