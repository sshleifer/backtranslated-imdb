I recently bought Lost Horizon from eBay, which has special memories of things I wouldn't miss from childhood (I'm an ancient 29). I recently also completed the novel on which it is based. I was so pleasantly surprised to find a real hidden treasure. Excellent casting brings such warmth and depth to a beautifully simple and elegantly spoken story that has been exquisitely updated from the original film (and now a rather distinct entity for much more intellectual and thoughtful James Hilton book). Particularly Sally Kellerman has a bright presence as the suicidal neurotic Sally Hughes, who gradually heats Shangri-La's charms. Only Liv Ullmann learns in his teacher's wood image (a role that is much more suited to Julie Andrews type. The fact that Finch, Ullmann and Hussey are dubbed is not important because it's almost impossible to say. Songs DO different quality, music is much better as lyrics, but it is still a lively and appealing movie that really deserves the right DVD release and much more appreciation.
