Enjoy this frenzied spectacle at every moment to match music (Mahler's fifth is gorgeous, but listen to the vocal part of the 3rd Symphony, which was so beautifully used in this film). There are many aspects to this film, but the main theme is the powerful force of beauty, its spontaneous character, the lack of logic of love and adoration. I am also a terrible fan of Bogarde and I believe he was rarely wonderful (try him as a "servant"). Note: I recommend multiple views.
