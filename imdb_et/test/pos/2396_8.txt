No doubt indie flick Eddie Monroe is one of the best independent films I've seen for a long time. For me, Paul Vario's performance was highlighted. I first saw Paul or "Big Paulie" when he was called Danny Provenzano's hit indie, "This Thing Of Our". Fortunately, Eddie Monroe's filmmaker (s) did the same and used Paul's indisputable skills in principle (basically). Out came a performance (camera and voice) that shows the role of a large budget studio in the near future. It is refreshing to see a trained actor who is committed to commerce to prove to the public the same. Keep up the good work with Big Paulie and see you soon in Hollywood! Not a bad Canarsie boy?
