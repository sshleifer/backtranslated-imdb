Greta Garbo's letters "Anna Christie", very early in the 1930s MGM 'talkie', for the first time "Garbo Talks". Anna Christie is a powerful film, but not for everyone. The film is filmed as stage, short and cinematographic, long dialogue and dramatic characterizations. Eugene O'Neil, who wrote "Anna Christie", is known for her dark work and Garbo's Anna Anna Christie is a tiny, tortured past. <br /> <br /> The sound quality of the DVD was mediocre. It does not help that George F. Marion, who plays Anna's stranger father Chris Christofferson, is difficult to understand verbally. Marion gives a good result as the old drunken sailors torturing the madness of the evil fucking sea. But his dialogue has been written with a very heavy Swedish accent, this is true for O'Neils' original game. Similarly, it is difficult to understand Marie Dressler's dialogue as Marthy Owens. Dressler depicts the disintegration of incredibly old drunken women, the "maraud". His dialogue is also true of O'Neils' original game, such as Charles Bickford as Irish sailors, Matt Burke, who is dealing with Anna in a difficult relationship. Garbo is actually the easiest to understand. <br /> <br /> Greta Garbo is the strong point of films. He is the victim of failure and abuse of intestinal intake, leading to prostitution life. Garbo was a huge star at that time and was one of Hollywood's most beautiful women. Here his appearance is not glamorous, it is tortured. His posture has almost doubled in torment. She scratches her face to get a pathetic creature on the screen. Garbo transmits these troubled feelings to the viewer to convince us of his misery. <br /> <br /> This is a dark topic and Garbo brings it to life. It's not an easy price, not fun, not for everyone. "Anna Christie" is deep emotions deepened for deep research, this is one gentle ride.
