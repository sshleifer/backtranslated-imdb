Hollywood is one of the best and most beautiful things that have happened in my life. I admire and am very excited about how Hollywood creates ideas and applies them. It makes me think about the extent of the human brain. I saw Flatlins back a long time, but the story, direction, cast, and all acting are still fresh in my mind. The story begins with our actor Sutherland, saying at the time of sunrise, "what a beautiful day to die." For all of us, this is a story that shows the emotions that are sometimes held in our lives. You never understand some things in life. This shows us how to improve our motivation and quality of life. Anyway I recommend it to anyone who watches it once.
