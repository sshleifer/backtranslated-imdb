Nightbreed blew my mind the first time I saw it. And it is quite good over the years. Sets and Monster Effects work, some of the best I've ever seen. Someone I know did not see this movie, which I believe was not terrible in the early 90s, because it is interesting. It plays like a dark, terrible fairy tale, and it is much deeper, you think with a strong message against bigotry by Clive Barker, a rich mystical past. What sucks is the end of the movie, which is really a cool sequel to the comment that we probably never see. My only small handle is that Craig Sheffer is at best only a satisfying actor and the project could have participated with a better actor. Just a little complaint, as Sheffer is fine. I had a similar problem with Scott Bakula in the Barker Illusion Lord, not a really terrible performance, but I just didn't like him in that role if I had other people.
