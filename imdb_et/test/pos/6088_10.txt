Count Laszlo (Ralph Fiennes) has recently been transferred to an Italian hospital during World War II. He's burning terribly. His sister Hana (Juliette Binoche) is inclined to her, body and mind because she rightly fears that she can be a very restless soul. During the maintenance, Count Hanna begins to talk about her recent past. He seems to have worked in Africa in a government that met Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Although they tried to avoid each other, they fell in love. After a short thing, Katherine called it out, leaving the count empty. Nonetheless, they would meet twice in the heartfelt circumstances. Meanwhile, Hana himself falls to the British bombshell Sihk-man. But the war rushes steadily. Does love exist when the world is confused? This is a huge movie based on an equally fine but complex novel. The plot has many stories that are beautifully woven, each of which has not been described. The script itself is elegant and contains many memorable features. Fiennes is great, both as a burnt offering and as a man who thought that love was a myth. Scott Thomas is also pretty good as a woman fighting for her passions. As for Binoche, he earned a wealth of Oscar that he had been given because his sister is a hopeless example of a hopeless situation. The landscape is absolutely proud, as are costumes, direction and production. If you've missed this movie, fix it soon. The English patient has been one of the greatest achievements of the film over the centuries.
