I had no expectations (never saw the "Marigold" previews) and enjoyed it in the movie characters, contemporary music and dancing. Although 98% of the dialogue is English (a big deal for me), I would like the DVD to have subtitles to help with some quick moments when the character's accent may be difficult to understand. I wouldn't appreciate this movie for Bollywood films, but just for my own interests, such as fun entertainment (a musical movie). <br /> <br /> I am an actor for Ali Larter (and his interview bonus material shows he is a nice person). I've been watching this movie several times (better every time).
