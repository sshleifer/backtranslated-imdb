I really loved seeing this movie. I think this is an excellent, undervalued film by Alfred Hitchcock. Everyone is familiar with the scene of the famous freedom column, but before that, it's really a great movie. Robert Cummings is great if I think his biggest role is, and Priscilla Lane is beautiful, she also has a lot of talent. But I think Norman Lloyd will give the best result. His character, Fry, is both evil and angry. Even if he's not that long, the film wouldn't be the same without him. <br /> <br /> "Saboteur" is a great movie that every Hitchcock fan should see. I'll give 10 out of 10!
