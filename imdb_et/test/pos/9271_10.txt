So completely unique and fun! Another excellent Canadian invention. Regular "Joe" (Dan) and a number of misleading crimes (also known as Puppets) all divide their residence halfway. Dan's task is to keep track of four threats to society and help them recover. Bill, Homicidal Dummy, Rocko Cigarette Smoking Dog, Buttons, Nympho Teddy Bear and Cuddles Comfort Doll. Five of them are in all strange conditions. Despite their killing and often publicly perverse sexual tendencies, it is difficult not to love them. Canadian pride that makes me proud.
