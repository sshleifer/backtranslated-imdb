This film strikes the heart as something I haven't seen. It shows what we, in a democratic society, take for granted, and just what we do not have the good fortune. Acting in a movie is great, sometimes you have to remind yourself that film is dramatizing, not real life. Mr. Rickman works wonders with his role (as he performs all roles), making the interrogator fully human and human. The set is incredible. It gives a "round" theater lesson that does not add or take action against emotions. This film tries to open the eyes of the viewer and I would say they have achieved this goal.
