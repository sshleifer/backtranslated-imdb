This movie is my family's favorite Christmas movie because it is a beautiful picture of what Christmas really touches. These days, in the big city I hate, I love watching movies of the life I've always dreamed of. The city in which this film is set up is my dream, which I am always in life, which I have always wanted, and the true sense of community that is lost in today's society. I no longer know the true spirit of Christmas, but watching this movie helps to find that feeling again. My family recorded this movie a long time ago on TV and now our copy is worn out so I really would like to buy some copies of my DVD for my family and me if someone could tell me where I can buy some copies, please just post the info here and I keep checking. Thank you.
