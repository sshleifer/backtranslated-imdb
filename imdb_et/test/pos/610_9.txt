Mikio Naruse is studying the wonderful character of three idle, constantly complaining, single ex-geishas in post-war Japan. They were friends in the old days, but now their relationship is tense because one of the women has become a successful financier and the other two are in debt. Although the money-restorer is the only one who has succeeded in this reconstruction economy, he is the only one of the three children without children. The other two have a child they depend on income because neither of them works. Complications arise when children decide to marry (though not to each other) and leave home. It brings bitter and crumbling older women who are getting bitter and sad, drunk and amazed by their rotten children and their disgruntled friends. In the meantime, the money itself is unhappy despite its accidents. He has no one besides his young deaf servant to keep his company and occasional meetings with two former lovers of his geisha days, where they are not. These three characters are in the bundle of their eternal life, and they are all too tired to fight much, usually choosing instead of leaving its unsteadiness or, most of all, throwing complaints back and forth. <br /> <br /> "Late Chrysanthemums" are moving very slowly and not really happening, but Narus, like all the great leaders, is able to do very little. I haven't seen much of my work, but I suspect it's not the best, even though it's very good. I think the problem is that it doesn't seem to be much. But the movie is full of good points. Although it is cynical, it is not too. Naru seems to despair in his despair, and he paints bright portraits that make the characters even feel superb in their confident misery. Although the film is not a must-have, it is important that it is a very little known (outside your home country) director's work fragment, from which small ones are available in the US.
