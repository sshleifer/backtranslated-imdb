I love this movie! Evil Dead has nothing on this movie! Demons 2 and 3 are the perfect festival, but it's classic. It's super cheesy and the actor is at best well, but what else could you be in the 80s horror movie? Stoogel has some of the best single-liners that will ever hit the screen in it. Many people talk about the lipstick scene in this movie, but my personal favorite is the end, unfortunately he has nothing to do with the main characters when the old man eats his left-hand Halloween apple pie, and his cucumber is inside out. The soundtrack is fantastic. The scene of Angela's dance is absolutely horrible, especially after the light comes on and you see how she jumps from one part of the floor to another when each sound of the camera shutter clicks on the song being played. The make-up effect of this movie is pretty sweet; Angela gave me nightmares as a child. If you are a person who demands perfection out of your film experience, you might want to give it. But if you are like me and you really drool over Halloween, the house is haunted by clich√©s of demons, it is definitely a must.
