It took some time to find this movie because they don't have it on the DVD (and my video recorder has not yet tried it again). I think all the references to drug use are too many for some people. But I found a good bootleg for eBay and I have to say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously has just slowed down. This is "Airplane" vein fraud. I have to say that when I looked at it in Showtime or Spotlight in the 80s, I enjoyed more humor than I do now. But it's definitely worth a look to see what they (i.e. filmmakers) got before "Just Say No" hypocrites triggered their propaganda. sing ... "We Are All Drugs" hahaha This is a silly movie and worth $ 10, which I paid for on eBay to just get it on a DVD. What are you high?
