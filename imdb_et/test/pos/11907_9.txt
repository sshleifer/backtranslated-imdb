I think it was a pretty good movie. This shows how someone grew up in an environment that has created a rich and powerful person, but unfortunately, because of his ambitions and the people around him, he led him to destruction. This shows that you cannot trust anyone, especially in a world that carries a lot of money and envy. The sign I liked most was Sebeva. He was another ambitious, powerful and merciless woman in a man's world who loved and honored Kilo. He also knew that the business was business and dangerous. Everything she did was risky but got a job. He helped Kilol get rich by his connections. In general, I liked this movie and I have it in my collection and look forward to El Padrino 2.
