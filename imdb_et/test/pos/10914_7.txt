Hollywood movies since the 1930s have been gays as leprosy. In the condemnation of homosexuality, the film industry has only reflected what its repressive society expressed as ideology. For example, in the 1962 Otto Preminger Melodrama "Advise and Accept" was cast directly by actor Don Murray, who committed suicide rather than admitting his alternative lifestyle. Gay movie characters have dealt with a lot of land "Advise and Accept". In 1997, "In & Out" (** 1/2 out of ****), the heterosexual actor Kevin Kline is dismissed as a homosexual teacher who comes out of the closet on his wedding day. If last year's conservative Hollywood foresaw that the "Counseling and Consent" congress had to commit suicide, today's liberal Hollywood states that an English teacher should embrace rather than maced. <br /> <br /> In principle, In & Out proclaims good citizenship in politically correct comedy. Director Frank Oz and scriptwriter Scott Rudnick support honesty as the best policy because honesty always brings happiness. High School Teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline, "The Big Chill") is happy only after he has come out of the closet, just as his one-time-but-now-thin-groom Emily (Joan Cusack) feels happy only he can diet drape. Ultimately, the film claims that straight society accepts gays when homosexual people can act with greater honesty and honesty. The report by happily outward straight actor Tom Sellec plays dramatic drama with open thinking. <br /> <br /> Rudnick's lightweight script beautifies the real life story that Oscars had when Tom Hanks honored a high school teacher. "In & Out", Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), blonde, Brad Pitt-style bimbo-type actor, wins the Oscar to invite a fertile foot soldier. Drake recognizes his mentor Howard Bracket during his reception. Do not claim to stay there, honest Cameron shows a lively, television participant that Howard is gay! Doubt, paranoia and the horror that has been placed in the media fall under Indiana's green Leaf town. (When would the sexual deviation of a high school English teacher be called such a mass media question?) Among those reporters who talk about Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck, "High Road to China"), and he wants to make weekend exclusive Howard. But Howard doesn't want to do anything with the witch hunting media, especially the irritating Peter Malloy. Howard denies Drake's accusations to everyone, including his groom and mother. Malloy complains because he smells like a spoon. Revelation has become a green page upside down. Tom Halliwell (Bob Newhart), head of high school, is nervous about all media coverage. Halliwell warns Howard that his marriage is not immediate, he must give him a pink slip. Meanwhile, Peter Howard bets that his marriage to Emil falls at the last minute and he will be in the camera to record the result. <br /> <br /> Howard Men's Massage Cassettes for Massage Cards. He is trying to reform himself. But Howard's efforts are pointless. The fault swells inside. And then, Peter Malloy, who kidnaps him to come out of his homosexuality. Finally, Howard's eyes break from under the altar. Of course, the bride-to-be Emily Montgomery is founded by Howard's gay confession. It is expected that the school will shoot Howard, but he will appear to finish. Drake also appears and rushes to Bracket. The school has not only lost Howard for his work, but has also given his year's teacher a prize. Drake turns to the principal and wins the unanimous support of the Howard community. <br /> <br /> The biggest shortcoming of Rudnick's script is Howard himself. Rudnick has created this to be the right standard, either gray or straight. Howard Brackett speaks more of a saint than a sinner. He helps one student to access the college and supervises the team. How often do you hear an English teacher doubling as a coach? Everyone in their high school loves Howard. She has no average bones in her body. Next, Rudnick and Oz ask to believe that no other Green Leaf is gay. Where are Howard's gay friends? Are they afraid of too much protection? No, In & Out is not strictly targeted at homosexual target groups. Oz, whose screen credit includes cute comedies such as "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" and "House Sitter", as well as Rudnick's Teter on a politically correct string. "In & Out" is not a gay recruiting film. Filmmakers are not interested in what Howard or Peter Malloy suggested to prefer gay lifestyle. Instead, Oz and Rudnick are only interested in a thin assumption: is he or not he is gay? They respond to this by responding to a community response. Finally, when Howard admits that he is gay, filmmakers dedicate the rest of the films to show how conservative Norman Rockwell's city accepts it despite the difference. <br /> <br /> The most shocking scenes of In & Out are probably when the tabloid reporter Malloy makes a Howard lipstick. Straight guys who can shoot each other on the homosexual identity crisis are as much fun as fake. Kline and Selleck grind their face What seems to be the main collision rather than the closed mouth. Something like the contradictory but painstaking piece of social propaganda that appears normal in the contradictory British film "Priest", "In & Out" of 1994, when "Ellen" was not TV equivalents, then "In & Out" would probably be a new sitcom towards the TV. "In & Out" is not about dealing with a gay or straightforward question but how to be a decent person in the last days of the 20th century. â€œComedy that is acceptable for sexual intolerance, is the joy of its equal opportunities and the rivals and bulls.
