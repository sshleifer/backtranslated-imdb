I've been waiting for 30 years to see this movie. I played the soundtrack album for the teenager and my 20s. Recently I found a dvdr at a reasonable price and I watched it this morning. It was on a widescreen, probably even in 70mm print, stereo, the colors were pretty good, very little blinking, certainly not remastered, but I'm very happy with the very copy. <br /> <br /> Now for the movie. That's pretty good. I wouldn't say it is great, although it has great scenes. Maybe Premminger may not be the right director, but I say that. For me, the middle of the movie was a hurricane scene. Premiere performance by Premminger. One of the biggest weather conditions all the time. In fact, I would go so far as to say that acting scenes are better than musical scenes, not that musical sequences are bad. Not at all. They had nothing. Perhaps it was a fact that there were no close-ups and very little average frames. It was almost like watching the production of the production. Perhaps it was the feeling that Premminger went after. In the end, it may not be the right choice, but it does. This is by no means a destroyed film. <br /> <br /> Having said that, not all the singers of the audio track love it either. I always have. They are ideal for this movie. I love the voices of the song. The participants who are sinking are mostly excellent. I just want the songs to be more staged. Sportin 'Life's two numbers are good, but intimate numbers don't even feel intimate. They just know ... far. However, you cannot deny the power of music. And finally, that's what's coming out loud and clear. Once again, perhaps Premminger had to try to stay on the path of unsuccessful music with which he worked. I believe he had the right idea, but maybe it went too far in this direction. <br /> <br /> Actress is terrible. The top ghost goes to the great Brock Peters, who acts and sings the Crown part. He's the ultimate mishny. We want him to leave the poor Bess alone and he's not. As proud, arrogant and disgusting as he is, Sammy Davis Jr's classic Sportin Life transfer is slippery devil himself and very charismatic. Davis is arguably the best film. Poor Bess just can't handle two bad things. I'm glad Hermes Pan gave Davis a dance number. <br /> <br /> Dandridge and Poitier, allegedly not affected by the film, are really very sweet. I don't know chemistry ... there were more chemistry between Dandridge and Peter than between Dandridge and Poitier. However, it worked for Dorothy and Sidney. <br /> <br /> However, I think both have to be proud of the work done with this movie. I managed to catch more than one tear in my eyes. Their characterization is very 3D and plausible. However, Sidney Poitieri Porgy seems almost inappropriate in the usual line. I couldn't think he was Mr Braithwaite's "To Sir with Love", highly educated and with a good visa and talked about falling in difficult times. Probably not my first choice for Porgyi, but hey, he was a big star at that time, so why not? Dorothy's Bess was as perfect as her Carmen Jones, actually even more vulnerable. Carmen was probably a brighter part for him. <br /> <br /> A very good movie indeed is two seals, which I would call classics. It just doesn't give the classical class. However, there is no ground on the ground why Gershwin real estate has decided to keep this beautiful movie even for all its mistakes that are hidden from the public. The premiere may be some strange choices as a director, but the film is not ashamed or ashamed of someone involved in it. That's what it is and there are many worse movies that are embarrassing on DVDs and theaters today. Porgy and Bess are not one of them.
