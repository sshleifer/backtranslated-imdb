I was going to think about it, thinking about the other harsh humor. Speaking of my first sentence, I don't like humor and this movie in moments, but I loved it. Justin Long has never done such a comedy where he is sarcastic and smart and I loved it. Lewis Black ... said enough. The end I really loved because it had to take me seriously, I mean, how else would you end it? Yes, this is another story of the underworld, but not in your typical form and film was not their ups and downs, but people came together for a common goal, go to college where they were accepted. The cast was amazing and yes I laughed loudly when I didn't think I wanted and laughter lasted longer than I thought. The parents and the sister played well, but their characters were placed if necessary. The film didn't focus on them, but at the same time they showed how to wait and not wait for them. They played the story very well, and I loved the familiar face of Anthony Heald (Boston Public), Jeremy Howard (I) (Galaxy Quest with Justin Long) Ross Patterson (The New Guy) and Sam Horrigani (Brink). Blake Lively added to her a movie that made it even more enjoyable, as well as B's friends. I recommend this movie to anyone who hated comedies of the last four years and really wants something humor and actually a story! ~!
