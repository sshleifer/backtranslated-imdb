Mishima - in the four chapters of life, I think the best is Paul Schrader today. Mesmorizing film art with Philip Glass's mysterious musical score added a completely magical aura to one of Japan's greatest novels, whose originality and picturesque narrative is beautifully depicted in this picture. Like any talented character, Mishima was worried about serious self-conflict, the main one being the conflict between "pencil and sword" because the director put it in his last chapter or in a fight against a sensitive poet and homosexual feelings in a famously male society with centuries of warrior traditions, thus increasing the gap Mishima's own sensitive and military traditional side. <br /> <br /> All Schrader's films (and the ones he wrote) are basically stories of the Human Conflict that does not belong to his living environment. This is also true of Mishima, who has grown up with love for theater and words besides raising Japanese military schools. His death consisted of both key elements in his life, that of the ending of words and theater in a lifetime game. Such a film will take place over a long period of time, and most will have to wait for that beauty. 20 out of 10 !!
