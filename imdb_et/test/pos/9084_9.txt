A film showing the unrest of modern men and women in the face of death. We are beyond religious belief in the afterlife, and whatever else is hell or heaven. Religion is declared dead. But people are more obsessed with death than ever before, especially since we can push it away for a long time. What's more, the scientific and technological development of our society leads us to believe that we can explain everything, know everything and do everything. It was quite typical at the end of the 20th century. Things are changing today, especially when US President Barack Obama talks to journalists about finding the truth in the public speech and, of course, qualifies this truth as relative, because it is more of an aspiration than a final end, goal or achievement. The film shows the end of a good old metaphysical thinking that began to become obsessed with the truth, an obsessive idea that the truth was unique and irrevocably achievable. Postmodernism had not yet reached Hollywood, although today it seems to have reached the White House. So some young doctors and nurses decide to die and come back. Technically this is possible, but the result is not surprising. It reactivates the old feelings of guilt and the disappointments that were buried in the subconscious. One is related to drug addiction to his father's Vietnamese veteran who commits suicide, another young boy, some of whom had died stoned, another young black girl who had been victimized and bullied at high school for racism, sexism and hatred not afraid of his harsh. It's so naive that you might be ashamed of those young adults who are highly qualified and behave like kids crying for their bottles. But the film is interesting, but something quite different. Setting up and shooting some details and every detail or treating is a baroque, sick, decadent, pretty-styled "Death in Venice" or Greenaway, or any other piece of art that deals with making friends with the main enemy. death is. Of course, it does not save the film, but at least what is worth it. <br /> <br /> Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University of Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID
