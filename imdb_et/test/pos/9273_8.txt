A refreshing interview with the legendary Italian cinematographer-producer, who died in 1999 with nearly 200 characteristics as his leader. Much is spent on D'Amato's soft sex movies, including her notorious EMANUELLE entries with Laura Gemser. They also briefly cover their pornography career, which keeps it on the surface for the last decade. What is more interesting to me is what focuses on his horror and pursuit of action. D'Amato has a lot of great anecdotes about actors and his little budget film making, including the story of an assistant accidentally collecting real bones in the midst of forgery in the 2000-year catacomb. Other interviewees are George Eastman and Al Cliver. I would have liked to have a little more conversation about my Stateide Filmirage productions (no question about TROLL 2; it wasn't a movie, it was now).
