I admit I've been a fan of Harrison Ford for several years, so it didn't surprise me that I enjoyed his activities here. But I also liked how the story develops and thought the casting was well done. I don't know if I "buy" Kristin Scott Thomas as a congressman, but he is a good actor and a beautiful woman. I noticed him on the first possible mission Impossible. Although his part was small, he stayed on the screen. <br /> <br /> Here, he and the Ford people, whose spouses die in an airplane accident. They sit together and this is where the plot gets. Apparently Ford, the police detective Wash D.C., finds that his wife had a thing. He also discovered that he was the wife of New England Congresswoman. <br /> <br /> The story takes a lot of subpages, like Ford and Thomas find themselves with revelations of marriage, deception, and pure grief and anger over the loss of a loved one. <br /> <br /> I think the film is useful for renting or catching a cable.
