It's a hard movie to watch and it would have been even more difficult if I knew that the actor who played the main character was killed by the police at home at the age of 19. has been caught in an attack triggered by a murder in which he did not participate. He is committed to a juvenile prison where he knows the cruelty and exploitation that ordinary citizens believe there is. When he finally flees, he and the three comrades will survive the only thing they know is a crime. What makes the film so heart-shaped is that both Pixote and the actor showing him do not want to be clearly in the characters' living conditions. Pixote tries to trust and love and bind, but in his world there is no room for the delicate side of human nature. One stays at the end who desperately wants to do something for the world for Pixotide, but what? Building larger-sized children's prisons is definitely not the answer ...
