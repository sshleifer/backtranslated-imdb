Some people think it was quite a bad TV series with cheese. (given that it was filmed from 1977 to 1979), but really, look at those years ago and think, "We didn't have a computer then." So when you think about it, it's a pretty good TV show. <br /> <br /> I thought the bad ratings killed the show, but not. network. they canceled their topic as a "superhero network" and abandoned the short life spider-man series. if it had gone on, it would probably have been well in the 80s, and if it was really happy (And I mean really happy) in the early 90s. <br /> <br /> And no one wanted to choose this series Anyway, Jolly old (or young) Nicholas Hammond, the celebrity sound of music, is brought to the TV screen as a Peter Parker, an astonishing spider's secret identity. Peter is dealing with a clone, a beautiful foreign country and a corrupt politician. <br /> <br /> when the series is out of line (that is, Peter has already graduated from university and it's when he arrives a bit and Uncle Ben is already dead) the audience is treated with action, relationship and attitude, what the characters have about the peter and his alter ego, the spider-man. <br /> <br /> It is also a little disappointing that Robert. F Simon doesn't see anything like JJJameson, it's not that disappointing that Betty's scholarship is not a Betty scholarship, but a hot African-American girl (who reminds me of Halle berries, one of the hottest women on the planet), really, this one wasn't so bad. <br /> <br /> But given the time and the amount of drama they offered in it, this is what is bad for TV today. in either case it is entertaining even today. <br /> <br /> 8/10
