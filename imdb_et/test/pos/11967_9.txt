"East Side Story" is a musical comedy in Stalinist Russia and later in Eastern European satellite comedies with many films and comments from survivors. Although some Stalinist films look ridiculously bad (Bright Road (?), What is a remarkable exception), the sixties films look pretty good. "My husband wants to sing", "White Mouse" and "Midnight Revue" look particularly interesting. Manufacturers had to fight with censors who had the right to decide what was politically correct, which led to some confusion, retrospectively humorous, because the people whom the censors were trying to calm down were the people who supported the movie starts! Because musical comedies were quite rare behind the Iron Curtain - forty years, they had a disproportionate impact on their audience, who made some of the bigger hits. <br /> <br /> I note that the sound of sixties movies was much better. Directors often had to make outdated equipment and strict power standards - they had to shoot for seven minutes or less - and dangerous officicrati. <br /> <br /> I also note that the "West Side Story" seems to have had a strong impact on the "hot summer". Later, the movies may not be measured up to "Singin" in the rain, "but they look like they beat Hell" Bye Bye Birdy "
