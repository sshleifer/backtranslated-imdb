The fact that this film was shown at Barbican in London suggests to me that the print must be sufficiently acceptable for such an exhibition. Now the question is, why isn't this a long lost and important movie available on DVD (or even VHS)? A lot of people in Europe and the United States have been hoping to see this movie for many years, if not for any other reason than the wonderful music written by Sergei Prokofiev. What do you need to do to get such a wonderful product as it is available to the general public, not just to the Barbican patrons in London? Having been committed to listening to Prokofiev's music for years, and being aware of this film, PLEASE, someone “makes it there” and takes it out to the DVD.
