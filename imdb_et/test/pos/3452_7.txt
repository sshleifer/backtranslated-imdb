This film is preceded by Australian Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert, and its impact on them is evident in dialogue, places, photography, directions and political philosophy. Photography is especially sure. The direction is stylish and mostly well done. If you liked Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir, and George Miller's early Australian films, then you will love "Oz". The direction also resembles Edgar Wright's reviewer of contemporary work. This similarity suggests that "Oz" was far from its time. The critics of 1967 hated it and the public stayed away - the 1960s Australia, like the 1940s in the US, was in some ways a place where compliance was important, while this film is very different from what the viewers would have expected, especially after read it. advertising posters. This film is probably more of an interest to today's audience: it is still awkward and self-conscious, but in today's European way, not the 1960s Australian way. Joy Dunstan (who later appeared in the Australian TV series "Prisoner") plays his role with less raw passion than his modern Jack Weaver could have done, instead of Dunston's character in this film giving some Australian women, most well-known Kylie Minogue played by Charlene Mitchell Australian TV Series Neighbors and further developed their career in later roles. Men also enjoy this film, which introduces different male issues differently than most other films from the US or even Australia in the mid-sixties. Especially central and central Bruce Spence (who later played Tion Medon's "Star Wars III", "Matrix" movie-trainer and "Road Warrior" and "Thunderdome" in the movie chopperpilot). a permanent role that firmly supports the rest. This film is remarkable for Bruce Spence alone. 7/10 for some minor consistency issues.
