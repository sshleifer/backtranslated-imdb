This film has been raised for Cornish and the history of tin mining. It has been filmed in and around Cornwall, showing the story of two of your children in the mine with a group of miners. <br /> <br /> The title "Haunters" refers to "Spriggins" - the ghosts of miners who live in a mine and claim they bring evil to every mine there. The events take place with the American desire to invest in local tin mining, but when the young local boy Josh is bothered by a young boy's ghost, he and his American "girlfriend" tried to unravel the mystery of his death, saving himself and several miners from almost certain death when a new shaft was opened and Spiggins rescues them. <br /> <br /> Top movie, though small budget and short, but it's worth checking out if you're from Cornwall and / or tin mining!
