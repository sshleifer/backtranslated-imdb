I saw this movie when I was very young in Texas, Texas. I really enjoyed this movie and I wrote to Jean Peters in Hollywood and I told him how much I enjoyed him in this movie. He sent me an autographed photo. The film was directed by Jacques Tourneur and starring Jean Peters. He also celebrates Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget and Herbert Marshall. It appeared in 1951 and is 81 minutes long. Jean Peters was married to Howard Hughes. He also played "Viva Zapata" with Marlon Brando, Anthony Quinn, who won the Oscar to play the role of Zapata's brother (Marlon Brando celebrated Zapatana) (1952). And he also played "Capile from Castile" (1947) with Tyron Power. Since then, I've been trying to find a place where it's available, but so far I haven't been successful. Does anyone have suggestions on where to find and buy this movie? This comment contains a spoiler, I don't know.
