Well, I have to say I was able to see this show in Philadelphia, PA sometimes on June 6th. And I really loved it all the time as a favorite of Madonna's appearance in the 1990's Blond Ambition Trip. That's MADONNA for me. "Let's say he's a 3-year-old mother, she has to change some things to make her fit. And I'm totally in agreement. It's a classic Madonna concert. In 911 we see a woman on the cross ... somehow looking forward to seeing this tour on the DVD and I hope it is an all-in-one transmission and with a lot of bonus materials all the time.the best there ... and still up and going strong.Long live MADONNA!
