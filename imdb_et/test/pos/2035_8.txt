ROCK STAR is a well-told Hollywood-style story based on the fact that Ripper became Rob Halford's replacement Judas Priest. Mark Wahlberg poured his delightful boy-charm and made an incredible admiration that he has known to have done since the release of BOOGIE NIGHTS. <br /> <br /> Stephen Herek, who is not a stranger to music-related films, takes the audience through a dead-end, hair-stone stone, the miraculous way of life of gods. Wahlberg's "Izzy" acts as the host of the film, playing forever, who can see their desire. His pleasant character quickly gets to the heart of the viewer who wants to see him, and gets the opportunity to give him a metal "goat horn" several times. <br /> <br /> The only real complaint about the story is that the supporting light, namely the other members of the band, was not specified or even properly presented. Greater interaction with their lifelong Rock musicians would have amplified and strengthened Izzy's new surroundings. Of course, ROCK STAR is full of good music. Rabin Score, Steel Dragon's original work and many 80's-style Metal welds make this sound-black! We all hope that films such as ROCK STAR will not only give credibility to the style of music that helped to define the generation, but will also bring about the much needed recovery.
