The Sharp Breakdown of Family Values ​​and Human Dignity Following Soviet Communism Vasili Pichul's 1988 Vera Vera is a landmark of modern Russian cinema. Pichul's brutal drama marks a strong departure from the images of sanitary idealisms advocated in Soviet times (as in Alexandrov's circus), moving his social loss of time openly. The modern Ukrainian language further strengthens the influence, first of all the timelessness of the film, the use of what is not only the anti-identity instead of the Soviet system, but also Vera, the character of the film and the protagonist of the Russian idiom, is a rebellious young girl with "dysfunctional" family, including hard drinking with father and mother care. Rejecting her, beau Andrei wants her to begin with Vera's destructive (and mostly sexual) relationship with a college student named Sergei. Regardless of his parents' sloth with Sergey and despite Sergey's rude contempt for his parents, he is moving into his narrow apartment. Tensions are increasing until Vera's father drunk Sergei. Vera must decide whether she will remain loyal to her intolerable family, recognizing that her father has acted in self-defense or continues to support and protect isolated Sergey. <br /> <br /> Almost every unimaginable, unimaginable, Vera masterfully and after the collapse of communism, retains the inevitable space left in social life. The film's sexual aggression (this was the first film that showed explicit sex) along with the unequal presentation of social reality (the demanding distinction of Stalin from socialist realism) met the conditions of the former Soviet life. But the most interesting was the public reception. Although many wrote banners for the director and star, the film was very popular. Here, the double nature of "film as social criticism" appears: if it is done correctly, it makes the audience uncomfortable. Since no simple solution is provided, some viewers hate film and filmmakers to "raise" the problem. Many movies come to mind in this sense, somewhat comparable: the children of Larry Clark, Harmony Korine's Gummo, even a popular film, such as the John Hughes breakfast club. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to those viewers who have almost two hours of lack of domestic conflict and social miasma. The film is absolutely beautiful and extremely complicated. Despite the difficulties in watching the movie, some moments inside it are very beautiful. Of course, the socio-historical and cultural importance of the film cannot be ignored and, in fact, the film is made even more solid.
