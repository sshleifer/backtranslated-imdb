Three words: a work of art. This movie is just great. At the same time, it is beautiful, sad, scary and thoughtful. The result remains constant in my head, the actress is a wonderful and at the same time admirable landscape. <br /> <br /> It was more like a coincidence that I saw this movie. At that time, I decided to watch this movie. I was just bored and read Asian film lists that might be good. Well, I saw the title "Two Sisters Story" that sounded very interesting. Then I read the plot summary and decided: â€œYou don't look at this movie, you have to buy it. Said said. I bought this movie and was hooked from the first minute. <br /> <br /> The plot kept me interesting from start to finish; the twist at the end of the film made me scream. I really didn't see anything like that. And the end scene made me cry ... it just made me cry. It was so sad. <br /> <br /> Well, I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a movie that combines an interesting plot with scary scenes and atmosphere. Although you should know that the end, as I have already mentioned, is very sad. But it just fits the mood of the movie, isn't it?
