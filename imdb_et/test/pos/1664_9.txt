I wanted to see it because my French teacher suggested it to me over forty years ago. Maybe you should wait a long time because the Criterion Collection DVD recovery is impressive. <br /> <br /> In this movie, this movie follows a time-consuming script. , they're happening, a small seemingly irrelevant event leads to the end of everyone. Although heist film is a transmission, it is quite early and ultimately not at the heart of the film. This film separates itself from a typical hymn, giving us an overview of the characters and their motivations - as much as drama like a thriller. Relationships play a big role and robbery is abducted, giving us two films for one price. <br /> <br /> John Servais plays the idea of ​​a man Tony le Stéphano (always referred to as "le Stéphano"), a world-wide fatigue he could just have quit from Camus. Tony has just come out of prison recently and prevents crime from returning to life until she has a very unpleasant relationship with her former lover (who has taken another man), where she punishes her physically. Fortunately, this scene comes from the camera, but you probably won't forget it. After this soothing event, as it seems a little hope to revive this relationship, Tony will meet two of his old partners, Jo and Mario, and decide to join them in one of the last major throws. They use the Cesar service, which is Italy's safe cracker, which was staged by Dassin himself - and we have been kidnapped. </p> <p> </p> <p> But Cesar's wavering curve is a personality trait that turns out to be dead to all concerned. But we understand his attraction to a nightclub singer for whom he has fallen, because there is a brilliant set where he performs a sexy and kinematically inspired nightclub action - one of the most memorable scenes of any noir movie. br /> <br /> Early on, it has been established that Tony has a close relationship with Jo and his family; in fact, his son refers to him as an uncle. I think this is partly to help the Jo family, that Tony agrees with the throne. The final scenes in which Tony rescues the life of the abducted son partially redeem his more brutal and immoral activities. But only partially.
