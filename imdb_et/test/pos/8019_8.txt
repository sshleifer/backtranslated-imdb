A very intelligent and exciting thriller that does not rely on action, but on a situation that is rare today. I'd compare this movie with Jackal's Day, another movie about the activities of a dangerous international criminal. Acting across the board is super-powerful - Aidan Quinn has a double-faced role as a witch terrorist Carlos and a naval man who embodies it. Donald Sutherland plays an immoral CIA agent who hires him. Ben Kingsley plays an Israeli officer who is helping the plan. It is a very tense and effective film and it is remarkable given how few activities there are. The first half of the movie is all built because the navy man is preparing to embody Carlos. On the other side, there is a breather, an action that goes beyond characters and their situations, making it even more engaging. A really tight movie that shouldn't be overlooked.
