This review has long passed since I think the story of two sisters has ever been made as the biggest film. I put this legacy on any film for a scenario, cinematography, exhibition, post production, editing, directing, or any other film. Is it practically perfect in all of them? a real masterpiece of artificial masterpieces in the sea. <br /> <br /> The structure of this movie is easily built in cinema history. I'm not thinking of any other movie where something important happens every other minute. Just literally, it seems that Ji-woon Kim has made a film that practically deplores the viewer to level it in the most detailed way. Can a seemingly invisible object be displayed? dress clothes, two diaries, tear blood that comes from floor crack, bottle pills, etc.? but after careful control it turns out so much more? a hint that helps to understand this particular scene (or perhaps a movie together) that almost always helps to disrupt the thinking of psychological concepts that lurk in the background until the viewer's intelligence forces them to come to the forefront. Such an event may be a handful of other films, but in A Tale of Two Sisters such events take place in such a fast and relentless fashion that the viewer must constantly watch the film so that they do not miss something important. In other words, the level of content of this movie is enough to easily fill in dozens of other movies. How can someone ask more about the movie in their right sense? It's just an imaginary highest cinema that is the highest cinema. <br /> <br /> The most frequently mentioned criticism of the story of the two sisters is well summarized by Zaphod B Goode, who mistakenly states that the story is a controversial, unresolved confusion that uses confusion to create a false sense of intelligence as it does not provide intriguing questions facts. She says that Ji-woon Kim threw up a dozen possible explanations and left it behind. In reality, nothing can go beyond the truth. The story of two sisters offers a number of objective facts that help the viewer identify the EXACT performances of each scene in the movie. If our good friend Zaphod had paid attention, would he have noticed? for example ?? a series of obvious setbacks that provide enough factual information for the film. These setbacks are inconsistent with Zaphod's full subjectivity. The objective elements of the two siblings are so obvious to anyone who wants to see them, that the mere confirmation of lack of objectivity can only question the patience of the viewer, who apparently does not want even the slightest effort. see them. Is Ji-woon Kim really guilty of the impatience of viewers who don't want to understand their movie? I don't think so. <br /> <br /> Note that I am not offended by the intelligence of critics such as Zaphod that cannot "get" the story of two sisters because it really has no connection with lack of intelligence as much as lack of persistence. The film shows itself so effectively that the only possible explanation for the confusion is the lack of effort of the viewer. Yes, this film requires quite a considerable amount of money to settle, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture. You just have to put them together. Remember that the script was written by someone who had a picture of what was already in the mind? he just separated the pieces and skipped them skilfully to provide great brain exercises, what? when it is finished? gives great satisfaction and awe. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong. There are films that seem to start with an incomplete picture and try to create an insoluble puzzle because of the design. Spider Forest (2004), Perfect Blue (1998) and Donnie Darko (2001) are perfect examples of this. Not two sisters are not. It is ironic that Zaphod claims that Darko is more masterfully built than the story of two sisters, especially since Darko not only offers objective facts but also a twist, which is the basic deus ex machina clich√© that can be terminated in any film that has ever been done to provide ultimate faux intelligence. I am ashamed to mention two movies in the same sentence, but the contrast is important. Although it is amazing to me that Zaphod cites a film that crumbles even with the slightest intellectual effort to criticize a film that becomes visible only through the significant use of intellectual force. Apparently, he likes "intelligent" movies in as superficial form as possible. This is obvious when he presents in his review 17 consecutive questions that the film itself has convincingly answered. Just read the Opiemar themes from the IMDb A Tale of Two Sisters discussion forum. Anyone who reads these topics carefully and confirms that there is no objective solution to this film can also stop watching intelligent movies at all, because the answers are so understandable. <br /> <br /> I'd like to say, but I've reached the limit of 1000 words. All that has been said here has to be said. So now tell me!
