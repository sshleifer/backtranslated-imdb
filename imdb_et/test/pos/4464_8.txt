NOT FOUNDED FISHING is one of Fulci's earlier (and honest, story, better ...) films - and though not the typical "bloodstream" that Fulci is known for - it's still a very unique and enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> The story is surrounded by a small town where a series of child murders take place. Some of the colorful characters involved in the investigation - whether the suspects or the assistants (or, in some cases, both) - include the city police force, a small journalist, a beautiful and rich drug addict, a young priest and his mother, an old man engaged in witchcraft and his female serviceman, spiritual Disabled townspeople and deaf / quiet little girls. All of these people are intertwined with the plot to create multiple turns until the actual killer appears ... <br /> <br /> DON'T FOUNDED FISHER is not a "classic" giallo nor a typical Fulcore gore. Although it contains elements of both, it is rather an old-fashioned mystery of murder, with a darker subject and some graphical violence scenes (although nothing is as strong as some of Fulc's later work). It is a well-written film that has many twists and turns, which until I find the hypothesis. Recommended for giallo / murder mystery fans or anyone who wants to watch some of Fulci's non-splatter movies - but don't despair, there's no need for violence and comfort. Sometimes the subjects of child murder can be left behind and one of the main women in reality is a strange habit of kicking very young boys, which is also kind of disturbing - but if this material doesn't disturb you, be sure to check it out. 8.5 / 10
