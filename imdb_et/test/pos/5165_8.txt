I've already seen cartoons like The Flintstones, Scooby Doo, Tom and Jerry and Looney Tunes, and most of them are great. <br /> <br /> When I saw all the grown-up pictures in 2001, I thought it was interesting to see how Rugrats would look at their pre-teens and teens, and it contained things that would normally happen during the lifetime of the concert, going to school and landing. The actual TV show is better because Rugrats seems to wear different clothes in every episode and Angelica is not punished as much as she did in the original Rugrats series. Tommy and Susie are being punished in this series. <br /> <br /> I have also noticed references to Rugrats at this show and even a setback on how Rugrats saw in the original series. They talk to adults about this exhibition because they're 10 years older. <br /> <br /> This exhibition is aimed at a slightly older audience than the original Rugrats. Viewers of the original show may like it.
