Recently I saw this movie again (after 25 years). In the original, between Jacqueline Bisset's character and the character of Michael Brandon in the airplane bathroom is a scene. The rental version did not have this scene. Can I imagine it? <br /> <br /> Or do some of the movies where some have been changed to exclude parts, some people think they're not "fit"? <br /> <br /> I love this movie - it's just like a friend and me, and we've been friends for 25 years and we saw it together. Her husband thought it was us too. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Joan
