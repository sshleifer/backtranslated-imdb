If Western Union is not exactly the story of building a Transcontinental Telegraph, it's definitely the spirit and commitment of the people involved in the project. <br /> <br /> Dean Jagger is the leading man and one beautiful day when he is thrown out of the horse and has some broken ribs. Randolph Scott, a predator, finds Jagger and is ready to steal his horse, but changes his mind and brings Jagger help. Later, she hires Western Union and works for Jagger. <br /> <br /> Jagger also hires a young oriental player, played by Robert Young, an engineer. Young makes one of his little loans away from the 20th century Fox MGM. Both Young and Scott are friends, but Jagger's sister Virginia Gilmore competes. <br /> <br /> Western Union has enough action to satisfy all Western fans. The telegraph team has to deal with the problems of illegal, Indians and the diversity of your gardens. <br /> <br /> Slim Summerville as an everyday chef and Victor Killian as a border guard dedicated to guard him are some of the most funny scenes. They both offer good comics. <br /> <br /> Fritz Lang got great results and kept the movie moving. Western Union is a strong Western entertainment.
