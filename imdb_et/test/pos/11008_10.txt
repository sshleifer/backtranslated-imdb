Yes !!!! Fassbinder and Ballhaus are at the start of the game in 1973! It's the same subject, but I think it's a much better film than MATRIX (1999), at least 200 times cheaper! The great work of "Albatross" by Michael Ballhaus and Fleetwood Mac is very nice. Fassbinder creates a great mood for the whole movie. It's a shame that this movie was never published on DVD. But now, after 37 years, they finally came to the conclusion that this TV movie is not just one of the best Fassbinder movies (although there are a lot of the best Fassbinder movies), it's a great example of a scientific literary movie, a lot of money. Buy!! Look out!!
