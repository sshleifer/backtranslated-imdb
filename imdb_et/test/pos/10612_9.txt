Marigold is by far the best "foreign maker" I've ever seen. (I didn't grow up with Bollywood, but I've seen a few hundred of them.) I'd say it leaves Gurinder Chadha, Mira Nair, and even a merchant and Bombay Talkie almost dusty. Director Willard Carroll really loves Bollywood and has the confidence to let us know - there is humor, but not arc, ironic distancing, not "of course I don't mean". As Jerry Lee Lewis would say, he says he "gets it" and so he can have it - the joy of the Bollywood film experience with the touches offered by Western peoples' role as a story-teller. /> <br /> This is a story about a corrosive, nervous, beautiful American B-film actor (he's only been in films with numbers in their titles, such as Fatal Attraction 3), who finds himself in a different Bollywood movie he got to India, to be (Kama Sutra 3 has wanted her tents when she was on the road, probably because her producers are now in jail). Salman Khan, a real-life Bollywood mega-mega-mega-star, is a dancing champion for an astonishingly written film that he has now pulled in ("is it before or after the blind?" to find your inner ecstatic dance ability. <br /> <br /> A strong start gives you both Bollywood - a superenergy dancer troupe in front of Taji in Mahal (so funny that it is familiar to the western viewer, as well as the great musical excitement we love in Hindi) and Salman from the beginning - there is no Bollywood 20-minute wait for the hero. She is an Indian costume decorated with a Kit Carson style Western film festival (all white). <br /> <br /> The character of Ali Larter's actress is pleasing to the western viewer - she is a blonde, a "traditional" "white" person in a Bollywood movie and a visually understandable casting - but she's a powerful girl, not the essential blondes we usually we present, and it is more or less a three-dimensional whole bitch who continues the prophetic and abusive mobile phone conversations with a boyfriend and agent in the US. <br /> <br /> We also have scenes from women who have problems with each other to go out with the bar to cope with them - we can't get people to interact together and emotional conversations are traditional in Hindi movies, but we rarely see much such things between women (apart from the discussion between mother and daughter about the choice of her daughter's groom), not to mention "strangers" - independent people - not to mention the bar. So the spirit is the same, the details are fresh, and I was totally glad about it. <br /> <br /> I saw it only once, in a preview, where a director, a good speaker and an interviewer took part - he and Salman sent "brother-like" friends at the time he did, he loves India, he's planning to do it in India Oz movie wizard. I can't get too detailed information about songs when I've only seen them once, except saying I liked them all. They range from the lucky parody of the Bollywood number inside the film-movie - women's costumes, Leghorn hats and sea-shell lining (this is on the beach) to the flowing dresses - it's worth the ticket price alone - for a pleasant reflective multiplied romantic song that is in the sad and serious part of the film. <br /> <br /> Hindi and English are mixed with music and it works. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan gives me many credits for openness to unusual projects - this and Jaan-e-Mann - and a good decision on which ones to be. Carroll said he was full of suggestions and ideas all the way, and completely fine (ie not at all narcissistic) whether Carroll has accepted them or rejected them - it's obviously just the one who loves engagement and collaboration.
