Of course, really experienced reviewers who like Star Wars and professional mess will definitely draw this movie and say very bad about it. But really, it's an enjoyable teen comedy with a fantastic story and good acting. <br /> <br /> Josie Gellar (played well by Drew Barrymore) is part of the news reporting team and has been offered ('real') work - she has to go back to school and find out what the teenagers are. Well it goes well until Josie remembers her terrible time in high school and starts to be amazed. But he never had a hip, never been cool, never popular before! <br /> <br /> Relax and have fun when you have never been able to! <br /> <br />
