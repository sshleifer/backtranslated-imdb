At the time of a serious accident, the nuclear power plant has a TV newsletter Kimberly Wells (Jane Fonda) and her radical camerman Richard Adams (Michael Douglas). Plant managers play it, but Adams has filmed it. Wells and Adams are trying to blow it up, but the company that handles it prevents it. Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon), the plant manager, realizes that there are serious problems and tests are false. He's trying to get the leaders to believe him - only they know it. Wells, Adams and Godell find their whole life in danger. <br /> <br /> I saw it in a cinema in 1979. I was only 17 years old and scared me. Worse still, the Three Mile Island accident happened around that time, making the movie more real. Looking at it more than 20 years later, I do not scare me, but it is still an excellent film - it acts as a mystery, a thrilling drama, and an exposure to the nuclear industry. Fondal (with red hair) is one of his best missions like Wells - he is conveying the growing suspicion and horror of his character when he realizes that a nuclear disaster can happen. Lemmon is (as always) great. He will start believing in his company and his work and will start to break down slowly as he begins to look for things. He was rightly named for the Academy Award. Douglas is good, but he has a small part and is completely overshadowed by Lemmon and Fonda. <br /> <br /> Really great movie - one of the best in the 70s. Don't miss it!
