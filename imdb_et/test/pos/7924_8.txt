This movie has to be seen for the music, which is really a great piece prepared by Sergei Prokofiev. Of course, the original soundtrack is not pretty hi-fi, but there are many great versions of classical music. You can self-assess the cover, but seeing the movie helps. <br /> <br /> The story itself is quite common in Soviet-era anti-German propaganda. The funny anecdote is that Stalin later bought so much time when he promised Hitler at the beginning of World War II that Eisenstein was sent shortly to German film, such as fineness. <br /> <br /> Prince Alexander Nevsky (honoring the Russian Orthodox saint), having earned his nickname, destroying Rome's attacks on the Neva River, Russia is facing resistance to attacks and ends its victory with a cautious warning to other future invaders. An interesting scene: Alexander sees that the Russian convoy is taken as slaves to Mongolian soldiers, and does nothing to stop it, as German knights are his priority. Historical Alexander Nevsky praised the Mongol Khans, like his father, while working to secure his country's future independence.
