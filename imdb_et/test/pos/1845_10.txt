I have to admit that I couldn't see it in the movie theater. As it appeared at the beginning of the summer blocking season, this cute little movie could hardly lose the shadow of several million dollar special effects movies, would it? <br /> <br /> "Returning to me is a lovely and simple story that has been very instructed and written by Bonnie Hunt (who has been several actresses in larger pictures), and the charming story is beautifully woven with smart comedy. both the veteran and the younger actors with such an excellent performance. <br /> <br /> For those who say that David Duchovny hasn't really come off his "Fox Mulder" mold, I agree. it is by far the best thing he could have done himself. The Minnie driver is just beautiful, charming, funny and lively in Grace's role. <br /> <br /> Outside these two lines is surrounded by Grace's close family and friends. Jim Belushi is an absolute seam, Bonnie Hunt is a stable and real life, but I can't speak of Carroll O'Connor without mentioning Robert Loggia's talents and dearly departing.Ironic, I just watched this movie on DVD only the day before he died. his last movie, and He gave a performance that his caliber actor can surely be proud of at the finish of his career. <br /> <br /> Generally, the return to me was just a fun love story and grew into a movie that has become my favorite! Take the time to rent ..... it's worth the effort!
