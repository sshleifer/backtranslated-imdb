The second one that slipped from most of anyone's radar. This little B-produced pearl is so full of new ideas in the old genre and so absolutely refreshing and inventive that the terrible feeling of cojone's absence in today's cinema is slowly moving your body. The final set is so innovative that it favors all Tarantinos to John Woo. Oh, and if you think "dying lines" are all clich√©s, wait for the FF to die. The dialogue that could have broken you with laughter takes your heart. Real joy. Look for it and look at it. You're not sorry.
