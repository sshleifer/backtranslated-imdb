That's exactly what I was waiting for. Relaxing, humorous and fun. The acting couple was both fantastic and a scene choice. I recommend this personally. This is a movie that can be seen by the whole family at the same time, without anyone feeling uncomfortable or eternal. This cute movie makes you smile and laugh. And the action scenes are delicious. Modern American comedy classic. And well done.
