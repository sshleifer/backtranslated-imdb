It was the best film I saw in 2000. Cohen's brothers have never put me down and they certainly didn't. <br /> <br /> It's one of those rare movies these days - it's witty, intelligent, and fun. I left the cinema warm in my heart. Of course, there's a lot of Cohen things - strange characters and a peculiar gadget, a well-developed plot and a magical camera. But none of Cohen's film resembles other Cohen movies, if you forget about their overall quality, of course. <br /> <br /> For me, it was a big surprise that Clooney was so good. But the real masterpiece of the film comes from Tim Blake-Nelson. But the rest is great too. <br /> <br /> A movie that is a light comedy and musical touch that evolves around the story and the old-age music that is witty and intelligent. This is a very unlikely combination. But this is the picture.
