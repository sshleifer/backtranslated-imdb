When the Nazis came to power in Eastern Europe in the late 1930s, Charles Chaplin turned his attention to creating a response. The catalyst may have been a propaganda publication that refers to Chaplin as a Jewish companion. In the big dictator, Chaplin created Hitler's dead parody, which is just as funny as scaring at times. The film follows Hitler's experience in the German army from World War I to the present day. At the same time, Chaplin plays a Jewish hairdresser who has long been out of the hospital with a tramp to discover how different the world is under the Nazi regime. <br /> <br /> Paulette Goddard, Chaplin's wife at this time, plays a young Jewish girl whose family is oppressed in the Jewish ghetto. Jack Oakie has a great, Oscar-like supporting role with Mussolini's similar look (Benzini Napalon), who gives Chaplin Hitler the character of Adenoid Hynkel. Henry Daniell is his normal self as Garbitsch, Adenoid Hynkel's chief adviser. Chaplin wrote and directed the film and received Oscar nominations for his scenario and his exhibition. The film was also named for the best picture. <br /> <br /> Chaplin made the film under enormous pressure for some obvious reasons and some not so well known. He funded the whole film himself because of the high risks of the subject and so far there was no other major film about Nazi Germany. The film spent about twenty-one months in production with Chaplin, even building a set and shooting a scene to get things right. When the movie was released in October 1940, the European War came under Hitler's hand, conquering one country after another, so that the film became more topical during its release than when production began. <br /> <br /> Looking back at the movie, there is not much plot; rather, the film seems to be a series of comedy sketches and / or injuries assembled from the film itself to achieve an independent goal. There are many examples of this in the last third of the film with Hynkel and Napalon. The scene is very funny, but it does not indicate where the plot is. Similarly, the escape of both the hairdresser and Schultz will simply lead to the false identity of Hynkler's hairdresser, giving Chaplin (through the hairdresser's character) the opportunity to call the audience at the end of the film. On the other hand, what better way to realize that Aryan's superiority is inappropriate when misled by the Jewish hairdresser Hynkel? However, the film has many high comic moments such as rally speech, new war development (bulletproof uniforms, etc.), dance club scene, coin pudding and the whole scenario between Hynkel and Napalon (including the hairdressing board) to highly recommend the film. Also, you should not forget the risks Chaplin took for his first film, anti-Nazi film and film financing. *** 1/2 of the four stars.
