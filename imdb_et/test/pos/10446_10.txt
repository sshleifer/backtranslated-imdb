"The Last American Virgin" with "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" is one of the last major teen movies ever made. It is the story of jealousy and unorganized love that took place in the early eighties. Critics have been very upset that it was a sophomore, banal attempt to restore the "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" magic, these same critics do not admit that the two films were actually filmed in 1981. \ t In both cases, studios never allow such a bold and uncompromising image that many male teenagers face in achieving sexual maturity. Especially in view of the heartbreaking discovery of the main character, Gary is facing the end. American Pie is not. The story revolves around a male teen trio and mostly a failed sexual entertainment. Gary is the group's least successful, so LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN. Secretly, Gary lusts after Karen, who is associated with her best friend Rick. Rick and Karen start to have sex and Karen gets pregnant only by Rick, who is not interested in the obvious responsibility she is facing. Gary slides into Karen, which leads to the above-mentioned, unexpected conclusion. In general, I find it very successful as a comedy, as a comment on the sexual dilemmas of young men, and a remarkable story of the era about issues such as jealousy, unique love and abortion that are as relevant today as they were over twenty years ago. It also has one rocking sound that has ever been done !!!
