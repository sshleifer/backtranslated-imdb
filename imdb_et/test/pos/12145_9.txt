Classe Tous Risques (The Big Risk) is repeatedly recommended every time I watch Jean-Pierre Melville's movie, which I had to watch as soon as possible. Since I have discovered Melville and have seen my filmography work back, it would be easy for me to make it one of my films, but Claude Sautet did it in 1960 before Melville came in and put his claim back in French neo-noir. <br /> <br /> Classe Tous Risques has two best men, Lino Ventura and Jean-Paul Belmondo. Ventura plays Abel, his wife and two children in Italy, who wants to come back to Paris because the police are closing her. After a surprising roaring and quick pace, Abel finally arrives with Eric Stark (Belmondo), who wants to get into the underworld. Stark becomes Abel's chauffeur and finally the only friend in the underworld that turns it back into Abel's everything he has done and passed. The film shows the duality of two men, at the end of his time after the tragedy the elder Abel strikes him and the younger Eric begins the same way as Abel, in love with a beautiful woman who looks at her husband, regardless of the world they belong to. It never ends for them or their loved ones. His one thing about seeing a single offender in his death is different when he is with loved ones he will risk with him. <br /> <br /> Like Melville's film, the seemingly simple story is more complicated because it goes by. As I always feel about Melville's movies, it left my head spinning (in good condition) and died to look again to miss the first time. Classe Tous Risques is a sure keeper.
