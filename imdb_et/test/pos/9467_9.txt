This movie is a great movie, but it is because most movies are very predictable. Of course, the biggest emphasis in the film is Amanda Bynes, who is absolutely proud and fun. He is one of the very few people in the world who can use all 53 facial muscles to make the strangest and gut splits. It is good for children and includes the upper male nudity and the desire for nudity to the end. All in all, they did a good job of refreshing the old classics, and it is worth resting on the movie stand with the O and 10 things I hate you. Other participants will also swell in their debut for the first time.
