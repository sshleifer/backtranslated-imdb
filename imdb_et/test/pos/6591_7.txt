Ernesto is a person who lives from other solid citizens for his hard earned money. With Manco, a senior man with a lot of experience, he pulls out capers that allow him to live a decent life, but it doesn't make him a rich person. Enter Federico, an older man who has more experience in fraud art. Together with the younger Ernesto they have won the combination. It only lasts until Pilar, Federico's former love interest, appears in the picture. <br /> <br /> This Spanish film, directed by Miguel Bardem, is an easy tone and a pleasant sit. Other, better-made capri films are made with much smarter plots than this, but the film is easy to take and sometimes it has a lot of funny situations. <br /> <br /> This viewer sees something about Federico Lup, even when reading the phone directory! He's an actress actress. We have had the privilege of seeing her at the Buenos Aires stage, doing an excellent job before her international film career. Like Federico, he does what he does best. It is impossible for someone to be better in his role. Ernesto Alterio, son of Hector Alterio, is a young actor who promises a great career. Victoria Abril makes Pilar fun when he deals with their males. Miguel Alexandre, veteran actor, is also good as Manco.
