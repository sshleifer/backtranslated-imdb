Spoilers. This review has been edited based on the word boundary. <br /> <br /> Fear. Fear. Marlon Brando, Apocalypse (1979) and Apocalypse Now Redux (2001) <br /> <br /> Sentence that is as famous as "Here I Look at You, Boy" or "Are You Talking"? or "Are the forces with you," or "I'll be back," means a little more than a lining. When it is spoken, it remains in the air with significance and meaning that will not go unnoticed. What might lead some viewers to nuts is that they may never find the answer to fear if they don't watch the movie again and try not to follow each frame carefully. <br /> <br /> What exactly is the meaning of this dialogue? The fear that is being said is the reality of war. The reality of moral men is so easily violated that they turn to their innate instincts and kill fellow citizens without guilt. When Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) stands at the end of the film before his dying colleague Kurtz (Marlon Brando), "Fear. Fear." is the realization of Willard corruption. He has mercilessly killed a person's cold blood as part of his tasks. This is not the typical end of Hollywood. In most cases, the character gets something, be it emotionally, physically, mentally or in all three. But Willard benefits and loses. He learns he has lost his morale. And it's a shocking end. <br /> <br /> "Apocalypse Now" is Francis Ford Coppola's respect for the artistic side of filmmaking. This movie is a completely different "Godfather". It is hallucinogenic, visually dazzling and guilty of human nature. At first it seems realistic and then it becomes strange and then symbolic and finally original in its unique perspective on the spiritual side of warfare. This is not so much a film about the Vietnam War, because it is a movie about the war inside us. <br /> <br /> At first it seems to be another war movie. Captain Willard (Sheen) has been appointed by a military lieutenant (young Harrison Ford) to assassinate an American colonel named Kurtz (Brando) who hides in Vietnam somewhere with a group of troops who are more or less their slaves. <br /> <br /> Willard fulfills his mission with "extreme prejudice" when riding a boat with four soldiers, including the captain of the boat, commander (Albert Hall), the chef (Frederic Forest) and the very young "Larry" Fishburne (who later in the Matrix) "Morpheus appeared). <br /> <br /> "Apocalypse Now" is in many ways a modern update of Homer's Odyssey. Our main character, Willard, carries his journey, meets a number of original and strange characters, including Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who has strange fetish surfing and stony photographer (Dennis Hopper) whose living gestures and motifs can be compared to their much smaller Jeremy Davies nor, who is "The Million Dollar Hotel", one of the worst films I've ever seen. Davies didn't make any connection to the audience; Hopper does. He is like a poetic vibe between Willard and Kurtz; he is like an interpreter back and forth in foreign languages. In this case, he translates to Kurtz Willard, although I'm not sure Kurtz needs Willard's translation. <br /> <br /> Many movies are happy to have one or two memorable scenes or lines. "Apocalypse now" is a lot. Kilgore, who falls to the Vietnamese village, plays Wagner's "Valkyry's Race", is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of the film. It has sharpness, its brutality, the ironic tone and the sense of playfulness. When Kilgore kneels on this beach and says, "I love the smell of napalm in the morning. Smells like a victory," we all blast a smile. <br /> <br /> I am not lying to you: "Apocalypse is now a strange movie. It's not the easiest to analyze. The end may prevent some viewers if they don't understand Marlon Brando's important calls. "It's a movie about the darkness of the human psyche. Fear is the realization of war and its consequences, not war itself. Kurtz says," You have the right to kill me. But you have no right to judge me. Brando's character, Kurtz, is left to judge. For many naïve viewers, he may appear crazy, with the power reaching his head. But that's not what Francis Ford Coppola is trying to overcome. In the struggle in Vietnam, Kurtz has realized how great he was and how bad others were. Walking through destroyed villages, he finally comes to realize that we are naive, living in the foolish paradise of their lives. We are completely naïve to our surroundings and possible failures until they hit. Looking at how some of Vietnam's miserable ones, Kurtz understands how easily he could catch something. Just how easily he can get into the people around him. And he also understands that the people who did this are people who have given up their morals and left them at the door. Many people think that horror is one thing. That's two. For Kurtz, it is horrible when he was naive and the impact of war on men. And when Willard murders Kurtz and hears Kurtz's dead words, he understands it. He understands the impact of war. To see so many soldiers who do not have the right or wrong feelings, he understands the fear that war can make for a man. And what he's done to him. Fear. <br /> <br /> 5/5 stars - <br /> <br />
