Although it is not closer to Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan than the Johnny Wiesmuller flutes, he has his own peculiar and entertaining story. This is a well made Tarzan movie. Nice scenery, good photography, dependable continuity, and Tarzan's cry that echoes Burroughs. Players all work well. In my opinion, the only bad points were related. It moves slowly in places. This slow movement? Makes this picture long. It would have been 15 to 20 minutes shorter, which, in my opinion, would have contributed to the natural flow and character of the plot. But the rest of the film works well enough to bring it to two harsh spots and leave the viewer unhappy with it. The short version above ... It's a very good Tarzan movie.
