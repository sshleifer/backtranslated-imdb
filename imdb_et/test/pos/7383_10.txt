This is one of my favorite films of all time, it's nice to look in groups. It's also great for all Alan Rickman fans, he does such a wonderful job. It's tempting, fun, very surprising ... you have to look at it at least twice. I haven't watched it for anyone who didn't like it or at least it was worth it.
