I saw this great documentary at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. It is extremely absorbent and very well designed, drawing you on the life and career of Harry Nilsson, one of the most remarkable musical talents of the 60s and 70s. Although I was familiar with his best-known compositions ("One Is The Loneliest Number", "Without You"), I learned about this man's excellent writing and beautiful song. If you love music, you will find a lot to guide you into your world, which unfortunately fell out of control as his success grew and his past haunted him. But, sadly, he was completely committed to his family and you find yourself so happy that you've met this man. The profile is effectively spoken of by the words of Nilsson himself and his friends and colleagues (virtual Who's Rock) who loved and respected him. Don't miss it!
