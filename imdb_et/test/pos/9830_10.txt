Random hearts are very well-managed, well-written and perfectly cast actors of primary roles. I found it so intense that you need to stop and wonder in almost all scenes when Harrison and Kristin are together as their characters deal with this terrible situation. Many people I think who did not appreciate the film for what it was, did not get to the point of the film and could not even understand the situation as they are. <br /> <br /> (skip this next part if you haven't seen the movie yet). <br /> <br /> I loved the end, which was a big surprise that tied the whole movie. It was alleviating to see how these two good people finally come out happier. <br /> <br />
