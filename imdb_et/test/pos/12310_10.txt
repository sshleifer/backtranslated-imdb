I've been waiting for years for DEAD to have a video coming out because I have a lot of VHS copies. This is one of the most beautiful films ever made for the holidays. It is on Epiphany Sunday (twelfth evening) and it is a simple, amazing character that includes three dinners prepared by Dublin women. At the heart of the story is a rather unattractive couple, a woman lovingly loving a young man who died for him, and a man who wants to feel the same kind of passion for his wife, but who is incapable. All the performances are stunning and the script will be dinners for dinner at various dinners. Of course, this is the source of the story of James Joyce, and much of his narrative structure is completely untouched. One of John Huston's long career as one of Hollywood's greatest filmmakers was the ultimate match for the film that his son, Tony Huston, had made. stands for his daughter Anjelica Huston; and is dedicated to his wife Maricella. Thank you to Lions Gate for its film rights and release from DVD. For all lovers of things who are Ireland or people who are looking for illiterate, subtle but incredibly moving holiday movies, this is a real gem.
