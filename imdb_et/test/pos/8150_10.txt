I watched it last night and again this morning. There's something about this movie ... When the movie was almost over, I started crying. I strongly urge your friends for later days - it's definitely worth it! I agree with those who say that some parts of the film do not seem very realistic. For example, both the main characters are perfectly cute and perfect physical shape (although the shape is also round)). I rarely meet people who are like single and have never met in pairs. Other parts of the film, including all these "coincidences", do not seem very realistic either. BUT, after all, it's MOVIE, not the story of life.
