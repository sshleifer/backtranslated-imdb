Well I just discovered IMDb from my twin sister Carol. Carol and I made "Fat Identical Twin" in Midnight Madness. We didn't have to prepare much for the fat part that came with us, and well and the rest was natural. ;) It was our first big movie and we had an explosion. We were 21 at that time and lived for about an hour and a half from Disney's studio in Burbank and Hollywood, California. We grew up in front of the television and probably some of the first generation lock keys. Twenty years later, we still have a lot of fun and are still "hard" or politically correct today. We are not trying to act anymore, but we have come to come back on the right opportunities. Carol is a Chiropractor in our home area of ​​Southern California and I am in the field of Information Technology in Georgia. <br /> <br /> I might be biased, but I thought the movie was cute, clean and fun. We knew it was neither a masterpiece nor an Oscar candidate, but it was and still is a movie that the whole family can watch and have fun with. It's nice that you don't have to worry if your toddlers can watch the video without having to move some parts forward. And no one left anymore when it appeared in the video as Carol and I did. Carol found $ 6.99 for this Kmart! Now it's a cheap way to capture your memories and share it with others. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Betsy Lynn and Carol Gwynn; The twins of Thompson
