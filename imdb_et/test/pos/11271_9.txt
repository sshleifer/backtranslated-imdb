A black and white distorted image is born. It seemed to have come from the 19th century. However, the sound is crystal clear, minus synchronization and the addition of peaceful nature voices. <br /> <br /> This movie was very critical of life. It shows a single mother and child in a violent world that blossoms innocently. Mother is very attentive about her surroundings. It brings a lot of torture, pain and death. You can view it several times and see different symbols, plot devices and basically "what does it mean?". <br /> <br /> If you appreciate movies in art, you will love it. Otherwise, don't worry.
