Where Rivers Flow North is a well-told story about the struggle of two people to live the "development" and development of their lives. In addition to studying film entertainment, I also learned a lot about the life of New England lived in the late 1920s. <br /> <br /> Cinematography has taken the raw beauty of North Vermont and staged the stage, while music brought the film to life. Very well done with a small budget for a local movie. I found the film's weakest Michael J. Fox character, but Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal turned to the two most beautiful stages I've seen for a long time. I was sad that he didn't get the best actor this year (I assume the movie was too small).
