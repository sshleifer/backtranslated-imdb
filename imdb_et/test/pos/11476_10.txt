"Sorte Nula" is the Portuguese film of the 2004 Office # 1. This extremely low budget (estimated at $ 150,000) was opened at Christmas for American blockers such as National Treasure, Polar Express, The Incredibles and Alexander, but quickly hit Portuguese gamblers. Despite the fierce competition, the small film surprisingly worked well, adding the first two weeks of all the other Portuguese films. The film is a mystery / murder with a humorous tone, wisely written and directed by Fernando Fragata, who has received a strong reference in the European independent film scene. Did I like the movie? Oh, yeah!
