* Warning! Some spoilers! * <br /> <br /> Matt, a rich writer, is still a boy in his behavior. He does not care about anyone but his own needs and does not care less about the consequences of his actions. Just as he learns about his name and his connections with his family and his communication, he begins to feel that something is missing in his life. <br /> <br /> He realizes that he is actually lonely and initiative-just comfortable, but with no heart and devotion. Nonetheless, he is excluded from every responsibility and does not want to change in his life. But can he settle in his old life and ignore the connections he has already - unconsciously - formed? <br /> <br /> The name is the absolute opposite. He is forced into the rules of his Nigerian community, his prejudices and his medieval values. Because of her single mother, her position is difficult and it gets worse when she falls in love with Matt, who is a white devil (as the referendum would be), a man who can't do it. Community women intend to marry her to end her single status and give Sammy a "name". But that would mean that the Name would give up any independence and self-determination. But is it an alternative to him if he wants Sammy to be accepted and belong to a community of honor? <br /> <br /> This movie is all: a very sensitive and sensual love story (very sexy Matt and Name scenes and a loving child who is eagerly delightful, beautiful scenery in vibrant colors. <br /> <br /> Colin Firth ( * swoon *) and Nia Long show great chemistry. It's just fantastic to watch them. And Fissy Roberts as Sammy is just dying. You just want to accept her. I just love how Sammy and Matthew talk to each other Especially when Sammy asks Matt about sex. This scene is absolutely divine !! <br /> <br /> Almost anything about the complaint .... wait! It's not true. One thing is not good: that the movie is not long enough (well, and maybe the referendum is too bad and too silly to be persuasive ....) <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10, all right!
