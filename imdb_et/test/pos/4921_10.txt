This is a classic animated movie from the series! Most of the larger characters get a lot of screen time and also add extra characters! The movie's focus is on superstar characters, and everyone has their own unique summer fun! Its very funny from start to finish! It has great color, great music and no, or not. I've seen it more than any movie. Its great and I think it's perfect!
