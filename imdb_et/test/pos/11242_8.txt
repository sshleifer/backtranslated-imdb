I can't say that this show is perfect. Maybe all the previous comments remember the old Tuesday at 10:30 am, accepted by the childish humor of Elvira Curt ("There's a space shuttle that tends to be 747!"). Oh coding honor to hit any remote control button to change it. <br /> <br /> Faced with comedy, you can't pull out the show and truly create the Canadian Trailer Park Boys comic genius. But hey, they're trying. <br /> <br /> This exhibition is by far one of the best original exhibitions. But none of the following laughs with the obvious "players" who show their stupidity in picking up girls: <br /> <br /> a) "Dark" girls - they probably don't realize they are like girls at shows. Unforgettable. Jump on a man's meat, you can call yourself a whore and get your name. She looks good, she has to be popular and nice. HAHAHAHA !!! Oh, but you never do it! No one would want to ... if they knew it would happen. <br /> <br /> b) Social boys who think women are beautiful boys - Obviously we see how these men succeed, what you can't or even don't experience. That your primary rages ooz. Look closely, they're casting down most of the time. They say foolish crap. <br /> <br /> c) Girls respecting each other - You will obviously see that your separate female species are getting the wrong situation in the real world. No one is playing. Women are not objects, they cannot be played because they are all very faithful angels who go to clubs to politely talk to each other without fear of boys trying to pick them up. <br /> <br /> Oh wait ... hmmmmmmmm <br /> <br /> As far as everyone says this show is not funny and it doesn't teach you anything, I have to take the opposite. The exhibition is very good to describe how relationships between men and women work. How they think and how they think about each other thinking and social hierarchy. He's funny to see and hear that boys make absolutely idiotic comments on what women say ("My grandfather recently died" "Oh ... we have fun tonight?"). <br /> <br /> Besides, the club. A place where people go to have fun and put on. No matter who you are, you go to the club to get someone to pay attention or attention. The boys go there to test their game and take the girls. The girls go to flirt and find what wipes her best. Lighten up! <br /> <br /> If you are a man, learn something or a different approach and different effects. If you are a girl, learn what these "ridiculous" whores really think, and learn to surrender them to genuine men. The next time one of these douchewads breaks down, understand it not for him, because you're stupid and thought he was the biggest man ever when he was clearly a dick all the time.
