I watched it again on BBC Channel 4. This is not Jane Austen's best novel, but the movie is a sensible interpretation. I suspect that the premises of the Bath Assembly would have been more crowded than shown; maybe they didn't get extra. Why is everyone stopping so that the dance couple can hear? I've never heard anything someone has ever told me when I've been dancing and I suspect it was the same in the 18th-19th Century bath. <br /> <br /> I can't believe US / Canada reviews; they are completely caught up in the irony of the film. "Gothic" scenes are quite wisely presented, but they need to be properly read. I'm sure Jane A would have amused these comments. Nobody thinks anyone else thinks Peter Firth looks more like Colin Baker (former Doctor Who) or vice versa, what older do they both get?
