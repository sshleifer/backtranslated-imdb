I watched this movie with my mother. He's 81 years old. He even admits it. I don't think he really understood what happened, he had already thought the child was guilty. Scary. I felt this child and his family. What torture they passed through and remained faithful. This is true faith. Back to the movie. I was against the police forces and their injustice. I am so pleased that this public defender was elected to resolve this case. This family was very happy that they had a person who took care enough to see the mess they had been put on. I can tell when one of the police officers was lying. He didn't see the defender in his eyes. His eyes moved to answer questions. It is unfortunate that a black person has to be punished for the color of his skin. I read a book that three white men were a black man behind a truck. They were finally found guilty of many years. I don't remember the title, but that was the same assumption. White who do what they want, black. I'm sure the child in the movie will be traumatized for a long time, if not forever. I pointed out to my mother that most of the serial and pedophiles are white. No comments about him. I want to congratulate the director and producer of this movie. I feel that the exposure they gave to this blatant injustice was a necessary project. I am an avid movie viewer. I think they are well written and have content. I'm glad I happened to be on the shelf of this movie. I felt compelled to comment because I feel strongly about the film and the prejudices that continue to exist in our modern society.
