I have great memories of this movie ... <br /> <br /> I was only 12 years old when it was released and it frightened me. I miss my play ... <br /> <br /> Zombies, graveyard, mausoleum, how do you go wrong? It's like Phantasmi's slowed cousin. <br /> <br /> This movie was released 1 year before the PG-13 rating. <br /> <br /> I argue that One Dark Night is a GORIEST PG (not more frightening and meaningful) ever released. <br /> <br /> Can somebody come up with a choir choir? <br /> <br /> (FYI: I do not consider Poltergeist to be a gorilla.), yes, but not gorier ...)
