I was actually about 13 years old camping near the McCloud River near Shasta when the film was filmed. My family was paid to leave our campground in the afternoon as they filmed along the Vincent River. A little trivia ... the scene where he pulled him out was actually where he started his float by the river. And when the stuntman left off, 20 feet down the waterfall was about 1/4 mile below. It was only years later when I saw the film and actually realized its meaning. This is a pretty powerful movie, and certainly Jan's good work at a young age. His film career never went as expected, but of course he found success on TV. I want this movie to be available because I would like to see it again.
