With all the intentions and goals in mind, Teen Devian may just seem like another lightweight Bollywood music. To a certain extent, it may even be true, especially since manufacturers had to be sure that the masses were successful on the film. But somewhere behind the scenes, Sadashiv Brahmam (who was the "idea" of that story) or Amerjeet (who directed the film) decided that the traditional formula had twisted and even managed to overcome his expectations. br /> <br /> It is not just a beautiful man who flirts with 3 women, undecided to whom to choose as his life partner. Dev Anand's character was very in love with each of the three women at different times and with them, despite being aware of the other two. Dev Anand's relationship with Simi and Kalpana is especially interesting - all women are heavily dependent on him. There are many clues in the body language of the stars, which are imaginative depending on the maturity of the viewer. The subject is surprisingly an adult, and after all, the ashame that the end was tame, obviously meant to appeal to the masses and to direct criticism.
