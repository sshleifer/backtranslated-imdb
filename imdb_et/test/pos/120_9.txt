There are questions that sometimes move with us and who have no answer. Two women gradually find each other (as it sounds, this is exactly what happens) and the fins they can't answer to their question, which determines their relationship if their own society doesn't have the name they have . Deep Mehta's somewhat wrong title, FIRE, is the first loosely associated with trilogy, which is the subject of the elements involved here and more symbolic than consumption. Fire as an uncontrolled erotic passion does not appear here because women - parents and feminine Radha (Shabana Azmi) and younger, more masculine tempered Sita (Nandita Das) understand that they share much more than ordinary ideas and affection for each other and stand for what they believe , their passion is against each other, despite the opposition faced by their traditional spouses and families. Like WATER, FUTURE is deeply spiritual, even if it technically falls into the sentimental melodrama mode (where Water, like the word weight, has a stronger meaning, which ultimately goes beyond its definition). However, it is a very beautiful picture and a strong voice from a strong director.
