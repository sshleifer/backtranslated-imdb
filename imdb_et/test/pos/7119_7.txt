I'm really impressed. I was expecting cheesy gamer humor and something else. <br /> <br /> OK, there's a lot of pretty geeky humor. But the film is so well done. Action is pretty good. <br /> <br /> Dialogue, although occasionally a gambler is funny, I think it is not bad to satisfy the crowd of players. Sometimes it's even, dare say, great. <br /> <br /> If a female player who built this type of non-traditional fighter, but the usual (min / max) type, gets all these additional attacks (it seems right), I didn't check the rules, it was cool. <br /> <br /> Sets are amazing for what must be a relatively low production film. Transitions from the world of the game to the real world are well done. A man who plays a female sometimes plays a female and sometimes also himself. I thought pretty wise, a man who decided to play a female, but forgot that she was a woman, had a lot of laughter. She even said the tag at one point and the woman was in that role (sorry, I didn't see her name, she did very good.) The boy who always tried to "get" got a little annoying, but I think it was more humor . <br /> <br /> The movie was just as pleasant. Lighthearted. Fun! Very well done and I say it's a movie fan, not a player (and I'm not a D & D player). As I said, so much less was expected. <br /> <br /> Movies don't often turn my attention, I listen to them while working on a computer. That was my attention. I can't give the film a much higher praise.
