Campfire Tales (1997) <br /> <br /> Great Peace. All this movie is just perfect. <br /> <br /> The film has an excellent show, as you can see from IMDb. The reason I brought the film was Christine Taylor and the love of horror films. can access the main parts of the movie <br /> <br /> 1. this movie has 4 teenagers, after crashing their car they decide to talk about some spooky stories 2. there are 3 stories and the main plot (4 teenagers are the main plot) 3. the best story is " people who can also lick "in my opinion. the least frightening story is probably "honeymoon" or story 2 (don't remember the name "<br /> <br /> 4." people can also lick "is about a man who pretends to be a 13 year old girl (on the internet) to chat with a girl called Amanda, and then to enter her home, a very horrible stuff that this story will do for a while for a while to chat with someone on the net. but at the end there is a very cool twist. <br /> <br /> The only bad part of this movie is, the teenagers are crashing into the second pair of their car, but the kids don't worry if the couple is fine, but they talk about the couple they've collapsed. br /> <br /> The men and women who made this movie made people scare, not to make money, unlike "Scream" and "I know what you did last summer", this movie is created to intimidate and "I know what you made the last summer er "was made for a long time in cash. <br /> <br /> Although this movie was not shaken in public or shouting, it's still 10 times better than shouting and "I know what you did last summer". <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are big and have realistic features. Those who show these signs are great. Christine Taylor does a fabulous Job with Lauren, doesn't go over the actor. The guy who plays Eric (lauren's younger brother) does a good job of showing men or teenage boys. Screams are like a spam, a murderer is a joke and kids are fools <br /> <br /> Unlike shouting and "I know what you did last summer", this movie has realistic people, not a bunch of movies, should be more noticed.
