When I got this picture for the first time, it was simply called a "sheepdog" and it was supposed to be a movie that brought JCVD ​​back to the theater shtuffle. I was very excited about the whole piece. <br /> <br /> By the time it was titled "Shepherd: Border Patrol", I was excited about this flick. Under the leadership of Isaac Fluorentine and JJ Perry, who pulled the gimmick coordination, I tried to get my pants down. Pics was released from JCVD, hit 8 different types of ass and Scott Adkins, who played what I thought was a villain, and I was excited. I thought it was another epic martial arts situation like Lone Wolf McQuade. <br /> <br /> Then it came out. I ordered this blockbuster online for $ 20 and I was ready for something. At Vandammefan.net reviews, my ideas had changed, but I pulled myself. The post came on the 4th day and I hung up the package. My initial plan was to rush upstairs, hang the face out of the cardboard package, then crush the bag in the right dynamics so that the disc would land on my DVD player. But I looked for 10 minutes, then put the disc in my player and watched the movie. <br /> <br /> By that time I was over when I was in the pool. The Shepherd Dog is definitely one of my all-time favorite-direct-video movies and makes Derailed a bit more like a toilet. Of course, some struggles ran a bit short, but they were still very awesome. Shootouts were great, as was Scott Adkins, who should be a villain, unlike the forgotten Steven Lord. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this flick. Seriously.
