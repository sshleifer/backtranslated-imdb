After ten years of turbulent unrest, American films began to move and transform their cameras from war-torn battlefields, political corruption and general social anxiety into a more intimate world of family dysfunction. Selfish baby boomers began to grow up in the American family and their children felt. <br /> <br /> "Kramer vs Kramer" is one of the first disturbing family dramas that would be so popular in the 1980s and one of the best. It gets quite a bomb rape because it is known as a movie that beat the "Apocalypse now" for the best picture academy award in 1979, but comparing these two films is like comparing a banana with marinated chicken breast: they are far from the same, but can we not enjoy both of them? Director / writer Robert Benton does not try to make his film a fiction; its strength lies primarily in the performances of Dustin Hoffman and Meryli Streep, playing a divorced couple who struggles childishly and selfishly with their son. The scene of the courtroom, where they say it for care, and where everyone is forced to hurt others, is devastating and seems authentic. The film does not feature Hoffman's father as a hero, or Streep's misguided mother as a villain. They are neither good nor bad as people - they are just bad married. <br /> <br /> Film is a tearful finale, but not manipulative. It serves to repel your right. <br /> <br /> Rating: A
