This surreal, absurd film is the first film I've ever seen from Swedish director Roy Andersson. He is a veteran filmmaker who has made live film material, directing only four feature films for the last 40 years. This background shows: the film seems like fifty minutes of artistic advertising. These vignettes are not interrelated, although some characters appear in more than one vignette (but there is a subject, the absurdity of modern life). Some movie motifs (show that actors are light white makeup) are more irritating than illuminating. Some sketches are very small (the man is not sure in which order to stand?). However, other sketches are better. The best thing is that the rock chick dreams of going to a honeymoon with his rock-guitar bride in a house that turns on something similar to a train (you have to look at it). A film worth seeing, even if the comparisons of some film critics and filmmakers like Keaton, Tati, and Kaurismak seem crowded: Andersson lacks their vision and the lack of a vignette story is lethal for the pretext of being a masterpiece.
