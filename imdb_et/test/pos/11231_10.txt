A dreamy, stunningly atmospheric film takes place in 1955 in the small town of Northfork, Montana. Government officials can evacuate the city, which is in a new hydroelectric power station. Other visitors are in the city, angels from another time, but they are only seen by the dying boy Irvin. The boy is taken care of by a local priest (Nick Nolte in a quiet heartbreaking phase). Irvin argues that angels leave a place for them ... <br /> <br /> There are some awkward qualities in the movie, some worthy grief and sublime sadness when you suddenly realize that everything is inevitable - people and their relationships, cities , countries, civilizations, the world as we know it. Death and birth have something in common - we go through them in solitude. <br /> <br /> I can't remember a movie that influenced me in the same way and as deeply as "Northfork", the film so beautiful and so gentle, so quiet and so powerful, so heartbreaking and so moving. Even now, after several weeks of seeing it, tears come in my eyes when I only think about it. <br /> <br /> After I saw it, I had to talk to someone about it. I sent a PM to one of my friends and said, "Please tell me what I just saw?" And my friend replied, "You just saw one of the greatest films of a modern time. One of those days sees the light."
