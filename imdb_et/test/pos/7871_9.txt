I saw this short movie from HBO the other day and loved it. Eight different characters, eight different perspectives. At first I was confused about how the story was moving, but then I realized that it was just one scene that would be shown over and over again to show us different characters. <br /> <br /> At first, you think officials are screaming to steal a teenager. They speak in their own language, which I (and Chris teenager, which Eleonore Hendricks played convincingly) does not understand. This view is dispelled by the officials' perspective. I didn't know how wonderful the short really was up to the last two scenes. <br /> <br /> A great short film. Hopefully, the director James Cox can be turned into a short film with the same frame, or beat us with a new movie. <br /> <br />
