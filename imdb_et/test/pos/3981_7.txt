I don't think I've seen a movie for a high school child who created my college for just my life, just to impress my parents. Nowadays, films are either new or another plots used in many different films. It has an original story and is watching it, making comedy movies just a bargain. It's a well thought out story and laughs, it's a good movie. Now I've seen better, but I was thinking of going to the theater for another drug / beer / frat party with some sexual enthusiasts (aka "American Pie" flick), but I was surprised. All in all, I enjoyed the movie and the next time I mix the paper for the film, look for "Accepted". If you want to laugh out loud, that is.
