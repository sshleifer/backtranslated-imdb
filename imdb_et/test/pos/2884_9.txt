In the drama of Wilde's novel, John Osborne has brought together events, eliminated many characters, and generally meant, not showing Doria's indispensable mischief. If you want more rendering, check out the 1945 movie. Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived around the same time, but were certainly very different men and writers. This story really deals with a topic similar to Stevenson's "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hydele", but note that Wilde decided to treat his story as a fantasy, while RLS took the scientific path. Both main characters are the men with whom good wars are evil, the ultimate victory. <br /> <br /> The participants of this BBC film will also take a different path on the 1945 film paths. John Gielgud tells all the same alkaline and cynical smiles like George Sanders, in his role as Wilde himself, but with a subtle difference. You suspect that Sanders really believed what he said, but Gielgud can say what is expected of him, not what he sincerely believes. Peter Firth also shows his character on two sides with restraint, but then we don't see as much revenge as Hurd Hatfield had the chance to show. <br /> <br /> This is a very good production, where dramatization reflects the essential aspects of the novel, if not all its consequences.
