"Campfire Tales" consists mainly of three terrible scenarios that a group of friends say after a car accident after a concert. The film begins with the classic "Hook" story and is then introduced to a group of friends traveling home. They are crashing their car, putting out some burns and starting fire in small abandoned chapels, waiting for someone to heat the aid through fire. As time passes, they decide to start talking about classical horror stories, terrorized honeymooners, a girl who has fallen victim to the Internet, and a driver who hides in a haunted house. As they talk about shameful stories, every story becomes more and more frightening, but the real shock that awaits them is still ahead ... <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the last story they say is probably more frightening and had some real scary effects. The first story was correct and the sequence of motor vehicles was a bit scary. Another story built a lot of intercourse, more than any other, but it's a unigenous plot of this drop. I remember watching this movie a long time ago when I was like HBO eight years old and the third story scared me out, though it's not scary for me right now. You will probably know some of these stories, especially Amy Smart's "hook" story and Christine Taylor as one of the main actors in the movie. The complicated end was also interesting, I know I didn't see it coming, I thought it was all good. <br /> <br /> To sum up, if you are looking for a horror movie that will pay for that time, rent it, you should be happy. This is the great anthology of some classic urban innovations and the whole film is put together. It's much better than expected. 7/10
