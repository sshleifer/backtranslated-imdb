This is a great new movie that is still shown in my cinema. His director, Calabrian Gianni Amelio, is my humble view, the only contemporary Italian director with Nanni Morett, to deserve to be called big (that is, except for the old masters who are still around and sometimes still in the movies). It is my biggest regret that today's Italian cinema has been bothering since the mid-1970s, mainly due to the lack of funding and the growth of new talents that can be transferred to most areas and which makes Italy the most static industrialized country of our time producing wisely (both industrial and industrial). in a cultural sense) ... differently, for example from China. This is also the theme of Amelio's latest film. Few directors can talk to me about the real, current state of my country and the world as Amelio gets, but his pictures also have worthless timelessness and universality. And for those who are already worried that they may be slow, embarrassing and worthy - be sure: the ones I've seen are certainly not at least when you're accustomed to the quality of European cinema. <br /> <br /> Main plot overview: Vincenzo Buonavolontà is an engineer in an aging steel mill somewhere in Italy, probably in the north. He has played Sergio Castellitto, one of today's most versatile and talented actors in Italy. When a large Chinese steel producer buys some of the Italian steel industry's industrial machinery, Vincenzo, who is trying to understand himself as a non-Italian-speaking Chinese director, is trying to try and tell him that the machine is defective and its converter needs replacement. he is working on building himself. He warns them that not doing so can have very dangerous consequences. In the meantime, a young Chinese woman, Liu Hua, is acting as a translation between two men, but she seems to be trying to find enough translations for Vincenzo's technical jargon. Italy will eventually lose its patience with him, practically pushing him away and asking him to give him a Chinese-Italian dictionary so that he can translate himself. <br /> <br /> Despite Vincenzo's warnings, he will find that the Chinese factory director and his staff have returned to their country the following morning, ignoring his advice on the proper use of the industrial machine at all. Vincenzo, who is equipped with his great honesty, goes to China. And here begins an endlessly interesting highway through China, which is very topical in the 21st century Odyssey through the Asian Giant. Last day's Marco Polo's ambitions for mysterious people's secrets? Not quite. As with all Amel films, the journey becomes more important than its final mission. In fact, the way this point literally brought home, not without humor, is a cute, terrible paradox and irony that put my eyes well at the same time smiling. The spectator is considered to be secret that Vincenzo's trip was ultimately useless, but he himself does not know and goes home with a satisfied person, innocent innocent. At least, you think he's happy. Similar. <br /> <br /> Trips that Amelio's characters start to completely fall out of, and drag them to their humanity. They are for a moment without a name, status or someone who speaks to them. These topics similar to Theo Angelopoulos are also being studied in Lamerica, actually in my favorite Amelio movie, followed by the personal preference of La Stella che non c'è. In 1994, in Lamerica, two Italian rackets traveled to Albania to "do business". Just like Vincenzo, they're going to go there, do what they have to do and then back home. Instead, one of these two Italians accidentally arrives almost homeristically through this devastated land right after the fall of communism. <br /> <br /> But let's go back to La Stella che non c'è: Once in Vincenzo he's in China, he's predicting that the seemingly "simple" task of giving a converter to his new owner is nothing more than just passing on. The new location of the machine is probably almost impossible to determine if it does not start a heavy journey through China. When he comes to Liu Hua, the young interpreter, who he has treated badly as a librarian, is trying to talk to him, but he reacts hostile, telling him that he has lost his job as a translator in Italy. Liu Hua is a relatively newcomer to Ling Thailand soon after playing Vincenzo Dante's Virgil when he feels badly that he could do worse than steer and translate on an Italian trip (obviously for a constant amount of money). This young Chinese actor may not have the beauty of Ziyi Zhang or the Gong Li movie star glamor, but his charming, expressive and beautiful face creates disgusting power, intelligence, dignity and funny humor that makes his qualities difficult to forget when you see a movie. In addition, he has a wonderful emotional chemical meaning with Castellitto. <br /> <br /> Amelio weaves a serious, poetic, mythical, post-neo-realistic, and humorous drama at the same time, while maintaining the ability of heart warming to explore the mundane nature of mankind in everyday, ordinary situations. Documentary naturalness hides what is actually a carefully thought-out wall transition in the face and place, which also allows you to turn on cinematography of breathtaking beauty. The photography here is functional, but proud, because it fits with the displaced film of an industrial and emotional body. <br /> <br /> Amelio's attentive eye is adult, frustrated, but never cynical or misanthropic. The masterful corners of the camera often give Vincenzo a stranger in China's eyes, bringing home impartiality and cultural impartiality, a very rare film about the "familiar" western country that examines "foreign" non-western countries. I can't recommend this movie enough.
