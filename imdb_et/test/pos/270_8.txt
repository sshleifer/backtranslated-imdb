Since the excellent series of "major suspicions" reaches the fourth, there is no loss of momentum, which in itself is a remarkable achievement. Prime Suspect IV: The Lost Child has solid support that we take for granted in these British dramas, but of course the beautiful Helen Mirren dominates; our eyes never leave him at the time of the screen. <br /> <br /> Finding a direct lost child leads the superintendent Jane Tennison's CID team's main suspect who turns out to be a convicted pedophile who now lives with a single mother and her two young daughters. The perception that we give to our mind is one of its mini-series of emotional items, but it can be too strong for many snakes. <br /> <br /> The sequences are perfectly hand-held to hold the camera that pulled us straight into the center of excitement, and it is firming while limiting the climatic conditions. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is another great police procedure for drama.
