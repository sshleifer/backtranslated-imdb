I saw this movie for the first time only a while ago. If you ask me, he won't get what he deserves. It's a bit like the American Pie meeting with Fast Times at Ridgemont High, but deeper. He deals with the same problems as both films, but in a way that keeps him truthful. The end is sad, but that's life. I think everyone should see it. I have it in DVD format and it took a long time to find it. It should say something, heh, and the other thing I add is that finding a soundtrack is quite difficult. I believe they stopped it, but the soundtrack of this movie is amazing. It has songs from artists like The Commodores, U2, Devo, REO Speedwagon, The Cars, KC and Sunshine Band, and more.
