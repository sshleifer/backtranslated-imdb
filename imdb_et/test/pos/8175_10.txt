Very big movie. <br /> <br /> Great Love Story. A lot of sword fighting. Huge scenes of battle. Heros and villains. Real history. <br /> <br /> Few in the West know much about Chinese history. Chin Zchaundi was founded by China. The country is under his name. Some are familiar with the newly discovered Terracotta Army. This is an historic epic about how he finished the time of competing countries and united China. He founded a dynasty that only lasted for 14 years, but it was immediately replaced by the Han Dynasty, which has since consistently defined Chinese civilization. <br /> <br /> Chin (or King of Zheng, when he was known before the Empire was founded) was about the same time in the west of Scipio, Hannibal and Fabius. The parallel dominance of the Roman world (the Western and Eastern worlds) was achieved without one higher personality such as Chin. It would not be a century before Western produced Caesar - the closest comparable western indicator. <br /> <br /> Chin has been shown very sympathetically at the beginning, but he is developing into a ruthless despot. History only writes a part of a ruthless despot, but a sympathetic start leaves room for the development of a real character during this long film. The famous story of meeting an assassin is just as good as an anecdote every two thousand years. Gong Li is cute. He is the emotional core of the story. It all makes a great movie.
