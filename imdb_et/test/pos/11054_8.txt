This is an amazingly well-filmed early talk of Eugene O'Neill's games. Its main drawback is a static camera, and as a result, it will take a lot of time if the filmed game is what is regrettable because it is a part of a good primitive filming made at a time when sound was any technical problem and as a result most movies were experimental , regardless of whether it was the intention of their maker. Garbo is as mysterious and charismatic as he was in his quiet movies and his entrance is still classic. His voice is strangely deep, almost a boy who only enhances his already seductively eccentric person. Like his boyfriend, Charles Bickford is appropriately beaten - he was probably born to be a tough and perfect divine Garbole. His Irish brooch is not at all bad, and he always seems to be a sea person, a very self-characterizing O'Neill. Like Garbo's (very) confused father, George Marion really looks like a second time. He is a kind of face and voice, - open, unmanned, completely without cunning - which is lost on earth. Marie Dressler is also in O'Neill's affairs. His empty expression and intensity around the eyes speaks as volumes, because he plays his cozy character as a woman in times of psychosis. The poetic license may be because it is not a script, but we can forgive Miss Dressler for excess; he's too good not to. The story ends with moving to the next thing, separated from a resolution that is not the author's cup; and those who love to work out at the end of their films are disappointed with the real surprise. Anna Christie's in the state of O'Neill, the place of the sea, the storms and the fog, the feeling that there is an all-encompassing and unfortunate uncertainty that we now call ambivalence or anxiety disorder. Instead of analyzing this mood, the author simply and wisely presents, because the weather, the earth, the ocean and the people intertwine and come into contact with one another in a unique language we know as privilege.
