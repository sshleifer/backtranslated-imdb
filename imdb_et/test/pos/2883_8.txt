I enjoyed this movie and after it is finished, I mean it. I believe Jeremy Brett is brilliant in this role, although his "death" was a little up, but Jeremy Brett didn't like it. <br /> <br /> It's a good drama, and follow the Oscar Wildes novel very carefully. When you enjoy this movie, I suggest you also look at "Ideal Spouse" with Jeremy Brett as Lord Goring. <br /> <br /> This movie gives an insight into Oscar Wildes' mindset. Recalling how Dorian Gray is Lord Alfred 'bosie' Douglas and Basil Halward is Oscar Wilde.
