It is now 2005 and 15+ years after this comic was first released. I have not been following it seriously or carefully for about ten years. Now that I'm an adult in my 30s, I can look at the episodes again seriously. <br /> <br /> In the concept, this comic is partly a tribute to the classic Looney Tunes. your original show. There are some episodes that are structured like old cartoons. For example, a singer who attacks Buster and thus expresses revenge on the concert of this singer - just like the old Bugs Bunny comic. The next comic is similar to Looney Tunes, which is just a different timing. When they looked at the old Looney Tunes, they did a lot of things just like Tiny Toons. Old Looney Tunes made a lot of social comments and parody. There were celebrities there. There was a lot of colds, jokes, slang and dialogue. Comedy was surreal and crazy. This can be said precisely for Tiny Tones. Comedy style is "spiritually" the same. There is definitely a setback for the classics that were not made in cartoons before decades (if any). We know Tiny Toons' cultural references and we can roll our eyes if we don't like it. But the reason we don't read Looney Tunes is that we didn't live back in the 40s. Looney Tunes was back these days, but today the cartoons are over and over again. Thus, Tiny Toons is easily perceived in unfair light due to our exposure to current events and overall exposure to cartoons in general. duration of exhibitions. These are two different styles from two different periods in two very different situations - Looney Tunes is made for theaters for adults and Tiny Toons is for watching TV. However, they did a good job of making the original with original gags and still honoring and shaping after the old Looney Tunes comedy. <br /> <br /> Since Tiny Toons had much more time to play together, they were some real moments of great animated inspiration. You only have to look at episodes like 1 minute to 3, baby plucky toilet episode .. there are so many more. For example, one of the best comedy dialogue exchanges ever animated is ThirteenSomething when Babs and Buster are shared on the screen on the phone, hoping that everyone will miss. Misuse is remarkable. Especially in this episode and in many other (usually written by Deanna Oliver or Sherri Stoner) the evolution is quite good. Female characters were taken seriously as personalities and developed, unusual, in the opposite, usually for comics of the same period. <br /> <br /> It was the first modern comic that had a lot of pop culture as well as its own humor. It was before his time. Tiny Toons opened the doors for writers to take comic book freedoms that are so common nowadays that we did the boring old mess when we suffered as 80s children. Yeah, I loved Transformers and Thundercats, but Tiny Toons jumped out of it completely. It was the breath of fresh air. Bakshi's new powerful Mighty Mouse adventure can be a forerunner, but Tiny Toons made this surreal comedy movie that wrote real success. <br /> <br /> As a child, I was totally kidding. For example, one episode is a respect for the Marx Brothers that I do when I do. Now I have a new respect. There are so many inspired gags I've never noticed that are truly brilliant. It's a comedy that makes me think of Looney Tunes and Family Guy. I've never noticed such comedy as a baby. I've been thinking about this for most of the recent episodes I've been watching. <br /> <br /> You would notice such things as you look at the exhibition. Unlike other evaluators here, who I know I appreciate unfairly, I've seen all the episodes and think about them thoroughly, exhibiting both a child and an adult. <br /> <br /> You can say that there is a lot of care that the voice works. I'm not just talking about the main characters, but the side signs were also very good and creative. But back to the main characters, some of the main characters were excellent. In my opinion, Tress MacNeille had the best performances in this comic. He has not been the same. Rob Paulsen also did incredible things here. <br /> <br /> All this does not mean that the show had no bad episodes. He had a lot. He also had a lot of mediocrity. But it certainly had a lot of really funny episodes. Especially when it was first aired, it was really funny. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 I'll give you 8.5 and costumes to push the envelope and take the doors to the new cartoon era.
