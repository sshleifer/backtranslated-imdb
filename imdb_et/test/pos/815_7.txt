"Dark Date" is one of three films made by the author Vida Hurst. Many familiar faces in this old town since 1934. Mickey Rooney as an Oral Small Bank. He seems to be in a movie about candies and "family values" at home. Jane Darwell is again a mother of strong will as she was in anger grapes and an Oxbow incident. Ann Sothern is Kitty who has met Bill (Paul Kelly), but meets Rich Bob Hartwell playing Neil Hamilton, who may be better for him. You can say that this was done at the beginning of the Hays product code - at one point, Kitty says she can't be alone with her unless there is anyone else ... just a year or two before anything and everything was OK. A good solid plot, but a whole series of conversations and dirty love to talk about. This raises the question of what a girl should look for in a man; Should he keep an honest man who treats him nice, or just find a man with big bucks because most of the films from the last 20 years have supported ...? and how do men change when their situation changes? be a stranger to the violence in the dance marathon scene. Television viewers from the 1960s admit Hamilton to Batman Commissioner Gordon. Also some strange drama on the outside of the screen in some of its parts - Paul Kelly was in jail because he was guilty of the Triangle of Love. Mickey Rooney had a deal with Norma Shearer, who was 20 years old; Rooney was married eight times. Tyler Brooke (Emory) and Spencer Charters (Pa) both knocked themselves in real life. The title "Dark Date" has been repeatedly used for films, TV series, and even comics, but none of them seem to be the same plot.
