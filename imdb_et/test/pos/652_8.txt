Historical big budget flop release. This comedy inspired by Robert Altman has nice moments and sometimes inspired cast. Although it takes a long time and loses its focus completely, there are enough funny moments that keep the curious viewer in the end. If you are a fan of the characters and actors of the characters, this is a pleasure for you; You know so many terrible little-known performers throughout this movie (you may not know their names, but you know your face), the hell of a little part of the Christmas song boy. Rent Netflix, if you read it, I bet you enjoy it.
