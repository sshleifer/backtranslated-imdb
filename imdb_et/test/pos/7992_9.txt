The 1992 "Batman Returns" was Tim Burton's second round as a director, and again he hit, making this film dark and gloomy as his 1989. Gotham City is again a place of darkness and darkness, where crime and corruption boils from every corner of the street. It was also wise to see how Burton used politics as a threshold that is well-connected with the clean and business-minded businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and the plan to change the "Penguin" (Danny DeVito) Mayor of Gotham! In any case, Keaton returns as "Batman" / Bruce Wayne and gives another star as a strange and torn person who just doesn't find love in the normal world, but is challenged when he meets Selina Kyle with only a single soul. Kyle has a dark secret about his own, which is very slippery and he is just an honest vamp like sexy and mysterious but dangerous "Catwoman" (Michelle Pfeiffer). There are plan forms between both villains that destroy Gotham and most want to get rid of it. Indeed, this film, although violent and somewhat large with the scenes of many penguins, is obviously an exciting exciting journey from start to finish, because you still can't find a dumb moment and thumbs up to Tim to explore the characters both dark and contradictory. the film even more interesting. The performance by Michelle Pfeiffer was the best if no one could have played "Catwoman" better and Devito was perfect because "Penguin" was the frame of her body that fits the character just perfect, even though ghoulish was fun to watch. "Batman Returns" is an entertaining thriller that you can't look down on, because the viewer enjoys it many times, it's exciting and explosive.
