This is the latest Ghibli movie and it is also the biggest departure from studio style. First, this film was obviously aimed at young children, much more than any of their previous films. There is no depth in other movies and does it offer a completely new, less realistic style of animation? and yet it is so fun. Although nothing has been put on to attract adults, I still found myself on the screen and the story is completely story. The secret of the film is brutal honesty with the graphic and the characters. Story and characters are very early in their feelings / intentions, but it makes them even more pleasurable. Particular attention was also paid to this sound track, which is absolutely amazing, despite the fact that it differs from the earlier Ghibli soundtrack. I find that I am singing an interesting subject all the time, like someone who sees this movie!
