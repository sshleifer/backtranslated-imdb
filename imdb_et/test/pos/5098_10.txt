I love this movie because every element of it is nothing more than great. I praise some of them quickly for praise. Peter O'Toole gives us one of his great performances when he becomes the final Mr. Chips. Petula Clark has a beautiful voice and is perfect as Katharine. The director was able to bring a new story to the screen. Combine it with fantastic and creative cinematography, editing, writing, etc. and you have a film that shows the fine quality of its production. I cannot praise well-planned camera work, it moves us up and down, enlarges and reduces, gives us the best views and let the places get part of the scene. Petula Clark's last song "YOU AND I" is just 3 beautifully made and takes 2 seconds. I can understand the special care that all involved had to give to make these long scenes perfect. The music is great and the songs move the story just as they should. Leslie Bricusse is one of my favorite composers. Listen to these songs, how did someone dislike them? This is a very romantic story between two medieval people who find each other, bring each other the best, and last until the end of their lives. Excellent product value, performance, camera work and music make this movie worth watching.
