This program is the favorite of our family and we feel it must be published on DVD by the seasons !!! The title of the "Promised Land" is very appropriate, because it is a positive statement about the good state of this good country and the people who live in it. It is a "God Bless America" ​​type program with inspiring stories, old-fashioned values, underground symbols, honest and encouraging messages, beautiful landscapes and well-written humor and drama. This is an exhibition that the whole family can enjoy and benefit from - without worrying about bad language, adult issues, worry, violence, etc. We've always been blessed when we were ready to watch the episode and can't wait to see everyone again when they finally appear on the DVD!
