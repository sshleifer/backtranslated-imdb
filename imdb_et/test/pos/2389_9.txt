I was in a House of Friends for Thanksgiving and I watched a movie, Eddie Monroe, DVD. I've been a fan of Indie Films for almost 20 years (I loved brothers McMull) and impressed how good this film is. My friend who works at Magno Sound told us that this movie was shot from Super 16. Photography was so good, it seemed to be 35 mm hot. In addition, music was an art with Fred Carpenter. The story was original and led to the end that surprised us all ... very cool. The whole cast was good, especially the actor who played, Uncle Benny. He was amazing. This movie was a nice holiday package and I was happy to be one of the first to watch a movie that many will see in the future.
