The offspring are the husband and wife who have lost time in love. Fully aware of what this bizarre experience means they are trying to move on with their lives. Ukko is going to question the odd event and get help through a very annoying psychiatrist. He believes that foreigners are responsible for its extinction and that the unborn child he once thought was his alien and his spouse. <br /> <br /> When you ask me, this is a big sci-fi / horror story. A very questionable real-life scenario involving abduction and hybrid breeding by an alien is definitely the man. I love all things related to foreigners, and this story definitely gave some good ideas. So if you share interest in extraterrestrials, you should be pretty happy with the offspring. At least story-wise anyway. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie is generally quite average. On average, all participants act. Yep, even consistently amazing Mr. Dourif, who still achieves the best result. While the black head physician gives his lines really well. There are some points in Flick where some of the deliveries are worth it, or laugh, good in my book. I like to chew them and it was a bit of a nice stinky cheese, and I mean it well. <br /> <br /> Anyway, less than a star with a script, you can't really blame all the players. Especially I didn't care about the mother's hysteria for which the film went. She wanted the child so badly that she forgot and leaves everything her loving husband (who is a doctor!) Told her. It almost reached the point where you really don't care about what happened to him. <br /> <br /> Successors are Brian Yuzna's second sudden sticky Society, Society. Again, he offers some clinging effects and again he offers a very unique horror. If you are a scifi / horror or you are a fan of Dourifi and / or Yuzna movies, there is no real reason to watch this opportunity when you get this opportunity. Excellent 7 outta 10.
