As in the case of FOOTPRINTS (1975), I only learned about it by accident: it was mentioned in the LIBERTINE review (1969), which I investigated when this film rose to a similar vein in Italian television late at night; by the way, I left this LIBERTINA screening (though I got it through the same channel later), but I was able to watch the movie by renting English dubbed R1 DVD at the time I was in Hollywood at the end of 2005 / early 2006. In fact, considering its enthusiastic review, LIBERTINE slipped - being too light in nature, which was essentially a serious issue (sado-masochistic relationship between a young couple); Frankly speaking, I'm afraid most of the time went into the same route, but later it was redeemed with an evil (if not exactly unpredictable) final twist. <br /> <br /> The film touches on the social attitudes and dazzling creative art of this age: the prominent philanthropist (Philippe Leroy) invites a female journalist (Dagmar Lassander) in his fashionable home for the weekend; but it turns out that he is a misogynist who trusts all the opposite sex members and dominates (or even kills)! Therefore, in the first half of the narrative, we see the heroine who lasts pain and humiliation in Leroy's hands (including being forced to love the dummy in his own picture!)â€¦ Until the tables are finely but surprisingly turned: he not only frees himself from his control, but teaches him that man and woman can harmoniously exist - except that Lassander also follows his own personal action plan !! <br /> <br /> The wires are completely cast and the film itself is often comic for moods; moreover, it is greatly influenced by the typically effervescent Euro-Cult score (ever more reliable Stelvio Ciprian) and imaginative - even appearance - (gigantic structure that depicts the lower part of the female form with a steel trap) if her sexual organ is supposed to be that it comes from Freud: by the way, this proportion was prominent in the photos I saw earlier in the LIGHTED WOMAN ... but it barely registers correctly!). Other bizarre touches include the uneven radio program "Sexual aberrations and stars" and the idyll in a castle belonging to the Leroy family, where there is a secret passage in the wardrobe and dwarfish. One of the most important items is the Lassander erotic dance practically naked - an episode that actually drives Leroy's "humanization"; Finally, in the two characters, "showdown" is the last show of the last show - a fun Western-style theme from Spaghetti! <br /> <br /> In the long run, the film will be the same as the masterpiece of the same but much more extreme Yasuzo Masumura BLIND BEAST (1969) in terms of style. Finally, it is worth noting that INTERNATIONAL WOMAN was distributed in the US by Audubon Films, a filmmaker in the United States, Radley Metzger; he would even use his own product designer (Enrico Sabbatini) for his CAMILLE 2000 (1969)! To look at the revised version: In addition to the usual shortcomings in the English-duplicating department, the presentation at this point was quite detrimental to the wash and the short cases that disturbed the side noise on the soundtrack! By the way, it seems that the film's driving time is somewhat confusing: its length from various sources ranges from 84 to 108 minutes - but it can be said that my copy was 87 minutes!
