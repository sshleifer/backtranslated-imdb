I'm deliberately biased because I see this movie, but I loved it and I'm only about seven scattered in a minute and I'm not nearly the most interesting part of it. The film is an honest and intriguing group of independent filmmakers trying to make a lovable movie. It is also an understanding of swollen expectations and a fallen hero. Interviews are well-compiled in editing. Different people are all interesting and one person is never too much. Interviews also capture a rather interesting fashion, keeping the film visually satisfying. Definitely worth the movie. I hope it goes around.
