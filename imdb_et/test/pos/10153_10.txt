Am I the only person who believes this American version is much better than the 1934 English movie? There is no intercourse in the English version, an antique and very low budget, and it has unusual behavior (except Peter Lorre). The 1956 version shows James Stewart as "innocent" in addition to top-notch values ​​and gives Doris Day his best role. Particularly remarkable is the music - the music of American film is almost classic; compare both "Albert Hall" sequences and agree that Bernard Herrmann's music is much more exciting than the original version (although it is basically the same music!). The only mistake in the 1956 film is a ridiculous meeting I would appreciate all the arguments that could prove to me that the English version is better.
