The struggle at Elderbrush Gulch was Griffith's longest and most expensive short, which he had done so far. In this we see that he is trying to perfect a wide-ranging action scene that would be necessary for his full-length functions, packing all the elements that had made his previous short pants successful. <br /> <br /> Griffith uses Western format? an ideal background for clean, straightforward action? for his first epic battle. Like many Westerners from the 1910s, the starting point is a character outside the West? a device that may have helped the audience in the desert, and here are the eastern children who were important for this type of picture. For Griffith, you couldn't have a vulnerability action and here he was introduced when the children returned from the East, Lillian Gish as "the only baby in town", and even some puppies who are in danger of ending up with the Indians menu. <br /> <br /> All of this paves the way for an extremely complex and layered sequence of activities, stirring the trap of a heroine's scenario and rescue, and the battles that Griffith had been depicting in earlier years of civil war images. Here's the phenomenal amount, and Griffith is doing very well to maintain all sorts of speeds and keep everything coherent and logical. However, collecting x-elements in an action sequence does not necessarily make it more exciting several times, no matter how skilfully they are, and Griffith created a better and more tense-soaked finale before and after. But even the image of Griffith, which is so strongly focused on action, would not be without his drama, characterization, and atmosphere. In the Gulch Battle of Elderbrush, the emotional structure is brief but economical. First, we have a scene where wafers leave their homes. The trolley they drive away from the camera using depth and distance to express their movement in safety and civilization. The equally effective scene is where we introduce Gish, Bobby Harron and their child to a young family. The townspeople move over the valuable tot, then drive off the screen, revealing that two Indians looked at them from the background, adding dangerous little signs of danger. <br /> <br /> Of course, many viewers today drew attention to the battle of parental Gulch's alien native Americans (unlike the more sympathetic Red Man's View), but perhaps not all that seems. First, look at the vest of the son of the Indian chief? it is black and covered with shiny white spots. It looks like a pearl-like king jacket that may be a bit warmer for the climate. Now, look at the "Dance of War" that they later present? he has some "brown mother" air on his knees. These are not Indians, they are cocktails! So it should not be offensive to the Indians. Just cocktails.
