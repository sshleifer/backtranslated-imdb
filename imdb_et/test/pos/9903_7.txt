I was lucky enough to catch this movie at the Phoenix Film Festival and I have to say that I was very pleased. When I asked the director if he had attended the Film School, I was very impressed that he wasn't. Such films do not come from people without talent. Starting with ads and then comedy in the heart-sensitive family is a real range. I will definitely follow what he does. As a good indie movie, the film should be very characteristic. Like your average Hollywood movie that has mostly been on the plot. The film focuses on the Jewish family in New York, Applebaum, who has all been called back by their father's "suicide party". The film is in stock, full of funny, fast, timid, dialogue. The small Jewish family is immersed in the "real" situation of the "suicide" party of the Jew and anyone who is Jewish. Director Jeff Hare is doing a great job of pulling characters out of actors and bringing them on the screen. The production design brings the kits to life, paying close attention to small details that make it a place that has been home for 40 years. Editing keeps the dialogue in such a way that it makes you sit, thinking who is going to stabilize, who's next spiritual phrase or stroke. And, if appropriate, the film slows down to let the audience dive somewhat deeper into the meanings and motivations hidden inside these lovable stars. If you're a fan of Woody Allen or movies like "as good as it goes," watch this movie.
