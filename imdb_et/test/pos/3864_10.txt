A retired old rich opera song in Paris in 1910 decides to give his lucky cat Duchess (Eva Gabor) and his kittens to his fortune, but the jealous butler Edgar comes up with a plan when he robs cats and leaves them on the ground. Fortunately, with the help of street and independent tomato, named Thomas O'Malley (by Phil Harris), they help them get home especially with their good friends, such as the swinging "Scat Cat" (announced by Scatman Crothers) and try the foil Edgar plans. <br /> <br /> Very entertaining and vigorous post-Walt Disney death animation with a few nice jazz music, such as the memorable "Everybody wants to be a cat", engaging in good voice and some fantastic animation for that time even during these computer animation times . Not one of the biggest Disney animated movies, but the cult of Disney animated fave and one of the few days that works well, highly recommended.
