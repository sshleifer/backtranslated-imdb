After studying in Western history, when I was a student at college, seeing World War II positions quite uncomfortably and completely wrong. During World War II, the world's most graphic and bloody affair was. Although the axes committed a lot of crimes against humanity, which are still in today's view, and many people forget that not every German soldier was destroying the Jewish population, not every Japanese soldier turned around the samurai sword and flew kamikaze missions and not every Italian soldier was a fascist. Most of these soldiers were ordinary people like you and I was trying in a terrible conflict and just happened to fight for the country they loved. <br /> <br /> The Battle of Stalingrad was probably the most deadly battle in the history of the world with over 150000 victims during the battle. The film Stalingrad follows the German group and its leader Lieutenant von Witzland as they have been relocated to the eastern front to fight the Soviets in Stalingrad. Von Witzland has two main men, Rollo and Fritz. They are all normal men and seem to be fully aware of what is happening in Germany and Poland. <br /> <br /> The film follows the battle. The film is very grim when it comes to depicting the battle and the lives of soldiers during the battle. We have been shown a lot of terrible battles and intense violence outside the battles (including the order of the shooting group). In general, battles are the first examples that I know are the consequences of the loss of limbs and the deaths and violence of their entire face. Much of the inspiration to save Ryan's battles seems to have come from this movie. <br /> <br /> The goal of this movie is not to make all innocent in the movie innocent of German innocence. Many high-level military victims are depicted in the usual view, most people use it, evil. Most soldiers are just ordinary people who often talk about home. The film explains quite quickly that not all Germans were responsible for what happened during the Holocaust, most countries and armies were not fully aware that genocide was taking place. The film explains that German soldiers just fought because they did not really understand and wanted to return home, rather than freeze at a negative temperature in Russia. <br /> <br /> The movie really shows how the hellish war is, especially in World War II. Battle scenes shock you with your sharp realism, and the story is quite easy to follow because you just follow the group during the battle. As with most war films, no good luck is expected after that. This will leave you a little depressed when you see the life of the East-front soldiers the most. Not recommended for children. <br /> <br /> 4/5 stars
