If we forget the technical problems associated with this early (1930) sound film, such as John Wayne's sound quality and from time to time, it is thought that this film is epic, which is more realistic than almost all films made since then. Starting from Missouri, there are large wagons, people and animals in the wagons of Conesto west. Wagons are pulled in front of large rocks and run through a flooded river, which has a significant risk for wagon riders. The Indians meet Wayne and allow the train to cross their land. Later, the Indians gather from the train west to fight them. Wagons form a huge circle with horses and cattle in the circle and shoot their rifles, creating a circulating smoke veil of Indians. <br /> <br /> When the battle ends, the bodies will be buried on the ground and people and wagons will leave. This scene is remarkable because the camera stays with the dead when the living leaves. It is unique in a way that binds the viewer dead and separates the viewer from the living. Wagons face a heavy thunderstorm with tear and mud everywhere. Finally, they reach their destination near the red or lake forest in Oregon. The film is made on a 70 mm wide screen with a ratio of about 2.0: 1 (1930!). <br /> <br /> I have not mentioned a plot because it is secondary to landscape size and tremendous work in making this film. In order to make such a movie or movie, the exercise practitioners will never do it again. Given the technical limitations of sound, music is moving from time to time, for example, when Wayne leaves her girlfriend's killers and ends. <br /> <br /> While all the critics talk about search engines and Wayne's psychology, racism, short-term character, and complicated characters, the Big Trail tells us a story about simple people who face extreme difficulties. One of the best Western countries I've seen.
