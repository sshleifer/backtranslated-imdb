Aaron Carter plays in this movie a pop star (J.D. McQueen) (surprise surprise). This is a typical movie, where the leading lady (Jane) is a drunken drunk on JD McQueen's pop star (like many other girls), but she's happy she's spending days with JD and making a relationship with her, which is more of a fantasy. J.D. You must go to a public school to keep your math grade in order to make your summer vacation. The problem is J.D. She thinks that the smartest person in school (Jane) teaches her. Jane's instructors and love for J.D.D. also fall in love, but J.D. screws and needs to do everything to make the girl win and have a summer excursion. The film is definitely worth it. Aaron is a great actor !!!
