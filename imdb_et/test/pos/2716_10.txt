In spite of Park Avenue, I responded to the suggestions, throwing the film as a clich√© theme for extreme emotional dramas and overall action. <br /> <br /> From time to time, movies like 15 Park Avenue come. wipe you off your feet. <br /> <br /> The film takes your attention quite early and after that there is no time to rest. Aparna Sen has done an excellent job of gluing the audience to every movie line. Proper character development, "just right" number of emotions and mysterious end that all fit ... <br /> <br /> I respect Konkana Sen Sharma, who convincingly plays schizophrenic Mith. She wins once more after Page-3 and Mr. & Mrs.Iyer's expectations. The role of Prof Anjali is very well developed and Shabana is completely fair in its nature. Rahul Bose, Shefali Chaya, Waheeda Rehman adds an incredible taste to the film. <br /> <br /> I define "moments of the shower" as a way of thinking about the scene from the scenes, meditating indefinitely in your shower until your wife / girlfriend / mother bangs at the door. 15PA offers a lot of "shower moments", especially the conversation between Anjali and his mother, where Mom is careful with Anjal's thoughts. It immediately brings out Anjali's personality. <br /> <br /> The end is a very bold statement by the director; likely to be too western for an Indian audience; still offers elements that promote the movie from "good" status to "very" state.
