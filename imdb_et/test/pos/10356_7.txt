America's final entry in the filipino horror film series "Blood Island" concerns the fictional ruler Abdul Amiri (Reed Hadley). He dies of cancer, but he has understood how to bring him back: put his brain in the donor's body. The responsible crazy doctor (Kent Taylor) puts it in a highly unlikely body: the face-loved giant servant Gor (John Bloom). A friend of a doctor's doctor is trying to solve things and stop the plans of mad doctors. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers Samuel M. Sherman (producer) and Al Adamson (director) organized several actors previously, including Taylor, Adamson's sexy wife Regina Carrol, Angelo Rossitto, Zandor Vorkov and Vicki Volante. They tried to feel the feelings of the previous "Blood Island" records, but it can be said that it was a state. Though it may not be a "good" movie, it is a bunch of fun elements to add to your entertainment. Evil dwarf (Rossitto), gory operations, pretty convincing makeup work Bloom, political intrigue sub-block, caves full of cave networks, etc. The narrative is actually quite cohesive, the plot's twists are thrown here and there. I think it might have been a bit of a cut; some scenes are dragging. But it's fun moments and people who have ended up may not wait. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad thing. Both Taylor and Rossitto are fun; the latter looks pretty good in his role. Volante is Attractive and Williams is O.K. heroic role. In any case, it's nice to see all these familiar faces in one of these films. <br /> <br /> Extremely special, but trashy B as "horror" (I use the word loosely, none of it is a scary movie, it will definitely amuse. <br /> <br /> 7/10
