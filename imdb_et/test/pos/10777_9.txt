Oliver Stone hits the bull's eye with this film, mainly supporting Bogosiani's extreme screen presence and biting, brilliant scenario. Every moment, it breaks constantly with increasing tension, pulling itself into a truly memorable movie experience. If ever there were signs of a writer and a director's ability to combine two very volatile temperaments into a smooth connection of creativity, then that's it! The result is a wealth achievement that is now more timely, perhaps due to the disturbing fame of our culture and its distorted interpretations. <br /> <br /> The ultimate accusation of the growing illness of our society and the self-harming hunger is the next great thrill. <br /> <br /> The film is not just forgotten. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the darker side of human nature.
