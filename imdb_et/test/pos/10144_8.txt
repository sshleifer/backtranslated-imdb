Unfortunately, due to the slow start, I can't say it's one of Hitch's best movies. However, this is very good. The films celebrate Jimmy Stewart and Doris' day as parents who get the police on the plot and try to get their kidnapped son back. Both give great results, of course not surprising. Really, I was most impressed with Hitchcocks' amazing music usage. The climax of the opera house was fantastic and the use of a live orchestra to create music and a break at the same time was a pure genius. This scene showed an absolutely fantastic relationship. Doris Day's song "Que Sera, Sera" was also great. Especially when it is put on the scene at the end of the movie. So, this film ends with Hitchcocks, which is the best use of the music that has been seen to date. Unfortunately, it was a slow start or I could have suggested this movie a little higher. Even then, it is still worth it. 8 out of 10.
