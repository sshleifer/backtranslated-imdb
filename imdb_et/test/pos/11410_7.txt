Simon Wests pg-13 thriller about a nanny who gets distracting prank calls while sitting on a mansion is neither original nor exciting enough to call a good movie. Although there are some mid-term reviews, good eye candy, and decent characters, the movie is another thing I know what you did last summer, because it's not taken seriously. The performances were decent, but there is nothing special about this flick, I say skip if you are not looking for a mediocre movie, you can sometimes find better movies in life, maybe not life but at least USA or something, haha. ... <br /> <br /> 7/10
