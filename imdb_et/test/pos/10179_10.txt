Millions of gold travel by train to the US Treasury. Traveling is Lois Lane to report. On the way, the train's hidden thieves are attacking. They separate the car from armed guards and attack the rest. This leads to a struggle between the rest of the guards and the thieves. Thieves conquer them, but then Lis Lane jumps in. He wins the thieves out of the train (in one place with a gun), but the train starts to take care of the control. Lois can't stop it and thieves stop for gold. Good thing Superman is on the way! <br /> <br /> Fast, exciting and swapping. Probably one of the best cartoons. Just great.
