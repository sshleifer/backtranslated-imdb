I was stunned with this movie. Later I didn't even want to see movies for a long time - not all other films would be so satisfying. <br /> <br /> For many, it may be the worst of Antonion â€” a very slow, unattractive traditional story, microscopic research on human emotions and interactions, and the worst Wenders-verbs, confusing transcendentalism. It consists of short different episodes related to the consciousness flow of a typical hero of the Wender's hero, so that it does not stop the temporary cinema. <br /> <br /> But for the fans, the worst best and divorced story draws a single poetic picture that stretches over the film. Wenders and Antonioni create a discourse between the segments that look for things in the heart. <br /> <br />
