This film is cordial in the surreal Ã  la Lynch and Jodorowski spheres - an atmosphere that is strangely convincing, captures the viewer with the dream intensity of his pictures. <br /> <br /> Talking is a narrative - the narrator is trapped behind a painting (adjacent to a bed) who often speaks for it, speaking of his wishes and reasons. Yes, Beardsley sounds like that. <br /> <br /> There are some bugs, but its strengths are beyond its weaknesses. The queue where a woman broke out of bed and slips over the floor, trying to escape, leaves you breathless. <br /> <br /> The film has air-to-air; and it should be considered the disabling cry of the gut of the 20th century. <br /> <br /> Find this movie and swim in it.
