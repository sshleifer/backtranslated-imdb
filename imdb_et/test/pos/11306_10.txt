I usually try to avoid Barbie movies, but it was unbelievably fantastic. Tissue with graphics and character voice. Everything flowed well. This enchanting story is a great spin for others, but it's worth buying! I have no children, but the kids I find in child care (including boys) are interesting and love the extra features of DVD. I don't know why it's so low, but for kids, especially your Barbie lovin '8-year-old loves it. It's not straight forward and predictive like most movies. This "children's film" is an excellent morale and shows teamwork. It has no letters, romance (if you are old enough to figure it out) and a beautifully written story. That's why I give him ten out of ten!
