This film revolves around the Arab leader (Amir), who dies and wants to live. So Dr. Lloyd Trenton transplanted into Amirs brain as a "ready" participant. But in the cellar of doctors, his dwarf assistant, Dorro (Angelo Rossitto), carries the blood of young girls for doctors. At the same time, Dr. Llyod pays a man who kills people who helped Amir (which is Reed Hadley, Grant Williams and several unknown bodyguards). Grant is the only survivor when his car falls off the road. Although this has happened, doctors are being sent to other assistants by Gorile to get the body into amir and hurt him so badly. Meanwhile, Grant Amirest finds her "girlfriend" Regina Carroli and tells her the story. Grant sees the man who drove him away, and Dorro kills him. Then, as Gor didn't get the body, D. Llyod puts Amirsi's brain in Gorsse, which is scattered. Then go to the Grant and Regina Doctors Lab <br /> <br /> ------------------------ SPOILERS ------- --- --------------- Find out his secret. Soon, Amir (Gor) will struggle to kill people and the confusion that I think is on the plot of Dr.Llyod's brain-ray weapon that hurts Amir's command. It turns out that Dr.Lloyd wants a country where all scientists can work without the law. That's how Regina dies. Finally, Amirsi's new body (I think) is a new country blah blah. <br /> <br /> I still can't finish, but generally it was a very enjoyable smell. On this film, Grant Williams is in his second to last film roll. I recommend it to Al Adamson fan or if you like Brain.
