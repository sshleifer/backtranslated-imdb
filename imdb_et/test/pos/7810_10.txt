There have been very few comedy films in the history of Hindi cinema. Andaz Apna Apna is one of them. The film is based on a very simple story of two poor young men (Aamir and Salman) who dream of enrichment, marrying a millionaire daughter (Raveena). Aamir and Salman Khan are trying their best to cross each other and Raveena. The plot will thicken when Paresh Rawal & Co intends to take over all the wealth. The movie is very fast and very funny. Rarely does Hindi comedy come as funny as smart. This is one of the few movies with Amir and Salman (probably the only movie!). Unfortunately, it didn't succeed in the office and we may never see this caliber movie. Aamir Khan is great in the film and has shown his versatility as an actor in this film. Salman Khan gives you a very good low light. Raveenal has a convincing role in a confused rich girl and Karishma, who is an assistant / friend of Raveena, is also funny. Only Paresh Rawal, Junior Ajith, Shakti Kapoor, Deven Verma, Jagdeep and Tiku Talsan add to the taste of the movie! All in all, the best Hindi comedy ever made, and I want them to make better quality movies. You want to watch this movie over and over again. old and new) etc.
