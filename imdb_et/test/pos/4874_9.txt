The first film at Fangoria Festival in Vegan and the most challenging. It's not a movie for everyone. Several of the following films used classic horror formulas to predict predictable stories. This picture seemed decisive to do your thing. <br /> <br /> Tom Savini showed some comic strips as a top thug. He dominated every scene where he was, sliding his cover like Leslie Neilson, who played Draculat. It was nice to hear his explanation after the movie. He had such a good sense of humor. <br /> <br /> I was glad I didn't have too many predecessors because the movie offered a lot of surprises. The story was funny and profane and unusual. There was a lot of love. The most important thing was this strange edge. Unlike many movies that followed and tried to use a similar classic horror, it was a film that used its purpose. <br /> <br /> The Fangoria Festival had a lot of movies with a bigger budget. but no one dared to be different.
