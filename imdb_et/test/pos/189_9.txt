This is a fantastic movie. Action is one of the best I've seen. Tatiana Samoylova is obviously very beautiful and she will automatically draw your movie with her credible action. Cinematography was extremely ahead. Looking at it, I saw the cinematographic parallels used today. This is a truly groundbreaking movie. Because of cinematography and exhibition, the audience may feel that the sound signal changes from beginning to end, changing the tone of the film environment. This is a very touching and powerful piece. My friend told me it should be, and I definitely agree with her. This is one of the movies you watch and never forget. Everyone should see this intense movie. It should be put on the list of "Movies to watch before ________ (any)".
