Age cannot capture the beauty of this East-West love story for me. Listening to the famous and beautiful title song and its lyrics, we have two dramatic biographies related to two remarkable people caught with counterattacks at the moment, related to social correspondence, big rehearsal, war, suspicion, and the need for immense courage. Against the background of Hong Kong, this film talks about a Eurasian doctor and a US journalist who meet and fall in love during the Korean War. Mark Elliott, William Holden is intelligent, windless and a bit weak; Jennifer Jones is probably almost perfect, like dr. Other great casts are Torin Thatcher, Isobel Elsom, Murray Matheson, Virginia Gregg, Richard Loo, Soo Yong, Philip Ahn, Jorja Curtright and Donna Martell; many of Hollywood's best oriental actors also played smaller illegal parts. John Patrick's Manuscript was carefully followed by Han's fine novel; Henry King's direction was as sure as ever. The nature trail is how Han wanted to fall in love with Elliot, his busy and demanding schedule as a doctor and his doubts about their future; and how he was afraid, despite the intolerance and the disturbances they faced when their affair became known. The film is undoubtedly physically occupied, interesting and often beautiful. The mountain where the lovers are leaving is a beautiful bay where they swim, against an already busy and overcrowded business city, with great social events and full of streets, hospital corridors and traffic-filled arteries. Leon Shamroy, Ben Nye Makeup and Helen Turpin's hairstyles, which are great creative artists, sound and lighting, the art department, and everyone involved, must be one of the most memorable productions placed all over the city in the US all the time and one of the most difficult to shoot. But what is most remembered here is lovers, fortunately not very young, confronted with them and exactly what they are in prices - then it goes as if love is important and the conditions created for the barriers of love are not. The climax of things is Mark's war; after that, Han will receive his letters after he knows he has been killed; they look right on the messages. A world where hope is all that is important, courage is the price of the entrance to this world, and it is always in the summer on a high and windy hill, separated and higher from a zone where beauty and individual desires can fall victim, miserable or disappointed by criminals . Truly love is with many brilliant things, Dr. Han says; and this film is one of the studies that are shining evidence, gentle as a pearl, timeless as a Chinese proverb and cute as polished jade, which is a tough background.
