The episode begins on the shores of dead dead woman scenes, abandoned Jim, who walks along the beach that has disappeared in reverie and at night in a home ending in murder and riddle. Yes, it is a small number of atmospheres that are difficult at the end. Jim does well to explain what is a priori unexplained case where a woman is going to disappear in 20 seconds after entering her home. Certainly, a possible explanation has been drawn a little further. Why, for example, go for a woman's shift between driving, if just her rubbing AND her companions had been so simple and left no trace. But they niggles aside, this is a catchy TRF episode full of inventions, even though YET AGAIN Jim puts the frame in an increasingly suspicious police department, I want to say that thankless and so has ever sat down and read how many of these files have been solved by expensive Olympic Jimbo?
