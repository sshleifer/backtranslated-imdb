There's someone who's been there, but only when you've been there. Excellent performances by Meryl Streep (of course!), Renee Zellweger and William Hurt. Many people have said that this is an uncertain family. silence. To not be dysfunctional, it would be dysfunctional! You lose your family as you know if something can be worse? People have to see this movie, so when they face this nightmare they can change the way they do it. Maybe they see that Dad denies himself for a valuable time if he never gets a chance. Maybe they understand how hard it is to die, or to see someone you love to die. They didn't miss a nightmare, it's hard to forget.
