This is an example of what film school teachers would call a good debut film. It follows all the rules. Short scenes, point-to-point, cheap shoot, guerilla-making, kits (simply used buildings) and maybe an empty hospital wing. The black-and-white film was also a brilliant stroke, probably more likely to be chosen for its low cost than film effect, but it worked. <br /> <br /> Reno was amazing as Brute. Everyone's action was great. The plot was simple and efficient, and you didn't leave any dragons. A tight, well-designed and cost-effective budget movie. <br /> <br /> Published in 1983, it would have been preceded by the great art of speculative speculation that the Hollywood film engineer improved and film making was more exclusive and therefore more difficult and needs the right people in the right place than the world of today's internet connection, so Luc Besson it should have done quite a lot of negotiations and allowed to keep the result, which makes the final product even more remarkable. <br /> <br /> But the French film industry has always maintained an excellent reputation (yes, I know Luc Besson is Belgium, but the film is French) and it has been the source of many Hollywood transformations. <br /> <br /> If I have one criticism, the DVD image (and perhaps the original sales post) is not like a movie and seems to be a strange image as any movi - any thing at first glance is a swing in an apocalyptic gun, but in a second review, a man finds a armor with legs in an office chair behind a desk at the desk. confident posture. It will never happen in the movie ever. <br /> <br /> This is a black-and-white film, a zero dialogue, physical behavior, a dense scene and brilliant actors making this movie worth its own private collection. Great movie.
