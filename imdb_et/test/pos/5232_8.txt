The release of this film for 8 is compared to other full-length films from 1930 onwards. Only a few years later, according to film standards, this film can only get 6 or 7 scores - mainly because the sound quality was so poor. Now it is possible that the film sounded better and the Fox Movie Channel did not show any degraded printing (DID has many lines and scratches), but I assume that the problem is always a problem. The reason for this is that the sound of the films was still novel in 1930, and many of the 1930s Hollywood pictures sounded awful - background signs drowned in wires often, characters trying to get them to receive microphones or contradictory qualities (like what was seen in BISHOP MURDER CASE, HELL'S ANGELS and other daily films). It was much worse because a large part of the movie was shot outside - something that was outrageous at that time. Quite innovative, but also something that really gave good technicians talents! So, although it was very difficult to listen to the movie, I realize that they had to start somewhere, so I can forgive it - especially since the outdoor conditions are breathtaking - a great innovation in 1930. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite similar to CIMARRON - the west who came out next year and won the Oscar for the best picture. Unfortunately, CIMARRON is not such a big movie, and I like BIG TRAIL more because of the size of the movie. While some may stay at a slow pace of BIG TRAIL, I saw this great history lesson from the difficulties that people traveling on wagon trains carry to the West. In addition, the whole thing seemed so beautiful when director Raoul Walsh went into considerable difficulty in placing the film, and LARGE TRAIL looks like a film version of some of Ansel Adams' prints. <br /> <br /> As for the example, it was pretty good. It was a big break for young John Wayne - because his previous screen performances were at best small and unobtrusive. Here he took the lead and made a dandy job - although he was probably young and a little less "John Wayne-ish" when he was in later films because his screen person was not yet firmly established. Another interesting part was played by Tyrone Power II (father of Tyrone Power). He didn't see anything like his very beautiful son and saw and sounded almost like the cartoons of Bluto Popeye! He made very few sound films - he died only a year after making this film - so it is a rare opportunity to see and hear the famous actor once. <br /> <br /> In general, the film has some sound problems and some too long scenes here and there. By 1930, it was a remarkable achievement - more than the most famous and award-winning CIMARRON made next year. Much of the reason why BIG TRAIL could not win the Oscar was probably because ALL QUIET ON WESTERN FRONT came out in the same year and it is really one of the great movies.
