This film is one of the only historical documents showing the talents of so many black singers, actors, actors and dancers. Many who are no longer with us. Those we bless today to enjoy thanks to this film allow us to recognize the talents that existed at that time. Therefore, those people who live today are also superstars who are dead. Because of the history of music, drama, filming, design, singing and the like, this film belongs only to people in that country. <br /> <br /> I recently watched this movie. The sound was great! The film seemed complete, the color and clarity were the ticket prices, but good considering how old this film is without frames. I agree with all the previous positive reviews. I have no negative views. <br /> <br /> I would just like to make one application. Please, to whom this is a concern, please make this film available to everyone with such historical experience.
