Virtual dual-handed and set during the day (you can see the origin of this stage and even how it should function as a radio show), and although it is only 77 minutes, he played with real similar sequences. time. Robert Ryan is a psychopath who keeps East Lupine home. Both are superb, especially underpriced by Lupino, whose initial independence and self-control collapsed quickly before Ryani's relaxed intruder. Of course, this would be all guts and gore, but the limitations shown by director Harry Horner (much better known as an art director) only increase what is sometimes worth Hitchcock.
