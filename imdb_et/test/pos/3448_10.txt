This movie is great - especially if you have visual art. The landscape that the two daughters paint and the pictures are beautiful. The story is occasionally both funny and amazing. <br /> <br /> People who like European films and "art films" like this movie. It's really an art film - it really has a lot of art. Go for rent. <br /> <br />
