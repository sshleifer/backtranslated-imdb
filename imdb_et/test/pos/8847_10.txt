For me, a ten-star movie is one that never dies in my memory, and it can be viewed over and over again with the same joy as the first time. This can be a technically faulty film; pleasure has nothing to do with spitting (my personal top ten is the slightest!). John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the very few films that fit this criterion. <br /> <br /> I have been a fictional fan because I was a child of the sixties and read a short story of John W Campbell on which the film is based ("Who's Going There") before I saw the original black and white Howard Hawks movie (like many people that watching TV was illegal when I had to be) in bed!). This film, as much as you see in such circumstances as a child, seemed almost perfect: temporary, unexplained, alien nature, photography; it all seemed to work. I looked at it several times in the coming years (and still when it is shown on TV). That's why I avoided the Carp version for years - I see that my favorite film remakes are always a mistake. When I finally saw it in 1988/90, then again on television, because there was nothing else, I realized I had to "always make a mistake" to make "usually a mistake"! Carpenter was nothing but the original story of the original film and truly wonderful. Helicopter and husky opening point, dog-pound visually disturbing scene, to the end (sorry, there is no spoiler!), I was hooked. The soundtrack lives with me - everything I have to hear is close to the similarity with this bass-over-snare drum beat and I'm * in the last scene ... <br /> <br /> Until I saw "The Thing" I had a Carpenter just a second gore monkey, based only on comments and comments in the mainstream press. Since you see "The Thing," I think I've seen most of my movies - I haven't done that, but when someone appears, it's enough to look at the director to see my name. He is thoughtful and knows how to build a movie so that it reaches the point where something stays in memory. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen "The Thing" and you enjoy science fiction, do yourself a favor - sit in a dark room, warm up and prepare for a better memory!
