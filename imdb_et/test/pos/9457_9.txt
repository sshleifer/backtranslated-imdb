I've been a fan of Amanda since all this, and she's still funny. Too me, it's so easy. If you like Bynes, you like this movie. It is harmless fun and partly quite funny. Vi crazy Sebastian accent and mannersism are completely unrealistic, but made me laugh somewhat at some point that I almost blinded my popcorn. <br /> <br /> And something that gets teenagers from reading Shakespeare (maybe) is good for me. <br /> <br /> Tatum Channing is in a low note that it's pretty hot. He also does a good job with some of the toughest movie scenes. <br /> <br /> Some side signs are very wide, but on the "twelfth night" they are wide, so it's cool.
