It's a funny movie, not many. OK, the plot is a bit disturbing, but very original. A teenager who is even trying to get to his father because he hasn't sent him to the jail because he's lying to the older boy to impress how it's not funny? Plus it's not a typical movie featuring teens. The first remake I've seen is better than the original, the only problem for both: Gerard Depardieu. With another actor it would be perfect 10 because he plays all the rolls in the same way, sucks. Another problem is that all the women melt it, it is far from believable, it is not attractive!
