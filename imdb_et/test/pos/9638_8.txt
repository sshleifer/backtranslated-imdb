In my personal opinion, The Patriot is one of the best films by Steven Seagal. <br /> <br /> I've heard people say it's the worst, it's not like SS, and so on. I do not agree. As a great spiritual person, the great captain Seagal brought a good film experience. He always has a good background, great activity, high professionalism and smart message. This movie is everything. You have good shooting places, great aikido. Although not much, it shows us a peaceful side. This change in the making of his film proves only his spiritual growth (he eventually does not kill a Chisolm friend). <br /> <br /> "Patriot" is definitely one of the best movie filmmaker point of view I've seen lately. You have great panoramas of Montana, we see the true American nature and beautiful wildlife (including horses and flowers). Music also deserves some words. During the film I had a great opportunity to listen to classical American-cowboy-western music (not country). Similar music was listened to «Back to the Future Prt.3». SS's action has improved significantly since the last films. His role is unknown to him (as opposed to policemen and commands), but he does a good job of playing a retired medical government. His actions are convincing and his lines are good. <br /> <br /> I was very cast. LQ Jones proves that life and death go together on Earth, Whitney Yellow Robe plays a beautiful and smart scientist, Camilla Belle is a great look for McClaren's daughter. <br /> <br /> Mr. »Tradition and militant groups who give their opinion (he likes the Constitution, but he has nothing to do with a fat bearded man). It also highlights good points in the East-West medical system and nature. <br /> <br /> Seagale's best. And opens up your film career with new horizons. <br /> <br />
