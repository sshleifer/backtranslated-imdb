Mr. Bug goes to town, one of the films I heard, but this copy cannot be received so far. I watched this movie on a DVD and thought it was a wonderful and charming movie with great animation, a good plot and great songs. If this film was made by Disney, the film is considered classic, but because it was made from a little-known film studio that has long since disappeared, the film is split. Max Fleischer's studios made their own studio in Miami, FL and appeared through Paramount Pictures. The premiere of the film was scheduled to take place on December 7, 1941, on the date of the bombardment of Pearl Harbor. Although it probably harmed the release of the film, the film played in some cinema theaters for up to one year, as evidenced by some research. The film was called the favorite of most major American newspapers. The film was published again every year, usually during holidays, such as Easter, at least in major cities. <br /> <br /> In the mid-1950s, this film appeared under a new name. Hoppity goes to the city, "is called the film's leading figure. Animation is great and many characters are very cute. People's animation in the film is through the rotoscope process, which means that the actors were filmed and the footage was followed by animators, giving the motion a real look." /> Fleishcher Studios were one of several animation studios that make animated films in the 1930s and 40s. /> Almost as a whole, Fleischer studios are in the public domain, all Superman cartoons are in the public domain, all except the Color Classics series are public and the movie "Gulliver's Travels" is also public. but some of them can quickly make a copy when you look around the internet.
