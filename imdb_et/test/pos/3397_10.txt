For me, the North and South (books I & II) are the ultimate TV series of the 80s. Just entertaining were all coming appearances. Gene Kelly, James Stewart, Elisabeth Taylor, Olivia De Havilland, Robert Mitchum, even Johny Raha Dick Smith's prosthetics gave Hal Holbrock a more powerful result. Crafted costumes, jaw drops, everything. It is clear that nowadays there are great and bright TV series (Desperate Housewives, Lost, 24), but North & South was and still is kind of. Don't miss it. Only the portrayal of David Carradine from the ultimate cable (you may call him a violent spouse) is worth seeing. Maybe some of the characters and situations are too stereotypical, I admit it, but the positive aspects clearly shade them. I'm so glad that finally Spain is available on DVD.
