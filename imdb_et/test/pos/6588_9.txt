This movie came as a gift - in the late evening I offered a blue - so unlike other evaluators I had no idea. I found myself glued to my seat because the film slowly dictated its own rhythm, its opening. I was pulled to admit my deep love and humanity, as I wanted to "good" rule - but also forced to admit that sometimes I was on the side of "bad" boys. The film is pretty beautiful - the word "elegiac" comes to mind and more so because the film starts and ends in the elion. The film does not acknowledge my profound suffering - and then its cyclical nature - because of births and births and deaths - not far from depressing or confronting, the film marks "sometimes a joy" when quoting Aussie poet. Oh gods, I feel like I've just written a letter of love for this movie, but there is. Hola!
