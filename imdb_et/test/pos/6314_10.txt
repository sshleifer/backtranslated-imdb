I saw this movie at the Rotterdam Film Festival and I was pleasantly surprised. Photography is just as stylish and beautiful, and the story is not just your average mafia movie, but it's actually pretty much in the background. It is more of a middle-aged man's personal journey, caught in the life he was forced to live. The actor, Toni Servillo, is great, he excites this "silence". Girl Olivia Magnani is a daughter of the Italian actress Anna Magnan and lives by the family name. <br /> <br /> If you are expecting your typical Italian movie, where everyone is shouting at big families, it's not your movie. You have no average clich√©s and it's definitely worth it.
