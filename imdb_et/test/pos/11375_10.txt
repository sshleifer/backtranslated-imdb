This movie is a masterpiece. It was exhilarating from start to finish. The story of the porn star Paul Thomas Anderson, a writer-director, speaks of style, love, humor, even astonishment. The actors and the characters they play are all first-rate, including Mark Wahlberg in the lead, who will prove himself as an actor and can film. Burt Reynolds is perhaps his best performance ever as a porn director discovered by Wahlberg. In the late 70s and early 80s, the movie creates a disco scene with low precision, starting with Wahlberg's Don Johnson's "Miami Vice", which he wears in the last scene. Most traditional filmmakers who see this film undoubtedly compare with PULP FICTION, but in fact he has much more in common with Robert Altman and Martin Scorses. The film is a triumph of style. The initial impression of the film is as impressive as the players and players. Editing Dylan Tichenor is just phenomenal. I couldn't believe that editing didn't get the Oscar nomination (goodwill was a better edited movie?!). The best scene for a movie must be that equipped with parsley. I had butterflies in the stomach because the scene is incredibly intense. When I saw the movie a second time, I had the same scene reaction. Unfortunately, this television may not have the same effect as a good stereo sound in the theater. It is a disgrace that many people didn't see this movie during the theater rush because it's the best way to watch it. Using Anderson on a widescreen will suffer on television (so you get a DVD or mailbox tape). What's amazing is how easy Anderson does it all because it's just his second movie. Music, kits, costumes, photography, amazing characters, sex, violence, happiness and heartbreak are a man who is clearly in love with cinema.
