Continuing his return, John Travolta played a slightly twisted angel "Michael". He may be God's messenger, but he is not the most beautiful man, as journalists Andie MacDowell and William Hurt discover. When I first saw this movie, it was before I started watching "Everything in the Family" so I didn't know Jean Stapleton as Edith Bunker. Now that I feel like that, I try to imagine Archie capturing her angel (whom she probably is black, Jewish, etc.). <br /> <br /> I know it's not really about film. But I just want to associate such things. Anyway, it's a pretty interesting movie. Bob Hoskins, Teri Garr and Richard Schiff are also starring. <br /> <br /> What John and Paul said ...
