If you love the vampire lore and you are a gothic horror fan then you might want to look out of Soul Midnight. I didn't know much about this movie until I watched it, and I didn't expect much, but I found the movie to be fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> As Armand Assante's vampire leader Simon, Soul separates himself from other low-budget vampire knocks by knitting St. Fun in George and Dragon mythology. <br /> <br /> I am not sure what the budget of this movie was, but I feel that if it were a little more, they could have really come home and effects. <br /> <br /> If you're late at night and are a low budget vampire after entertainment, then Soul's Midnight is a good choice.
