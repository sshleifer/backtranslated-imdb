When I first saw Stella in the middle of comedy, I thought "God, it's terrible!" But I loved Wet Hot American Goblin. So I knew there was no point in it. There was nothing left for me to do, but I was looking for Stella shorts that I heard, containing more dildos than any other comedy band. When I found these not only my dildo expectations met, but I found probably the biggest comedy scenes I've seen in years. A set of twenty odd short films put me on the edge of my seat with water running down my feet. Not only did I laugh at my ass the first time I looked at them, but I continued to laugh harder when I looked at them again and again. It's really a shame Comedy Central had cable TV restrictions for the Stella series. This would be much better for HBO or Showtime. Their sense of humor cannot be limited by censors or popular culture. Even if it was in HBO, I'm sure "masses" would have voted in the season or less, but it would have been fantastic. Needless to say, I'm in love with Stella and all of her individual members now. Every Stella fan should watch David Wain's website with all his short films. They are just as enjoyable as Stella himself. So my hat goes to Michael Showalter, Michael Ian Black and David Wain for Stella's incredible comedy. I hope to see a lot more in the future.
