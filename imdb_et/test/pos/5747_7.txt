This is a very "true case" movie that offers everything almost on the face. I'm a Christian and I liked the movie in one way. It was an average person on average, and it was a small budget, as you can clearly see. It may be a bit long, but the movie has some pretty nice cars that will save me from a lower rating. It was pretty good as a Christian film, but maybe a little better in the message. The film works best on the big screen. * SPOILERS * Two brother-in-law venues may remind you of the battle between two Christian thriller "Mercy Streets" brother Eric Eric Robert. * End of spoiler * I'll give him 7/10.
