If you look at this film for nudity (as I did), you won't be disappointed. I could have done without a bow or a bear. Some bottomless nudity could have been shown, but what I thought was H.O.T.S. it must be the best of its genre. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie that could have been done today, because it's a movie that's worth these days. <br /> <br /> I would take daily nudity on the basis of key points. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that the DVD has no additional features, but because they didn't have DVDs, if it was filmed in an understandable way. I would like to know more about shooting a movie, especially when they finally shot a football match.
