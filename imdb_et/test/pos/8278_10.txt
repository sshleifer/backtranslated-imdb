If the child of your 80s has not seen the film, you are not a true child of the 80s. How you can't love these great helmets (don't forget the chippette), lines and songs. Years later I can still sing to every song. The story is great and much better than movies for kids today. It's just pure fun and worth renting, even if all of you grew up.
