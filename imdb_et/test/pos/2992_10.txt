I loved this movie! FOR GOD'S SAKE! This movie shook so hard! I found it among some old tapes and didn't know what it was and after reading the back of the lid to see what the summer came about (which btw mentioned that Elton John covered the soundtrack of the movie) more than what the movie actually mentioned .), I thought it was interesting, and I was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older film. <br /> <br /> "What controversy?" I thought to myself when I put the tape on, I was curious. And my expectations were certainly fulfilled. I love it! I think it's really girly kind of movie, but it was so cute and divine! It was a beautiful romance, though sometimes the board reminded me of the camera industry "The Graduate", which I thought when I saw it, that the director must be with some of the close companies they made with acids. /> <br /> OK, so it wasn't quite conceivable that these two kids would run down and live on their own ... but that could happen ... in fantasy ... <br /> <br /> But the end ended sincerely me! I was so crazy about how they ended it ... it leaves you hanging out, and I think they can deal with what follows them ... but at the same time I'm almost hesitant to see that because the lakes are almost never as good as the first. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to every sixteen and more! It's an awesome movie ... Awesome!
