I've seen this movie three times and I appreciate it every time. I think Jordana Brewster should have been given an Emmy nomination for her real and natural activities. Many of us who were at Phoebe at that time understand how real it is. For most of us, the romantic or karmic cynical pessimism is not quietly glowing. This is a blurry balance and this film takes its balance. It is also well designed, so it has so many fine details. Like a movie or not, based on the extremely high estimates of the demographic situation of women under the age of 18, we know that this film shows some important truth about how young women see themselves in the world.
