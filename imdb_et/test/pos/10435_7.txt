I see many comments on this movie, I have a few points to comment on, the reasons why I thought this movie was something special ... <br /> <br /> The movie is, in particular, realistic. it may not seem realistic for an adult who has forgotten what was a teenager, but it is really a superdrama that lasts all the time for teenagers. secondly, a good man, a man who treats women with respect, does not get girls. so it is, in real life the same! he's too good for himself. people are just selfish. third, it was nice to see a fat guy with confidence. I mean, this role is already an actor's trust, I'm not just talking about a character. In general, I thought the film was a positive surprise that hides the mysterious, comedy comedies of teen sex on the rental shelf. can't get me wrong, it's not all sad, it's also a good laugh.
