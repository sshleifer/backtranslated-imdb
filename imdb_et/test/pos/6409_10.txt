This movie is like bright. If it goes to a musical number that is like ALL F * CK, but delicate, like desperate. MIND FOREPLAY. The funny vibe given by the speed and despair of the characters can be pretty Kill-Yourself-Awesome UNTIL when you reach the musical number. This is a great movie. Optimistic. Weird. Manic-depressive (bipolar). That's it! This movie is BIPOLAR. still look at it. This is music !!! TERMINATION !!!! If you like an existential shape like a stranger or waiting for Godot, you probably get that real kick. I needed to get DVDs to be 12-chronically through Amazon.com. OH and songs rock. well they rock but they are not rock out there like calypso, jazz, Broadway, but Grace Chung, and i can't find the soundtrack NOWHERE <but i want the songs to be great and the dances are so fun.
