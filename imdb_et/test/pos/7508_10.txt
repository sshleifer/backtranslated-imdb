I am waiting for years for a new DVD number for this wonderful movie. I have a beta-max recording that contains French. Unfortunately, MGM leaves a French journey on his last DVD ... The French subtitle just spoke English ... I don't know how to recommend MGM: I wrote emails to them, but of course did not answer. If I emphasize that this is due to the fact that the French copying track was extraordinarily remarkable, funny, well-written, etc. George C. Scott is always outstanding and for people born in the 50s, Diana Rigg is nothing but Madonna (for example). Thanks for the help.
