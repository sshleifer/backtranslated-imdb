Okay, so I love stupid movies. If you enjoy stupid sci-fi movies, top movie or if you're a fan of Bruce Campbell, I'd go see the movie. This movie is all I wanted. Being a fan of films, it fits into the account. Every time I myself thought, "This film would be the toughest, the best movie ever, once * empty * happened ...", as I thought it would * be empty *. It's a wonderful silly 'b' movie. If you are a Campbell fan, I'd say I see it, bring your friends, laugh. This is fun. It's not classic or anything, but if it's on television at night, look at it. This has become a film for me, which I would present under "loving films". Movies that may not be good, but after a hard day, I could go home and watch (this list also includes "harold and stoop to go to the white castle", "dark army" and "intolerable cruelty") <br /> <br /> If you feel up, a wonderfully bad movie, look at it. if not, rent "Bubba Ho-tep"
