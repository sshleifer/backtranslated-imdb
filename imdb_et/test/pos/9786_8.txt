Milo is a neglected and undervalued horror strike at the end of the 90s, but the feeling and atmosphere are more than 80's horror. It seems that Milo's father, the gynecologist's office, has taken a bundle of girls who see things and paid for seeing what's in the jars (yes, gynecologist plus something else), one girl playing "doctor" Milo. Hmm, his first patient and he lost. Now Milo is a creepy little boy who always carries yellow rain, rain or shine, and he's talking funny .... but that's not all that weird about him. Fast forward to the point where these girls are adults and one of them has planned weddings, but the tragedy strikes and leaves one of the girls coming out of the city to choose whether to replace their friend as a teacher or not. he does. And then the strange things will start again. Of course, this little boy brings the rain into slicing. It's not too violent or graphic, but it's clear that you can't find it in many modern horror files, and it's worth it. One wonders why this day and age is so hard to find good horrors, but here's what has been overlooked by the offender and definitely worth your while when you control it. 8 out of 10.
