I love the mockumentary format that Chris Guest and the team have developed over the years. I really like it and "Waiting for Guffman" better than "Spinal Tap", which was the first group (and what Rob Reiner did, but was an asterisk star and several others of his mind). This humor is not for everyone. It is quite fine and not too physical, so some people may not be involved. As a dog performer (and a dog show fan) I loved this movie. There are so many funny features in it! My daughter and I quote them often. I find it amazing that these people get so much funny material for every movie! What a fun bunch must be. I highly recommend it to people who prefer their humor on the brain.
