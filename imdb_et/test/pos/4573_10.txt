Idiocracy felt that Mike Judge had taken his thoughts on society and put them on film. In fact, the film is a social comment. Almost sometimes the documentary appears. Luke Wilson did a good job of playing a boring middle river (like most of his films). <br /> <br /> Idiocracy of the course was extreme in the current state of society. But that makes most comedies funny, extreme situations. Fiction is not as different as reality. <br /> <br /> Children are praising the materialistic Hip-Hop culture and pride that they are not aware of. When people feel useless in their lives, they grow. Give them a goal in the world. And the worst people seem to breed the most. I understand how others don't like it. It doesn't help most jokes to be a 2nd class bathroom humor. Not very different from Kevin Smith's movie. <br /> <br /> Idiocrat throws away logic, reason, any intelligence (for good reason). <br /> <br /> The return of Mike's judges was crowding out.
