Stepford's children are Stepford's second best Stepford movie. I saw the original The Stepford women in the theater when he appeared in 1975. I was absolutely blown, it was terrible. I have seen all of Stepford's movies, and I like all of these. this movie was a real good watch. Barbara Eden was doing the usual job. Every role he has ever played has been very good.Barbara Eden is very good at playing roles where he is kind and caring. Murray as a man and father was just perfect in this movie. She was particularly effective when she was irritated by her father's two teenage children.
