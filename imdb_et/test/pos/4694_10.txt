Bug, I ordered a new version of Robin Hood from the BBC. Very disappointing compared to RoS. Terrible costume and background. Although I enjoyed the sheriff, who took note of Nick Grace's character, the rest of the light was much desired. "For example," Marion's costume seemed suspicious as it came from Walmart. And Mr. Guy, he looked a little bit of the look of the character in the film! Talking about this story, RoS has overshadowed attention, probably forever. Clannad's gifting, costumes, story, landscapes, filming and soundtrack are all excellent, as evidenced by the continuous feedback about 26 years later. RoS is a timeless classic. Thank you to everyone who did this series.
