I thought it was a really great movie, especially since it was stuffing for me. I was bored, got it from the library and I really enjoyed myself! I've been following it twice in two days and the more I watch it, the more I like. I thought the plot was really horny, but in the end it could be said to be true. I liked the main characters and I thought they were well cast and you see a true friendship. I thought they all did a great job. The end was good. And you really hate bad guys and you like good guys. What movie should be like.
