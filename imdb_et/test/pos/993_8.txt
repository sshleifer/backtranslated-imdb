I didn't expect to enjoy it. I really looked at it because a friend knew that a friend knew a friend who wrote a script but was not credited. knowing Dylan Thomas, and being truly his poetry appreciation, but a knowledgeable and rather amazing man, I didn't feel like I had to see his flat bohemian life expose. and it wasn't. critical and yet grateful. it made me cry. Kiera Knightley was great, even with its slightly tense Welsh accent, and it's a sad story they say. Dylan Thomas is not a hero because, unfortunately, he was not a "feisty woman" throughout his life or as a spiel. it's a deliberate movie. The man who leaves the woman loves the war they ignore. his challenge to revive this indifference is what is really interested in the beautiful results of this film and its actress. This means that this film is underestimated because it was marketed so badly. Dylan Thomas fans are waiting for something more so than a hurt hero and are getting less, and that is how it was marketed. this is not a movie about Dylan's themes and it is much more interesting to it.
