I had heard the news from this anime-legend of Hayao Miyazaki and I want to see it. But I was lucky enough to film on YouTube; After watching the movie, I knew it was another Miyazaki / Studio Ghibli classic. named Sosuke and his relationship with the goldfish princess he called Ponyo, who longs to become a human and to be with Sosuke. I'm not giving you more details, you have to see the movie yourself. So in general one of the best animated movies ever made with lots of fantasy, adventure and humor ... I loved it!
