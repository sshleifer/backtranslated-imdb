Along with the image of almost every republic that has ever been done, it seems that "Murder in a Music Pile" has unforgettably disappeared. Shameful because this lusciously produced, expertly managed, written and insidious mysterious object spins an attractive thriller against City Music Hall. In some of the buildings in a penthouse apartment, suspicious Rockette - including Vera Ralston (who offers a couple of dazzling skating product numbers in addition to interesting subtlety and vulnerability), Helen Walker, Ann Rutherford, Julie Bishop and several other 40's B-stars - are murdered. The high, blonde and beautiful William Marshall (usually in musicals) throws the killer down because a complex and increasingly horrible earlier plot opens up compared to the biggest settings that can be seen in the film's tweet. The end is the same surprise as the sadly forgotten secret of a stylish murder. It is worth to restore and revive cable TV, VHS or DVD. The Republic fell into this bumping budget in Class A production, and "Murder in the Music Hall" is just as slippery, nervous, and enormously enjoyable as the biggest studio film of that era. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Pay attention to the raps performed just before his death by the victim. Then try preaching in the dressing rooms of the play girls, which moves that deadly melody in their changing rooms. You'll find out who the killer is like William Marshall. Great fun, a movie that they don't really do, and what a loss - both for movie visitors and actors.
