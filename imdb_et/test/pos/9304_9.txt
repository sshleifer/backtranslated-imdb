Several productions speak of the development of the atomic bomb. Robert Taylor's movie "OVER AND BIRTH" (under the flag that really moves into inter-service propaganda; if you think that you think the army air force, Paul W. Tibbits, was running the whole show!), Did NBC ENAY GAY (apparently LOT closer and the BBC-TV series OPPENHEIMER along with Sam Waterston. <br /> <br /> FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY uses the same approach that the BBC series did, but extends it; it avoids Manhattan's "Gee Whiz" technology and focuses on human aspects; persons involved in the work. Instead of focusing on Oppie, it covers a wide range of mythical, but quite typical people who were part of it. </p> <p> </p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> and in a moral context ... just to be overcome by an overwhelming desire for personal power and glory. AFTER AFTER THE FOLLOWING, it was made clear that Oppenheimer saw himself as "supreme being" due to his great and extensive intellectual skill. In the end, it was Robert Oppenheimer's decline; he saw himself as a sort of "philosopher / king", a moral and intellectual superior who could (and rightly) "foresee" wisely what was best for the rest of the world. development and deployment of nuclear weapons. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, wisdom does not dictate the actions of nations or the direction of events on a global scale. Wisdom does not give time power. When he tries to use such non-existent power (when Oppie found when he was responsible for developing the "The Super", the hydrogen bomb), those who really are capable of ignoring and praising wisdom. <br /> <br /> I found myself in one direction in the Schultz symbol; his Oppie reveals himself too close and personally to the Manhattan project, despite the suspicions and fears that he tore on his intellectual basis. True Oppenheimer should have taken a different approach; at the beginning, he would have had to come to a firm resolution that the project would lead to a final good. The inconsistency that has been missed would be a random price to be paid to achieve this ultimate benefit, and it must be ignored ... at least until the end of the project when there was free time to estimate profits and losses. Oppie made this clear and it resulted in his controversial post-war statements that science had now felt sin and that it was a knowledge he could never lose. <br /> <br /> At the same time as the project goes, such considerations should be discarded if it wants to maintain its peace of mind. <br /> <br /> Because of this ambiguity, Schultz's sign is weak, a frightened little boy who could never be a "Rapid Rupture Coordinator", as Oppenheimer officially called his post. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman's lineage with General Leslie R. Groves is exciting and bravura performance, possibly with LITTLE BIT up. <br /> <br /> Groves was a civil engineer in training, but first and foremost he was SOLDIER and the general who launched! He is used to insisting that things go his way ... intensely driven, unpleasant in the mouth, spoiled child with caps in a hat drop, respecting his country and not too proud to fall on his knees and pray. In other words, very similar to REAL (ie NON civil engineer) soldiers, or George Patton! Grove's MISSION does not only come first, but his only consideration ... feelings and egos are sad, except, of course, himself. <br /> <br /> Groves couldn't admit it, but he knew he needed Oppenheimer; The military rank meant NOT in the world of theoretical physicists. Oppie was a necessary interface between the two worlds he had to hold. <br /> <br /> Again ... I have to damage this script and for the same reason. <br /> <br /> In reality, Groves are already OWNED Oppie; if he didn't, Oppie would never have been elected before. History speaks of many cases where other scientists, some stars like Oppenheimer, just went away from Grove's recruitment efforts. At one point, Groves was so desperate that he proposed drawing the necessary physicists. <br /> <br /> Grove is trying to maneuver the film and check out Oppie's were noticeable ... they exist only here as a dramatic device that really helps to make the film's atmosphere quite ugly. <br /> <br /> Kusak's "Michael Merriman" is a composite of several real characters, but they are of a different time. The POSTWAR arms surveys involved a number of investigated accidents, similar to the one shown. <br /> <br /> Overdose of Merriman radiation creates another ugly movie, but IMHO is necessary and quite accurate. People with weak stomachs find it difficult to handle the sequences of hospitals; they are all too real. <br /> <br /> The main idea of ​​what is happening, but not enough for IMHO, is the great truth of the Los Alamos experience. The scientists who signed were young, idealistic and naive and talented. Most were on their first tour of the campus shelter. For them, the project was a patriotic adventure that allowed them to experiment to a large extent with experimental physics without budget constraints or "excessive" bureaucratic supervision. <br /> <br /> The atomic bomb was created not only by their shine, but by their youthful greatness. <br /> <br /> Here's a lot to make the thoughtful viewer of this movie very uncomfortable. Just as you filter the Hollywood BS (there aren't many), this is probably a pretty accurate insight into the inside of the Manhattan project.
