This is the best 3-D experience for Disney on your topics. It is definitely better than their original 1960s acid-travel movie, which was in this place, the leagues are better than "Honey I Shrunk The Audience" (and much more fun), barely bothering MuppetVision's 3-D movie with Disney-MGM and can even to Win the Original 3-D "Movie Experience" Master EO. This movie restores some of Disney's greatest musical hits from Aladdin, Little Mermaid and others. And brought a smile to the face. This is a child-friendly film, unlike "Honey ..." and has more effects than the notable "MuppetVision"
