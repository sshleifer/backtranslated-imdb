I see a lot of movies in the cinema (so far 103) and I have to say that this is by far the best movie I saw this year, although it was released in 1954! <br /> <br /> I sat in a terrible way and watched this genius work and I was quite ashamed that I had never heard of it before my local cinema showed it with a new printout in a week. <br /> <br /> The best part of a movie is a 28-minute break with no speech or music, but rather a tribal man. Pure quality. <br /> <br /> Although it is sometimes dark, it is relieved with dry humor. <br /> <br /> Multiple films don't have 10 out of 10 scores, but it does and gets a golden star! <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to see this movie, don't be afraid, it's classic. <br /> <br />
