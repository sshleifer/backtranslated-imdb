It couldn't. <br /> <br /> This movie was a joy to see from the cutting dialog to super-special effects. Feeling direct against the bitterness of Antarctica, affinity for the characters at the basics of the activities of the characters and the insidious final that makes it one of the most memorable and pleasant films. <Br /> <br /> In contrast to the long list of films that have tried to take advantage of the theme of visitors from another planet, Thing appears and laughs. Who can forget about the special timing of the special effects of dialogue and cooling? Special effects that are much more impressive than the computer-generated images we see today. I found one of the most pleasant aspects of the film is how we slowly introduced each team member and how they all had their own characteristics. It was not just a pointless blood flow-fire-slasher-horror flick. This movie was a feeling. Emotion. <br /> <br /> I can't really recommend this movie. I haven't seen anything in my class yet close, let alone improvement, almost perfect functioning and timing used in the cinema's clever polymer house.
