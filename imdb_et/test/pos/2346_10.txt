I have to say that this is one of the best films I've ever seen for naruto. The action was much better than the first film, because it was much more in combat and it came faster. it was amazing, the choreographer was great and most of the visual effects. <br /> <br /> The story is something new to naruto. but it is basically the same as the first film. series u saw them fighting other ninjas, but in the movies (1 + 2) see them in the fight against the mass destruction machine. it is nice to see that they are fighting something other than a ninja and that it was nice to see some other power beyond the chakra. and how other people from other countries are fighting over the ocean. Sakura also killed someone who is stronger than him. (He has really become strong) was much better than the series I now look at. If u watch this movie, the fast action scene will definitely make your heart pound. It's a good thing to know with a new movie and movie. and the music was also good, but I find it missing. But the ending song was a plus. (dind dong dang) I thought it was a really good song. I recommend it completely. <br /> <br /> I give this film 10 because I just love it. if u decide to watch it, enjoy it. lol
