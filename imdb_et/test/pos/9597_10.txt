This is the real gem of a TV movie. Based on a totally wrong story, it follows a football club running through its course in the English FA Cup, where chaos and all seventy styles can be played by all players. The end is unexpected, the performances are great and Nick Hancock shows he can do anything other than host sports. My only regret is that I didn't record it.
