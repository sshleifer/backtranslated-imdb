Martina, a young teacher of Elba Island, has formed a great teacher, Maestro Fontanelli, to be her own man and to say what she thinks about something she is struggling with at school, where we meet her for the first time because she teaches revolutionary ideals. The island is madness, because one of the most influential men in 19th century European history arrives. Napoleon comes to his exile, not just to the high point of his life. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, Martino comes with Napoleon who writes his memories and needs help for his project. The young man comes from a family of merchants. His brother and sister want to go on a commercial expedition, but Martino has decided that his place belongs to Elba because he is trying to kill Napoleon. The little one discourages him from trying out his mentor Fontanell's deception and condemning his condemnation. There is a different person in your communion with the resurrected emperor. Napoleon is considered to be a more humane person who really enjoys Martino, not suspecting that the young man's plans are for him. Unfortunately, Martino is unable to implement his design because Napoleon has other plans. <br /> <br /> Paolo Virzi, Head of Caterina va in citta, shows why his early promise still exists. Mr. Virzi also collaborated on a scenario based on Ernesto Ferrero's novel. The director shows that he is so good in both intimate drama and this type of speculation. Alessandro Pesci, a filmmaker, makes pictures of his great works. <br /> <br /> Elio Germano, the young Italian actress, is the best in the film. He plays against more experienced players, but he succeeds in convincing us that he is an idealistic youth who tries to get what he perceives to be a noble cause. The great Daniel Auteuil is a bit weaker than Napoleon if anyone should wait for it to be bigger than human life. Monica Belucci is Martino's love interest, but she has little to do. Omero Antonutti plays Fontanelli.
