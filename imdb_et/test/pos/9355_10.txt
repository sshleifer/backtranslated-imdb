Crossfire is a fantastic movie noir that is both a time and a timeless classic product. This movie achieves this by addressing issues that have not been screened before the 1947 display, and being a high-quality film that keeps up to date with a good script, great looks and fantastic performances. The first American film on anti-Semitism is in the classic form of Crossfire. The horrors of post-World War II America are developing after the Jewish man has been murdered. <br /> <br /> The story is great, its anti-hatred theme is in a dark multiple criminal thriller, and next to the anti-Semitism corner is another great post-war dialogue and topic. Unlike other mysterious thrillers, the audience is reported to be the offender almost immediately. But the story of the film is still tempting, because the fight of all the big characters takes place when the situation is understood. Outside the great general story and themes, the entire script is simply intelligent, with meaningful messages and sharp shifts between characters. <br /> <br /> The fascinating story of the movie plays great with its great pain. Robert Young is fantastic as Capt Finlay, a leading investigator of a murder case. Finlay is my favorite film, he's just a cool character - dry like bone and tough than two to four and ending with nothing to bring the killer to justice. Robert Mitchum is also a very good, very lively army sergeant in the film, thanks to his excellent screen presence. Gloria Grahame gives a remarkable result in her role as a small Oscar; George Cooper also does a good job of sick and unhappy Corporal Mitchell; Paul Kelly gives the odd character of the image; Steve Brodie, Sam Levene, Jacqueline White and William Phipps are also giving strong support. Robert Ryan is the most talked-about speaker of the film, giving Montgomery a cooling and also an Oscar nominee. <br /> <br /> Crossfire is a great look. Director Edward Dmytryk does an extraordinary job of performing a film, and J. Roy Hunt is a masterpiece of black and white. Crossfire's image is as dark and darker as its themes, covered with a shade with an almost glossy surface, but also partly very raw. Ironically, the big appearance of the film was not the result of hard work or even intention. Dmytryk wanted more time and money for actors than lighting - so he did it. Fewer lights, less preparation (about 6 hours a day) and a fantastic movie. Crossfire is not only a well-made film art, but also an excellent example of a cheap classic film.
