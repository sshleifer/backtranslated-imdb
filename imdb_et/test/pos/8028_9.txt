This movie is Carlos "The Jackal" (Quinn), an international terrorist who, according to the description of CIA agent Henry Fields (Sutherland), seems to make women and children hell. At least what he says is guilty of an American naval officer Annibal Ramirez (Quinn again) to take on the role of posing as Carlos and making him a traitor in the KGB's eyes. Ramirez is probably physically identical to Carlos, but spiritually he is his opposite. He wears the queue and Carlos carries chaos. <br /> <br /> The movie is not all shooting game jumps, and it's good. In his first half, Ramirez goes through training to act and think like Carlos, and this is actually where the film makes a difference to the work of a different mill. The Israeli agent (Kingsley) joins the fields in the training of Ramirez, and they seem to take on the roles of parents in giving birth to the new character of Ramirez. Ramirez is taught not to like things that Carlos dislikes to act in shared seconds like Carlos and even love like Carlos (courtesy of Carlos' former girlfriend). Of course, what he teaches would be used later. It's a bit busy, but Quinn gives Carlos-wannabe mowing. <br /> <br /> Another thing I liked about this movie was that he didn't use much excess plot in the evil twin film - you know where the evil twin puts himself in good twin families. The Ramirez family does not come to the picture, but instead they highlight how his new character breaks his family life. <br /> <br /> A good movie-like humor is injected into this movie, which often comes from the Sutherland and Kingsley acerbic duo. An exception is the superfluous and probably free gift that includes the first name of Ramirez (Annibal, Annabelle, get it?). The surprise was also the constant grip of the duo on how powerful and insidious and intelligent Carlos is. In my opinion, the final showdown failed to offset. <br /> <br /> The film was generally enjoyable. I'm not a fan of high glow, but this film was more intelligent and appealing than the average action film and it keeps my attention all over. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 9/10
