I saw this movie when it appeared about 50 years ago in the UK's small cinemas; and the memory remains a great musical score and a tragedy in the story. I recently saw it on video recently. The sound track was bad and the picture was sharp; but this is one of the two movies I saw the next day, the other is the Gladiator. The music theme is intensely tragic and from the beginning knows that it proclaims a failure or death. Certainly one of George Sanders' best performances; as a man who works in the black market to get back for the money lost during the war, but he is waiting for him; Patricia Roc plays an Eastern European refugee eager to despair. She has been interested in her, inadvertently wants to help her and then falls in love with her, but she is too proud and painful to accept the help. Their love destroys her and inevitably the girl and the doctor (Herbert Marshall) who brought the noble. The story is with complex intertwined fates where affiliates are not the ones they seem to be. It's like a movie that set the critics and fought the box; but the young man and retired gentleman who saw it, this is one of the greatest films (given its age), whose story is more like an opera.
