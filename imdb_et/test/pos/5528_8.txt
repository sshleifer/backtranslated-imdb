I looked at six types of W.C. Fields - It's only about 10 minutes in it and has one long scene, the infamous pool order he made famous in vaudeville, and many other great moments. Fortunately, there is also a 55-minute joyful, mainly thanks to the fun Charlie Ruggle as the worshiping banker J. Pinkham Whinney. He's the foil of everyone. He strikes and rejoices. Also, her comedy partner Mary Boland plays her wife Flora. The intervention is George Burns and Gracie Allen. Boland is especially funny at the beginning and end, but Gracie and Ruggles use most of the picture. Gracie is funny, but she gets tired. And the poor George Burns has nothing to do except for Gracie's repeated repetition. I don't remember him laughing once (though he has one big scene with Ruggle, where Ruggles is desperately trying to get George to Gracie and leave him and his wife alone for a while and one of the fields where he asks to sell him a sweater, but this is just a bit of fields). The situation is always funny: Whinneys are driving to California, but George and Gracie are employed to help them out. 8/10
