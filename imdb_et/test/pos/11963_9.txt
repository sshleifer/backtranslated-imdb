In the eighties, Savage Steve Holland released three films, two of which are a classic that seems to be a very small genre, absurd teen comedies. The third "How I got to college" does not measure "Better off dead" and this, mainly because of the absence of John Cusack and Curtis Armstrong (except for the small zone). <br /> <br /> One Crazy Summer is an underrated movie with many great testimonials and gags. I remember when Savage Steve's films were dead in the brain and after three films she went to the children's TV. We could use more movies for the ones we like.
