One of the best films that comes out of the 1980s tells of the fact that it talks about distracted high school students who murder their girlfriend, leave their bare body on the river bank and later talk to their friends. Their inability to feel anything about Him is just as bad. A disturbing, yet incredibly weighty look at the targeted and apathetic children who have no respect for their parents or any authority who seems almost doomed to live a rebellion and a careless life. This drama hits hard and it's impossible to forget. The young man does the job that can be done - even Keanu Reeves is better off than usual in his first role. Of course, there is no reason for Layne (Crispin Glover) to be as crazy and wall as it is, but it's just Glover himself. Veteran Dennis Hopper has a particularly good role as a loner who, despite his sorted past, is saddened by the attitudes of children in this group. I would like to draw attention to the cooling down of Daniel Roebuck as a young murderer; he is an undervalued actor and, after Hopper, he is probably the best cinematographer. <br /> <br /> I saw "River's Edge" for the first time since cable TV movie shows were for the first time; but I couldn't catch it all; I saw it for the first time several years later, and now I have seen it, which is probably the final time. <br /> <br /> Some of the most influential moments are Madeleine's (Constance Forslund). The division where he wants him to leave his children like their worthless father. I also liked scenes where Matt (Reeves) is facing his disturbed younger brother (Joshua Miller) and as a teacher of Mr.. <br /> <br /> I will never forget this movie as long as I live. That's too sad for that. <br /> <br /> 10/10
