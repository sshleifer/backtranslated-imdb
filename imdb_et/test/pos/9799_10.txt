This story is a great story of two boys doing what they can do to get rid of the abusive drunken father. A remarkable role is the "Lord of the Rings" star Elijah Wood. This film is one of the main reasons I haven't touched one beer and never lives. It may be a joke for me, but I have to say it. It's a wonder why it's not a classic American story.
