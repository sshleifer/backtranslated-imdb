In the mid-1970s, the brutal young poor in Venice, young adolescents in broken homes in California, and the bad side of the city, called the Z-Boys, turned to a prominent professional roller-skate ear with their acute punk-style, radical unusual riding style and pure in-your-face aggressive spirit, transforming the process around sport and paving the way for many extreme sports variations that appeared in their influential awakening. Directed by Stacy Peralta, one of the legendary Z-Boys himself, this incredible use of this amazing ragtag team is fiercely struck and visceral, which is both informative and convincing: gentle quick editing of fires, uninterrupted fast-paced and raw sharp photography gives one hell infectious kinetic buzz, which is a mere joy and full-life energy that is a complete joy. Better yet, this documentary does not disinfect or romanticize its topics: These tough boys were so fiercely competitive and out to themselves that they all went their way when fame and happiness lie in their lives. The ultimate fate of some boys is frightening and heartbreaking, the gifted and spontaneous rat cruiser Jay Adams is the saddest and most tragic: he blew his time and ended up in prison. Others in dudes are also very colorful and satisfying; Charismatic Fever and Shameful Ball Tony Alva is one of the most astonishing but impressive pieces of foolishly confident work. Amazingly, Sean Penn was gently told nasally. The amazing rock music also smokes seriously. But what really makes this documentary is the winner's complete refreshment: it's as dynamic, overflowing and livelier as the extraordinary, than the brilliantly outrageous Z-Boys itself.
