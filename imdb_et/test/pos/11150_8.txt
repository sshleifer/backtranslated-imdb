I am really surprised that the rating of this film is only 6.4 at the time of this review. Although I'm not a big movie, I think it's one of the best films Dietrich did, and it's a shame that it's not considered higher. I think a lot of the reasons why I liked the movie is that the usual stupid Dietrich man, as "uber-vamp", is absent and his role required him to act. I just hate the movie after the film in the early days of my career, where she seemed more like a caricature or clich√© than a real woman. I don't necessarily have to blame Dietrich for the foolish vampish films made in the 1930s - the audience loved them and they made him famous. But here he showed that he was really capable of acting. After all, just watching her in movies like MOROCCO, BLONDE VENUS and BLUE ANGEL, who would have thought she was a gypsy! I was quite ready to hate the movie because of this casting decision, but it worked - he was pretty plausible and also fun to watch! The film is primarily a vehicle for Ray Milland and Marlene Dietrich - other supporting characters are very secondary to the film. Milland is a newly independent spokesman in Germany, and in his quest to escape he stumbles on a rather dirty single Gypsy (Dietrich) who immediately takes him to fulfill his prediction - in other words, to his new lover! Milland is quite tired, but is reluctant to travel to his wagon - even putting the body color and ear piercing to look like a gypsy (hence the title of the movie). Over time, she slowly realizes that she is quite a woman under her very irregular appearance, and romance is slowly flourishing. <br /> <br /> The word is "charming". Nice romance with a good dose of comedy and fun - just the kind of picture you want to make in Hollywood yet. Also note the Murvyn Vye performance "Zoltan". He was very magnetic on the film in a short time and I just loved his deep and beautiful voice. <br /> <br /> Finally, sad note. Although the film has taken place in Germany, the upcoming Holocaust of the Roma is not mentioned. During the war, the Nazis throughout the German territory destroyed an enormous amount of gypsies and thus the final endless endless film of the film.
