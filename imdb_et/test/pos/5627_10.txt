The subject of this film is potentially depressing: a man of about thirty who do not have a job, little education, three children of unsuccessful relationships living in their parents' house, but dreaming to direct feature films. But about half an hour of the movie you realize that Mark Borchardt has an in-depth offer and ambition - it's just that it's all directed to his need to manage movies and nothing makes him happy. The movie jumps over the emotional spectrum, but in the end you come out of a happy feeling because you have just known some wonderful people. Go see it - you finally want it to be longer.
