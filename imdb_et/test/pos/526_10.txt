Never have I ever had the impression of a movie like this little piece of four people facing a crisis or many. In some ways, slightly short cuts, but completely different, at the same time. <br /> <br /> There are a bunch of guides we all know very well when their stories come out and when people show their good and bad sides, weaknesses and strengths, there is a lot of drama and laughter. <br /> <br /> The closest equivalent to the US movie, I can think of what is much weaker in any case is Royal Tenenbaums. <br /> <br /> Four brown tones, as the title would be in English, tells the story of a stressed hotelman and his wife and his older parents (who travel wizards); animal crematorium administrator and his family malformations; members of the cooking course (who mostly speak about their unfortunate life) and fourthly the jockey funeral of a ridiculous thrombi trying to continue family orchestration outside the grave, singing and appearing at the funeral, thanks to high-tech equipment that has paid all its fortune (the family gets zero, not even the famous horse) not given to family)! <br /> <br /> In this movie, there is heat and compassion that is full of grief and laughter that I have never experienced before. <br /> <br /> Most of the participants were new to me, except Robert Gustafsson and one or two, but they all deserve a big slam, a film taken by Swedish Guldbaggelt extravaganza (= Swedish "Oscar" awards) a week ago! <br /> <br /> The male, female, and male supporters' awards went to this movie, plus some more, to launch! <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, go and see it - the number of hours is very fast!
