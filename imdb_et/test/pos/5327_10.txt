I'm not Ebert. I am compassionate and I have never felt more sympathy for the fictional character I felt for Leland P. Fitzgerald. I'm sorry if I don't offer criticism, but I see not only perfection in this movie. I'm sure many of those watching this movie will never see the same things I do, but if you look hard enough, you'll see something you didn't expect. I've read that Leland's character was faulty. It seems to me that anyone who wrote it couldn't see this movie. I'm sorry for anyone who doesn't see the answers to this movie. Open your heart more than your mind and you can let it show Leland P. Fitzgerald to a world that really matters. Extraordinary story with extraordinary action. Ryan Gosling deserves to speak.
