This little John Ford west, which has no "stars" but character actors, is one of his masterpieces. It has a documentary feeling as it traces the journey to the west of the Mormon Party, and it can be the most authentic viewing of all Ford films (parallel to The Sun Shines Bright, which he made a few years later). <br /> <br /> There is a lot of land (a group of robbers joining a wagon at a moment), but the dramatic highlight of the movie is almost random. The great performances of the Ford Stock Company (Ben Johnson, Harry Carey Jr, Ward Bond, Jane Darwell, etc.) add a lot to the authenticity of the film, while the closest film reaches the perfect star - Joanne Dru Denver. Dru was a much more subtle actor when he had ever received credit like Bond and Johnson, who at least finally was awarded the Oscar for "The Last Picture Show". As he himself said, "It couldn't happen to a more beautiful son." Add Bert Glennon's superb location photography and you have a real Americana piece that doesn't have anyone except Ford. It is a film that truly respects American pioneers and is full of feelings and feelings.
