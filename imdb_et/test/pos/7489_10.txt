One good thing: this hidden criminal treasure is incredibly fun from start to finish. The best example of making a low-budget movie, Skip Woods, writer / director uses everything he could find (eg Lamborghini, super model, cow phone) and ear dial to add smoothie levels and all his camera settings. <br /> <br /> SECOND GOOD: This movie seems to have been made for a DVD era with multiple segments that contain a larger story (similar to the work of Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez Desperado). In every chapter of the film, Thomas Jane is the main character who spends one day at home and meets the unforgettable role of Aaron Eckhart, Glen Plummer, Mickey Rourke, Michael Jeter, James LeGros and Paulina Porizkova. <br /> NOT A GOOD ATTENTION: Not just a "good" thing, but an incredibly shocking and memorable ... Anyone who sees this movie remembers one important scene. As far as Deliverance is always remembered, if it is a terrible rash for Ned Beatty, a movie will be abducted on Thursday by a woman raping an unwanted man. Unforgettable. <br /> <br /> ONE CAUSATION: The title makes people think it's somehow related (or derived) to the "Friday" series of movies with Ice Cube. <br /> <br /> GRADE: A +
