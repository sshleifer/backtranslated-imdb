I liked it because I can communicate with it. <br /> <br /> At one point I tried to make movies and experienced the same problems Mark Mark Borchardt made to make his movie. And I also went through a protracted period of self-absorbed development where I refused to grow. But then I marveled, and I had children. I realized that being a fighting filmmaker is not going to feed my family. So I got a decent job and I did what I felt I should do. This is also done by a mature, responsible adult. Mark has not yet faced this reality and so is a slow youth in this sense. For this reason, he is hopeless. Like Don Quixote, he seems to be so unfair and dignified that he doesn't understand how bad he really is. The viewer knows him and his circle of goodness and regret. Mark has children and former husbands and bills, but the film depicts him carefully only by following his "artistic vision". <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Mark appears on the film for a pleasant person surrounded by a very interesting family and group of friends. Unfortunately, Mark does not have many things that are necessary for both life and career success: maturity, responsibility, education, knowledge, life experience, prioritization, financial capability, and so on. without any clue. <br /> <br /> I think we should feel encouraged by the vision of this noble individual's "ever to die" attitude that fights against contradictions. And man, what are the probabilities! Kiefer Sutherland, Colin Hanks, Tori Spell and Angelina Jolie are all offspring of big films or TVs; they will undoubtedly want to direct all the day if they do not. How much space is independent like Mark? It's like looking at how the boy hit the table, over and over again. Think about it, it's pretty close to what happens to one of Mark's actors at the kitchen cabinet door, in one fun scene I've ever seen in every movie. <br /> <br /> Despite these doubts and seemingly criticism, I truly enjoyed this movie and wish it to everyone. Uncle Bill is amazing. I have a friend who met both Mike and Mark and told me that in reality these guys are just as they appeared in the movie.
