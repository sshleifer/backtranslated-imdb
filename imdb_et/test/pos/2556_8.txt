A friend brought me this movie and at first I hesitated, the movie's pace was so slow that at first it was boring. But life scenes were attractive, it's like watching. <br /> <br /> This turned out to be just stunning in the whole movie, the way the director was talking about live life reflecting reality, but somehow overwhelming. It's like understanding the real life of a living person as watching a movie. <br /> <br /> Alejandro Polanco and Miss Isamar Gonzales did their best to tell us more about our stories. Indeed, they used their real names in the film.
