The promise of Martin Donovan, who played with Jesus, was fairly honest to see me in the movie. Definitely worth it; smart and funny, without being over. Low-quality filming was probably an appropriate effect, but it ended up a bit too flabby and ended with a PBS program like Hartley. However, I have too many memorable features and great moments to judge it hard.
