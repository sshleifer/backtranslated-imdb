I looked at Sleeper Celli a bit of a fear of worrying about terrorists. This mesmerizing series did not handle the substance responsibly, but created the depth and content of almost every character. Oded Fehr just pulls the screen into every scene he is, and although his character is a charismatic leader of the jihad terrorist cell, he still has a hypnotic complaint. Michael Ealy kept his well, though in some scenes I wondered why he didn't see it on the spot because of what he was wearing. <br /> <br /> The pros are two leading, Fehr and Ealy, well-written characters - all that were credible and tragic, and hopeful problems. Having been married to a Muslim himself, the atmosphere created was quite realistic. The disadvantages to me personally were that women's R&D was overwhelming, which seemed as loose as some sexual scenes. Nonetheless, this is a raw grip that makes you think. Somebody gives Fehr such big roles and let him run. He has an incredible screen presence and a strange innate power that comes out of him.
