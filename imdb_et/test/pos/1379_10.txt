I tried to find out why I enjoyed this movie? This is not because money is definitely spent on it! Did I see a water gun painted there? Maybe they don't have the same visual effects in Scotland? Or maybe they had no money? A clear show shows the very happy guys who make the film inconsistent. Awesome! But what I really liked was sharp. Mike Michell and Patrick White play leading parts like 2 normal men. Hollywood histrionics are not here. <br /> <br /> OK, so the effects aren't very good. Spaceships just don't look as good as today's FX world and I've seen much better free stuff on youtube. But the film is gathering very well on the planet. Was it filmed in Scotland or just with the Scottish team? Or is it just a better effect? Did they edit the water? Finally, I loved this movie and was disappointed when they all died.
