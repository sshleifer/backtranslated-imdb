Gracie (Minnie Driver), a woman at the end of her twenties, is on the waiting list for a heart transplant. Bob (David Duchovny) has just become a tragedy to lose his wife's car accident. One can guess the result. Gracie gets the heart of Bob's wife, though they don't know each other .... yet! A year later, Gracie is feeling like a new person, while Bob has started thinking about his social life. When a friend puts him on a blind date, Bob finds that he is interested in a report from Gracie, a restaurant where the date goes. They start to see each other. How long does it take before the truth comes to life and what are the consequences? This cute, funny and touching movie is one of the best romantic comedies. The two stars are dazzling because the couple in the sky can only bring together, and Bonnie Hunt, Jim Belush and Carroll O'Connor are also cast in admiration. The neighborhood near Chicago is also charming and beautiful. We do this for costumes and script. If you know someone who goes over with wonderful love stories, then you will have their good grace forever when you introduce him to this fine film.
