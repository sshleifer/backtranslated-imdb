I had heard interesting critics about this film. I believed it was a love story, but I wasn't sure what the plot was. So when I finally saw it, I found myself in the middle of a former love relationship between the former Isabel (Isabel Ampudia) and junkie Rufo (Sebastián Haro). So, the love story, but not probably what I expected. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on Isabel when she struggles to return to society. She does not want to return to her neighborhood and she finds herself at home or somewhere to go. So, if he just experiences these feelings of freedom after being released from prison, he came over to Rufo, who was his old acquittal, which he had been junk and lived on the street. If he doesn't have where to go, and without money or a source of income, he decides to join Rufo in his place of residence: a covered area on a lonely street. <br /> <br /> The story itself moves. This explains how impossible it is, the relationship between Isabel and Rufo becomes deeper until the film's almost final twist. <br /> <br /> Be sure to watch the movie. Sebastián Haro is great for the junkie role. A person who can be both an innocent and a bidding man and a ruthless street getaway. Just depending on who he deals with. I believe his role is. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I do not believe in Isabel Ampudia's role. Although the film tries to show some scenes inside it, he is not able to believe me. She is too sweet and too honest to be expected from someone in the same situation. <br /> <br /> The film tries to show love in a desperate situation. This is an enjoyable movie. But the feeling that I get to the end of the movie is that Isabel, who has a way of thinking and acting, would never have come to such a situation. Its role, partly because of the script, partly due to the action, is hard to believe. <br /> <br /> I really like the end, and that's why I've raised one or two points. I liked this bittersweetness and the fact that sometimes the instinct of survival is higher than other spiritual considerations such as love. <br /> <br /> To sum up, an interesting movie, but he had no punch to be "full to see".
