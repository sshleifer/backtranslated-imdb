It was a joy to see this movie at Big Bear's film festival, where he won the audience award. And I have to say it was well deserved because Boy Next Door is a very funny short film! The script is well written and keeps things expanding. It also has a high current. You don't know what happens next, because the main character is trying to deal with the fact that his new neighbor may not be the ideal person to live against him. Jokes are fast and unexpected. The plot keeps us away. The dialogue seems very real. I thought the direction was first-rate and director Travis Davis shows great potential for making this studio comedy world wide. It is not a small praise, as he is also the leading actor in the film, so he had to do it with a triple commitment, writing, leadership and head. If you can see this movie in iTunes, it's worth it. It makes you laugh a few times loud. And it is more than most shorts offer these days.
