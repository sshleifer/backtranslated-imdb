The plot of this movie is not complicated. A very attractive young girl goes to Europe when she looks for the causes of suicide of her older sister ten years earlier. There he meets his sister's former boyfriend and together they go to all the nursing places and the causes become clearer. <br /> <br /> But what makes this movie so special and limited to a limited plot is the beautiful images of the symbols. Though the older sister's boy is a drop-out hippie, he is the ultimate ideals, moral standards, and incredible strengths. And although the older sister we see in the setback shares these ideals, it has no limit or balance as to how much is too much. And although the younger girl is loyally loyal to her sister's memory, she gradually finds strength that her sister was only a normal girl. <br /> <br /> The most special moment in the movie is when a young girl and her sister's boyfriend finally stop fighting for their attractiveness. I never remember that in the film I would see a more beautiful, touching and romantic love in love. <br /> <br /> In all these ways, this is a really beautiful movie, a movie that needs to be valued and seen again and again. 9 out of 10
