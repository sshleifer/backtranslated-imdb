First, don't be disappointed by my last name. My mother was full of bloody Italian, so I really know Italian families and I love mobster movies, even such funny ones. <br /> <br /> For those people who are bad, this movie (you know who you are) should have your movie rights because you don't know what's good. It's a fucking funny and well-designed movie. The fact that almost no one is Italian is part of the joke as far as I can see. And what red blood straight guy can feel the feeling and something like Michelle Pfieffer? Tel-rent! When I saw this movie, he won Rosemary Clooney with the opening song, which was as Irish as possible, but his pronunciation of the Italian words "Mambo Italiano" is flawless and determines what is perfectly observable. (Hell, I even bought this record the next day because of that.) Just the look of every joy in the apartment that I've personally seen in my relatives' houses, though not in the same place (what I found hysterical) sold by this film is like Goodfellas, who laughs at gas. I just don't know why there is no Burger Worlde and what happened to the food that these guys had to get? I think the team ate it. "Potatoes are crispy. Shakes are creamy." My mouth solves almost as much as the proud Mrs. Pfieffer thinks. (And I never trusted clowns ever.) And the three best things about this movie are Mercedes Ruehl's nervous funny mob woman, Dean Stockwell as his philanthropic husband Tony "The Tiger" and the last, but CLOSE, especially Oliver Platt, who should do more comic role. And note yourself: find out where this black chick went. Ouch! Why does he rarely work? This picture is right next to the big movies, as it should be.
