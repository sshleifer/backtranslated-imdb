As a camera operator, I couldn't admire the great look of this picture. The performances were excellent, as was the story. It wasn't when I thought this film was slowing down. A cordial tension, great change through editing, and a score that knows when it comes to silence, come together in a competent and capable direction. The camera was always in the right place. Love it.
