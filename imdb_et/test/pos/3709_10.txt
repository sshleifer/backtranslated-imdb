William Faulkner was one of the American writers who won the Nobel Prize in Literature. Faulkner wrote mainly about life in the south, especially during the years of depression. Many of his tracks are customized on the screen. Short stories, like two soldiers, are the loving story of two brothers in December 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Elder Brother Pete Greer goes to Temple in Memphis to recruit hundreds of thousands of young men, some of whom don't come home. His younger brother does not take his departure well. He manages to get a bus ticket to Memphis without finding his brother. He surprisingly becomes another kind of soldier because he wants to recruit at the age of 10. Ron Perlman is a surprising force as a military leader who can take care of the boy and bind him. This short film won the Oscar for the best short-sighted action that is well-deserved. If it were longer, it could compete with longer films. Everything else, like costumes, the direction of art and the re-creation of the American era in 1941 is perfect. The film also shows a home-born war, as most Americans survived a major depression. Actors and actors are not known, but they do first-class performances. If Hollywood makes more high-quality movies, I'd probably go to the cinema more. If Broadway had more quality exhibitions, I would go to the theater more.
