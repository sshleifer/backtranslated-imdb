The great performance of Clint Eastwood and especially John Malkovich, in my opinion, is his best today. Malkovich had one nailed on the floor, it is incredible. Eastwood is the agent of Mike Horrigan, an obsolete and cynical secret service agent, who quits his career for breaking counterfeits and routine tasks. But one task that begins with the mill's move becomes complicated and deadly. Horrigan and his new partner Al are sent to the president for a "wacko" threat. If destiny should do this, Horrigan has bounced off not to confuse the nut, but to a professional single wolf with a large bone of the White House. When Horrigan dives deeper into the world of "Booth", he draws the unwanted attention and unlimited admiration of a bad boy. Horrigan was JFK's principal representative and present in Dallas, Texas when he was murdered and accused himself of what had happened. Now he feels that his task is to stop the current Head of State from joining the list of the dead president. But this killer has turned to the Horrigan tables and now he's wounded in life or death in a cat and mouse game. Who wins? Who dies? This is a race with time to save the president from a chameleon-like enemy who gets to anyone. My favorite secret service movie and so good nail as any.
