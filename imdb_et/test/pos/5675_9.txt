If you've ever seen openness, it's the same type of sharp, sharp, indie style. I liked this activity, intercourse. it slow building everything, i hope they don't do it one what they did in Open Water that sequel .. but anyway ,, one thing i didn't like was the annoying younger sister ,, i was rooted all the time .. The film starts pretty much like it should, kids wrap up for a trip, they hire a tutor who mysteriously left for 5 minutes. before they got there, I think his assistant will take two sisters, and a boy boy in the water, now remember that this is another adventure of their adventure, curiously the first day they thought hmm crocodile farm .. so that they are there and everything is good for a while, "then banging, crocodile ... very intense, you know something in the movie that is not seen by the crocodile, a whole hell, but if you do, it is very scary," i love croci nose and eyes, and fog that looks like it crouches every time he raises his head over the water, very very horrible but good ,, in general it is a great movie when you get over the annoying little sister.
