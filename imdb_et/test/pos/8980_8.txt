When he returned, he said that the film would be opened in 1989 when Charley was awarded a prize for his role in defeating Communism. I have to admit that my heart went down if another serious, somewhat boring and long-lasting biography had to endure with thought. How wrong I was, because this short scene is as close as the film is ever boring. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of fun and fun devices and cracking in some unexpected places. The next scene after the award ceremony is Charlie's hot tub, with some naked women and a man trying to invest in TV shows. Another fairly amusing scene is about three-quarters of a film composed of Charli, his pretty sexy secretaries, Phillip Seymour Hoffmans CIA Man and a bottle of whiskey. As for this line, the Senator says he can teach us, but cannot teach us to grow. OK, School-boyish I know, but the film is gently drawn. <br /> <br /> Performances well Phillip Seymour Hoffman, as usual, steals every scene he has. Hanks is fine, but surprisingly I was still Julia Roberts who is in the very exclusive role of Texas Oil Millionairess. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson's war has long been one of the best non-musician bio-images, and it is also a rare movie that amusements, amusements and all the same.
