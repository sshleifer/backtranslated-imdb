Norma Shearer dazzles when she has transformed from a frump, an extra-burned house-spouse into a charming potential divorce. Most 1930s films have a fracturing edge for them - from time to time, the camera's work is slow, but we must forgive the joy of talking about them for their long-lasting "quality". As a guest of the eccentric ground rope Marie Dressler - Shearer, it mixes with the odd cozy, including the long lost spouse. Dialogue is fun, many times smart and productions. Shearer and Dressler shine most. Shearer even shows his piano skills in musical brevity. His strange but tempting attitude and the "thing with the camera" are obvious - and he hits every emotional comment, really and on the target. For that time. . .good exhibition.
