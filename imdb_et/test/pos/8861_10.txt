Many people have a film they think is their favorite movie. My movie is always John Carpenter's thing! The main reason this film is a cult film is probably the spatter effects of the genius by Rob Bottin, and this is the film that made Kurt Russell what he is today (with Escape from NY). In my opinion, this is not an excellent film because of the impact, it is related to the story, the atmosphere and, of course, the actors. I've watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day for the last 10 years), but none of them affected me as that, not even the big "Das Boot". <br /> <br /> Here is my suggestion for you who like sci-fi and horror movies: put yourself in the good chairs of your home. Make sure no one is breaking. If you don't have a projector, sit close to your TV and watch the wonders of the movie. Let him absorb, and you see it in my way! <br /> <br /> Best View: End of February, 5-9 in the Evening.
