I was very excited to see a documentary about one of my favorite Italian leaders. D'Amato has scared everything from Horror, post-apocalyptic to hardcore Porn. He has touched the genius a couple of times on movies like Buio Omega and Emmanuelle & The Last Cannibals. This documentary is a long and informative guide to D'Amato's films. He is interviewed throughout the English with subtitles that move at the bottom of the screen. His film extracts are spoken by a narrator (with English subtitles). The documentary turned out to be particularly interesting when often censored Emmanuelle in America was analyzed. Here, D'amato explains the fake "snuff" scenes in detail and resembles some funny stories. In fact, a good oil Joe is very warm and funny, always wearing a smile and smoking a cigarette. One of the distressing aspects of this documentary is that it spends little time on D'amato Horror films such as Anthropophagus and the brilliant Buio Omega. It spends too much time on the erotic cinema and hardly touches the apocaplexy movies. But I can't complain. It's nice to see D'amato, which he deserves. Highly recommended for D'amato fans. Rest in peace.
