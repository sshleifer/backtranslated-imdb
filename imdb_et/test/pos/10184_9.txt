I saw the second part of this beautiful period, sometimes on the ship in the 19th century. Golding's book must be responsible for some great dialogue, but everything else was good too! I especially liked how they gave up the period and the feeling they were on the ship so well. For me, it was a sense of integrity that I know I could not pass on in words ... Maybe they were disturbing the story of technical and historical details about sailing in the eighteenth century without being upset. Benedict Cumberbatch was great, as was the rest. It is often not a mini-series that sends me to a "zone", but it did.
