I looked at this flap on Saturday afternoon. Man, did it pull. I got metaphors, insignia and all these things. No, I didn't care about the sexuality of the characters in one way or another. But the story and scripting made me almost sleep. <br /> <br /> It's ..... until Ruth Marshall got naked. If you are a breastfeeding man who is not homophobic, you might want to rent it. Ruth has a lesbian sex event that is pretty hot, and then a hetero-sex scene that is higher than the most common movie ticket. His jiggly D-cups were worth the movie. <br /> <br /> - Mighty Avatar
