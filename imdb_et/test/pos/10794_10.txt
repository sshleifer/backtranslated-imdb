"Talk Radio" is my favorite Oliver Stone film, although he has made many great films, including "Salvador", "JFK", "Natural Born Killers" and "Platoon". But I like the intimacy of "Talk Radio", the kinematic expansion of the production by Eric Bogosian, based on the actual account of the Dallas speaker host. Working with an ace cinematographer Robert Richardson turns Stone, which could have been a very binding exercise for a visually stopping ideological battle that depicts a radio station as a war arena. Bogosian is devastating when he is tortured in air dependence with Barry Champlain and communicates his character with contradictory, destructive beliefs and higher doses of self-esteem. Alec Baldwin, like his alpha-male commander, captures the perfect note when a man leads the nuts whose boy who helped him without any trouble. Ellen Greene is fantastic when Barry's sweet ex-husband reaches another target of his witchcraft vitriol. Stone and Bogosian fill each frame with interest and every dialogue area with a sweet poison and ambiguity. John C. McGinley, like Barry's long-stricken / technical manufacturer Stu, is turning to a fun and sharp action, just like the big Michael Wincott. The film is a flawless, undervalued, excellent writing, awesome actor and brutal, uncompromising direction. The result of Stewart Copeland is also great.
