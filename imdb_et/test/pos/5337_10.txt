A great animation film that really rises to the level of "Lion King". <br /> <br /> I went to watch it with one of my best Belgian friends who watched the TV. I was happy because I did not know that the people of Belgium were aware of "Wallace and Gromit". <br /> <br /> When it started and a good old theme started, I started to look back when I was 5 years old. <br /> <br /> Humor itself was very funny. Some nice sitcom style scenes, some word games or just jokes. Animation is not as impressive as you know this series, but it is still fun to see when you understand how it is done. My Conclusion: Not only can it keep your happy and entertained, but some humor can easily turn to older people so I say, Go and see "Cursed Rabbit Curse" as soon as you get.
