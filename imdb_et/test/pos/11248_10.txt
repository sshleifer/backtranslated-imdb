VIP keys are one of the more entertaining, informative and fun exhibitions that are currently on TV. The idea is original and well executed because it manages to maintain the aspect of reality, but remains fun. All judges have a razor. They are not always the most pleasant, but if you are looking for comfort, check out the chick flick. Say what you want about the validity of the exhibition, but it's absolutely real. I know people who have competed in exhibitions and they have confirmed it. <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh, look at this example. This is the best comedy shows ever made.
