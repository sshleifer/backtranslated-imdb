Two sisters, Su-mi (IM Soo-jung) and Su-yeon (MOON Geun-young) return home with their father (Kim Gap-sex). Eun-Yoo (YEOM Jeong-ah) welcomes them, but Su-mi is bitter for him. Su-mi hates Eun because his father allowed him to act like a house wife after his mother's death. Eun-yoga treats its attitude towards nurses in the cold and there is an intense atmosphere. <br /> <br /> As the atmosphere is called, there are many mysterious things in the house. If Su-mi's clothes hang in her clothes, then many dresses with the same design have been hung. When he put his diary in the drawer, he finds another diary like that. When she sleeps in bed with Su-yeon in bed, she awakens a nightmare and she finds the woman standing on her - and the hand hangs out of the woman's skirt! <br /> <br /> Mysterious things also come from other people. On the evening of the next weekend, Eun-joo's brother and his wife's family will visit and have dinner together. Eun-joy speaks joyfully of the mad man he was when he was a child, but no one has spoken of him. He says the crazy man broke his brother, but he says he doesn't know anything about this man. <br /> <br /> Listening to their talk, the brother has a panic in his wife. <br /> <br /> After dinner, the conflict between Eun-joo and nurses becomes worse. The Eun-Yo pulls Su-yeon into the wardrobe and locks it in. Su-mi rescues a shouting sister and complains to her father what Eun-joo has done to her daughter. But his answer is unexpected. "Leave me alone." he says angry, "Su-mi, please. Don't make me tired anymore." <br /> <br /> And the following words from the father's mouth are more shocking than those they've seen in the house. <br /> <br /> Truth, I hate horror movies. Although I sat in the theater because my intuition told me that the film was something else, I was sorry for what my curiosity had started to show me. But after ten minutes, the regret had become a joy for expectations. <br /> <br /> This movie is a tragic secret that is more than horrible - more painful than terrible; more beautiful than sensational. It may be a frustrated horror fan, but for me, a mysterious fan like me must see this film. (9 out of 10)
