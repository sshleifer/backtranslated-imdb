It seems that everyone compares it with the matrix and the 13th floor, and when I first saw it, I would agree - I waited for the matrix and was a little disappointed. But repeatedly, my respect for this film has grown tremendously. <br /> <br /> What you remember is that Matrix is ​​a great movie with some philosophical mumbo-jumbo. a satisfying feature film with a somewhat more interesting philosophical mumbo-jumbo. Existenz is not usually an action film, and it is not (as many believe) about "reality" or some "deep" concept. It is related to the tendency of people to deliberately replace the world with artificial (both origin and behavior) with faith. <br /> <br /> The coldest moment of the movie is when Allegra Geller repeats her. At this point, you realize that the people who participated in the game have voluntarily given up their free will to participate in the story. It will become even more frightening if D'Arcy Nader (or rather his player) comment on the opportunity to live in the game. "with the philosophy that the offer of interesting worlds, where people are just looking for the right path for the ultimate goal, is ultimately the soul without a recipe for existence. Living in" the game "does not live at all, but is an appealing way to spend time on earth. You may also have someone else's imagination and pretend you are doing something interesting (although I have to ask if Cronenberg considers it to be a self-appeal, given that he himself offers a world that must be experienced with 90-minute fragments.) <br /> < After watching this movie after leaving the theater, I thought it was one of those movies that could only be seen at the end of it. I've seen it a few more times (thanks to the SciF channel), I've realized how much it goes. Seriously, if you've only seen it once, it deserves a second look.
