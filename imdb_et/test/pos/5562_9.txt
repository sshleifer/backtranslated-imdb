Having just borrowed from a series of one DVD collection from my somewhat obsessive brother, I waited to get through the first few episodes and gave it back. I just saw myself screaming on the screen to finish the first season on the dumbbell-hangers - just a week later and I watched the whole season. When I found that time, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> This show is great. It does not take itself too seriously, it is pleasant characters that have worked well, and special effects (ignoring the odd sticky doll here and there) are special enough to give it a polished feel. At first I didn't know that it was mostly filmed here, and it seemed strange to hear so many Aussie accents at the Sci-Fi show - it was most interesting when the protagonist (John) rode back in Sydney. First season. <br /> <br /> I believe that the greatest strength of this exhibition is the vision that the creators of the exhibition probably had. They have gradually introduced the new aspects of the characters who explained past activities and continued to have fun and effortless conversation with the slang. In addition, I can see that when I looked at the whole series of Voyager and the next Geni, I see a few plots withdrawn - so it has been able to maintain originality throughout the first season. I hope the rest of it is so good. <br /> <br /> Farscape isn't like any other Sci-Fi I've had. I heard that the fourth season was not as good as the first three, and now I'm quite annoyed that they canceled it before the fifth. I hope they will revive this exhibition - with the same participants in the film or in another series. It would be a shame to leave as many land lines unfinished, because I imagine that with a play that has so much thought that it would be enough to warn, it would leave me with a sense of robbery. <br /> <br /> Go now ... back to your brother to slip the 2nd season. <br /> <br /> V.
