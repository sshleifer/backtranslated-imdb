True, Alex has become small, but they are still (for me) the biggest rock trio. I recommend this DVD to every fan from the heart. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed that they canceled their recently planned Munich concept (logistics) and regretted that they had not tried to see them elsewhere. The DVD has a little consolation - the biggest incentive to get the right DVD playback setup. Maybe it's na√Øve, but I still don't understand the importance of tumble dryers on stage; I would be grateful for any explanation. <br /> <br /> Greetings, Iain.
