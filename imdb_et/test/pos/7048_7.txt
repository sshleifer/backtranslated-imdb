If you take a movie for what it's worth, you won't be disappointed. If you think Murray should win the Oscar for his action and this is a movie you expect, don't worry. It was funny when I saw it in 1979 and has not lost its charm. Good clean fun for kids and frantic entertainment for older people. The story is simple and easy to follow. Murray has done better, but it's his first film. The film reminds me of the time when we didn't need blood and courage. Morty has a head dunce and plays it perfectly. Other advisers are typical reved up teenagers who want to have fun in the summer. One nice thing about this movie is the message.
