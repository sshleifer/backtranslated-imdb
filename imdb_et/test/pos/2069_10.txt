I've watched every version of this game I think including several on stage and Sir Derek Jacobi is the absolute best Hamlet I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> He has the most amazing voice on stage and his expressive face is a roller-coaster of emotions during this game. The way he carries his lines takes you through madness. He (like Hamlet) may be for a moment to be loving, soft and gentle, and at some other moment to scare hell for his life. You believe he is hurt, you believe he is angry, you believe he is not a little crazy. You think he's Hamlet. <br /> <br /> Of course, some thanks will probably go to Shakespeare :) but without a great actor to get words on the stage, it's not really important how well written the game is. <br /> <br /> If you like Shakespeare, you should definitely see this version. If you don't like Shakespeare, you should definitely see this version. If you do, you'll come back to Shakespeare for a new recognition. Sir Derek gives you the nuances that leave you in the soul.
