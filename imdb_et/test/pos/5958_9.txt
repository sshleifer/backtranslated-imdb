It looks like M.Hazanavičius is back! The man behind the "La classe américaine" returns with truly fun and smart sequels to these old-fashioned OSS-117 ... considering that the directors tend to overestimate the aftermath of the old classics (remember avengers, urk), Hazanavicius decided to work for a really cheap hero, OSS-117 , with a low budget French 007, and decides to do it through the old school ... Photography, body attitudes, choreography and FX, everything is like respecting how the movies were made back in the 50s. And it works because the movie's tone and jokes are really good! Jean Dujardin perfectly embodies the stupid-arrogant-macho-selfish French spy lost in a country that he understands only in terms of folklore and inferiority. Yeah, just like the randomness uses its colonies back then (and oh no, I'm not saying it has something to do with what's happening in the same area today ... ah ah) ... She looks like frozen Lino Ventura, with something less than 40 pounds, which is perfect for a role. Other cast members are well suited, everything that can be dream of Russian spies, independent and ex-Nazis of Egypt. And, of course, women, because there have to be "femmes fatales" with any good spy movies ... The plot is good (maybe not brilliant, but really good enough), what happens between the actual historical facts and the funny thing about France (and others) treated their colonies these days. It all starts in 1955 when the British spy disappears when he watches Russia, which is full of weapons in Suez. Then France sends her best friend, agent OSS-117, to find out what happened to both the shipment and the agent. that this agent is really as stupid as he can, and he slips through the story without even understanding it, solving it in a very clouseau-esquire way. I have to say that I had a bad feeling about the film because the advertising around it was pretty scary and when French humor tends to be quite populist and flat (forget les bronze 3 or camping ...), but I was really surprised and a good way ! I highly recommend whether you want a good parody of bond movies (for example, more fun than, for example, DEBS, but less skirts) or you're a true and honest filming fan they played back in 5O. . Yes, it's smart and (really!) Funny, you've got Mr. Hazanavić again!
