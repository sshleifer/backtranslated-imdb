The demon, from wood, removes itself in the form of a human man to love a young just girl for her death only. Deemon's eyes freeze, two drops of blood fall into the bed he was specially designed for his desire. The bed consumes blood and it is hungry. Everything that comes in contact with the bed is consumed! This is explained to us by one of the bed victims, a painter whose soul trap is one of his last works, the artistic alteration of his final resting place (.. he died of consumption, coughing of blood, deciding to die in bed). You see a painter we see as if he was detained in small spaces, looking through his painting, unfortunately at the observer's bed. The bed has a dark sense of humor, and we see it through allowing the painter to live, even giving him jewelry and other things when they have eaten the victims. One of the victims' skulls is with bright red flowers that are not in the basement of the bed. There are three young women in the movie who are experiencing a manor house that holds a cellar containing a bed of death. The artist (Dave Marsh) can only be a method of destroying the death bed, but it contains a human sacrifice to restore the body of a person whose death first caused hunger. Patrick Spence-Thomas offers the trapped painter a soft, depressing voice telling the film about lying about his current situation, telling us about previous victims, and often tearing down his bed of predators. <br /> <br /> A final, true cult movie .. I hope that this status will increase now that BIRTHED FEED: BED, EATS has found its way into the audience (like me) who appreciates the odd and grotesque. The bed itself contains a liquid type of acid with an apple cider tone, where we can see what objects and people (.. fighting with zero) are consumed. Many would appreciate the young William Russ (BOY MEETS WORLD, UNHOLY) waving, looking for his runaway sister, finding him in the basement, zombie-like and traumatized (.. of course, Julie Ritter was pretty much so movie, trance, barely to say) with them both trapped. One of the most demented scenes in the film attempts to stretch the bed just to grasp his hands, the meat is acidified only with the remaining skeleton, the cartilage deteriorates. The victim, whose legs were caught in the bed, tried for a long time to escape, almost as if in the basement, when his pages were captured by him. The film seems almost completely surreal when we look at a macabre nightmare. Director George Barry often has victims who find themselves in the most deplorable situation by choosing a deathbed as their shelter. There's really nothing about this movie, it's definitely unique.
