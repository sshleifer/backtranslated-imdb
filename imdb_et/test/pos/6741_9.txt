The viewer who said he was disappointed seems to be wildly absent here. It's a great movie, with an excellent and realistic imagination of a middle-class Jewish family at Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. The nuances are perfect and I felt that everyone's casting was better. I just found Judith Ivey's work of perfection - especially the speech she has with her daughter when her daughter arrives home at the end of one night. This scene was worth Oscar. But it all worked fine. I recommend this movie. It's a fun, family movie and a delightful vision of how a cute middle-class family lived in Brooklyn so long ago. Look at it and you're glad you did. Are some very funny lines and the character of Eugene is a real comedian - very funny.
