With so many people watching this movie, there is a problem they look at. People come to look for a B-class horror film or a "good bad" movie. Jack Frost 2 is neither of them. <br /> <br /> Simply put, it's a very good movie that is hidden inside a very bad one. To look at it other than a comic comedy (more fun than all three absolutely immortal "scary movies" in combination) is the wrong interpretation of the film at the basic level. It would be like watching Shawshank Redemption and then complaining about the absence of explosions. <br /> <br /> The assumption is simple; The characters of the first movie, haunted by Jack Frost's memories, take a vacation on a tropical island. The new, improved Jack comes after them, now essentially with the Spider-Man hydro-man; in essence, he can turn lightly and quickly out of the water, share himself, multiply himself, and in the worst case he has succeeded in immunity to his only weakness ... AntiFreeze. <br /> <br /> What is sad about this film is that the dead fans of the first Jack Fros (just HORRIBLE movie) brain cannot appreciate the successor change. Just as Alien was a horror film, and aliens were involved in the action, Jack Frost was a weak horror attempt and Jack Frost 2 was wisely written in the paradise of tricky horror movies. <br /> <br /> Most of the entertainment comes from live actors who earn great service. Particularly funny is Ray Tooney (the cartoon of a British colonel retired from the early 1900s), Christopher Allport (providing a crazy, fun spin from his first film) and David Allen Brooks (once a serious role in creating new, strange heights). <br /> <br /> The lack of "memorable quotes" disturbs me. <br /> <br /> Like the horror movie, Jack Frost 2: Mutant's Revenge Killer Snowman, sets zero. But you have to understand, it's not HORROR MOVIE.
