The big news is that this movie is now available on DVD at http://treasureflix.com for all those who want to own it and use video. This is good news because it's one of my favorite films! <Br>> <br /> I was watching this movie for the first time in the 80s and this is a mandatory vacation view. Living in a small market town Tewkesbury, picturesque and with its traditions, reenactions and traditions, we are also a cozy close community. We are now also facing the development of a large housing that threatens to destroy the community, and you see why I love this movie. First of all, the most important thing is that LASHINGS is snow !!!! Then the Christmas tree is a beautiful legend and also a Christian condemnation because the whole community attracts money to help the poor farmer save his farm and stay in the community. Evil developers - only after sending money all over the city - allow their money to help protect what they have, which is very special. I love how the whole community sends its message to Santa through the post office, which the hero misunderstands. He and his daughter have to make a long journey after the death of the mother and mother. (This is likely to be a candidate) - once driving and the warmest of all the heart is that a taxi driver whose engine is broken is mysteriously given to new people in the morning of Christmas and no one has constructed it! It is a beautiful moment when Denver sings lullaby and an exciting search. A great gentle movie about everything that is actually on Christmas.
