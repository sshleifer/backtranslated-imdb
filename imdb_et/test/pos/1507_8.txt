In the late eighties and early nineties, independent video companies such as Vestron and Media effectively shut down Italian horror films from a large number of American audiences. Randomly (?) Italian genres also declined in terms of quality and profitability. <br /> <br /> Sometimes movies like Primal Rage, "Lakes" like Beyond The Door III, Troll 2, and some Dario Argento movies that stayed in the video but most remained in the US only a decade or longer (up to DVD) . The films of these lost years became very desirable and were spoken by horror. <br /> <br /> Of these films, Cat In The Brain is probably one of the most amazing, because the legions of fans of Lucio Fulci and the fact that he was not only led but celebrated his idol, Fulci himself. <br /> <br /> Although not quite Fulci's best, it is still better than most of its later efforts. He probably loves his rabbi fan base. Depending on their taste, it can also be enjoyed by Italian horrors and giallo aficionados. People who only look at Hollywood stuff may not be able to talk about many glowing reviews here. <br /> <br /> One of the things I personally found was the scenes that were probably Benito Mussolini's only permanent contribution to Italy, Cinecitta Studios. The name is instantly recognizable to any Italian movie fan. Until I saw it, I could only imagine what it looked like.
