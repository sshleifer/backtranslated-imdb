ASCENT is a very valuable addition to the recent Soviet reopening. Director Larisa Shepitko The 1977 film explores moral religion and honor in German occupied Russia during World War II. On foot and on snow, two partisan Soviet members leave for supplies and Nazi soldiers. At the heart of the film is how each person deals with or introduces his or her moral alternatives. One chooses dignity and honesty, while others choose to cooperate with enemies. Eventually, however, he cannot follow his selfish decision. The film uses a lot of slow, wide-angle panels that move to extreme neighbors and highlight the spiritual flaw of every human being. It's not a great movie, but it effectively represents a moral dilemma in the harsh and cold Soviet wilderness.
