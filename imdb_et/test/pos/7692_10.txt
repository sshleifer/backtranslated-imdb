I saw this movie when I was a kid and I was never looking for it. This rate is there for Cabin in the Sky, Stormy Weather and Carmen Jones as must see movies that presented awesome talents to African Americans. In the 60s there was a local Los Angeles TV channel for a week movie and some stations show the same movie in 5 days. Pergia and Bess were one of them, and all my family would be there all 5 nights in front of the television and only the South Pacific, Oklahoma and The Sound of Music are all the music classics you can get at every video store. It would be a shame to allow this part of America's best talents to be forgotten or locked in the treasury. Please make the film available to the public.
