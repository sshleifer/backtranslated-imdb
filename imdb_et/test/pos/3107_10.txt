Ghost Walks is a delightful little mystery with a great twist, a spooky dialogue, and the best thing about a tiny piece played by the exciting character actor Johnny Arthur, which never abandons or denies his character. Mr. Arthur is great at his Homer Erskine, bringing a great comic relief as Broadway producer Herman Wood's secretary, played by another great actor Richard Carle. <br /> <br /> They play great with each other. Although Homer character is used to describe acceptable words of timed sister and cream buffer, this does not mean that men in the film do not speak, but does not mean that it is meaningful or intended for migration. his employer, who burns and wastes him every second arena, and who sees his devoted employee almost almost irritating. <br /> <br /> There is a big scene where Homer tells his boss that he has dedicated his best years to his life and has been all but mother. <br /> <br /> The mystery of the movie is very entertaining and eventually the twist may leave you stitched. <br /> <br /> For a low-budget poverty line image, this movie is a great set of decoration and great costume. <br /> <br /> Direc Mr Frank Strayer is working on his creativity and this film is much better than some of his low-budget mystery aspirations, but he had a great script to work with and some great actors to do it. <br /> <br /> This movie is a line of poverty for the devotees of old movies, the old dark house (they were able to actually work on the lines "It was dark and stormy night") and it is an additional benefit to be the early representation of homosexuals in a movie nothing bad happens. <br /> <br /> This movie is available in the public archives of the web archive at archive.org.
