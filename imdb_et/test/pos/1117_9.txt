A great family film and a beautiful horse movie. 75 +% entertainment. Casey, Buddy, Kelly Marsh are very interesting and loving characters. Horses are real beauties. <br /> <br /> Is horse racing the backdrop to showing how happiness is sometimes good. Shows how children are stupid things in stupid things. Shows how adults can make dumb things for selfish reasons. Very realistically depicted characters make the film an unrealistic subject to something that everyone can associate with. <br /> <br /> Andrew Rubin is a great Buddy, a brilliant parent. Sometimes Aidan Quinn reminded me (eyes, speech delivery, facial appearance). <br /> <br /> Casey makes you serious about the character of love. Sarah Blue also represents Alexis Smith nicely. Father, Lloyd Bourdelle, plays Walter Matthau and he's a character. <br /> <br /> Although the film has room for development, it's a very enjoyable, good-looking movie.
