The True-inspired radio is one of the best, heart-sensing dramas that I have often published widely. This is definitely one of the best films of 2003. <br /> <br /> Radio stars Ed Harris, who is still worthy of Oscar for this film, as Harold Jones football player. Coach Jones has taught football all his life and loves the game. But Coach Jones doesn't spend much time with his wife and daughter, played by Debra Winger and Sarah Drew. One day radio, played by Gooding Jr. of Cuba, is the best football field when the coach's team plays during the game. Some team members, then tie the radio and throw it into the building. Then they beat the building, and finally Jones coach suspects something is wrong. He's coming over and helping the radio, who's scared, and from that moment on, Coach Jones and the radio are very special. The radio receives every football game and really enjoys participating in football games and school events. He will also become Coach Jones's main interest in life with football, which was initially his main priority both for his family and for the radio. <br /> <br /> The film discusses all the real problems, including your priorities, which are your priorities, the acceptance of people for who they are, even if they are different, death and family relationships. The film touches on all these issues and much more and it is very well done and director Michael Tollin should be very proud of this film. The most pleasant thing about radio was how real it was. The performances were like seeing something in the real life that goes right before your eyes. There was a great combination of comedy and drama on the radio. Some parts were pretty funny, but the other parts were very serious and sad. Finally, I feel that critics have neglected only the average view of the radio. They have to have their heads there, because its amazing how this movie receives only 2 star comments and something like rock school can get 3 or 4 stars, which makes no sense to me. The above-mentioned performances are also top-notch and Oscar-worthy. In my opinion, both Ed Harris, who I think is underrated as an actor, and Gooding Jr. of Cuba should both be able to name this film. Radio is one of my favorite films that gives me a reason to see great Hollywood movies. My final rating for the radio is 9/10.
