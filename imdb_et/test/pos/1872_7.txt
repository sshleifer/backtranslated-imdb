I firmly believe that film, television series, or any form of art should and should be fully appreciated when the timing factor - if it is written, produced or planned - has to be taken into account. <br /> <br /> Yeh Jo Shark Zindagi is one such series. I remember this in the mid-1980s on television and restarting through video cassette libraries in the early 1990s. and laugh out loud and be addicted to it. It made me buy a whole series of DVD sets and surprises - comedy and good moments of the Olympic Games just fell for me. Even a very popular "30-year-old experience" "GULAAAAB JAMUN!" and "sofa cum bed" was not based on what I thought. Timing factor: In the 80s it was an actor. The main event. Mother of all TV comedies. And it worked over age and time! Maybe you can't say the same right now, but despite the fact that watching a DVD brings you some nice memories. I want Shafi Inamdar and Swarup Sampat to have longer seasons. Satish Shah has been at the center of the exhibition with an incredibly good support as far as Farida Jalal, Tiku Talsania and Bengal are concerned. Rakesh Bedi Hams all the time. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the experience that brings back memories to those who showed it during the main times may not be for younger viewers or first-time viewers!
