This film is quite better than the first "Astérix et Obelix contre César", but it is far from perfect. Customizing the comic book is good, some pictures and film dialogues are the same as in the book. But there are a few things that made the film not as intermittent as the animated film that appeared in 1968. For example, fighting between Numerobis and Amonbofis. It was neither necessary nor even credible for Astérix's little love story. There were also some things, such as animated songs and some other things ... I've been deceiving the movie because they cut things I was expecting and they showed things I didn't want or needed to see. I know that it would have been very difficult to make a movie just like a comic book or animated movie, but that was what I expected. In conclusion, even if the film is good, I still prefer an animated film that I think is much better.
