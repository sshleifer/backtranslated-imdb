Before I was watching the movie from start to finish, I just happened in the last half hour. I usually don't watch a movie if I haven't seen it from the beginning, but my friend had turned it on and when I started watching it, I couldn't stop. <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised this movie didn't get wide theater information. It's a pretty funny movie (often with a sense of humor) and the monster and the monster truck are quite menacing. The Monster makes the Leatherface beautiful and the monster truck is like a cross between a German artillery vehicle and a giant coffin in World War I. <br /> <br /> A fearsome twenty-five-year-old virgin boy is a long ride to stop the woman with whom he loves to marry. His former best friend celebrates him and his clothes constantly. They threaten the way from the vintage black heart and the monster truckist mentioned above. They also take on a very sexy jumper playing with Aimee Brooks. <br /> <br /> I also watched an animated trailer with a director's commentary and an electronic press kit and found both of them interesting. I would like to make the commentary on the director and the two male-marked functions quite enjoyable, but I have so many other films I've never seen.
