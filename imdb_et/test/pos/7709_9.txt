Film noir meets anime ... brilliant! It was one of the surprisingly creative shorts of Animatrix. It was one of my favorites, if not my favorite (I also loved the world record). This is basically a reference to those classic film's detective and 40's films, except that it is animated and includes the Matrix. But being animated, he can take extreme camera angles, detective lifestyles, shadows, and everything that shoots to a whole new level. Femme Fatale? Trinity. The story of the detective seems to be alive in the 40s in his minds, but he is stuck in today's world and everything gets too much for him when his case is suddenly scientific literature and agents, when a secret woman walks in his office in black. <br /> <br /> My class: 9/10
