Of course, before you see the House of Waxi, I assumed it was just a second-tier, low-quality teenage movie that followed the footsteps of movies like The Darkness or Amityville Horror. After getting to college on campus, I can honestly say that Dark Castle people have done an excellent job to do slasher. <br /> <br /> Starting from the usual clips of teen horror movies, such as a small group of friends leaving on a journey, a strange detour will come over, leading them through the highways, meeting the terrible locals after a slow but obligatory story really comes to the fast customer . Paris Hilton appears in this movie, as many already know, but I have to give him his ballsy performance. It is clear that his actions were not worth the Oscar, but the filmmakers use their appearance completely, squeezing his two blatant satire, saying that the appearance of this film is less dignified. Ms. Hilton also claims the title of the biggest death scene in the movie, not just because it was his death scene. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of brim with moments and cheap fears, but Jaume Serra has definitely created high-quality tension and tension between characters. The causes of fear are partly based on the public taking care of what we do. The usual accumulation was followed by loud noise and another frightening moment in the camera. These cinematographic works taken from many films are almost perfect with this film and offer a lot of good fears. In fact, it is not a slow moment after they have reached a small town with a scary wax house. <br /> <br /> This movie owes much to earlier films from this and other genres, although I'm not sure how much originally came from the 1953 movie of the same title. References to movies such as Texas Chainsaw Masacres, Saw and even Titanic (see Paris Hilton's great death scene and you know what I mean) are common, but eventually you will be paid and filled if you are looking for a good fear of some laughter. Not bad.
