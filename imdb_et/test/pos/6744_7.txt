In this Colombian crackerjack noir thriller, a combination of panic on the streets and a naked city, Evelyn Keyes is an abducted killer in The New York. Evelyn, who smuggled some stolen jewelery into Cuba, also smuggled pox. Doctor William Bishop can be misdiagnosed and if they know what the hunt is for him. <br /> <br /> For most movies, the Treasury Department has also taken Keyes, but for smuggling. The health department and law enforcement do not understand that they are looking for the same woman until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Evelyn is on a mission. His wife, Charles Korvin, has left his apartment, which was the most inconvenient when he was stupid with his sister when he was collecting precious stones in Cuba and making smallpox. When Lola Albright, as her sister, commits suicide over the whole thing, Evelyn is on a mission, gets to Korin or dies. And this is not an unexpected threat due to the situation. <br /> <br /> The movie was mostly shot in New York, like Naked City, and its casting is scattered freely with many familiar names and faces. Keep an eye out for Connie Gilchrist's good performances, such as Evely's sympathetic homeowner, Jim Backus as a cozy club owner, and Art Smith as the Corvin Fence. <br /> <br /> A real sleeping place in the noir category, don't miss it being forwarded.
