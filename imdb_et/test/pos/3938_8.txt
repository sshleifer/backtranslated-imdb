I was really surprised that, unlike most documentaries, he wrote, directed and directed this film critic - Richard Schickel. In most cases, when I know where the film critics were involved in the films, the films turn out to be bombs (Rex Reed starring "Myra Breckenridge" and Roger Ebert's writing on "The Valley of Dolls" are the main examples). In this case, the powers of the critic are used for good and not for evil - and the results are better (although it doesn't speak much because the films mentioned are among the worst films). <Br / Clint Eastwood (a pretty good choice) talks about the documentary and is able to discuss his long career - from his silent days to his death in the early 1960s. The only negative and small ones are that the film is terribly short (like most movies) and Gary Cooper is very little human being - you really don't know so much about your life. But as a nice overview of your movies, it works very well.
