The hospital is a film that was made before that time. This film, created by scriptwriter Paddy Chayefsky, gave us the Oscar winning film "The Network" on superfluous staff, incompetence and bureaucratic corruption in Manhattan's large conglomerate hospitals. George C. Scott, who is a great physician, is driven by alcoholism and the desire for death when he tries to recover from divorce, throwing his son from the house and, at worst, into a medical facility where corruption and incompetence take precedence over the care and healing of sick and injured people. <br /> <br /> Mr. Scott makes the film himself and the audience is shocked by what they are watching in this medical facility. You may feel the "pain" that this hospital has done to her. Vivid images of this hospital's incompetence are so vivid and dramatic that you can laugh and deeply disturb the scene. <br /> <br /> If only the film was in this documentary style as it begins, this picture would be great. Unfortunately, Scott has suffered a sub-block for an old patient's daughter. The patient has murdered people in the hospital. This is where the credibility of the image becomes tense. The romantic dialogue scenes do not add anything to the picture, and a spiritual patient who is a doctor has found it to be absolutely incredible. Simple security speech and document control should have avoided killing senile patient. It takes almost the entire movie before the residents get involved in the movie to get the patient out of the hospital. I didn't see a single person who was hurting this much, even if it was corrupt because that hospital is. <br /> <br /> In addition, George C's character is "overworked" (another goal) because the script has too many things. at the same time. For example, in 20 minutes, 20 different doctors may be blamed and denied what they should have done or not. Sisters and aids are the same story. Someone was wrong, someone got the wrong medicine and died, the doctor was acting on the wrong patient when the other doctor did the same thing, accusing a third sister who hadn't been calling because another nurse who had to receive the patient was on a coffee break. There are also many subtle, dark humor with the same messages of incompetence and corruption to the viewer. <br /> <br /> This repetition of medical failure is unforgettable. But the murder sub-block is more disturbing than this movie. If at the heart of this film is staff incompetence and Scott's reaction to it, then you are glued to the screen. But the conversations between Scott and the daughter of a mad patient are forcing the film with the "Who did it?" scenario that seriously damages the quality of the film. When a loony patient reveals how he did the killings, I thought: Why did the manufacturers need a "patient killer" mad patient subset? I think the only point of Scott's character that had a connection with the old patient's daughter was to give her to someone to communicate with. The hospital should have kept its wretched accusation against the medical staff by removing the interest of love and the scenes of the mad patient. It should have focused more on the incompetence of B.S. At a time when this film might have been phenomenal, the bottom-line stories make the film a very good one, rather than a very good masterpiece.
