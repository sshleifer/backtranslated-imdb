Have you ever wondered what he likes to be FREE? I am sure that each of us knows the meaning of freedom and never thinks seriously about using it for our benefit. HARI OM shows the audience what freedom actually means. This film describes the freedom in the style represented by the Father's discovery in India. The Father discovers his true true love when he is on Ricka's journey with Mr. HARI OM. She looks at life differently and represents the freedom that every woman limits her relationship. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely "worth seeing" and I saw it for the first time in the Dubai International Film Festival (DIFF) and I was completely satisfied with the cinema. <br /> <br /> "Look at it"!
