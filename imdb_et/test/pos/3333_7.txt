"Saint Takes Over" stands for George Sanders, who is Simon Templar, named "Saint" in this 1940s. He also celebrates Wendy Barrie, Jonathan Hale and Paul Guilfoyle. On a ship to the United States, the Holy One meets and tries time with his wife (Wendy Barrie), who gives him a brush. Simon arrives in New York to help Inspector Fernack, who is now heavily discredited due to the gangster structure; $ 50,000 was found in her home. Gangster, Rocky (Roland Drew), of course, was not convicted in the trial, and he and his colleagues pay a fee of $ 90,000 for the frame and the lawyer's representation. Today you have to protect yourself against a parking ticket. It was a murder rap. <br /> <br /> Rocky sends his bodyguard Pearly Gates (Guilfoyle) home to steal $ 90,000. The lawyer catches her with a red hand and sends her back to her boss with a message. Seconds later, he's dead. Rocky corresponds to a similar fate. And on and on - who kills the gangsters of this group? One must be able to talk to one of them so that Fernack can be deleted - will he get anyone before they are killed? The woman she met on board the ship appears and sees the case prominently. <br /> <br /> Few actors are on the line with George Sanders and his dry spirit, good looks, smooth voice and depth as an actor, ideally suited to Simon Templar. Paul Guilfoyle offers nerve, drinking milk from Pearly Gates humor, and Jonathan Hale is a great, sometimes irritated, but worried sick inspector, Fernack. Wendy Barrie, who appeared in many episodes of Saint, is very good as a woman who is trying Simon's heart. <br /> <br /> Very enjoyable.
