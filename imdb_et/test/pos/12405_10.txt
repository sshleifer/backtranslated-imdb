This movie was so nice that I don't think I was really blinking during the viewing. One intense situation after another kept me glued. But I would have liked Corey Feldman to be much more in this picture. He just steals every scene he has. This may be my favorite Corey performance. The end was wisely and unlike other movies that draw back the body of pleasant supportive characters, this movie goes for it! I liked it was not graphic blood and gore, but more of the viewer's imagination. Bravo. During this torture scene I had to literally sweep my forehead with a paper sweat. Ultimately, the film works thanks to its delightful management badge and the fantastic presence of my all time favorite bad guys, James Remar (48 hours, remember?). I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to break the sweat. <br /> <br />
