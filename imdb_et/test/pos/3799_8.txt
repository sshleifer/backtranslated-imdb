I saw this movie late in the night at the Buffalo TV about 30 years ago and I die to see it one more time before I ... well know. The interaction between the main characters of Tigri (Eli Wallach) "hits" his prey (Anne Jackson) in a botched robbery test is completely fun. Charles Nelson Reilly is the Dean of the Neurotic University (?) Or Head of Department. How many movies can you name, which can enlighten the struggle of mankind for meaning and fulfillment, making you laugh from beginning to end? This film reminds us that we are all in the same struggle, regardless of class, race, gender, or religion. And who can forget the suburban homeowner's hand and knee scene, these little tiny weeds who have dared to appear overnight in their excellent manicure grass!
