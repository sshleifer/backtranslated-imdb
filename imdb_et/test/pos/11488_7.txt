"Dedicated" is all about Graham as an indestructible optimist who is looking for his own stranger spouse who has gone to look for himself, all of which brings some kind of cumbersome, comedic odyssey that involves a number of side effects and questions. The fresh, fun and unpredictable little stroke that a "devoted" story does not allow is of good nature and fine morals and maxima. If you enjoy this little chick flick that has received a review of critics and the average public in general, you might want to look at Indie "Manny & Lo" by Lisa Krueger (1996). (B)
