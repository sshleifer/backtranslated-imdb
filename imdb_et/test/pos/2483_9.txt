This extraordinary pseudo-documentary film, made in 1971, is a great hit by the American zeitgeist today ... which makes it even more frightening and more relevant. "Subversives" (college students, hippies, black activists, academics) have been rounded off by the government and have been sentenced to lengthy prison sentences for the amount of thought crimes and social protest. As an alternative to life in prison, they are offered "convicted offenders" three days in a "punishment park". Their goal inside the park is to make the way to the American flag where freedom awaits them. No wonder the choice of the punishment park is dirty wrong. This Peter Watkin brilliant film even made "Battle Royale" and "Series 7", although the angle of this attack is more political. In the '71s, it seems and looks as fresh as it is today. The performances are exemplary and the direction is sharp. Narrative trimming takes place between different groups that catch the park in rough conditions and have been convicted by McCarthy-like attempts to survive. Today, this film still retains its power. In '71 there was nothing but something like that. This is a masterpiece that succeeds in dozens of levels. It is the balls most people have lost today.
