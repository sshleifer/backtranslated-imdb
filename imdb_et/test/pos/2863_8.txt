In my taste in movies, I will continue to be amazingly and probably my readers of reviews, but to everyone and I have a weak spot for crazy horror, slasher flicks and This No Evil happens to be exactly the same and more! I think the biggest mistake of filmmakers and filmmakers is that they talk about it as a WWE film and "starring" KANE. WWE can be a great next, but it's a very specific group that follows an incredibly cheesy and (sorry folks) type trailer park "sport" and those who don't love it HAATTTE IT! This would make them a case that would otherwise be typical of gory slasher flick that people come out of droves to see. Watch No Evil does not break any new horror, it is precisely to play a typical horror with some over the top, terrible bloody scene that honestly indexes your screen. They really drive it home and cause unjustified violence. The psychological aspect is not exactly the same, although there are some fear factors to the search for this monster. <br /> <br /> KANE (wrestler), also known as Glen Jacobs, plays Jacob Goodnight, a religiously and physically tortured man. He is the ultimate cross between Leatherface and Jason Voorhees. He is not the original killer, and even his killings are not really unique or original, except that the girl is suffocated by death, forcing her to swallow her mobile phone ... yeeeeah !! He does a good job and the man is legally enormous! He's standing 7 feet tall and has no monsters! Tiffany Lamb, Penny McNamee, Samantha Noble, Michael J. Pagan, Luke Pegler, Christina Vidal, Rachael Taylor are playing a typical group of "think they're unbeaten" festive teens who unwittingly become victims of the serum killer. The story is that in return for a month ago for their liens for theft from theft to the possession of drugs, they are sent to the old hotel to make a "community service", confirming it. It turns out that there is a serial killer on the top floor and he removes the eyes of his victims to cleanse their sins. Luke Pegler stands out as a bag of bags that eventually becomes a hero, even if he rescues his former girlfriend he was beaten. The rest are playing well in their perspective, but it is not a great deal of action. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Porn director ... yes PORN ... Gregory Dark, does a good job with today's slipping. He goes to the killer even a little bit of history, and although his back story is not unique, it is actually a bit hidden, which is still interesting. And in a few shots where the filmmaker actually looks through the eyes of the killer, it is interesting to hear voices and see things that are distorted as he does. He throws a mandatory soft core nude shot and grotesque, blood-soaked scenes and makes everything up the notch. It fits well and a spooky fan like me is fun. Kane's serum killer is terrible and he will stop them all with brutal intelligence and silent horror. The film is sealed and spoken, and I don't blame anyone because it's pretty dirty, but isn't it? This is a horror film, and I thought it should be exactly that. It made me jump, made me brighter, and it also turned ME in many parts ... impressive by any standard. It is an entertaining, decent story and plenty of settings that are designed to see No Evil up to the 15th installment if they want and I say it! It is true that the film is full of plot holes, ridiculous details, but deadly gore and horror rides it all. It all comes down to you love horror movies? Really love them? If so, you think it's a terrible slasher ... if not ... you hate it ... plain and simple. 8.5 / 10
