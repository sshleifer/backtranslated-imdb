I have DVD mini-devices because I love this story so much. This is one of the best periods of the civil war I saw when talking about the story of friendship shared by war. Costumes are great, the story is great, I love the way the story jumps from character to character to guess what happens next in your life. There is a great balance between good and evil. Some of the signs that I find evil are too good not to look. Every time something more despicable than the last case, I cursed the TV as they would hear me. I love the way this miniature makes my drama. However, I would recommend not to watch the third movie in the DVD series. It is lower than the first two movies and most of the original characters don't come back. I don't want to remember how the third movie ended, I prefer to live with the end of the second movie. It makes me happy.
