"Four daughters" simply begins with another "Little Women" type melodrama clone. One father with four musically talented eligible daughters is full of hands, trying to keep them and lead them in their rituals. What turns the film around is an unexpected appearance of the new Hollywood star, some critics say long before the big screen of James Dean. From the time when Mickey Borden's (John Garfield's) predictive darkness appears at Ann Lemp's (Priscilla Lane) gate, which sprays his self-hate and condemned philosophy for the rest of the pain, "Four Girls" becomes much more than just a chick when Garfield is The main reason why to watch "Four daughters" is the other shine flashing. Hungarian-born director Michael Curtiz, who later was responsible for the gems such as "Casablanca" and "Mildred Pierce", specifies some images with his camera (assisted by Ernest Haller "Rebel Without A Cause"), which remains in the minds of the viewers. for example, the trembling gate that Ann's first smoke, Felix Deitz (Jeffrey Lynn), is so joyful, symbolizes the shifts in the mood and affection of people using it. <br /> <br /> This Garfield delivers excellent performance, but the rest of the majority keeps it up. Under-performing Jeffrey Lynn performs his role perfectly as a neglected defendant whose love for his dear Anni never disappears when he is with another man. Claude Rains, who is somewhat uncertain as the father of a woman of four young women, gives a subtle image to the collection that carries the head of the family who is losing shuffle. Three Lane Sisters, who are already known for their musical abilities, are becoming actors, playing their parts well. Many supporters, including Dick Foran, Frank McHugh, May Robson, and Eddie Acuff, all make this credible. <br /> <br /> How the opposites are attracted is part of the impact on the viewer's imagination. Ann is an eternal optimist, even when she and Mickey are down and out. She always looks at the bright side and, like the pliers of many major depressions these days, she saw wealth just around the corner. Mickey tells a whole list of the bad things that have happened to him to look for Ann's refusal from Ann's misery. Mickey hopes to go out with the flash, trying to kill him when he lives in the corner. Mickey's talent is a composer; Ann has a talent as a singer and musician. Ann is great in beauty; Mickey has a great sense of personality in a complex sense. And the differences continue and continue. How this is all agreed is an important part of the film that must not be missed. <br /> <br /> See "Four daughters" on John Garfield's cozy actor debut on the big screen. The only time he was better came seven years later, when he again captured the film's performance with one of the biggest screens, as Frank Chambers "Postimees always worships twice", equally against the same charismatic Lana Turner. But also look at "Four daughters" to catch the important elements that can be skipped if too much concentration is placed on the exhibition note.
