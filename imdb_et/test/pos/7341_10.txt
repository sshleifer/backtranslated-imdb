Thank you for such a wonderful escape. I love it for movies. I'm so impressed with the air colors, the way they were shot and the timing was so dynamically perfect with music, being a dancer, and being part of many choreographies of dancing movies, cubes and sometimes not even winning ..... "Showgirls" movie. The relationship between women was once so great in movement. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the last one when it is pulled up. I've seen a movie earlier, a different version. I felt a little more damage this time. It changes how I feel about female love birds. It's all so magical.
