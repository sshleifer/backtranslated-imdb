Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco), called Alejandro Polanco, works as a car body repairer, known as the Iron Triangle, near twenty block lines for car spam and car repair shops in Shea Stadium in Queens, New York. Here, customers do not doubt whether parts come from stolen cars or why they can get such great discounts, they just put their money down and hope that everything is up and up. Such weaknesses have not been highlighted in the guides, but the Iranian-American director Ramin Bahrani puts them on a lively display at the Chop Shop, a powerful Indie movie that got a lot of affection last year in Cannes, Berlin and Toronto. Following his acclaimed "Man Push Cart", Bahran spent a year and a half in a place described by F. Scott Fitzgerald as in Great Gatsby's as "ashes of the ash". <br /> <br /> For all this depiction of darkness, Chop Shop is not a job of social criticism, but like Hector Babenco Pixote, a poignant character study in which a young boy's survival is bought at the price of his innocence. The location of the picture at Willet Point in Queens makes Bahran feel like you are there, sweat in the hot and humid New York summer, where all the noise and chaos is. At the heart of the movie is the charming, modern, smart 12-year-old Ale, who lives on the edge without adult support or other supervision than her boss (Rob Sowulski), the real owner of the iron triangle garage. Polanco's performance is crude and slightly dirty, but he was fully honored by the constant assassination he received during the premiere of the film in Cannes and the hugging of the great Iranian director Abbas Kiarostam. <br /> <br /> The narrow little room above the garage, along with his 16-year-old sister Isamar (Isamar Gonzales), who works for lunch at the South Wagon, is Ale as one of the interchangeable parts he deals with. Although he has dreams of owning a car, he knows in a city that never sleeps, that the only thing that can do the "top of the pile" is another odorless fender. In this environment, Ale and Isi use all the tools they need to keep their heads over water, while their love for each other remains constant and they still laugh and act in childhood, which was never their own. As Barack Obama says in his book "Dreams of my Dad", change may come later when their eyes laugh and they have closed something inside. Meanwhile, Ale supplements her income by selling candy bars on overcrowded New York subways with her friend Carlos (Carlos Zapata) and pushing DVDs on the street, while Isi makes tricks for truck drivers to save enough money to buy rusty $ 4500 in which they are hoping to start their own business. <br /> <br /> Although Ale is a "good boy", he has not stolen the Shea Stadium in the wallet and hubcaps, which the Bahran camera observes without judgment. In the Chop Shop, Bahrani has provided convincing countermeasures to success stories at the Hollywood Dream Factory and has given us a stunning film of naturalism and respects that are similar in many ways to large Italian neo-realistic films and to the latest Iranian works by Kiarostami, Panahi and others. Although the result of the characters is far from certain, Bahrani observes that we are seeing a huge billboard at the Shea Stadium, which says, "Make dreams", leaving us with the hint that Rumi's phrase "this promise beats"
