Maybe I read it too much, but I don't know how much hand was in Hongsheng's film development. I mean, if the story is about the main characters, then I think he would have a hard hand writing, documenting, etc., and that would make it a little biased. <br /> <br /> But. ..the family and friends can also have a hand to get the real data of Hongsheng's life. I think the best view would have been from the perspective of Hongsheng's family and friends. They saw their transformation and were not as confused with the drugs they remember. <br /> <br /> As Hongsheng is full, the consistency of Jesus Christ makes him appear as a martyr who sacrificed his life (metaphorically, of course, he is still alive when he was cast) fortunately for his family. Huh? <br /> <br /> The viewer sees him at his lowest points while maintaining superiority. He lies in a tall grass with himself and his father, he thinks of life and has a vision of the dragon in his window, celebrates his freedom during cycling, pulls his hand out, his head falls, it is amazing that he is now out of drugs, but he doesn't not a hero. He went from the highest point of his career, acting as the most vulnerable to drugs to get back somewhere in the middle. <br /> <br /> The same device is used in Ted Demme's "Blow", where the audience is perceived as the main character shown as a bad hero. <br /> <br /> However, "Quitting" ("Zuotian") is a movie that is mostly recommended for its haunted soundtrack, excellent performance and landscapes. But the best part is the feeling that one can get if what we expect from Jia Hongsheng's house is actually the stage of games. It makes the viewer feel like Hongsheng's life was just a game spoken in many difficult parts.
