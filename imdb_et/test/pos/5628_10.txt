At any time, if I don't give my dreams or my goals 150%, I mean Mark Borchardt, the real theme of "American Movie". Mark's scintillating persistence in making and shooting his first feature film is so enchanting that he laughs, shaking his head with sadness and root. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen this honest documentary about the movie R. Crumb. Supporting "cast" (Mark's real family and friends) are all great. Give this film a chance and see a great movie and a wonderful portrait of what the American dream has done.
