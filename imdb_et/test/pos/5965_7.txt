Many of the animated fishermen hold a large forgotten genius of one unique art scene, the doll-animation, which he invented almost individually, Wladyslaw Starewicz. . . and as it happened, almost accidentally. Starewicz was more interested in entomology than cinema, but his failed attempt to film two stag beetles led to an unexpected breakthrough in film making when he realized that he was able to simulate movement by manipulating beetle carcasses and shooting them with a single frame of time. This discovery brought Starewicz's amazingly sophisticated classical short THE CAMERAMAN, which he made in Russia in 1912, at a time when film animation was at all ages. <br /> <br /> The political revolution of the Russian Revolution led to Starewicz in Paris, where one of his first productions - randomly? - was in a dark political satire known as "Frogland" or "The Frogs Who Wanted King". A black comedy strain can be found in almost all Starewicz films, but here it is really dark, directed more at adults who can appreciate satirical aspects than children who would probably find a climax. (I am middle-aged and found it quite troublesome, myself.) And indeed, the titles of the 1920s English-language filmmakers were given headlines that were full of punches and smiles to help soften our sharp story set in the Gender, Frogland Commonwealth, where citizens are satisfied with their government and have called for a special session to see what they can do to improve things. They decide to pray to King Jupiter. In this opening sequence, there is an impressive animation of the crowd - it would not have been possible to do so much to see so many frog hats alive - when Jupiter is depicted as a slightly white bearded man in the clouds who see him as a nap. When Jupiter sends them a tree-like god who sees them unreasonably, the frogs decide that it is not healing and require another king. Irritated, Jupiter sends them a stork. <br /> <br /> Like this magnificent new king who pulls towers at their height, and the frogs greet him with the officially dressed delegation. The mayor moves forward to give him the key to the Commonwealth, because the newspaper cameras record the event. Because of the fear of everyone, the stork quickly eats the mayor and then gets cheerfully wet, swallowing the citizens by chance. The title card looks dry: "The news of the king's appetite spread throughout the kingdom." If now the frightened frogs encourage Jupiter once again, he will lose his mood and showers with his own community of flashlights. The morality of our story, given by an unlucky frog just before he has eaten, is "Let it alone alone." it is made by a Russian emigrant who was at the height of this domestic war, it would be easy to see this parable of these events. Starewicz had or had not been confused by Russia when he made Frogland, but whatever prompted his material selection, the film is a deterrent story of universal application. "Frogland" could be the Soviet Union, Italy, Germany or Japan in the 1930s, or any country, in any era that will let its guard down and be surprised by tyranny. It's an exciting movie, even charming, but it's not a joke.
