Giorgino is a long and frightening journey from the bad to the worst protagonist's life, to whom the film is called. A young demobilized, gas-poisoned First World War Lieutenant, who was a very delicate health, who was a physician in the orphanage of children with mental disabilities, is looking for a new location and finds much more than ever before. A depressive atmosphere where desperation is much less terrible than the mind, where madness is a kind of poetry, keeps you from the first frame of the film, hypnotized. And all the beauty: the beauty of winter and mountains, the beauty of snowy landscapes and the wild forests, I don't even know how the sadness and sorrow of the last days of war can be made so beautiful.
