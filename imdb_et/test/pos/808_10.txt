David Suchet (Poirot), "FoolProof", 03 gave excellent performance as a perfectionist in almost everything he did or said. When he had a cocktail, he always had a napkin to slip the excessive mouth with incredible perfection! You can just look at the detective's face and see that he never misses the importance of the suspect's behavior. The beautiful Falls Colors through out the English countryside were just breathing. Megan Dodds, "Bait", 2000, has produced outstanding results as a very sexy, wild woman who managed to keep Mr. Poirot very secret. A very enjoyable movie if you like showing David Suchet as Mr. Poirot!
