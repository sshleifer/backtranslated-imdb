Vincenzo Buonavolunta, a man who has been working in the steel mill for years, as a nurse that Italian owners are selling Chinese, comes at the end of the meeting where the purchase is organized, because he wants to tell new people he has discovered the buyer of the mistake and thinks he has a solution. He will not allow himself against the old Italian leadership or new Chinese owners. He even struggles with a translator with the exact term he wants to express his concerns. <br /> <br /> The next thing we see is Vincenzo, who arrives in China, trying to contact new owners. To his surprise, someone is new responsible because Mr. Chong, the man he warned in Italy, has been fired. His next search is for a woman who was translator Liu Hua. She finds she works in the library, but she tells her she doesn't doubt she was fired from her post. Liu, who sees Vincenzo's despair, agrees to go with him to find his steelworks factory. <br /> <br /> Thus, Vincenzo and Liu travel through some terrible rural areas that include traveling by train, steamer, bus and lorry to the far parts of a gigantic country. Finding the right factory is, at best, hard to understand, but Vincenzo discovers a completely alien life for him, but also finds a kind soul to help an Italian man, despite his initial dread of him. <br /> <br /> Gianni Amelio's film is a travel document. He takes the viewer to an unknown territory. Some comments compare Vincenzot Marco Polo, a large Italian passenger, although the similarities are not quite tangible. The film keeps our attention at the beginning of the journey, but it becomes a little less enjoyable when Vincenzo goes to Liu after divorce. Mr Amelio is an interesting leader because he clearly shows the film he was working on to adapt to the novel by Ermano Rea, which we have not read. <br /> <br /> Sergio Castellitto is the only reason to watch a movie. This versatile actor brings a lot of movies that are in some way a tour for him, as he can see in almost every frame. The combination of Amelio and Castellitto is a winning combination. Ling Tai, who debuts under the name of Liu Hua, has great moments and shows her good chemistry with her star. <br /> <br /> Luca Bigazzi photographed the Chinese landscape in her darkness. We see China, which is not a beautiful postcard. Mr. Bigazzi captures all the brightness that is typical of the regions where the film is set. Franco Piersant's musical result is a good movie.
