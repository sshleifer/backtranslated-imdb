I'm not sure which movie I saw, but it was a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> I didn't know who the twins were (Gillian Chung and Charlene Choi) before watching this movie and I think the English translation of the title is somewhat misleading. <br /> <br /> Martial arts are very well done. I especially liked them because there were many judos that were filmed very nicely. Donnie Yen (see her in the hero, a great performance) as a director is great because she knows how to shoot those scenes. The roof battles with bamboo poles. It really has nothing to do with the plot, but it's still fun. <br /> <br /> In general, this is one of the best (most modern) HK activity charts I've seen for a while. Although it is somehow cheesy, it still pulls out. <br /> <br /> Definitely 9/10
