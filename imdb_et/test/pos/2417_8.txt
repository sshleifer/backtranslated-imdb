this is the fourth film in the Karate Kid series. However, he has nothing to do with the previous 3. The only remaining character is Mr. Myagi.this, when Mr. Myagi encounters a troubled teen Julie Pierce (Hliary Swank before she was famous) Julie having all kinds of problems, including in a bullied school, a guy belonging to the university's pseudo-military club. Of course he is trained on how to fight. itself and ultimately recovers its respect. I like the unique idea that an antagonist is female and has an enemy man. There are also some fighting scenes that are done quite well with a very low key and minimal violence. The fight is graphic. The end is also good and a bit surprising. is a predictable but not typical end to such a movie. the film probably has the echoes of the original, especially the spiritual aspect and the lessons. as good as 1st mov and definitely not as good as 2..it, but there is a huge leap forward with the remaining 3rd entry. This is a very entertaining dog movie that is suitable for the whole family. 8/10
