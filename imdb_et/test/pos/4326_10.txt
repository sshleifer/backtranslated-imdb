It was Libby, who spoke with Desmond's setbacks, and when someone confused about his past (as he arrived at the same hospital in Hurley), you should know that Libby, who died in the 2nd season, died, this character is being studied more in the 3rd season and we get answers to his surrounding questions. <br /> <br /> BTW, great episode. It really had a big rocker and some interesting questions ... like what happened to Eco and Lock and what are the shape of the four toes? <br /> <br /> I can't wait until 3rd season for lost rights! I hope to answer any unanswered questions. I loved how they explained why the plane actually collapsed. Desmond did it if he couldn't enter the numbers in time. 4 8 15 16 23 42
