First of all, I have to say that I really enjoy watching this movie. The way we follow different people at the same time works great and one of the movies that really thinks. <br /> <br /> Spoiler !!!! <br /> <br /> The fact that girls who kill themselves is what you don't notice. This fact made me wonder, because he puts suicide in the film. and the message that many people would not have seen it. Some people may start talking about why no one did anything to stop it before he did, but no one noticed him like someone who watched the movie ... I don't know about you, but I didn't think about you, but I didn't think that it was he who committed suicide. Are you? <br /> <br /> Welcome to Jan
