This is undoubtedly the most disturbing black-and-white war movie I watched; In fact, during this time alone, the only Western director who was approaching his work intensity and merely visceral force was Samuel Fuller in his work. By the way, I had participated in Kon Ichikawa's retrospective at the London National Film Theater in September 2002, but managed to do only part of his work from 1960 to 1973. <br /> <br /> The film is certainly as depressing as it is known; however, it shows a welcome black humor - a dead man who wakes up to respond to a request for a soldier and immediately "dies", tastefully ironic shoe replacement, hero eccentric, telling the hungry hero what part of the body he should eat, etc. By the way, the script was written by a woman - the director's wife Natto Wada! <br /> <br /> Ichikawa is a versatile and fruitful filmmaker whose reputation may not be as high as he was at his peak years (1956-65), but his direction here is often striking - an amazing pre-credit order ( a hero kidnaps by his chief officer for the release of the illness that was previously anticipated)! surrenders from Japanese to Philippine woman, hospital bombing (where medical personnel escape to rescue themselves, leaving wounded soldiers to climb back at their own limited pace), automated disappointed soldiers in March (which also includes the above-mentioned business of shoes that actually resemble a similar scene ALL QUIET ON WESTERN FRONT), a mountain full of soldiers who tried to climb it, is definitely one of the main features of the film to be a stunning film of unforgettable and unspoiled mud. <br /> <br /> The film is known for the tabni theme of cannibalism (almost ten years before it became a major horror movie), but Ichikawa's approach is not only subtle, but very effective: meat is actually called "monkey muscle", while When a hero is seen only once (and spits out quickly with most of his decaying teeth)! ); on the contrary, as a weak humiliating soldier (played by Mickey Curtis, who, despite his name, was a Japanese pop musician) rabidly promises to have nearby land with bleeding. <br /> <br /> By adding Ichikawa remembers that the practitioner, Eiji Funakoshi (who by the way is unforgettable), came to the hunger point, which forced production to close in two weeks until he recovered! Donald Richie's understandable interview favors the nihilism of the film about the underlying Hollywood patriotism behind it as SIVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998). <br /> <br /> PLAINI FIRES is one of the director's greatest efforts, and among the many Ichikawa films I watched, it is closest to spiritual exercise (1956; another characteristic of a movie, but a spiritual tone and also available on DVD) lt Criterion) and ENJO aka CONFLAGRATION (1958; a few years ago, a limited theater was given to a local exhibition as part of a foreign film week). Personally, I also have a special soft spot for the director's stunning stylized color extravaganza, ACTOR'S REVENGE (1963), which I am in the NFT in 1999 and the aforementioned 2002.
