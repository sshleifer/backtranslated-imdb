Cinema is the best entertainment. If one wants to question all aspects of which one can find disagreements, and much of the recorded history is based on modern opinions that are often biased, then the cinema has to leave because their prejudices always violate their enjoyment. When I saw an airline flying on a 33BC movie, I was amused. Casablanca's backdrop is absurdly fake. So, do I have to create and say that the film couldn't convince? Fiona, relax and enjoy great actors. Wajda's decision to inspire the main characters in French and Polish was inspired. one was immediately aware of which side of the main characters represented. There is no need to live in the authenticity of wigs. This is a powerful cinema. If there is a political message that is still relevant today - have dinner - Ch√¢teau d'Yquem with foie-gras; Puligny Montrachet with entrance; some Polish vodka sorbet and maybe 1961 Lafite-Rothschild meat with beef - and discuss Danton's political aspects until fatigue. Danton would definitely agree?
