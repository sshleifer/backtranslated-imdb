Back when I was like 7 or 8, I always woke up early to watch it, with a whole host of other cartoons like HootKloot, Road Runner Show, The Pink Panther. But it was probably one of the most memorable and funny animated works, and I find it very funny today, I'll never forget episodes like the one where two treasures fought over chocolate and a bottle of jar? or where the treasure trove is trying to reach the island, where there are all ants, and my personal favorite, where an ants, treasure hunt and dog reach the animal hospital, which would later be based on a similar Looney Toon comic strip Sylvester, Tweety and bulldog. This is one of the unforgettable cartoons where everyone would like to look again. Great series.
