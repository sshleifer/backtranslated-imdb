The odd should be able to stumble "Classe Tous Risques" only by chance; it should be on any "best movie-noir" list, including IMDb. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura is as good as ever; Knowing his terrible, gentle family situation, he gives weight to his almost inexpressible face and short dialogue. Belmondo's finite performance under Sautet's definite direction only shows what a wonderful actor he could - and should - be. <br /> <br /> "Classe Tous Risques" is completely minimal, dry and cold, without Melville's artistic landscape, with pretty faces and fancy cars. It's almost a film-noir corresponds to neo-realism. David's little hard words to his children, describing their secrecy from there, keep their throat closed until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The last sentence of the movie - Davos' final result with no more than ten dry, frightening words - will keep you on your stomach. <br /> <br /> A real jewel of a French film with a big crown.
