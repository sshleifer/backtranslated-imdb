Valley Girl is the final film of the 1980s, where all of this wonderfully functional movie is filtered out. The characters are so convincing that you forget that it's a movie, not a video from every high school in the US. This flick has been in the 1980s by the Brady Bunch series in the 1970s. If you don't like it, then "to me with a spoon".
