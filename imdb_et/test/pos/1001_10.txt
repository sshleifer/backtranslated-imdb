Despite the title and unlike other stories of love and war, this film is not too sticky and pink because love is a rose: thorns, that is. The four leading actors made their characters realistic and good practice and balance between the tragic and the underground. <br /> <br /> The music of Cabaret / chanson-esquire songs and the words (singing by Kira Knightley himself) drag the viewer into a deeper and deeper film, from one place to another, between brutal war and between them. peaceful love. Some people find this to be a biopsy, but it is mostly a romantic story, although it follows the triangular relationships that create Dylan Thomas's life and joy and jealousy. <br /> <br /> London's visual vision is one-to-one, while German bombardments place Dylan's bohemian life in the floating atmosphere of small bedrooms, pubs and bars. Independent women, a soldier and a charismatic poet are constantly wiped with feelings of love and anger. <br /> <br /> Maybe it is too twisted and hangs somewhat loosely on the rest of the movie, but all this is a great romantic story.
