The genius, Stephen Sondheim, was never more visible than it was in his 1979 Musical Thriller SWEENEY TODD, a gothic, gory, grisly, but delicious musical performance about a demented hairdresser who returns to London for an evil judge. not only was he permanently emigrated from London, but also raising his daughter and planning to marry him to "protect him from all the evil of the world." A hairdresser will find love, compassion and help from a lone pirate shop owner who has Todd on his agenda. This musical won Broadway and won nine Tony Awards, including best music and best actress music (Angela Lansbury). Production was filmed as a whole in 1982 when Angela Lansbury restored her Broadway role as Mrs. Lovett, the owner of the daffy pie shop, who finds practical use that Todd makes out of a piece of meat. George Hearn, who replaced Len Cariou in Broadway, has so much electrified the title role, so you have to think about why he didn't play a role first. Lansbury and Hearn are rivets from start to finish and 100% of their ghoulish characters help with the Sondaheim score, which is probably the closest thing Sondheim has written for opera. Lansbury shines with "The Worst Pies in London" and "By The Sea". George Hearn stops the show with "Epiphany" and is "Pretty Women" convincing duet that he sings with Judge Turpin, the man he has sworn. Cris Groendahl is vocally impressive as Antony, a young sailor who rescues Todd and falls on his daughter Johanna. Betsy Joselyn is a little taller than Johanna and really speaks loudly that during the "green Funch and Linnet Bird" she will cast her voice a few moments away. The rest is first-rate, especially Edmund Lyndeck as judge Turpin, who is going to present "Johanna" in the production that was cut from the original production and Ken Jennings Toby, whose gorgeous tenor performs "Not though I am around." But it's amazing a musical score by Stephen Sondheim and Lansbury's extraordinary performance, especially George Hearn, making this night-time gothic musical theater experience that will stay with you long after the curtain speech. Not for every taste, but if you are a game and have a strong heart, SWEENEY TODD is a delight for all music theater lovers and must be for fans of Stephen Sondheim and Angela Lansbury.
