Debbie Vickers (Nell Schofield) and Sue Knight (Jad Capelja) want to become one of the cool girls in their high school. Happy and ugly girls had two options, be a mole or a prude! Debbie and Sue imitate them using their cheating practice on the exam. Two cool boys, Garry (Goeff Rhoe) and Danny (Tony Hughes), are asking for answers and they are all interrupted. After the headmaster (Bud Tingwell) rolled out, the cool girls meet in the playground and face the question of whether they "hesitated" them all. Because Debbie and Sue were not cool girls, they invited them to smoke "dunnies". They then hang out on the beach at weekends, watching all the boys. Sue goes out with Danny and Debbie with Garry. It is a normal teenage activity, including sex, drugs and rock. Garry has an overdose of heroin that makes Debbie face inequality in life and decides to learn to surf, not just boys. They are not happy but look at him, calling the names and finally Debbie directs the board. Aussie film in the early 80s.
