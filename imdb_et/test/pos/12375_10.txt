One of the best silent dramas I've seen. As dark and shady as all the German Expressionists have produced, but with rather undervalued and naturalistic performances for the day. Camera looting and unintentional laughing are not the result of wild-eyed hand-scattering histrionics. Sjostrom gave convincing results, such as drunken, enchanting and frightening David Holm. <br /> <br /> When the film was mostly on a Swedish slum at night, this film had a very claustrophobic feeling. low key lighting and extensive use of devastation. <br /> <br /> Narrative was deep and usually Scandinavian, desperate and hopeless: the film starts in a rather grim and then we have told David Holm the story of several setbacks (and setbacks in the setback - a rather difficult 1921 story) where his character there are many ways to redeem, but he doesn't take them, and we know he can't take them because we've seen him dead drunk and sad and thoughtless as he is now. The penultimate scene is as dark as I have seen in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Writing and managing are tight and intelligent, even in today's standards. In many cases, Sjostrom can partially suspect the audience and then draw a surprise. The ending may not be a surprise for some viewers, but I didn't see it coming. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves complete restoration and DVD release. Or even a dirty budget release. It just has to be there for people to see and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10, which rounds up to 10/10
