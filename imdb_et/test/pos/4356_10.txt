What attracts a man to military service? What prepares a man for brutal torture as a prisoner of war? What despair will lead to the planning and implementation of escape in the Southeast Asian jungle? How does he begin to ghost and the memories he returns to his home? Herzog tries to answer these questions in his documentary about Dieter Dengler, a German emigrant and a US Navy pilot, who was taken down from Laos in 1966, imprisoned, tortured and starved, but ultimately escaped to haunt the rest of his life experience. A powerful and personal first-time presentation of the man, his life and the experience that is reflected through the obvious integration of interviews, archive material and new film material. You don't forget this story - or this man.
