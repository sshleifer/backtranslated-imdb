Amazing movie, I've seen it and I want to see it. I would never have heard of Derek Jarman before I saw this movie, but now I am, I can't wait to see her. The film takes a whole new perspective on Shakespeare's temple, I am sure he would have appreciated it for Jarman's love, magic, darkness and atmosphere tension. OK, OK, there may be some nudity in the movie that I didn't really expect, but it didn't offend me, it just surprised me and made the film more unpredictable. One spoiler (for the nervous system: a fast back and forth scene of Sycorax & Caliban and Ariel as a slave, its beautiful graphics. In general, when you start to find Kenneth Branagh's Shakespeare performances that are uncomfortable and monotonous, you must see it as Fantastic and Surreal) it will hit you, but only when you let it open.
