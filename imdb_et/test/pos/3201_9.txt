I think I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, it was a good cast, an interesting story, and a lot of other things, but I still couldn't shake what I had in my stomach, what it would be. I am pleased to say that I was very pleased with this result and regretted being concerned about it. The film scenes were very intriguing and were enough to interest the film early. As the film progressed, the characters of the film were introduced as well as what happened in prison sentences. Like most of the comments in this movie, I have to admit that there is some unequal clich√©, but it cannot erase the overall power of this film, which is a good novel. Everything is fine, especially Chestnut and McGowan, and this is one of the best films this year. Be sure to check out if you are looking for a good courtroom drama.
