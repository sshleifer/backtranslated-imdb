It is possible that sexy Rosie Holotik will play Charlotte Beale, a new sister in one of these movie-type aces, where the responsible physician has unusual ways of treating detainees. Dropping reluctantly on board is the official dr. Masters (Anne MacAdams, Annabelle Weenick). The prisoners are not too friendly to Charlotte. <br /> <br /> Part mystery, partly horror, this B-film director S.F. Brownrigg has an overwhelming feeling. These colorful psychologists, including nymphomaniac without self-esteem, a gentle giant who already has lobotomy, and a presumed judge who speaks in legal jargon, dominate the screen with his unpleasant presence. <br /> <br /> This is a picture that works quite well, creating a terrible and gloomy atmosphere right after you go. Some short breaks in graphic violence also help to give it good old-fashioned exploitative quality. <br /> <br /> It is based on intensity, as a disgraceful heroine struggles to maintain his own peace of mind by offering one surreal treatment after another. Especially effective is the poetic quotation, dotty old Mrs. Callingham. <br /> <br /> For bad cheeses in the 1970s, it is quite effective, especially with an unpleasant climax. I looked at it pretty well. <br /> <br /> 7/10
