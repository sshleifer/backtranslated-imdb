Chasers war everything. 5 words I love to watch. Attackers of War Everything is an excellent Australian comedy. As the name suggests, they fight everything. They seem to love the best way to defeat politics. <br /> <br /> Chaser is one of the best comedies I've ever seen and is Australia's top level. This is the Australian Broadcasting Corparation (ABC) with some of the best comedies. <br /> <br /> He has won the Australian Film Industry (AFI) Awards, but did not win the best comedy logies. <br /> <br /> Last year (2006), ABC talked back on Friday night when everything was out, so no one could watch it. Well they have moved on Wednesday night at 21 (a bunch of better time blocks) and the best thing is if I miss an episode or even just want to see it again, I can download it at www.ABC.net.au/chaser.
