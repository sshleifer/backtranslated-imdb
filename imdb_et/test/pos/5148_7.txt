I saw it at the 2008 Palm Springs International Film Festival. There are some great descriptions of this movie from others in this commentary, and they seemed to have really enjoyed it so that I don't move into the synopsis of the movie, but you see a little Woody Allen and maybe a bit of Federico Fellin's collection of about 50 short sketches or vignettes in it. pulled with a real singular. Some vignettes are linked by their character and plot line, but the corner edge is often used as a central scene where they always give the last call. The start and end scenes also have a common theme that shoots the movie. It took three years to make this movie, and a lot of time has to be spent to find the easiest and most homely looking people in Sweden. This is Sweden's official presentation of the Best Foreign Language Film for the 2007 Academy Awards. This is a nice movie, but hardly worth the official submission for the best foreign film. Last year, Sweden's official performance was very weak in Farväl Falkenberg and a year before it was expensive but boring ZoZo, so Sweden still has no chance of getting an Oscar. This film has moments and would have made a good 20-25 minute short film, but for a full-length feature film it is a bit old and cold. Roy Andersson leads. Gustav Danielsson is the operator. Editor Anna Märta Waern deserves a lot of work for the work she has to do. Benny Andersson's ABBA fame gives an entertaining music score. This is an interesting movie that has a lot of dry humor and I liked it, but it's not special and could only give 7.0 out of 10.
