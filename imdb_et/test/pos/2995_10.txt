First of all - I'm not one to go to all movies. I saw friends in the 70s when it was first released. I was about 17 years old at that time. Even now, at the age of 50, I still remember some scenes. The movie is sweet and sad and may be too annoying for teenagers today, but I loved it. The story is about innocence, the purity of young people's love, and 2 young fortresses so they can get a better life when they were at home. At that time, it was quite risky about a couple of young Runaway people who successfully set up a house and have a child. I'm not surprised that the movie and Elton John's soundtrack are almost unknown today. The music is beautiful. It was unforgettable.
