Of course, most people call "Island of the Fishmen" like a silly and trashy hockey, but can you honestly name another movie that highlights many many inspiring themes? This Italian pearl stands for pure entertainment and features like voodoo, volcanic eruptions, mutant fish creatures, the mysterious continent of Atlantis, a treasure hunt, a distant island full of dead curves and totally mad scientists! All this and much more in one simple movie? Yes please! The close opponents of the Italian Horror Cinema can easily label this movie as a cheap version of "Dr. Moreau Island", but the truth is that it is so much! "Fishmen Island" offers excitement and adventure from start to finish with surprisingly convincing special effects and amazingly stylish camera work. The story opens up promisingly for a small group of prisoners, the survivors of the marine casualties, and the tropical island. They experience the sadistic Edmond Rackham, who reigns over the local tribe, and the legions of genetically-created amphibian monsters who live in the islands of the island. The story contains so many twists and additional sub-squares that it is almost impossible to write a summary, but trust me, this precious stone is worth it. Sergio Martino proves once again that he is a brilliant filmmaker who is both commercial and creative. It uses a very beautiful island location and the interior design is very impressive. The stunning underwater film and the imaginative landscape really add up to this film from the conventional standards of the late 70s. I do not quite understand why Roger Corman worked so much on his original and released it under the second title ("Screamers") in the American market because there are very few elements available for improvement. Cast members are all regular Sergio Martino (except for the excellent Joseph Cotton is a pure supportive rule) and delivers great performances. If you get the recently restored German version, you will be working on fifteen additional protocols. Look at this!
