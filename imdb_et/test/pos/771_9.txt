I have felt that Rupert Grint has a lot of promise in this role that everyone knows. So, although I had never heard of this movie, when I appeared on my cable TV listings, I immediately went over this channel. I'm so happy I did! <br /> <br /> I have read from other reviewers that they generally do not like the advent of age; On the other hand, I do it. I am one of those who are always adults; I've been since the age of 12, I'm 52 years old now and I will probably continue until I am 92. Age arrivals are nothing but suddenly realize the opportunities the other day brings. The realization of understanding, its size, sometimes makes us confused. If we try to hide our delicate sneakers from it, yes, I can see how age can end. But if we just dust off and head to the new direction we've discovered, then we're suddenly on a new path, and we're as alive as yesterday, but stronger, brighter and more daring, more interesting. <br /> <br /> So this movie was. It was all age history; young Ben, his father, Robert, and certainly Dame Evie ... all went through a wonderful transformation. In fact, so did Mr. Fincham, isn't he ?! Everyone did it, I suspect, except for the mother, in spite of the huge opportunity offered by the end of the film. One is left with the feeling that he will continue on exactly the same path he has been, but perhaps with the other supportive pain. <br /> <br /> So a great movie that could not be done in America, which is completely frustrating to think about, but thanks to God we have the constant supply of films produced elsewhere, which we occasionally see. I really recommend this movie very heartily if you do not mind that those parts that are familiar to all of us and all the rest are happy about it.
