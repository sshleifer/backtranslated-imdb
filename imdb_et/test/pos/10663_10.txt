Originally, only part of the great epic of 1905, which depicts the 1905 revolution, Potemkin is the story of the Potemkin team's rebellion in the port of Odessa. The film opens with a team that protests maggoty meat and the captain organizes dissent. The uprising is taking place during which the revolutionary leader is killed. This crew member is going to the shore. When the townspeople gather in a huge step to see the harbor, the Tsar's troops and the crowd break down. The Navy squadron is sent back to Potemkin, but at the moment the ships reach the range, their crews allow them to pass through the nuts. The non-historically accurate end of Eisenstein is open, which shows that it was the seed of the Bolshevik Revolution that is to flourish in Russia. The film is divided into five parts: Men and Maggot, Drama Quarterdeck, Dead Appeal, Odessa Steps and Meeting with a Squadron. <br /> <br /> Eisenstein was a revolutionary artist but at genius level. Not wanting to make a historical drama, Eisenstein used a visual texture to give the film a newsletter that the viewer feels he's listening to an exciting and politically revolutionary story. This technique is used by Pontecorvo Algier's Battle. <br /> <br /> Unlike Pontecorvo, Eisenstein relied on print or non-specialist casting with outstanding physical presence. The extraordinary faces of pain are what Potemkin remembers. This technique is later used by Frank Capra, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, and meets John Doe. But in Potemkin no hero or hero is. The story is about a series of scenes that are combined as a special effect known as editing - for editing and selecting short segments to produce the desired effect on the viewer. D.W. Griffith also used assembly, but no one learned it as well as Eisenstein. <br /> <br /> The artistic filming of their crews in hammocks is complemented by easy rotation of the tables hanging from galley chains. Conversely, the confrontation between the crew and their officers is blamed for electricity and the fists of the masses are showing their rage injustice. <br /> <br /> Eisenstein introduced the display of the method and repeated it, but a slightly different angle to show the intensity. Breaking the disc with "Give us this day our bread" means the end. This technique is used in Marienbad last year. Even when the ship's surgeon is thrown over his side, his cellar-nez covers the rigging. It was these glasses that checked and went over the infected meat. This sequence binds punishment to the tsarist corruption. <br /> <br /> The best-known film in the film and perhaps the entire film history is The Odessa Steps. The wide width of the steps is filled with hundreds of attachments. Rapid and dramatic violence is always and not explicitly recommended, but the visual images of the deaths of some people remain in the viewer's mind forever. <br /> <br /> The footage of running footwear and feet that step down. sharply highlighted by the long threatening sun at the top of the steps. The sequence pace has deliberately changed between running soldiers and some civilians who call for the courage to ask for a halt. The face of a woman who has been hit by a soldier's sword is frozen because it is the direct predecessor of Bonnie's banknotes in Clyde and gives a lasting impression of the horror of the tsarist regime. <br /> <br /> The death of a young mother brings along a sitter who takes care of the steps taken by Hitchcock's foreign correspondent, Terry Gilliam in Brazil and Brian DePalma in The Untouchables. This sequence is repeatedly displayed at different angles, pulling out what was probably just a five-second event. <br /> <br /> Potemkin is a film that immortalizes the revolutionary spirit, celebrates it for committed people, and promotes it without transformation. It sees the fire and thunders the decadent tsarist regime with useless injustice. Its greatest impact has been on film students who have borrowed and only slightly improved the techniques invented in Russia for several generations.
