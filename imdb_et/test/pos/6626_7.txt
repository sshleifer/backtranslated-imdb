It was not surprising to me that it was a very depressing and emptying film. After all, it is the consequences of war for civilians AND this is the "king of depression", Ingmar Bergman. In other words, so many of Bergman's works deepen deep into the human misery and angels, and so this film does not seem so extraordinary to this leader. <br /> <br /> Although it is more difficult to view, the last part of the film offers a better overview of the lower depths of humanity. This is because at first the main characters (Liv Ullman and Max Von Sydow) are trying to cross accidents and are basically decent (albeit a bit stupid) people. But because of the lack of deficiency, they (especially Von Sydow) become less and less human and animal - we are doing something to survive. <br /> <br /> Have fun watching, NOT FROZEN! But an interesting overview of human nature. <br /> <br /> The PS-1 thing I loved about this movie is that he kept the stupid movie chiche. When the couple sat with the shopkeeper to drink a glass or wine, they stopped the wine completely! In most movies, they hardly touch their drinks or leave them intact. It makes me crazy because I'll never leave a $ 4 alcoholic drink without drinking it unless it tasted awful or was there a mistake! BRAVO!
