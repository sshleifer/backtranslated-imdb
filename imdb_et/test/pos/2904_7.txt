The DVD now has a lot of movies, but the manufacturers had forgotten some important tittles for some of the many movers. Egyptian with El Cidi and other wide-screen favorites had great budget epics. Many of my generation's people are learning a lot about Egyptian history, medieval Spain and even the ancestors (for the first time I heard a very inexpensive adventure film called Charlton Heston called Inca's Treasure). Egypt or Rome saw many "bad" epics of the era. lots of output values, great color use (De Luxe color was Brigit and sharp to plain Technicolor), maybe the cast was wrong, but in any case the film made us give an idea of ​​ancient Egyptian life and was that the engine goes out and buys a novel, my Mika Waltari, one of the best, if not the best, journalists ever published. Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann gave a great result. I saw this movie many times when I was a boy, it wasn't a big hit with the shell that Fox studios wanted to make Robe's huge hit at CinemaScope and Stereos a wonderful eye. I only have Lasser Disc version.m the only way Ito see it in wdisescreen format. Soon Hope appeared.
