I have enjoyed Van Dykes over the years and are happy to see them again. <br /> <br /> So cute and funny and easy to watch and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Dick was good when he was younger, but I enjoyed him more than he got older. <br /> <br /> Son Berry has been great to follow in the footsteps of his fathers. <br /> <br /> Together they make a great team I'm very disappointed that I haven't found any other murder 101 listed anywhere. <br /> <br /> I've seen both shown. I hope more because it is a really enjoyable duo to watch. <br /> <br /> You can definitely say that Berry follows his father's traces, they speak in the same way and have the same way. <br /> <br /> Would there be something they do separately. <br /> <br /> Be sure to look at what they do alone and together.
