I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 6 ish - my grandmother thought it would be a nice baby to attract me and keep me busy .... but every time I looked at it, I had nightmares at night. Yes, it is a children's movie, but even today I find it in the dark, especially the haunting music played every time the guardian angel is on the screen, and his rather hypnotic eyes and voice. The real "bad" of the movie, ie sharks, Mr. Grimes, etc., didn't scare me at all, I found the movie always quite creepy and dark. This is obviously something I now appreciate as being 21 years old, but speaking of experience I have no way to show it to my children!
