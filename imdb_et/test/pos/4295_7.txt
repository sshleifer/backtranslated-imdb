Well written scenario. A moving story that shows the best English language. Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson's nice actors. Tom Wilkinson is one of Britain's best actors. He knows how to be subtle and honest. Emily Watson is an actor I didn't know, but she's playing ****** for her credit. Director, Julian Fellowes did not give typical Hollywood tricks to give the movie a pleasant story. It has not dramatized the portrayal of this English middle class. The pace of films is not stuck, although it is not a live film. Good for torsion plot, which is not predictable. I enjoyed this movie very much. Locations were also very well chosen. When you enjoy movies, it's one. It is better to get some tissues ready!
