Forget every spy movie you have ever seen - just like in the USSR and still in many places in Russia and the former Soviet countries. Vera dreams of spending leisure time when she depicts being in the West; his reality is very different: a bitter mother, a violent father, and a constantly present alcohol. And his future prospects are not much better. He finds a man and they are trying to make a living together, but he is suffering from the same social and physical environment - the terrain of this film is great, sitting comfortably in a company of apocalyptic films, but obviously any special effects; they've just walked and shot what happened in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Forget your stereotypical, cold spy movie Russians. This is the real thing: people are passionate, viable and present in ways you never see in the western drama.
