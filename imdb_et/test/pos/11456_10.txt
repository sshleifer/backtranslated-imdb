I love this young man who is trapped in a horror movie. Not only because I'm a big fan of Linnea Quigley-Jill Terashita, but because it's sometimes fun and actually scary. <br /> <br /> Special effects are awesome, especially Linnea's scene with lipstick and end when almost everyone is dead and possessed. <br /> <br /> A lot of nudity offered by Linnea and Jill, lots of humor, cool sounds, high body numbers, and more. it has never been seen, try and buy / watch despite the version with more gore, and some scenes with no rated version.
