Fine comedy scripting has been unbalanced in recent years. The characters are interesting, even a little predictable. The comic timing written for the script is more than enough to make up for the primitive subfamily. If you are sure you know the end ... SURPRISE! Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set is unlikely to make some subtle references, they will certainly appreciate a galley scene! Great movie!
