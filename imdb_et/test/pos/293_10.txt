I would like to submit the next search. <br /> <br /> During the bridge scene, soldiers will be seen by the river, asking to take away and trying to escape. Some soldiers approach Captain Willard's boat and try to carry these suitcases. Soldiers will never be issued or ever transferred to the combat zone. They have duffel bags, packaging and footwear, but not suitcases. Using a suitcase in this scene is absurd and not. In addition, if you look closely, you can see that the suitcase is floating on the water. This is probably a very good sign that it is empty, otherwise it will sink.
