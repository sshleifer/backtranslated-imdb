I was looking at it initially because I thought it was another HISTORY of Gentlemen and this movie is a completely different thing going on here-comedy! But I still loved it! The gentleman is probably some British TV series with somewhat odd characters and sharp humor. It's a British comedy, so it turns out very foolish, in costumes, and in making the homosexual references of the Germans and French - in short, it's very funny! <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around the writers on the TV show decided to cancel some of the characters and characters that come out of their dimensions to the writer's dimension to finish it. It's a fun twist and there are many great scenes in this idiotic adventure. I laughed many times loudly and praised the cunning humor. It makes Mr Bean look like he is. "(Rowan is much better in the Black Bold series btw) <br /> <br /> This is not Monty Python, but you can never compare it to British humor, and there are some similarities, but not so much that keep it from being your thing and be fresh. It is more inclined to the young and Guest House Paradiso with its comic style. <br /> <br /> If you liked it, check out the youth series and the guest house Paradiso movie, and of course I expect the TV Gentlemen League is also quite funny.
