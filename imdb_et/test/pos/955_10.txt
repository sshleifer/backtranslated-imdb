I am a terrific fan of Vijay. I've never seen another movie of her that is so good. <br /> <br /> He has all the usual clich√©s that can be expected from a commercial entertainer. A hero who is bad at studying but a star in his forte, ie Kabbad. His friends fill up a comedy quota. Heroine in life and death. The villain I say is the best protagonist. High octane rating and sequences. Music that can make one dance. And first and foremost, the perfect story to keep all the above-mentioned factors inside an enjoyable circle. Ideal. <br /> <br /> The director does not give the audience any chance to relax. He just goes from one pound to the other. Vijay's lighter side can be seen in the film he rarely fills. <br /> <br /> Everyone said ..... This movie was and will be perfect for many years to come.
