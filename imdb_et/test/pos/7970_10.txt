This movie is very similar to Death Warrant with Jean-Claude Van Damme and he also has some similarities with Fire of Fire with Jackie Chan, and I also heard that there are other very similar action films, but this movie is much better than Warrant or even Fire of Fire (that's right, Jackie Chan's movie). Rarely do American films have such large sequences of activity, even though this film had many negative comments, it wins most of the action films of that time that were more successful. There were many martial arts scenes, David Bradley was in this movie Bruce Lee fast and still good that the fighting scenes were much longer than most American martial arts films. Shooting scenes were similar to John Woo films, perhaps not as good, but still very exiting. There were also many impressive explosions and one big chase. I've seen some other David Bradley movies, but that's still the best. OK, this movie has nice moments, but what movie isn't it? It was decent, Charles Napier was incredible and his character was tough. Adam Clark was also very good at playing squid and Yuji Okumoto, who played the main bad. The other actors also acted quite well, although functioning is not important in this type of film. If you are a fan of the feature film (I am thinking of real movie fans who really appreciate good action) if you have to see this movie.
