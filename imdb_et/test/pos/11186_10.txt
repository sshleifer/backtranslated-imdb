"Monkey Island Curse" is a treasure; in my opinion, the series as a whole was the holy grail of the adventure game, not to mention Lucas. <br /> <br /> But to return to "Curse", which is beautiful for CMI, it is not afraid to be yourself. It is different from the first two, but it remains true to Ron Gilbert's productions (if the same could be said about the series 4). The work of the voices is impeccable, Dominic Armato plays our favorite protagonist Guybrush Threepwood. Animation, although it is completely different from the classic pixelated characters, is made beautifully. It's really great. And the music is fantastic! It's never irritating and you never want to turn it off. <br /> <br /> Although I'm not too romantic, romantic scenes and themes are not at all capable. They also have a rare ability to come as sweet as cheese. It says a lot about a girl who usually sleeps during chicks flicks. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, is a classic MI humor. CMI is quite adept at offering dead heights, totally absurd humor, and just good fun. Gary Coleman, as a young entrepreneur, is a focal point, and world events are discreetly joking without being out of the game. is in his own field. Personally, I can't find 3 favorites because everything is completely different. However, if you want the classic series to be heard for a good time, I demand that you give this game. NOT disappointed. <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars, hands down. <br /> <br /> - Emily N
