A terrible, fast-developed, screw-like comic / drama / farce set against the French 1939 break. Played with wide-eyed, straightforward, talented cast and chockablock action, satire, social comments, and authentic periodic details, from slippery brilliant hair and marcelled hair to Citroen's "Traction" fleet, rolling sound and short, but incredible Charles de Gaulle and Marshal Petain to awaken. <br /> <br /> This is just some of the best entertainment that was recently shown on the screen, without the assumption and "no messages". If the films were trains (and there is a creative holiday on a steam-driven train that works despite the fact that the steam wheel is not an expensive proportion), it would be a TGV.
