I remember this series with excitement and being so disappointed when it ended. Since then, I've been trying to find out if I can get a copy of it either on video or on d.v.d. But I was pleased to find out about the details of this website that it would be disappointing at the point of purchase that the available videos would not be played by English recorders! This production was so wonderful, being completely accurate with Nevil Shute's novel, having finished the story after the end of the war, with Joe's and Jean's later life - absolutely wonderful - and I just wish I could see it again, as it is from the initial screening, It has not been repeated on British television.
