When I stepped into the theater, I thought it was a great movie. And I was not disappointed. WOW! This movie is brilliant! The feelings of the whole movie through feelings are extraordinary! Great works for Madhavan and Simran. Beautiful music by A.R. Rahman. It may be the best Tamil movie I've ever seen. Mani Ratnam has once again proved to be the best meaningful and affectionate film. <br /> <br /> This movie is mainly a young girl (PS Keerthana) who is looking for her biological mother (Nandita Das) who gave her up in a refugee camp to fight for her country like her husband (JD Chakravathy). The young writer (Madhavan) finds the story of this young girl and decides to write her story. He and his wife (Simran) decide to accept this little child, but one day he finds they are not his real parents and decides to look for his biological mother. <br /> <br /> This movie really punishes you very much. The way Mani Ratnami plays a film is great. <br /> <br /> My rating - 10/10
