Just the first time I looked at the program - a 2-hour "robbery" program. Don't know why I wasn't there before? James Caan is outstanding and completely credible when he plays the role of Prime Minister of the 5 * Vegas Complex. <br /> <br /> So often, such programs have one or more ensembles that are either quite annoying or seem to have been chosen because they have to be related to the manufacturer or director. <br /> <br /> This is definitely not the case with this program. Along with Caan, everyone is primary and support cast and attractive. Guest actors are well chosen. <br /> <br /> I have seen interesting stories and the exhibition also has a good view of the city. <br /> <br /> This is an entertainment program, and I hope it remains. I don't know how I managed to leave it for so long, but now I'm planning to do it from TIVO.
