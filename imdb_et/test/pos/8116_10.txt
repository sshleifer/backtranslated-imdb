I've never seen such a movie; is not planning to see it, but it was worth calling the TV channel. I'm usually an observer of a sci-fi movie, but I'd be happy about it for my collection. It starts as a one-sided film with a simple triangle of love, and it got a little different (you can't say it anymore. But it includes two men and one girl. Juts aren't as you expect). It also played the role of Hugo Weaving "MATRIX" and "Vehicle Master" that I wouldn't have expected ... a very funny man. This movie plays on HERE TV, but if you do not have a satellite, it is worth renting. So try it; you don't have to be disappointed.
