I heard about John Garfield, but he didn't know him. I loved this movie. I've never heard of it. I just picked it up randomly. John Garfield is a movie boxer. He had been in real life, so he knew his part. He was fleeing throughout the film. Someone killed a human. His character was charged. She is a friendly family who has questions and is not sure what to do about her. All kinds of small plots follow. My favorite was the water tower scary pool where the water was deep and one Dead End Kid couldn't swim, and none of them got out. John's figure saves the day. Dead End kids were great as his friends and followers. One of them is right to the end. Ann Sheridan played with her family's daughter and John's love interest. He was plausible, but in my opinion, it was not loved - the only weak link in the film.
