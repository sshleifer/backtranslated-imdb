How can you like the same movie and not? <br /> <br /> The plot is very similar to Jody Foster, Sommersby, not just so good. Nicole was great .... Jude was enough. They didn't give him a lot of lines ... is that the reason? In general, he's a pretty good actor. She is so elegant that her character is so national bumpkin. It makes one of the miracles they see with each other. <br /> <br /> Only the Lady Chatterly Lover was successful in the romance between the two. <br /> <br /> I think it's not like it because the movie is too long. They would have got the story in two hours. <br /> <br /> The story is good. Good location, good filming. The characters were great.
