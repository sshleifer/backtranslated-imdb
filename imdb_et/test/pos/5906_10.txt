In his film genre, this film has little audience and a narrow appeal with a subtle undertone that passes through the entire production. Nevertheless, it is a remarkable cinema that is as timeless as a rare piece of art. The time that is rarely seen in movies is rarely seen in Quebec, the strength of Mon Oncle Antoine lies in the depth of his symbols and the abundance of settings. Duplessis' Québec, paracial and feudal, is an excellent background that anyone other than pure wave Québecois could achieve. <br /> <br /> It would be too easy to use stereotypes, clichés, and consonant myopia statements in this story. At the same time, the director decided to skip the forced images and instead focused on the life of the countryside in Québec. This makes this movie exceptional in its authenticity, but it is not pretentious in its presentation. If only more modern movie tasks were to be done, the viewing public may not be forced to choose between a jumped Hollywood Pablum that goes through viewing. <br /> <br /> Mon Oncle Antoine is - in every word - unforgettable. It leaves a lasting impression on anyone who has ever lived or visited in Quebec. Classic. ********************************************** <br /> <br /> Follow-up: May 10, 2008 <br /> <br /> After reviewing some of the comments, it is worth noting that Antoine is NOT - and apparently it wasn't MEANT to earn a mass market sale for a standard Hollywood / American cinema. Age story, yes, but much more than just the memories of adolescents in 1940 in Quebec. Observers looking for real entertainment at the expense of the complex development of their characters are very disappointed. Go watches, adventure / romance / comedies. Check out MontoCle Antoine that it is rarely pulled into a visible but absolutely remarkable society that has been ignored and ignored for too long. <br /> <br /> The grape of anger is barely a thriller, but this story and characters are what makes America a classic film. Montoon Antoine is in the same genre.
