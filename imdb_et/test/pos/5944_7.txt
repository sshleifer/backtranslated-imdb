If you intend to fool James Bond, this is a great idea to find a leading man like BOTH Sean Connery and Leonard Rossiter, so move on to Jean Dujardin, who captures the ideal Connery sneer that smiles, and Rossiter's thinking self-deception he is suave. Dujardin plays it like Clouseau, who can own his karate. On the plot he has been looking for our man In Schtook, who has disappeared mysteriously and contains such improbability as the Nazi cell hidden inside the pyramid. If there is a dirty note, this is the leading lady Berenice Bejo, who has all the sensuality of the suet-pudding, and what Aure Attica just - and only - hides. This is good for a single viewing, but that's it.
