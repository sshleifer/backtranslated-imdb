I can't drag that on my brain. This is definitely different from what it is. I've seen many movies during the holidays, and some are okay that nothing shook my world the way BlindSpot did. The actors and how they put together a movie are just something cool. It's like a really frightening stuff that is mixed with some pretty f **** stimulating black humor. Franco is great, but the older tough guy steals the show in some scene, as if he was striking the child's dirt into the grave. I think some politically correct doesn't know it's a miracle (don't bring your grandmother), but it's absolutely fantastic. The best thing is kaliedescope style. There are some very serious things that are mixed with a super interesting journey. The film will make you partly sad and scared, but it will spin your head with what's going on and how it's filmed. WTF in the world? Many critics in Sooo talk about all of these allegedly revolutionary groundbreaking films, and when you see them, they are boring and predictable and not all. I don't get it because there are many other better choices. Blind Spot is really good because it gives you excitement and chills and a major future power, but it does it completely fresh and definitely totally rad.
