This is not the best Canadian film, IMO. I can't get back and name 3 or 4 better. Just a few nights before I saw The Bicycle Thief, is a highly respected Italian classic and has some parallels. Both filmmakers shot their movie at a certain time and in a safe place, with minimal resources for collections and casting. In both cases, the result is an exciting and joy to see a realistic device and signs alone. Face and landscape shots make it worth looking at alone. That said, it's not exactly the same as the Italian classic. The film will be released in a cold and barren asbestos quebec. Such frost resistance is contrary to the warmth of the people and the filmmaker Claude Jutra. Basically what you get, there are several vignettes that are probably nostalgic memories of Jutra - not ha ha funny - but nice and probably sometimes heavy, but now the nostalgia is warmed with a patina. The movie strikes; there is little tension. Somewhere about half to two-thirds of the story begins. Everyone you have met on this issue is involved and you have felt these signs quite well; so you have little patience in the beginning. The story is good; it leaves you thinking and includes all the basic elements of sex, love and death. If you like Bergman, Godard, Truffaut, all such things, you won't be disappointed.
