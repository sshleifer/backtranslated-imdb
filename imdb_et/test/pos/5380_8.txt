Every time you occasionally compromise a movie that even exceeds your boldest expectations. Given IMDb rating 4.0, I didn't really expect much from Satan's fraternity. I was hoping it could be at least a cheerful joke, like the fucking rain or some other thematic satanic horror movies in the early 70s. I couldn't "be wrong. Instead, it was an ambitious and intelligent film that had a real pleasure. Broadly speaking, to give away something, the style and structure of the film is much more experimental than the so stunning storytelling in the early 1970s. There are lots of points and explanations for the viewer to fill in. As a viewer, you know that something is wrong, but for a long time you are not sure what it is. The unknown contributes to a far-reaching atmosphere than most similar movies. I was amazed at the latest credit being rolled in. Those who want the big slam-bang finals are the end of disappointment for the sake of simplicity. /> There are moments in the movie where it is easy to forget that director Bernard McEveety was mainly working on television There are some scenes that are so well configured, illuminated and photographed that even the most successful directors could learn something or two. For example, I have seen enough films over the years to understand that drivers can sometimes have problems with widescreen shooting indoors. Not here. The scene in which men discuss their action plan at the Sheriff's office is amazing. Do we see all five men at once? Everyone does their thing like in real life. In the lesser film we see all the men at once, but everyone would be immobile, waiting quietly for their dialogue. This is a small scene, but it looks so natural and so beautiful that it is one of my favorite moments of Satan's brotherhood. <br /> <br /> Finally, I mentioned what is happening in my opening, so without going into a long speech, I just say that in the fraternity of Satan is Strother Martin and LQ Jones. Any movie with these two men is almost an automatic winner with me.
