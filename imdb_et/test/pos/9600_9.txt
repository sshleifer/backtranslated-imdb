One cannot believe that the Bostock Cup option is not yet available on the right video or DVD. I have only seen it once, in a maliciously crafted copy of television and despite being not a fan of football (at all), I thought it was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The famous incline, wherever it was, a helpless trainer ("Ponty-this, Ponty-that", "I'll take the next exit"), a pointless plot; it all adds to the aching sides. <br /> <br /> In the US, I am caught in desperation for some good British humor, but not quite enough to spend the amount a manufacturing company is asking. C'mon, get this kosher out of the DVD.
