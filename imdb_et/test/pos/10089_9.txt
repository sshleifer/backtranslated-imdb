Forbidden by Asia, the "story of two sisters" is actually a complex psychological drama driven by the character, which involves the viewer in seemingly normal family problems. I was really surprised at the depth of this movie. It is right that Director Ji-woon Kim's decision to focus more on telling a story, not on cheap fears. Create one of the brilliant new horror films. <br /> <br /> The story of two sisters strikes the story as it refers to two siblings Su-mi and the younger Su-yeon who, after spending time in a psychiatric facility, return home to their father and apparently an abusive stepmother. Since then, we have witnessed how nurses are engaged in their step-by-step aggression and insecure behavior. Saying what would happen next would be a violation of the whole experience. So I'll leave it there. <br /> <br /> The plot is very tightly written. What characters are nicely refined. Ji-woon Kim focuses on the little pain that gives them and their relationships a much more detailed insight. In addition, each of the four basic pains has a very different role and character. Protected Su-myst, weaker Su-yeon, invisibly interesting male stranger with frantic and later deadly behavior. It is a great mystery that a lot of the plot does not appear until the end, and even after that the film still leaves a lot of room for interpretation. Even after you look at it once, the viewer is forced to see it again so that he can understand it better. <br /> <br /> Participants are perfect for their roles. It is particularly difficult to create strong, emotional scenes in psychological films, but it is a great joy to succeed in creating them and this is the best example of such an example. Ji-woon Kim's direction is slow and thrilling, creating tension in the horror scenes of the film. Although few of these moments are strong and, frankly, terrible. Cinematography and scores are top-notch, helping to create an atmosphere that fits your psychological film. <br /> <br /> "The Story of Two Sisters" is a demonstration of how horror film is actually so much more than simple thrill. It's a strong focus on nature and mystery, it's a complicated movie that can easily attract you again to understand it better.
