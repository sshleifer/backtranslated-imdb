Awesome Movie! Great combination of talents! I'm a huge fan of David Duchovny and he's outstanding in this movie! I'd like to see him more in this kind of movie. Her talents are definitely too little used and they have so much more to offer than Agent Mulder (although I'm a big fan of this series). Anyway, I want to see her more. She is our generation Cary Grant. If you haven't seen this movie, you have to be! A great love story that shows love never dies ... it's forever with you. Minnie Driver is great and how can you wrongly pour, which includes Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Loggia and Mr. Belush? This film did not receive any awards, but it was wrong. Great work for Bonnie Hunt! ** By the way ... the soundtrack is great! **
