Algernon4's comment that Mrs Paget's "ultra lewd dance (this film) is the most erotic in film history" is definitely an exaggeration. It's not even Debra Paget's most erotic dance. The naked quarries near him in Fritz Lang's "Indian tomb" make this number straightforward. The most erotic dance history. Well! Where do I start? Salma Hayek's performance as Santanico's pandemic "From Dusk to Dawn" (1996); Jamie Lee Curtis "True Lies" (1994); Jessica Alba "Sin City" (2005); "Terror Planet" by Rose McGowan (2007); Sheila Kelley's "Dancing Blue Iguana" (2000), blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong. I love the sequence and I've added it to my "Cheesecake Dance" series on Youtube. I just think making a statement like "the most erotic movie in history" really goes to a very fragile limb.
