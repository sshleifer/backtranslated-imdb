The masterful performance of Vittorio Mezzogiorno and Jean-Hugues Anglade adorn the lust, desire and alienation of France. The work of two performers is striking - exquisite, intense and passionate. Unfortunately, the script is deliberately marketable and varieties and the overall impact leaves one fear. At the same time, those who appreciate high-quality action will enjoy the courageous work of this leading world in this often difficult Gallia movie life. <br /> <br />
