Garlin leaves himself as a writer-director-actor in his indie production, with a big man (Garlin) who travels around Chicago with the eyes of every woman he sees. The laughs come almost every minute. This is a somewhat dramatic and serious story of a man who is looking for love but made great comedy writing and showing. Supporting roles are also very well done and very funny and really movie rich. <br /> <br /> Rose Abdoo is hysterical in her administrator role, leading you directly to the rest of the movie's mood. Sara Silverman is fantastic with some of the big bits she does with Jeff. Bonnie Hunt is classically great in his role. I just want more in the movie, as I think most of them agree. It's definitely refreshing to see her tight skin. <br /> <br /> David Pasquesi was an inseparable sidekick and a voice of reason. Ms. Kolb plays Jeff's mother with whom she lives. There were many other fires that were all well done. <br /> <br /> Prime Minister Jeff mentioned his inability to do more with Bonnie because of production problems. However, it is good to leave you more of a wish. I think that is that some things are unclear to let the audience fill some thoughts themselves. The title of the word should make you aware of this issue. <br /> <br /> Jeff said some basic characters were based on his earlier relationships. This explains why they work so well. Real-life people are always unusually colorful and make great signs. He leaves quite a bit of what you can expect, having seen Curt Your Enthusiasm and some of his other work. This is one of those who break things where the actor takes certain risks to do something they always wanted to do but could not. <br /> <br /> I think it's remarkable that Garlin's healing is another city, and Hunt for it, set a style and leadership style here. This is probably a new innovative hybrid that matches the indie movie.
