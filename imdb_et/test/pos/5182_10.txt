I saw FAREWELL HARRY at Plaza Theater in New York and was quite taken. William Hall Jr. the performance is huge. This is a film for the classic film carrier. The direction of Garrett Bennett reminds me of the work of Barry Levinson and Robert Redford early on. The film seems to be a typical independent film. It has a soul and visual power that is quite unique. I saw it with a small audience (400) who had been caught from the first credit moment, and although I wasn't crying (like a lady next to me), I have to admit that I had a small soldering eye ... <br /> <br />
