And I would have rated it higher than 7 out of 10 if it wasn't for Barbara Hershey's serious uneven Irish accent to lead Madalyn's mother. This accent came and unfortunately, what I found more than a little disturbing. <br /> <br /> But William L Petersen's presentation of Joad's role was remarkable, and despite his character, he brought warmth and depth to some periodic dialogue. Exciting and genuine, I found it quite amazing how she was in the character. <br /> <br /> The premise of the movie is to build a pretty, forgotten staircase in the church. It is based on a loosely real story and I heard it on the stairs before seeing the movie. <br /> <br /> It was a phenomenal engineering training for your time - a floating double spiral that was made without nails or screws. It still exists today, although it is now privately owned. <br /> <br /> ** Small spoilers ** Good support and Barbara die so well in all of her movies and she won't disappoint. Much special moments. <br /> <br /> 7/10
