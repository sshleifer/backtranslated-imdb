There are a number of full-length films featuring Muppets created by Jim Henson & Co, but "The Muppet Movie" was the first of them all, the first being in the original trilogy, including "The Great Muppet Caper" and "The Muppets Take Manhattan". It appeared seven years before the birth, so I probably couldn't see it at that time (nor could I see my two descendants in the first release). But in my childhood I saw a lot of cups, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990. I finally saw this movie for the first time after listening to the mid-1990s after listening to the soundtrack. Not surprisingly, I liked it, and the rethink of recent years has not been a disappointment. <br /> <br /> One day, while Kermit Frog sits in his banjo swamp, after the song "Rainbow Connection". - Hollywood's Bernie named boat and invites him to continue his career in Tinseltown. Kermit takes advice and goes west. Soon he will meet Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in the restaurant, and will convince him to come. Frog has also noticed Doc Hopper, the owner of the frog dog restaurant chain, who wants Kermit to be his mascot. To frog, Kermit is nasty about it, so he refuses to Fozzie and leaves. Kermit and Fozzie meet their way across the country with other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who will soon be kermit's love interest) and Gonzo. Unfortunately, when they're all trying to go to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is ready to do everything to force Kermit into the mascot of his restaurant chain, so Kermit is getting more and more threatened! One thing many people praise for this movie is the songs and I understand why. Of course, at the beginning, there is an Oscar called "Rainbow Connection" and more good stories, such as Kermit and Fozzie's memorable way "Movin 'Right Along" and "I'm Going Back There One Day", Gonzo sang poisonous ballad. "Never before, ever", the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, the only one I would weaken, and their romance seems terribly unexpected. This movie is generally loved by Muppet, just as they are on television, and some of them offer a lot of humor, including Fozzie, making their movie first appear hopelessly trying to entertain people in their restaurant with their stand-up and, if you know these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them. Some of the short acting actors in the film may also be funny, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie Agent and Steve Martin as "Insolent Waiter". Nor is it 100% comedy. The film also has serious parts that they did well. <br /> <br /> Watching this original Muppet movie this year was my first watch since I saw "Muppets from Space" (one of the Muppets movies) after Henson's death, published in 1999) for the first time last year. I was very disappointed when I saw this movie that had never happened before when I watched movies or TV shows with popular dolls! Not only is the movie not very funny, I also think it's too dark and cruel to Muppets, as I noted in my review! But I can't say I think it's the same as the predecessors of this movie, including what appeared twenty years earlier. "The Muppet Movie" seems to be the most popular bunch, and because it's as much as not just for kids, it's understandable. I doubt there is much to say about "Muppet Movie", which has not been said at any time in the last thirty years, but today it is a good family life.
