In earlier Fassbinder films, his idea sometimes exceeded his ability to perform them. He was always a great writer, but he took the time to end the style and storytelling of camera work. <br /> <br /> The four-season merchant is one of Fassbinder's first films that make great use of color, ranging from a light green pearl from a merchant to a bright red rose at a funeral (funeral in the Fassbinder movie - who would have thought). <br /> <br /> His camera work was also there, but it was still relatively small. Sometimes, occasionally, zooming is a bit uncomfortable and unnatural, but then Fassbinder still came out of his avant garde phase. This may be because Michael Ballhaus is not behind the camera, but a little lower than Dietrich Lohmann. <br /> <br /> However, it is Fassbinder and you will get this fix. Broken dreams that are both viable and unreasonable to alienate the audience and lead them into a depressed stupor. That's what the doctor ordered. An early classic style that shows remarkable progress over the first films that only appeared for 2 years.
