What can I say? You only expect the best dramas from the BBC and MESSIAH is no exception to the rule. <br /> <br /> MESSIAH is a great thriller, a really shocking and creepy story about the serial number that interrupts the languages ​​of the victims and replaces them with silver spoons. The police officer, Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) and his team have tried to solve the mystery of seemingly accidental events before more lives are lost. <br /> <br /> But to warn - despite being 15 years old (in the UK), MESSIAH is a bit tough film. Some of the murder scenes are similar to SE7EN scenes and one or two may be truly staining. But if you can resist it, sit on your chair and enjoy ... even though you are likely to be on the edge or hidden behind it. <br /> <br /> BBFC-rated "15" moderate violence and strong horror.
