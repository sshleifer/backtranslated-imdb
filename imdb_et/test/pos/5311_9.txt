- only a few understand the character of Leland and this is probably innate to see the lives of both sides, and to face this reality is very difficult and can cause some bad deeds (like the character of Leland), but for such sadness and real reasons why his intentions were good, in the sense that the intent to save another physical or mental (in this case) pain for a long time. and it is really sad when most of everyone in this movie makes mistakes, but what one does through good intentions is killed by him. The lesson of this film is that a unique person sees, realizes, faces and justifies the real life situation and sees it as right or inspiring who can do the right situation correctly. but before that ... u have to see both sides and rationalize it for long peace and peace for all human life.
