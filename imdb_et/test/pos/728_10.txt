I saw the movie when I was in high school a few years ago. I thought it was a provocative film of thought that made you want to be behind the riddles. I think people of this type, who would not want this movie, would be the ones who don't like dealing with things, or those who are disappointed if they can't solve the puzzles. this is a good movie based on the real story that happened in my hometown of Toronto. so if u want a real record of what's going on in the area, check out this movie. And for those who only watch movies to bring out the holes in the plot and the drawbacks of the signs, realize that the same thing happens in real life. but that's all I want to say about it. The puzzles are good, some are heavy, some are not. But the film also leaves you with more, more puzzles, more explanations, just explanations. Another thing I want to add is that the ideas of this film, the underground puzzle world exist, but there is much more to it. You can't find it to find it. It would never be possible to search for it. Leave your mark and find it.
