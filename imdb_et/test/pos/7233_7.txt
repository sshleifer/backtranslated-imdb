This movie is really sick and funny. I've made my friends guilty of describing it to them. I saw it about 8 months ago, and I still have a song that comes out with my head. <br /> <br /> Basically, it is tromatized Romeo and Juliet, but it goes beyond what you would expect. Let's just say an incest, references to a child's molestation, gore (of course), but unfortunately it's a kind of happy ending ... sort of ... it's weird as happy. Cappy Capulet was great! He has such an intellectual snobbish tone, he is abusive but civilized. He quotes more than Shakespeare as someone else in the movie ... all who deal with their sadistic role as husband and father. He was Julia's groom who was deeply attached to him and soon worried about Tromeo. And Tromeo, a real romantic. She is a beautiful, really lovely man who wants to find true love. "He makes torches burn!" Unfortunately, Troma just had to use this terrible fake vomiting and other antics. Sometimes they get this stuff away. But hey, this movie gave me a big impression. How often do I refer to it in real life, which is pathetic. <br /> <br /> Anyway, enjoy!
