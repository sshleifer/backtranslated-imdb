If you are an IMDB audience who put High Fidelity in the top 200 of all time, this movie is probably not for you. This movie is as kind as Steve Frears is consciously in the tree. Renee Zellweger is a great hip-urbane journalist who returns to her suburb of Bucks County to take care of her mother Streep (who still offers one fame). William Hurt is ideally a cast and misleading, unbelievable and selfish spouse. If this movie doesn't move you to cry and laugh, it's too nice to enjoy it.
