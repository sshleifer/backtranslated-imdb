It's 1920s. And a man named Walt Disney was on a mission to satisfy families and children all over the world with one thing: entertainment. What did he do? He did cartoons! Whoo !!!!! And he made a character that is as big as a mouse. Mickey Mouse. Ha ha! Oh boy! <br /> <br /> Two movies were pulled out by Mr. Disney himself: "Plane Crazy" and "Steamboat Willie". This review focuses on the 1928 "Steamboat Willie" function. <br /> <br /> Since this movie as a little boy, I've always wanted to see this movie. Well, in 1997 I rented an old VHS with many old Disney cartoons, playing the mouse !!!!! Miki Mouse !!!!! And guess what? This short was there and I loved it !!!!! Soon after I took the tape back, it played on the old Disney channel (note: "Old Disney Channel") already on Saturday morning. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a great comic; it paved the way for major Disney stuffs from 1928 to 2002! <br /> <br /> 10 stars, really !!!!!
