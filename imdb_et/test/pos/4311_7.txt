Well filmed, a little uneven, "Someone" is good night entertainment. The plot is simple enough - three yuppies get into a scrapbook group with strangers and it turns out that it is much more than they wanted. Operation is decent and a couple of unexpected twists. Watch out for the incredible (like 10 revolvers and 25 semi-automatic pistols).
