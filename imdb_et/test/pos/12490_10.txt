First of all, Belgium's Stanislas André Steeman's detective story, "l'assassin habite au 21", was already portrayed in 1942 by Pierre Fresnay and the same actor Suzy Delair.Steeman. Clouzot's adaptation to both films. The 1942 film was great, but the side of the "detective story" was kept, so why did he complain? In the case of "Quai des orfèvres", Clouzot was now in a new phase of his excellent career. "le corbeau" and blacklist had much more to say than a simple whitun.Steeman basically complained about the end of a bad detective, which I obviously do not publish, but Clouzot focused on social vignettes, his characters psychology, and he didn't give the fucking Aatra Christie puzzle about. In doing so, he becomes the true predecessor of CLaude Chabrol, who has always been closer to him than Alfred Hitchcock, whom he admires. Suzy Delair has a big screen presence, and you love the song she really sings (she was also the singer) "avec son tralala" .Bard Blier gives like gestures and words forever and she really pulls it off Two characters are especially interesting and worrying: first, Dora, photographer: she takes pictures of female models and Clouzot reflects that she is a lesbian. Of course the word has never been said (How could it be in 1947?) The police chief (fabulous Louis Jouvet) tells him, "You and I, we are not happy with women." The portrait of this police is very detailed: we learn a lot of things from him, do not need to connect him to the Delair / Blier plot: he is a widow with a son whom he loves and who gets into school problems, especially in geometry. So we can know all the symbols thoroughly. One of the most important post-war cinema manifestations in France.
