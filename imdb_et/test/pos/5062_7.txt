I came up with a "Rendition" with a list of errors in a mile long, so how is that my overall impression is that it was a pretty decent film? This is definitely a movie whose sum is better than its parts. <br /> <br /> These parts contain pain in large letters, not one of them gives memorable performance (Omar Metwally, relative, unknown, is one you remember); unusable if it is not distinguishable; and a scenario that is too complicated and too simplistic at the same time. Metwally is an Egyptian-born American citizen who robs the US government of a transfer plan that is otherwise known as the process by which the United States tortures suspect terrorists, whether it is remotely true. Reese Witherspoon plays her pregnant wife, calling an old college friend (Peter Saarsgard) who works for Senator (Alan Arkin) and helps her husband follow. Meryl Streep plays the transfer program manager; Jake Gyllenhaal is a young agent assigned to the interrogation, whose conscience goes on. At the same time, the entire parallel storyline follows the daughter of an Egyptian commander who has joined the American Relocation Program, and her boyfriend who is trained as a suicide bomber. <br /> <br /> Ay-yi-yi, which is a lot of land to wrap a two-hour movie, and I was about to wash my hands on the whole thing, especially Egyptian Romeo and Julia, which seemed more than disturbing . But then near the film's finale, chronology brings all the plot directions together so that you want to reassess everything you thought you knew about the motivation of the different characters, and make "submission" a much more interesting movie Witherspoon, Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard look like high school students playing adults Twenty years older than they really are - Gyllenhaal, especially a beautiful actress, looks so boring that you don't know if she's getting the energy to run her lines. And the screenwriter should be arrested for having a good actor at his disposal as Meryl Streep, and he did not give him more work than this one-dimensional dragon lady. Of course, the appropriateness of the film, but instead of addressing the network of national security issues, it cautiously puts it in the center of the debate. There are moments when you think the film might turn off an interesting direction - what if Witherspoon actually started to doubt his husband's past? What if Metwally had been in contact with terrorists, as his interrogators blame? But no, the film takes the least resistance. <br /> <br /> But as I said before, I recommend this movie. I know I haven't done anything but I counted a lot of my mistakes, but it is in the right place with my head and it is fun or at least as entertaining as a movie about torture and questioning. <br /> <br /> Rating: B +
