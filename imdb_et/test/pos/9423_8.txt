I probably liked it a little more than the Terror of Night, although it is not enough to give him extra *. The beginning is simply brilliant when we reveal the Nazi agents who want to see the new bomb and its inventor in a small Swiss village, only if it lies in the hidden Holmes who attracts the scientist back to London. When he is there, he does everything he can to prevent the scientist from reaching the person behind him - not Hitler, but worse: Holmes's arch-enemy Moriarty. Of course, the scientist will disappear, leaving the snapping coded note and Holmes will again hide. The climax of Moriarty dockside camp is suitably exciting and we can all think that everything ends well, isn't it? A bit overflowing patriotic message as the role of credit. Now that I think about it, it is a beautiful place, despite the obvious sets, the hidden use of Rathbone and the way so many parcels are just over an hour - what the hell's that extra * and my favorite 5 Rathbone / Bruce I've seen the movie I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> On a DVD that is part of Mill Creek Entertainment's "50 Mystery Classics". Many of these transmissions are very poor in quality, but Holmes fans take note that Rathbone / Bruce movies (with this set of 4) are all quite observable and reasonably sharp.
