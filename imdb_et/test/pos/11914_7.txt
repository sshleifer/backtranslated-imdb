Toy Soldiers is an okay action movie, but what really looks like is the effort that scriptwriters and directors are depicting exactly the American counter-terrorism forces. Just look at the final credit - there are more than a dozen US military personnel and officers. The film accurately depicts the FBI as a hostage control, but turns it over to the US Army's Delta Force (who is unnamed in the film because the Pentagon denies its existence at the moment) when the President declined the US code for the Posse Commitatus Act. By this time, the US military forces are well dressed and armed. And even using AH-64 Apache for Air Support - which may seem a little up, is not terribly unrealistic. Much more expensive and honestly better films have depicted the American counter-terrorism forces much less accurately.
