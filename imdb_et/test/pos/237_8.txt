Another great music from Hollywood Gold! I liked this film, which tells about the trio of friends who are performers in a small nightclub, far from Broadway and all its shine. Although it is not a great time for them to be very happy with their life and the small club they meet. Gene Kelly plays the owner of a small club and is also the boy of one of her dancer Rita Hayworth, who points out if she has the opportunity to be on the cover of the magazine. The problem starts with Gene Kelly because her girlfriend is now a city. Phil Silvers plays one of three friends and does a good job. Of course there is music and dance. There seems to be one Gene Kelly dance show. She walks down the street alone at night and she sees her reflection in the shop. His reflection will soon start dancing with him on the streets, great cinema. Don't miss this, great entertainment.
