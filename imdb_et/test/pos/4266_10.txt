This is a film that anyone living in Sweden should watch. The film shows political unrest in 2001 in Gothenburg from a new perspective. It includes interviews with convicted persons when these people get the first chance after their riots to tell their story and why they think the world can be a much better place to live and participate. I see it emotionally because I feel so crazy how these people were treated during the riots and after the riots. <br /> <br /> I hope you can see this movie as much as possible because it really thinks: is it possible? In Sweden, Democracy, 2001?
