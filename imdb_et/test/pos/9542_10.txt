This wonderful film has never left me. Color, a convincing cast and a stunning landscape make a great contribution. This production, unlike Carlton's later recast, is more impressive and is presented more from the child's point of view. It focuses on certain episodes of the charming story of E. Nesbit, rather than trying to do a little more of the documentary "warts and all" style Carlton takes. Above all, Johnny Douglas's brilliant musical result supports the whole story, adding extra emotional depth. The result is a real combination of sensory experience that cumulatively presents the "fun" story of "Railroads". <br /> <br /> One awkward factor that the viewer has to ponder over all this film is how things have changed since their times - and in many ways worse! Yes, maybe many of us no longer have to use outside toilets and ride in horses, but what is the overall quality of life? Think of unpleasant celebrities who are now "on TV" on our TV screens. Their language is probably considered perfectly acceptable. Consider the insecure "here today, tomorrow" aspects of so many modern "partnerships" and of all single mothers - no matter what the "marriage" happened to this institution, when people accepted each other's mistakes, but still loved their children? These details add an extra extension to watching this wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> I hope that children can enjoy this movie after generations. Not to mention some adults!
