I liked this movie. One thing I've noticed is that Korean TV shows are much better, as long as you get the whole story. I'm watching movies if I don't have the time or feel the 16-30 episodes. Movies seem to be in a hurry and if you do not look carefully, you may miss something. I feel it was rushed and I had to roll back a few parts to try to find what I miss, especially at the end. If you like a nice love story, I think it's cute, and if you have extra time, I think it's still worth it. <br /> <br /> It's always nice to go back to watching the different actors, because we can't follow them from the beginning, as we do the producers and leaders of our country's actors.
