I was really looking forward to watching this documentary about what I thought was some of the most fun movies. In LA, many of the old black and white films of the 1960s grew up in local stations. I even remember the Friday night exhibition titled "Strange Story of Science Fiction", which introduced another Sci Fi flick every week. However, this documentary spent too much time on the opinions of four famous filmmakers and how they felt about the classic films of this genre and how they used them as an inspiration for filming. <br /> <br /> I was hoping for this documentary. Indeed, it could have been a decade of thorough investigation, rather than briefly highlighting the best-known films of the era. Anyone who has learned or is interested in these films is quite familiar with such standouts as World of World, Forbidden Planet, Thing, Day the Earth Stood Still, etc. I would have liked to see some excerpts from lesser-known movies and maybe some interviews with people involved in making these films. I should agree that the documentary was too focused on Spielberg's opinions and was a new World War II for him.
