In 1965, producer Kevin McLory owns a part of Bond's cinematographic rights related to EON Productions (Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli) 007 for the fourth film. The star is of course Sean Connery. <br /> <br /> In 1982, McLory won a legal battle and was able to create an "independent" bond film. "Never Say Ever" (NSNA) is one of the two "unofficial" 007 films made outside of EON (the second is the 1967 comedy "Casino Royale"). NSNA is a "Thunderball" remake and marks the original Bondi, Sean Connery - who comes back after years of absence. <br /> <br /> The movie will be released a few months later by "Octopussy" with Roger Moore, episode 13 of the EON series. During the press, it is called "War of Debts" ... Both films are great advances in 1983, even if "Octopussy" earns more money in the box. <br /> <br /> NSNA is a luxury movie by great technicians - director Irvin Kershner who led "The Empire strikes back", Douglas Slocombe - lost Ark "Raiders" - and screenwriter Lorenzo Semple Jr-who wrote "Three days of Condor "- among other things ... <br /> <br /> Connery is great, then relatively unknown Kim Basinger, Barbara Carrera, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Max Von Sydow, Edward Fox ... <br /> <br /> all that the film will be worse than the original "Thunderball". It has no real key component for the Bond movie: there is no traditional weapon attack, there is no "James Bond theme", M and Q are not traditional players ... This is the copyright reason: the EON has only these elements to use. In short, the classic cinema of the NSNA lacks an atmosphere of 007. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film is exciting and enjoyable. Brandauer is a very good villain and women (Basinger and Carrera) are sensual and proud. But the main emphasis is on Sean Connery! She's still wonderful in this role, she's older, but she looks more passionate and nicer than "Diamonds are forever", her last performance in the role of British superpion before NSNA.
