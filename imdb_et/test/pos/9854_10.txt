This documentary is not only one of the best documentaries I've seen, but also one of the most mobile and quietly beautiful movies I've seen. It follows the lives of two young men from Sudan, Peter and Santino, trying to enter American culture. Peter and Santino are first of all friends, but they are gradually moving away from each other, as Peter goes to Kansas City and Santino stays in Houston (called the "land of Houston"). Santino's beauty is in her eyes. He takes people to his back, supports an apartment full of another Sudan, pays the rent, doing everything to other people. He's a quiet sufferer. Peter looks out for himself by acquiring basketball and Christian friends playing high school. It seems that director Megan Mylan did not know what he was going to do with the story. Peter and Santino are amazing characters that move you. But the true strength of this film is the commentary on American society. It doesn't decide. It shows the strengths and weaknesses of our world and how difficult it can be outside the human being. I suggest you find this movie and watch America through the lives of these two exciting and beautiful people. <br /> <br /> My class: 10/10
