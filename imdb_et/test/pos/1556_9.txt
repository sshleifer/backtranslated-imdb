I gave it 9 stars out of a possible 10. If it had just been a teensy bens bit more plot line, I would have given it 10. <br /> <br /> However, this is a very interesting film. <br /> <br /> Judith Ivey, who played a pleasant old buoyancy, should have given him an Oscar. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace (depicting Alice) I have never seen will do a good job and I have the most sexy body I think I've ever seen on film. <br /> <br /> During the old car beating, Alice has come to Florida where she has a friend (or maybe it's her sister, I'm not sure, and it's my fault, not the movie) and the big hopes go to college, which he and his family can't really afford. br /> <br /> He seems rather insecure on the road only, and he is confident that he will encounter somewhat tougher characters and soon after that it was discovered that one of his tires had a hole. > She is at the same time as a rest and is assisted by a woman named Sandra and her husband Bill, an older couple traveling in the RV. <br /> <br /> Will they go south to Florida and take it under your wing, but is everything as they present themselves? Returns and paranoia enter the story when our young heroine learns new life-related lessons.
