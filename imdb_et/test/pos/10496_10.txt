Enigma is a computer part that scans Russian messages so that America cannot understand them. They can only be read by the desired recipient. The Americans know that the Russians are conveying a message that reveals the plan of the five political murders they wish to conduct. <br /> <br /> So they send former Defender Holbeck (Martin Sheen) to grab and replace the wrong part so they can decode the message and kill the attempts. <br /> <br /> However, when we listen to the leaders of spy organizations, we find they already have and want Holbeck to try to steal Enigma, but to convince the Russians that they don't already have it. They do not expect Holbeck to succeed. So the Russians, who had stopped sending Enigma, would immediately resubmit. <br /> <br /> Enigma is on the computer at Dimitri Vasilikov's office. Anyway, Holbeck must have access and he must find out when Vasilikov has come out. He sends his former girlfriend in Karen (Brigitte Fossey) to attract Vasilikov so that he can review his documents and find out his planned movements. Karen is happy to do this because they tortured his father, a university professor, to death. <br /> <br /> Since we know it's better than Americans when Holbeck fails, the film becomes even more intense than the spy thriller. We find ourselves hoping that he can survive, especially if he uses brilliant methods to beat the Russians at every step. <br /> <br /> But what is it? Do Karen and Vasilikov fall in love? Will Holbeck win Karen back or will he actually go to Vasilikov? The romantic twist raises this spy thriller, which is worth ten, even higher, in its originality. Writing, direction and acting all make this new and more exciting twist convincingly realistic. <br /> <br /> You will find yourself at your seat, grabbing your armchair not only the excitement of a spy story, but also a very beautiful romantic love story. These two themes are intertwined, until the end. You really want both sides to win. Who then wins? You have to watch the movie and find out if it is!
