I've broken my brain against another movie that reminds me of it. I can't really come together. I think this is because most movies that take this issue (war, peace, violence) are fixed in documentary style. they are intended to be informative and to give their emotional response to the surface by intellectual means. This DVD, which in some cases may seem more intellectual, but it really is not. Maybe it is philosophical, but it goes into the mode of information and goes straight to the place the music plays. It makes you feel, but sometimes you don't know why. You are just feeling somewhere. When you look at it, note how well it is put together. It may not be for everyone, but for everyone looking for rare cinematographic creations that respect you.
