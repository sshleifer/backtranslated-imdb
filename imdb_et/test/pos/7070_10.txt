Yes, yes. Watch this movie if you want bold movies. This is perhaps the best Mexican image from Midaq Alley just because of the excellent casting, outrageous direction and sublime soundtrack. Many people did not like "Cronica?", They think it is very aggressive, but they did not realize that it was only a representation with a Mexican society of hyperrealism, but so similar to all third-world families. I hope that Benjamin Cann and Bruno Bichir (who in this movie will give another example of their size as an actor) will quickly get together with a new film. Remember how Los Bu√±uel was misunderstood at liberation, but now we have to take into consideration the best films of all time. Please prepare yourself and watch this movie.
