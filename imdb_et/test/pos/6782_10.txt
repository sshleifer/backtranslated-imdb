This game is a fighting act / adventure. There are quite long periods without struggle, but at other times you have to get rid of different monsters. Monsters is not like something you would see in real life, and they have to get rid of them to continue their endeavors. The whole game is search. You play Adam Randall, whose father contacts him outside and asks him to come and save him. The game has been around since the mid-1990s and has to be played in DOS. I used Dosbox and managed to play quite well. Graphics are not as good as some games even during this time, mainly because the resolution is not high and some scenes are pretty blocked, but others see the dough, but don't let it down. The game is very imaginative, long and may jump you when unexpected monsters appear somewhere. Not for young children who are probably not interested in anyway, but over 13 or 14 may like this game. This is a horrific adventure in the fight against the combination. I thought it was a great game. It had to be found now. Suddenly Ebay. But remember, this is a DOS game and you can't play it on today's faster computers. fast computers would be difficult to play if you are not using Dosbox. Oh, and the actor is also very good.
