No matter how many times Wile Ethelbert "Famishius Famishius" Coyote tries to get to the Road "Burnius Roadibus" Runner, we always know what happens, even though our sympathy always remains with the WEC. Highlighting "Hook, Line and Stinker" is a Rube Goldberg style scheme that WEC hopes to end; But of course you know what happens. <br /> <br /> So, Wile E. continues to have a fun fanatic (defined by George Santayana as doubling after forgetting your goal), while Road Runner will never be aware of the potential threat or lack of it ever again in which he found himself. Real classic. <br /> <br /> Yes, the middle name of the koyot is Ethelbert. I learned about it "Jeopardy!"
