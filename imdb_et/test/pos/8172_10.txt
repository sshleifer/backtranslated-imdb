Having grown up with Mormon and experienced the authority of the Church against the black people (they were not allowed to have the priesthood of the Church when I was a member) - I was not aware of the policies of the organizations that homosexual men and women only communicate after leaving the church in 1966 - (I was 20.) I was stunned when I found out that friends who were gay were being sold out even after serving missions. DAYS DAYS reveal the persecution of Mormon to gay members. The film is long-lasting. It provides an excellent job of showing how two leading men meet each other, succeeding to grow and develop as individuals. LATTER DAYS has a big heart, great music and an extra class from Jacqueline Bisset. The film is a great story about an individual who leaves the boundaries of organized religion and restores his soul.
