I admit that I am frightened of the sea and spent many years in the navy, so I am a little biased about it. I missed this documentary when it first came out, but I started buying different people on DVD this Christmas (2002) and got it! Some movies are amazing and I have a lot of respect for those who make documentaries to see the 200 tons of Blue Whales "sailing" at sea, they saw like submarines. I like the level of information and facts transmitted through the story, it's just right, I don't want to know what the science bases are just some of the basics to see that these things are enough for most people. The BBC can do things to the right level for the desired audience. <br /> <br /> A really big documentary, there is "The World at War" for me, the DVD is of excellent quality. If I had little criticism, it would probably have added sound effects here and there, I think they will reduce some scenes. But well done by BBC and Discovery.
