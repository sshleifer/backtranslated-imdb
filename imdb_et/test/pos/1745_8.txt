Although Disney has been a 70-year-old animation studio, their supremacy has always been a rival. If this review was written in 2009, such companies as Dreamworks and (to a lesser extent) Warner Brothers and Ardman will bring out animated films that could challenge Disney's dominance. At the beginning, in the early 1930s and early 40s, when Disney served cinematic banquets such as Snow White, Dumbo and Fantasia, the competitions were competed by brothers Dave and Max Fleischer. Despite the release of two highly praised films, are they never quite at the corner of the market? Many attribute their collapse to the business break of Mr Bug Goes to Town, which appeared the same week as the Pearl Harbor attack (which gave the American public something more important than to think about going to the cinema to watch a movie!) The film is faded by the relative ambiguity of travesty. <br /> <br /> There is a dangerous risk in a growing box in the city. People use land in the form of a shortcut, throwing garbage and cigars, and other threats, right into the home of mistakes when they go. Honey-shop owner Bumble (expressed by Jack Mercer) fears that the future is gloomy and asks how he can raise his daughter Honey (by Pauline Loth) in a safe environment. A very shameful creature, Bagley C. Beetle (expressed by Tedd Pierce), offers her a safer place to live when she is married to her, but Honey is much more interested in her childhood, forever joyful and optimistic Hoppity (expressed by Stan Freed). Hoppity believes that everything is better to deal with, but it was stupid when Bagley Beetle and his pair of comic dresses manipulated the crisis with their contemptuous end. Only at the end, when their patches become the basis for a huge new skyscraper, the mistakes of loyalty return to Hoppity when they wait for them to drive these new, safe people away from the devastating effect. <Br /> <br /> What does this movie really do? all bugs are intelligently designed and designed for maximum audience complaints. Bumblebee runners will fly and smile mosquitoes (fun names when you think about it) are especially memorable. Equally admirable is storytelling? even the youngest children can enjoy this story while they know the message to older audiences about how human negligence can affect the survival of wildlife. Time is inevitably a timing of some aspects of the film, and when viewed, the audience must accept (and forgive) those occasional features of general age and wear. But the whole Mr Bug goes to the city is an animated, funny and very slickly animated, worthy message to launch.
