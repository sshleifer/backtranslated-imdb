DALLAS is a setback for the 30's and 40's "old-fashioned" western countries (like DODGE CITY), DALLAS has several things: Gary Cooper's coolest and relaxing Technicolor photographer Ernest Haller (GONE WITH THE WIND) and Pulse-pounding Max Steiner (KING KONG, GWTW, DODGE CITY, and others). In addition, disguise, mistaken identity, fake death and more hair flow flee than the series of the Republic. As always, Cooper determines what a man under pressure is. Forget the 50s of angst western ... it's pure entertainment!
