As is often the case when you try to take a 400-page book and a two-hour movie with a cramp, there is a lot lost. Here, the director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) takes an extremely ambitious project and almost pulls it away. What we get is a charming and emotionally influential film that seems somehow incomplete. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of wonderful and fantastic. John Toll's filmmaker (the gateway and operator of autumn legends, winning the Oscars for both) is great. When working with Madden, the choices for the Greek Cephalonia Island are excellent and visual images that come in a different light from the shooting of these majestic places are lush and beautiful. Madden also uses several Greek actors as city citizens, giving the city authentic feelings. The soundtrack is also terrible and the mandolins and vocals of Italian soldiers are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Madden is doing a great job of bringing us the Italian occupation and romance that take the biggest part of the film. There are lots of cute and funny moments in this segment. But by the time the serious battle of the drama is ready to open, there is not much left in the roll and this component is extremely rushed and shortened. Although the battle scenes are well done, it is obvious after the battle that more and more compromises are being made to keep the movie too long. By the time we reach the post-war scenes, the treatment is only a skeleton. Another downside is that DVDs are particularly rare in terms of features. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage is in a romantic lead as a sentimental captain who seems to have joined the army to sing, not fight. When he has to fight, Cage switches smoothly and sharply and is somehow believable in both individuals. <br /> <br /> Penelope Cruz, who loves the camera, unintentionally gives Pelagia. This is partly because Cage dominates this screen, but Cruz seems too inappropriate for what should be emotional and dynamic. He promises to characterize the character for Corell's love instead of creating a powerful character in his own way. <br /> <br /> John Hurt gives a fantastic result as a smart old doctor who knows as much human as medicine. But Christian Bale seems a bit overdone and stiff as a Pelagia fianc√©. <br /> <br /> I appreciated this movie 8/10. Despite some drawbacks, this is a film that is worth seeing. Photography alone is worth the price of admission.
