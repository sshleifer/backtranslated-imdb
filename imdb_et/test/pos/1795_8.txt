Obviously, Han's isolation and despair have been caused by a stereotypically cold, cowardly woman, a cheering woman, and a rejection of a lover. And despite the complicated portrayal - Hans himself does not specify these allegations - there must also be an important part of Fassbind's mindset (using Freud and Marx). However, the viewer does not look beyond the sex of Hass and sexism to find a more serious cause of his broken spirit. <br /> <br /> First of all, it is very unlikely that the lack of love for her mother forced her into a foreign Legion. It was much more likely and partly stated that it was an adventure, a male husband (escaping from the mother's and sister's female world) and male identity - offered by both the Legion and the War. Second, because of his sexism, Hans loses his successful job as a police officer. As prostitutes work, they not only strike prostitution as an oppressive institution, but show that they cannot even control their sexuality in the professional arena - and are even prepared to threaten their desired career. <br /> <Third, he makes serious verbal violence against his wife in front of his sheep-like male friends, without making any distinction between his absence or, when he sees him, looking for it. In fact, he is brutal in his presence. <br /> <br /> A few hours later, in a violent and drunken state, he will win his wife in front of her daughter who intervenes on behalf of her mother. The terror she puts on her and her daughter is felt. But both he and the audience are moving with conscience or protest. Why? Because her husband is cruelly and sexually insecure (yes, it may be Fassbinder's opinion of what capitalism women have, insecure and merchandise), but it does not relieve Hans's brutality or Fassbinder's exploitation of the battery scene). <br /> <br /> And then this male role pressure Hans can choose to refuse and protest, but agrees. He is too short for men and too heroes to achieve the desired global success of men. But how can these be the causes of despair if he not only gets his loved one's lover, but marries a senior woman who is much more attractive than herself., Finally, Hans Harry, his companion, promises to convince his wife, on the contrary, in his house. With this decision, he not only makes it clear that he is more involved with Harry than his wife, but that male attachment replaces his love. Ultimately, he replaces his life, because it is Harry's ultimate competence and spirit around the house, which causes the Han to fall. The merchant Hans may be the victim of capitalism, but rather he is the victim of his own loyalty to his male identity. His failure to let him go is the main reason for his isolation and despair. <br /> <br /> This is something I think has disappeared not only from Fassbinder, but also from Han's sister, Anna, albeit to a degree that is lost. Anna (and Fassbinder) for her brother's support for her mother goes only so far. He is quite demanding that only he can save himself - that his support and love cannot end his own dignity. Unfortunately, he does not offer any kind of support and love for his wife, who has to be much more nervous than Hans, but who eventually can get the pieces and save himself and his daughter and make a noticeable contrast with Han falls.
