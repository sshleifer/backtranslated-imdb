It is clear that the value of this film exceeds the cost of a format (mini-dv). In fact, the filmmaker includes the form and adds it so steadily to the story I forgot that I didn't see a typical 35 millimeter film. It has major complaints about indie films, such as Clerks & Robert Rodriguez, with a fantastic "new key" in the romantic comedy. "This is not a movie" is an honest film with honest images and it is a great tempo of the pace. There is no point in this movie where I felt that the scene could (or should have) been abandoned. On the contrary, the manager draws amazing performances from truly talented actors and does so in extremely limited circumstances. On the screen, this movie is a worthy and relevant story that hits so many levels (creative, technical, or otherwise). I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys cinema or who are looking for a little charm unless otherwise enchanted by the environment.
