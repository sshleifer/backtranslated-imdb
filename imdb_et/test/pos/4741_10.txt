After viewing the "Waco: The engagement rules" I was just sitting incredibly on what I admit. FBI big roof, gung-ho / firing happy government massacre? I clearly remember Waco standoff, at that time I was 17 years old and watched it on CNN. I remembered the thinking of all the children when I looked at Mount Camel's burn in April 1993. I remember the mercy of children, but I clearly felt that it was their evil leader David Koresh and others Davidians. Gazec's film shows clearly and beyond doubt, although it is biased that the FBI lied again and again. I think this film made a big contribution to the resumption of the new case in 1999. The outcome of this new investigation was somewhat predictable, the judgment was based on a fact that was as gray as the facts that Davidians put forward. I was very disappointed with the judgment because, as far as I know, it did not take into account all the lies, misrepresentations and evidence of the FBI and other officials. Why hasn't anyone been accused of obstructing the work of Texas Rangers investigators? Why were they allowed to contaminate the crime scene and thwart the compound soon after the incident? These are the questions I have not answered. Most importantly, what about children? In this new study, I have not learned who was responsible for spraying CS-flammable tear gas in a multi-hazard compound to ignite this gas, and I haven't found an answer to whether the children's muscles were diminished as a result of being alive. If they did, I would certainly believe that Janet Reno, or who is ever responsible for the attack, should be blamed for mass destruction or killing. The question raised by Gazecki but not mentioned is; Was there a direct plan for responsible people and their tanks to cut holes and burn the building deliberately? (a plan that would have achieved 112% efficiency) or were the officials so incompetent that they did not know the consequences of their actions? Both are equally scary. Even if the Davidians were shooting the compound, the officials in charge were certainly giving them the opportunity to work. When the responsible officials knew as they claimed that Davidians would shoot the compound, why f? Did the containers cut all the holes in the building, turning it into a furnace, and why didn't they intend to deal with the fire they knew? The dark issues that still do not disappear The ultimate and most important issue in this film is the way the government demonizes goddesses through the media, which simply feeds it to the public. I clearly remember the resentment I felt for the evil Davidian I saw in 1993 at CNN. Now that I'm older, I see a clear line of communication between the government every time they begin to hold the civilian massacre. Demonizing people with words like; "they have different illegal values, then" they don't enjoy freedom "and" they threaten our freedoms and way of life "make them so much easier to kill ????
