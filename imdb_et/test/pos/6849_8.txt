And it got in France! Why not in the rest of the world, while studios keep the expensive post-Grisham trash out (does anyone remember him as a fine writer and not the most betrayed-the-the-screen author in this Stephen King?)? is this all. Okay, the situations are not always original, they have small plot holes and it tends to be some (short) time for your own interest, but it really gives you love. I would like to know what the budget was. AND. Once, it's not a cheap Tarantino copy! (Well, the movie noir did not start with Tarantino, you know.) Does Europe rescue him like John Dahl's films, so Mr Guttierez can do that? If you ever read it, Mr Guttierez, thank you and you
