I liked this movie, another Naruto feature film. I liked it better with the snow, although I found the story a little bit loose, because I wasn't sure where certain things had to happen or when. At the same time, as in the first film, he also has one and a half hours of running time, a lot of time for a nice, well-developed movie that really has a cool fight. The story begins with a ninja in a village hidden in a sand fight with unknown attackers. Then it goes against Naruto, Sakura and Shikumaru to cool to the ferret, which they think is a simple task. They will soon find themselves differently if they are attacked and Naruto is separated from his friends when he is fighting with a stranger with a young army covered with armor. Both are injured and involved in the caravan and immediately after Naruto has been invited to join this strange organization who wants to create a utopia. Of course, not everything is as it seems and there are many struggles to go around. My favorite was where Garaa fought against this strange woman who takes her very lightly, which is a very big mistake. All in all, the fight is pretty good, involving Naruto and his strange man who is better off than any previous movie.
