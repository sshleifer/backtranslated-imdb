LA ANTENA (Esteban Sapir - Argentina 2005). <br /> <br /> A totally unique silent cinema in this fairy tale, such as the story of Esteban Sapir, which is beautifully black and white and practically without dialogue, "La Antena is a party dedicated to lovers of German expressionism and cinema, where most wear Fritz Lang Works by Friedrich Murnau. <br /> <br /> "The city without voice", "La Ciudad sin Voz" is ruled by Mr TV, has taken the voices of the inhabitants and fully controls all the words and pictures that are spoken, forcing everyone to eat their own TV food brand Mr TV is not just a monopoly, he is a personalization of evil and totalitarianism, even a swastika appears as a symbol several times, he works mysteriously with a hypnotic device to control all the thoughts of a citizen through his television programs. with a singer, but the TV repairman knows the robbery and escapes in the mountains to an old TV antenna to stop Mr TV's bad plans. Although Esteban Sapir captures the main language of silent cinema, he adds a number of new techniques, such as a combination of typographic and animation techniques. Everyone speaks to each other with text through balloons (usually floating near their mouth), the louder they speak, the larger the characters. The texts themselves can be pushed or crushed. In the opening sequence, we see a book entitled "La Antena" that opens and a paper city rises from the pages. There are always no references to Argentina. It is constantly snow, which gives the film a very argentine sense, while the surreal setting refers to the big city in the Northern Hemisphere, just a few songs that reveal the film's Argentine background. <br /> <br /> The pace is fast and so much on the screen, it is difficult to follow the surreal narrative of the movie. Not only is it breathtakingly beautiful to look at, but we are also given some messages about media monopolies, corruption and totalitarianism, but they are easily packed. One of the most original films I've seen for years. Entertainment. <br /> <br /> The movie was opened as a film by IFF in Rotterdam 2007. <br /> <br /> Obscura Camera --- 9/10
