So far, Miguel Bardem's career has been one of the most terrifying cinema in Spain. He hasn't done anything so far, but garbage. "Incautos" has been quite surprising: it is a serious film with a rhythm, great pain and very entertaining. <br /> <br /> The art of robbery, it's Incautos. The film is similar to David Mama's "House of game" and such things. Thousands of turns and stories of the scenario where nothing seems to be happening. <br /> <br /> The weaknesses of the latest Bardem movie may be the American language, which makes some characters rather unnatural (especially Victoria Abril, he is the actor of hell, but "incautos" he is a bit forced). Ernesto Alterio is not so bad, but he is not as good an actor as his father ... And what to say about Luppi? Well, he's a man. <br /> <br /> In short: a good movie. Best of all, Miguel Bardem has ever done. I hope this is the beginning of a whole new phase in my career. <br /> <br /> * My course: 7/10
