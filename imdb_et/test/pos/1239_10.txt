Why would I say that? Because when the movie ended, I was in a good mood. So many people cry at the end, wow! Bruce Willis may be funny. For those who believe he learned how to act after the sixth mind, you must be very new to your career. Before he made Hard Hard, he won the best actors. It's like saying that the sky learned to deposit snow just because it's your first winter. The movie was fun. What is my way of thinking about how some other comments about this movie claim to have no memorable lines or scenes. Spoiler ... <br /> <br /> Waaaambulance? I'm not a loser? Have you ever seen adult shepherds, which I have not before loser? <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was great. It was funny, it was never boring and cheesy Disney sort of, it was a point to do. Something that is related to life and, of course, to every child's film that tries to do it, is over the head, but never interested. <br /> <br /> If you haven't watched it. Do it. You like it.
