Very nice movie! I browsed the TV channels and usually ignore the channels that the air movies show, but then I saw the channel that encourages old school movies and where I saw that movie. At first, when I saw the title "The Cure" I thought it would be boring, but then I got hooked when I saw Brad Renfro in this movie (because one of my favorite films is "Client" where Brad also stars). Then the scenes became better and better. The story is so beautiful and very touching! I called this movie, which I usually don't. Great pain! and there are so many beautiful lines / quotes in this movie that are very striking and made me cry! Now I bought my copy on DVD and always recommend it to everyone!
