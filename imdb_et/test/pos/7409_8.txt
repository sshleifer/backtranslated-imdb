This is one of my personal favorites, a rare little pearl that seems to be undiscovered in the general population. Chris Cooper and Patricia Clarkson form part of the heart that is well chosen. Few films have ever taken real warfare that was under civil war, but it seems to have covered all the right tones and moods. If you're a fan of the book, Cold Mountain, try out this movie and see if you don't think it makes a good companion.
