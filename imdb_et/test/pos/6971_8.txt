Francis Ford Coppola's first "personal" film, made and released in 1969, was the last film he made mostly for an unknown, up and future director in front of the godfather and is in stark contrast to both this film and the rest of his uneven career. This is probably a road film that involves a broken young woman who gets bored of home life and a child with her, she's not sure she wants, escaping her generations from her dull marriage and finding an open path in search of freedom. Along the way, he makes a friendly guy with a former football player who suffered a traumatic head injury from a brain injury that young James Caan played unexpectedly finely and decided to help him, despite the disappointment of his simple ways. His attempts to get rid of him always fail with guilt or coincidence, and eventually he goes directly to the emotionally wounded police (Robert Duvall) who has his own ideas. The plot is complicated, but Coppola does a great job of refining the emotional life of these characters and using editing methods to return a story that wasn't in the American era films at all. The shots are simple, but exceptionally effective, delivering the moody destruction of the open road as well as the emptiness of the suburban life of the suburbs, accompanied by the gentle melancholy of the film. Coppola also deserves credit to address the issue of domestic dissatisfaction from the women's point of view in the culturally turbulent 60s. In general, a rather low-key film, which is not what the audience has been expecting from Coppola, is what has a little triumph in its quiet and little way. 7.5 / 10.
