When I watched the movie, I told me, "so that such a movie could be done." Wong Kar Wai's proud story of poetic love hit me all over the film and even after that. I have to admit that this is one of the best love films, perhaps the best I've ever watched. The content and form overlap perfectly. When we look at secret love, we see characters in a finite frame that limits their movement as well as their feelings. Beautiful camera angles and lighting make feelings and blues even touching. I would like to congratulate Christopher Doyle and Pin Bing Lee for their excellent cinematography, which creates the mood of love. Music also defines the sadness of love, which plays through beautiful slow motion frames and shows signs of despair. And, of course, the performances of the actors that make love so real. Finally, all the elements of the film were perfectly combined with WKW and gave the audience a feeling called love.
