I love this movie. and the Disney channel is ridiculous that it will no longer be played. I think they should definitely put Susie Q in the air for at least one night so we can save it !!! but if not, does anyone know where I find it? my email address is cristin6891@aim.com. Please send me an email if you know where to find this movie. Online or anywhere. I told my kids about this movie and I think they deserve to see it. All of these Disney movies that are coming now are fake and boring. I need Susie Q back !! It was a great movie and he had great actors and I don't understand why it was taken off the air. If everyone loves this movie so much, why was it taken off the air. Please take my comment into account and with all other comments on this movie. Thank you, nice day.
