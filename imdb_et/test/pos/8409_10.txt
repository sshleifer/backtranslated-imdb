First of all, it's never the same as the original movie, but that's why they're not trying to do it. Only one person has the opinion that could have happened after Rhett left Scarlett in Taras. I thought it was a great movie and I would like to add it to my GWTW collection. Only the landscape would make me watch the movie. Just look at this movie as an extension of the original and don't think they're trying to replace Vivian Leigh and Clark and you enjoy that much. They pulled Scarlett's spoiled selfishness in many scenes and you see the longing for Rhett's appearance that he is clearly in love with Scarlett. The fact that you can recognize many of the actors in the film is another plus, although some of them are only on television. I've always wanted them to have other children after Bonnie Blue died in the movie and it met my need perfectly. <br /> <br /> Lore60
