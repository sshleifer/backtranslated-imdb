This film is cooling the bone in a way that is difficult to describe. Although the World Trade Center's devastating event in 1993 and its follow-up investigation are quite accurate in the description of these events, which has taken place since September 11, it is almost intolerable. <br /> <br /> It would be a mistake to call this movie a prophetic, but it will definitely "common deceive me, fool me twice, shame me" on a common playground. <br /> <br /> Our government learned something from the 1993 World Trade Center experiments and the subsequent September 9 report did not show that many of the defects that led to the 1993 bombing were repeated. Some people have criticized the first and the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution, which is partly responsible for the fact that Islamic terrorists are capable of implementing their evil plans, but it is mismanaged in every way. <br /> <br /> Do people who support this argument certainly do not support denial of free speech, free press, or religious freedom? I hope they will not support our government officials so that they can get into any person's home or office to look for no reason or without a warrant. The fact is that the FBI, INS and even the local police could have received guarantees based on the information at their disposal, but they did not decide for various reasons. Moreover, it is not illegal to talk badly about America or its leaders, no matter how terrible or ignorant it is. Likewise, it is not illegal either with their weapons or with praying to Mecca. <br /> <br /> Note that until Lee Harvey Oswald fired his rifle with his President John Kennedy, he wasn't actually breaking the law. Living in free societies has its drawbacks. <br /> <br /> However, the way to see Paradise is what the film fears that many people will never see. As far as I know, this is not a DVD, and 2007 is the tenth anniversary and no updates are known about it. <br /> <br /> I'm not really surprised people don't want to document their failures and this movie definitely shows that the different agencies that were supposed to protect us didn't do their job correctly and for the most interesting reasons like jurisdiction and refusal to share information . <br /> <br /> This is a shame as the tea road paradise is well made and thrilling, and as many have said before, the last scene where Ramzi Yousef (played by Art Malik) is a bomber who built a truck bomb that was used in the first attempt to destroy the two towers, passing the World Trade Center after his capture and extradition simply says, "The next time we put them down," is the moment of the film that froze me for several minutes.
