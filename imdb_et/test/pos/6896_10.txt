This movie was very funny but a little gore. It is about two serious robbers who go in the usual time when they discover that there is another client they can earn. This changes the direction of the collected corpses. The film is spoken by the younger of the two when he explains the company to the priest before he is sent to death. His partner was already dead. The priest is obliged to take the last confession and that is the story. There are some animations that give him stories about the crypt. The story meets another group of fear-robbers who are afraid of everyone, but at one point they are offered to work for younger people who are ready to perform, so that it calms some hostility between groups. When a woman joins two men, she crosses her boundaries and escapes them with horrible hackers. The story leads to a meeting between two groups, which has resulted in the arrest of a man and a man who has already lost his life.
