I wanted to write a quick response to all those people who give this film a bad overview because they think it's not funny or it's boring. <br /> <br /> Here's the trick --- the movie isn't just for comedy. It's deep. Like many Demme movies, it also deals with people who live in some strange corner of our society who are trying to develop how to put together a full life. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film and home video industry does not deal well with the nuance and leaves it in the "COMEDY" trash. It's funny, but a lot of humor is puzzled. However, humor is not the focus of the film, but the people who live there. <br /> <br /> It may not be one of the world's biggest movies, but it's sure and fun. <br /> <br /> And this is one of the reasons why casting is the art itself. Michelle Pfieffer is great and it can be a movie that showed she had some beautiful factors. Mercedes Ruehl has a great boost and he can only chew the terrain in the way that it requires. Throw Oliver Platt, Joan Cusack into smaller roles and talented Dean Stockwell ... and even Chris Isaak and you have a great cast that, as usual, makes a great difference. <br /> <br /> Matthew Modine is fun, but more importantly, he is a big hottie for this movie. Hot, cute and sexy. <br /> <br /> Sit down, wait for an unexpected one and let the film stay where you want to go and you should have a great time.
