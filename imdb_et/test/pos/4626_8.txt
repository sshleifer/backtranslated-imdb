2:37 manages to show us what Australian teens know and don't say. These are the stories of real children and I think we would be naive to think differently. The only new thing 2:37 really brings us from Australia's point of view. We often look at American peoples, but these same problems are often unable to bind our teenagers. It is a smart and skilful cinematography, but I still found (in the case of immediate recognition of a disappointing final song) a musical direction that was lacking in complexity. I praise the fabulous casting of this film. They are regularly looking for Aussie children who call it a lot of compassion. Great performances everywhere, and you can't put Gary Sweet up, this movie reminded me of why sometimes high school suck and if you're not nervous or want to leave with hot and fuzz, go and see 2:37.
