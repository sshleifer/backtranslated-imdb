The film was great and everything, but the "football" scenes had a lot of mistakes, I don't know if someone who worked on the movie has seen a football match before ..? First, I don't understand how he wanted to try the boys' team? Football boys and girls can't play in the same team and they are FIFA rules. And don't let me start who, if they discovered he was a real girl, let him continue playing ... !! secondly, players can't paint their colors and play like that, again FIFA rules aren't for me. <br /> <br /> And don't get me started on the way they gate, it was ridiculous totally unreal. and all the players felt they didn't know about Jack's football. <br /> <br /> And when Duke trained Violat, why they focused only on shooting and overtaking. or shot his only problem?! and why in hell were all the posters placed on the wall of the room for Chelse gamers ?! do not like other players from other teams. it was the only team they know ...! but besides being a good movie and liking the rest, it was just unrealistic for me to train and play scenes. they should have consulted some of them ...!
