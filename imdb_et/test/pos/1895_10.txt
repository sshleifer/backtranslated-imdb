When you watch this movie, you quote it and refer to it for a long time. It has been years since I saw Dolemit and I quote it so far. This is a real classic. It's so pointlessly horrible that it makes a fun look. Every terrible dialogue is absolutely amazing. Every buggy shot of a work of art (?). And every punch and kick so wisely executed. You don't believe your eyes. That's all I can say. If I really got to this movie, I wouldn't be able to finish it and I'll go over to the IMDb 1000-word limit. <br /> <br /> Please watch this movie. You're hysterical. Is 1/10 or 10/10, depending on the sense of humor.
