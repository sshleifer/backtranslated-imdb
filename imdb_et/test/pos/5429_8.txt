If you watch this movie, don't go into this movie in any way, because this movie is completely fun because you shoot yourself. Yeah, sure it's funny at times, but I think it's a political thriller that was masked by comedy. The performances are very good, especially as a leader of Jeff Goldblum Election Company. although it has a limited screen time, it makes a lasting impression. course robin williams is great. laura linney is also great for surprise. he is one of the best actors in Hollywood and one scene shows it. this film makes you think. what if the comedian ran for the president and actually won? would the country be better or would the country break a million pieces?
