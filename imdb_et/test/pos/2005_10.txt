Eve is the eye opener, thanks to the great landscapes and background music that we don't have, we hear. This film shows a good aspect that the human body is God's creation and cares about it, viewers can earn a better respect for the legendary story of Adam and Eve (either when it is true or just a fairy tale, depending on what we believe). Actress / model Inger Ebeltoft's Even personalization is so good, there is no good word to describe her activities, and I can't imagine another actor being Eve. This film is very convenient for me to relieve stress. We would never be as relaxed as before watching this movie. This movie is a masterpiece, God wanted this movie to be ready first! <br /> <br /> Mr. Razbin!
