I was very amused to read some bad comments about this movie. First, many have said they have taken their 4-year-old daughters and grandchildren to watch it and they didn't enjoy it. First of all, I don't think it's a child's film, at least not a very small children's movie, not at least 4. It's a very subtle humor, but it's not meant for quick entertainment, as Tom and Jerry see, or something like that. Many people have also complained that it is going very slowly .... I think these people are used to "collecting" over "quality". Although I have a small quality problem with this film and the fact that the film was not as detailed as the short films, I still believe that it succeeded perfectly for the feature film. And how can people complain about jokes? The jokes were reasonable, timely and thoughtful, never rude offensive or "your face". Wallace is extremely intelligent, but careful and Grommit is the most divine, wise and cute character that could be. It was a beautiful movie and the topic was very relevant ... to adults ... especially with regard to the increase in obesity and metabolic disease in the world, there is nothing wrong with promoting vegetables and fruits once ... and this was achieved very tastefully in the sense that. .. when people are related to the vegetable aspect, which does not necessarily mean that they are healthier or that they eat more ... but simply that they hit with nature, what is actually the cause of the rabbit legend. And for those who complained about religious jokes, I say ... came! are you real? Many villages revolve around the local church, and legends / premonitions etc are common issues, no harm. This movie was absolutely amazing, but some people had negative comments on it and I find it absolutely absurd !!!
