If anything, William Girdler was an opportunist who wanted some of this activity to be popular over time. I mean, blaxploitation flick in Louisville, Kentucky .. who would thunk it?!?! I can imagine the enthusiasm that he had to mark his picture to get Pam Grier, a pretty hot object. If you are quite familiar with this genre, Girdler's Sheba, Baby is not necessarily too far from the formula. In spite of the change of place, the film is still dealing with the merciless business nickname Shark, who muscles to the credit companies using stooge to threaten their signatures. Grier is Sheba Shayne, a former Louisville police officer working in Chicago who returns home at the request of his father's partner Brick (Austin Stoker, Assault on Precinct 13). Sheba's father, in spite of Shark's bullying tactics (.. his man in town is Pilot, a wannabe gangster, equipped with stooms who are not so threatening, rather buffalo, so thin that they would hire strikes outside the city to shoot a Shayne loan building), will not give up his business and will eventually cost him his life if the warning of brute force leads to his death. Sheba gets revenge on anyone responsible for her father's death. In other words, Shark's ass is a lawn ... do you dig it? <br /> <br /> The fact that Grier with magnum is enough to sell this particular movie is a novelty in the Louisville layout. You can even see a speedboat, Grier with gangsters (.. may not be the most polished one that is used to see in Chicago or New York in this period blaxploitationis), many blood-hoping organs broken with firearms, and colored characters (like a wimpy loan a shark pimp-dress called Walker and Pilot, one of the least frightening mobiles you probably see) who appear during the movie. failing in contact with the very angry Sheba. The plot itself is not something special, but Grier is always worth seeing and Girdler organizes many sequences of activities to keep his target audience entertained. Modest success for Girdler and one of his more films.
