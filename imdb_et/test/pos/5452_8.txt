TV movies generally do not get as much recognition or credit as excellent movies - and this is usually a good reason, but the 1996 HBO movie Late Shift is just one of the best TV movies ever. Based on Bill Carter's revealing book, The Late Shift is about NBC's late-night conversation with David Letterman and Jay Leno when he came to fill the vacant Tonight Show when Johnny Carson was. We see what's going on in front of the camera - Bill Carter, director Betty Thomas and HBO show us what happened when the cameras were turned off. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we can never be sure what really happened when it came time for Johnny Carson to replace either Letterman or Leno - but the delayed transition gives us an interesting potential reality. In making a very well-made movie, Late Shift does a great job of portraying all sides quite equally - though you don't know if the film makes Letterman and Leno too quiet; especially Leno, who seems too holy. <br /> <br /> Performances are also very good. Kathy Bates plays a very worthy Golden Globe performance at Leno's extremely surprising leader Helen Kushnick, who, according to Carter and the book / film, was very challenging for the studio and Leno (the real Kushnick actually matched Bill Carter to slip this picture!). John Michael Higgins leaves his usual small comedy pieces and delivers excellent results as David Letterman - it gives Letterman a great impression, but also creates a dimensional and relative character. Daniel Roebuck gives Leno a good result, but doesn't understand any other talent in the movie - Roebuck probably did what anyone could have done, it's just hammy if someone tries to make Leno's impression or image. Bob Balaban (squirrelly Warren Littlefield), Treat Williams (magician Michael Ovitz) and Ed Begley Jr (pompous Rod Perth) give memorable support. <br /> <br /> Late transition is definitely one of the best TV movies I've ever seen. I think that if nobody has watched David Letterman or Jay Leno, the delayed shift may not be for them, but this is an interesting movie for those who enter into late night politics - something that has recently grown up in his ugly head. Leno / NBC attack.
