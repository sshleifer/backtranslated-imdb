Okay, I have to admit that I like Peter Liapis and I admit that this is not the best Ghoulies sequel. I mean, yes, he had his drawbacks, such as NO GHOULIES himself. But the two Ghoulies who come to earth were really funny, I think they were called Dark and Lite. I enjoyed the plot of the movie. And even at the end of the movie, both Ghoulies meant there was a sequel. Still waiting. lol. Peter Liapis reiterated his role as Jonathan Graves, this time playing a detective as lovely! Ghoulies IV may not be scary or intense, but it's definitely funny. I thought I'd like to comment on this movie and just say - it's not that bad. It's worth a look, though Ghoulies aren't in it.
