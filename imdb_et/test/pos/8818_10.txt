All in all, Big Bad John was a fun and touching movie. If you want romance, tragedy, and humor, this movie got. If you are a fan of the song (like me), you know pretty much how it ends. But if you don't want to do it and don't want to watch it, I strongly recommend this movie. Jack Elam and Jimmy Dean are having fun with a couple of great chemistry. But I wouldn't recommend this movie to a strict city dweller. You have to understand where these people should come, and only one handful of us are left. But even some city dwellers could understand it and appreciate it for what it is: a good, down home movie that makes you laugh, cry and be inspired.
