(Note: I saw that I sold in the 20th century at the Glasgow International Film Festival). I sold a black choral comedy set at the end of the Middle Ages and the stars Dominic Monaghan (Lord of the Rings), Ron Pearlman (Hellboy), Larry Fessenden (9th session) and Angus Scrimm (Phantasm). <br /> <br /> The movie opens with a grave-robber Willie Grimes (Fessenden), who is still outraged and indestructible, eaten on a guillotine and filled. His trainee and perpetrator, Arthur Blake (Monaghan), is a locked tower waiting for his turn when a whiskey-swilling priest with an unhealthy interest in the occult pays him a visit with a visible intention of Blake's last confession. It will soon become clear that Duffy's main interest is that there is more to Blake. Most of the plots here are in the form of a setback when Monaghan cuts Duffy into his horrible career. <br /> <br /> Initially, Grimes and Blake start with a simple, splitting body snatcher working with spiritual drummer Quint (Scrimm), a harsh, corrupt anatomist who uses blackmail as a fight against our two heroes and takes a rather unhealthy joy in his work . The couple has the first invasion of Undead when, one evening, Quint sends a blank moonlight bridge to the mission to restore the body that is mysteriously mixed at the crossroads, probably according to some ancient practice. But there is something else in this body. It is wrapped in garlic cloves ... and buried through this heart ... <br /> <br /> After a terrifying meeting, they didn't only plan to get rid of the mechanisms of the doctor, but they also discover the occult subculture of the occultists who pays good money for the corpses and even better money for Undead's living parameters. This leads us to the hidden underworld of our frantic duo "ghoul hunting", where they find themselves not only vampires, monsters, and zombies (and another paranormal unit for which I am not surprised), but also rivals who were competing hunters inbred and murderers Murphy clans. <br /> <br /> I was going to sell dead, waiting for a low key, slightly distracting and low budget cooler. I was not ready for incredible imagination, strange humor, high quality action, great dialogue, a thick atmosphere and a unique personality that makes me sell a dead strong early candidate for my year's horror film. <br /> <br /> With the exception of a few rough edges, the production values ​​are really fantastic for such a low budget cut - it seems to have been made for about $ 20 million, and I was surprised when the director told the audience that it was done less than half of it (although it did not want to give accurate figures because the film was sold to dealers). The "look" and tone of the movie is a visual comic book somewhere between Tim Burton and Hammer Horror. The plot is a wonderfully surreal but hidden underworld idea that runs parallel to everyday life, but what the general public cannot or does not want to believe is what really makes sense in the context of the film. /> <br /> The actor's expected actor is the upper limit. The characters are surprisingly well established, especially Grimes and Blake, and all the actors give their sharply written lines with just the right language to make the dialogue so fun and realistic. Angus Scrimm also has a very short but memorable role as a gentle threatening violinist Anatomist Doctor Quinn. <br /> <br /> Conclusion - I loved it. It's been a long time since I had so much movie entertainment. I'm trying to say something bad about that. Mark my words, this is one of the cult films such as Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people still discover and love 20, 30, 40 years.
