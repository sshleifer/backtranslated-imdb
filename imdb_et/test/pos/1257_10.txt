From that point of view, it is certainly useful to make films that do not attack people of high moral value. This is another Bruce Willis film in a row that can tell your story without nudity, color humor, embarrassment or free violence. (Of course, I refer to the sixth idea.) Both films take part in more than one level. It is also suitable for children, although, as others have pointed out, it is not flashing for children. <br /> <br /> I was bothered that the schedule that drives this plot has never been explained except that we know that Russell himself will launch it at the age of 70 years. Also, why should her deadly mother come to school when she wins; why, if his parent himself says he has to fight this child in the next few years, his mother does not have to come to him every time and cannot learn and why he does not learn to hit the process. I also found a score for a tedious and not always suitable stage. <br /> <br /> Good use of the red plane as a metaphor.
