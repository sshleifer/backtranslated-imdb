Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every existing tree, saying it is a rabbit season. But you guessed it - it's really a duck season. Elmer Fudd appears: he is the only hunter who is stupid enough to fall. <br /> <br /> He is even uneven. When Bugs Bunny gets on with her and asks how the rabbit's hunting goes, Elmer admits she hasn't seen a rabbit yet. That's more than Daffy can stand. He appears in his hiding place and immediately refers to the rabbit: Bugs Bunny. "Shoot him now!" Daffy screams. "You're quiet," says Bugs. "He doesn't have to shoot you now." Daffy demands that he do this. <br /> <br /> When Daffy returns his broken beak with his head, he has been condemned for more arguments that are infected with the "noun" problem, all of which have the same result. Later, Bugs sounds a sexy wife and asks Elmer for dinner. Will Daffy laugh at the last one? "Ha, ha, very funny! Ha, ha, ha!" <br /> <br /> What's this classic comic book funny? The mistake repeats fear when Daffy screams his face. Bugs Bunny says, "Yes?" while dropping yourself with satisfaction. Daffy Duck is standing on a top view that needs shooting. Elmer Fudd suggests he "can't wait any bigger." Daffy sees Bugs in women's clothes and makes little noise at this language. Carl Stalling Games "You must have a beautiful baby" during the Bugs pull. Daffy calls "honesty" out of the Bugs. Stalling plays "Home Sweet Home" at the wrong moment. Daffy tells Bugs that he is "unlikely". <br /> <br /> Five words: every detail of this movie. <br /> <br /> NOTE: This short is available at "Looney Tunes Golden Collection, First Volume," Disc 1
