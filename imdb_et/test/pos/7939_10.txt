I saw this movie with a lively performance by Buffalo Philharmonic and music was one of the two things that definitely gave me experience; especially the song after the battle where the woman was looking for a man was just devastating. The second thing that stood out for me was the battle itself on the ice, with a bit of strategy hanging in 2004 by KH Arthuri's makers. The battle also lasts forever (half an hour?) - painfully long. I cannot think of another propaganda film that makes war less glamorous or rewarding. I'm surprised that Stalin liked this movie so well; I wouldn't want to go out and watch it.
