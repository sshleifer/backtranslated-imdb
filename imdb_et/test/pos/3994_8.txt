This film, which won Im Kwon-Taek as the best director of Cannes in 2002 (associated with Mr Anderson for Punch-drunken Love), is a 19th-century Korean painter whose roots are traditional and have a major impact on Korean painting. One of the strengths of the film is that Im trying to see us in the artist's eyes, so we can see a number of scenes and objects that inspire our drunk painter friend Jang Seung-up (Choi Min-shik). <br /> <br /> Costumes and art direction are all impressive and the actor is even good. It's not filmed for me, but that's what made me think of art and what it means to find my voice in it. It's pretty cool. It is also interesting to see that in Korea these days, just before the beginning of the century, there is a version where the Chinese and Japanese authorities are both in Korea and in the kingdom of Chosun. The film has collected more than one revolution and political ideology, but never a center. It is definitely a painter. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is a well-made film about life in painting. But it does not have exactly three times the structure of the structure, so you have to be able to look at this non-standard Hollywood story. Yes, for art! 8/10
