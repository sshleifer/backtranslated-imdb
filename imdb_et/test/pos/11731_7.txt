The Sharky machine finds that Burt Reynolds is a drug policeman who, after unsuccessful purchases and bangs that were not his fault, but killed some people, finds himself humiliated by the Atlanta Vice President. /> Prestige is hardly as good as beating drugs, but it has its own fringe benefits. One night after the rounding of working girls, where one of their books gets into their hands, the boys are asking for Rachel Ward's supervision. He is an expensive item serving both the infamous Vittorio Gassman and Earl Holliman, a law-abiding governor. <br /> <br /> Since their surveillance, the murder and the rest of the film are Sharky and his new colleagues who are trying to solve this prestige case. <br /> <br /> Although this is Burt Reynolds' movie and they usually have humor, comedy is kept under control, as the film becomes as deadly as Dirty Harry. It was reported that Clint Eastwood was offered this movie. <br /> <br /> Look at some good things from fellow vice-president Bernie Casey and Brian Keith and Henry Silva, who is a Gassman's hugged brother that's not a bad film, a Dirty Harry and Laura blend. Why Laura? You have to see a Sharky machine for this answer.
