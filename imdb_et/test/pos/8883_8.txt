stars: Danny Devito, Billy Crystal, Anne Ramsey, Kim Griest, Kate Mulgrew, Oprah Winfrey and Rob Reiner. <br /> <br /> After college class teacher Larry (Crystal) wants his former wife to die and Owen (Devito) wants her mother (Ramsey) to be dead. When Larry points out that he wants his wife to die, Owen knows what to do on his behalf so that Larry can kill his mother. Devito is totally fun in this sense, as a brain-dead wannabe writer who has dreams of poisoning her mother and keeping scissors out of her head. He has a child-like role that makes him feel confused as a killer. Ramesy was nominated for the Academy Award because her excellent result was old Mrs. Elevator. With comedy, the film also has a heart. One scene between Devito and Crystal begins with a seemingly joke, but goes deeper, making me a little sad. Danny Devito led the film and did a good job of putting a dark tone in his direction. For every comedy fan I recommend it. <br /> <br /> My rating: B plus. 84 minutes. PG-13 for language, sexuality and violence.
