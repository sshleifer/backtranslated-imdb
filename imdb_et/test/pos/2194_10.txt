I can't overcome the quality of the score, the book, and the performances. This is the first production I've ever seen from Sweeney Todd so I don't have to compare it. But the effect is so strong, I can't imagine anything. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is music - take "Johanna" (Act II), during which Sweeney, Anthony and Johanna sing an interwoven vocal line that includes three song melodies. It's like Bach's chant in this sense - just a composition of masterpiece. And the underlying chord structure and speeches are so perfect - a little melancholy, a bit of satisfaction, a bit of a longing, all expressing these three singers' perspective. <br /> <br /> Then - - lyrics. Rims are so smart. Racking schemes sometimes seem random, but they are always at the end. (The DVD I watched is closed captions and are essential to dialogue and words.) Sondheim deserves only a literary prize for his poetry. <br /> <br /> Finally, performances. I can't imagine anyone better than George Hearn. Why haven't I heard him before? His singing alone is masterful, but his scope is simply amazing. Angela Lansbury surprised me completely. The song "by you and me by the sea" - who could do it better? His timing is flawless, the pitch is perfect, the winning of each score is counted; and the overlap of this achievement in music education is its delightful comic delivery. <br /> <br /> It's a dark story, but I found it sometimes sweet; and the voice for "Johann" continues to play with my head.
