The previous reviewer, Claudio Carvalho, gave much better details than I could. Most of the time I recall that it was just so beautiful, in every sense - emotionally, visually, edited - just proud. <br /> <br /> If you like movies that are wonderful to watch and also have emotional content, this beauty is appropriate, I think you are glad you have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of art. <br /> <br /> On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it about 8.75. The only reason I was out of 9 is that it is a mood. If you're in the mood for a truly artistic, very romantic movie, then it's 10. I think it's black-and-white, but none of us can have this mood all the time, so in general, 8.75.
