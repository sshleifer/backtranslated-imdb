(VERY slightly buggy) <br /> <br /> I have to start by saying that science literature hasn't usually impressed, so Pitch Black (2000) was a pleasant surprise. It was from the outset involved rhythm, intensity, and visual outbreaks that left me fascinated and glued to my seat. I'm very happy to say that this movie was the best (okay, at least * one of the best) science fiction I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Plot In short, it may seem simple - (space) ship accident allegedly abandoned on the planet, and Captain Caroline Fry (impressive Radha Mitchell) must lead the survivors' safety. At first, a cold bloody murderer, Riddick (Vin Diesel, who plays a role with a very credible margin), seems to be the group's biggest problem, but when Twilight begins to crawl, nightly creatures begin to wake up ... This leads to a desperate attempt to escape from bleeding predators, as we everyone thinks it doesn't bring a happy family picnic. <br /> <br /> It's not worth watching a movie. - After all, let's face it, if you remove it from the basics, it's not * it's * the original - the skill it speaks. The story flowed on, never left me awake (at least not much). Management was a fabulous job. It was a very visual, even beautiful film; The purple night view was a real coffee. Although "beautiful" may not be the right word to use; Yes, the pictures shown were candy to the eye, but they also added a lack of unspecified grotesque, frightenedness as if there was anything under the base. (Not to mention the fact that the monsters were really well done, they seemed realistic, which seems to be rare nowadays [maybe the people just can't effortlessly see them ...]) <br /> <br /> I not just did not enjoy the visual aspect of the film, but also the psychological aspect of the story. During the film, we see how characters are broken - some of them are falling, some are rising - but what was most interesting to me was developing Riddick's character. I liked changing her over the film. Further, the other thing I enjoyed a lot with Riddick was incredibly well and originally performed by UST (Unresolved Sexual Tension) between Fry and his "no" (you get what I mean when you see it). [Can't deny they have chemistry. Don't even try or I'm looking for you and listening to me listening to chopsticks until you shout * grin *] It was fresh. As Radha Mitchell once put it (modified quotation), "Pitch Black is really a sexy movie without sex," which makes it even more interesting. <br /> <br /> To sum up, I recommend this movie - even if you are not a fan of "space stories". The aisle was kept until the end and, importantly, we were (or at least) left out. If you can't bother thinking about psychology, subtext, and the like (as it's my bad habit), you'll still find Pitch Black very fun. Just hit your shoes and enjoy.
