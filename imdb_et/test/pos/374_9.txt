Indeed safer. Hitchcock is a perverse cinema all the time; but we all know his perversions are us too, so we forgive him. And we not only forgive him, but we praise his wise way to invite us to an unforgettable train ride. <br /> <br /> I saw Hitch in 1953, I admit a week before that, and I put both in the same category as his trademarks. These trademarks were in his genius, questioning and pulsating his artistic veins, which disrupted the viewer's psychological blood flow, leaving untreated blemishes, but instead a very subtle awareness of the ashame's perception. <br /> <br /> The pen is always more powerful than the sword, and Hitch firmly writes the most controversial issues with his wrist and held his hands firmly, he kept cameras that always reflected the blood flow of most people (most people), otherwise the comedy would not be tragic and most of the time. Making people laughing wouldn't be so complicated. <br /> <br /> Blending the dark elements of all "high society" with the rich psycho Bruno and the ambitious tennis player who wants to be a politician, Guy, this story is one Hitch is best designed and guided, inspiring many filmmakers, not just with his plot , but with complex images that provoke dark smiles and happy nightmares. <br /> <br /> Hardly perfect!
