Rabbit seasoning is one of three caricatures that have words in war and whether it's a rabbit season or a duck season, Bugs Bunny / Daffy Duck / Elmer Fudd. Love Bugs and Daffy always interfere with Daffy's "spokesman" as a victim of Elmer's shotgun, resulting in his beak always open. Then there is a rabbit crossbow that always gets Elmer in his love mode. Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese are always my favorites in the writer-director team category because these funny hunting trilogy films have laughed because I was a child. And at least two of them will end up with Daffy's exclamation for Bugs: "You are despicable!" It can't be better!
