Why take a perfectly original original drama based on a completely good novel and turn it into quasi music? And cast it down with actors who don't just have singing or dancing talents? Somewhat similar to "Showgirls" or the last two "Star Wars" movies, "Lost Horizon" is full of involuntary laughs. Who can forget that Sir John Gielgud smiles calmly in his Dali Lama dress, observing the interpretive dance for the Republican Party ("The Family")? <br /> <br /> Or Sally Kellerman loves George Kennedy by making his best Cher impression when he drops from one stone to another ("Every little thing you do")? And my favorite, Bobby Van, embodies the strength of the American education system ("Ask me an answer")? I can't wait for a DVD release, because hopefully it will also include Liv Ullmann's comments, who will finally explain what he thought when he gave his consent.
