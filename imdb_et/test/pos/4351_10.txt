I didn't know what to expect if I decided to look at this documentary. I knew it was in the former Vietnamese troops of Laos, who fled, but I didn't know much more. Actually, I didn't expect too much. Oh what a surprise! The story of this person's life is in itself very interesting, but what makes this film out of other biography-type documents is that Dieter himself speaks of most of the story. The dieter is very comfortable in front of the camera. His personality really looks like. He talks about his story about the life that grew in Germany during World War II, and about the difficulties. We are with her in this same small town where she describes her family, inspiration and struggles. We follow him in America and his way to fulfill his dream of being a pilot. Later, Dieter describes his story of kicking, escaping and surviving in the Laos jungle. We are with him in this very jungle when he describes and reinstates his imprisonment and the path of freedom in great detail. We see the same primitive houses, villagers, and forms of detention that he actually does, which have not changed for 30 years. We see the thick jungle, the mountain landscape and the rivers that Dieter faced during the escape. It helps us to understand his emotions, pain and difficulty. I liked the man, the story and the style. Work well done!
