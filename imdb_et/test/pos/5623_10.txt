Let's face it, many bad movies have been made all the time. For those who work with the film, you have probably spent a lot of time and effort on many of these plots less wonders. Sometimes, and this is my opinion, it's just a movie that is important to us. Talking about the story (no matter how simple and unrealistic). The collaborative process is also one of the main features that are unique to film and theater. To produce any caliber, you need different numbers of people, depending on its scope, to bring your story to life. However, the most interesting part of the American film is not the film that is being filmed. It is the filmmaker himself, the nature of his life, which requires our attention. None of them is the model of filmmakers we know and have worked for. But I argue that these are the archetypes of our small parts that are trying to be part of the cultural activity of independent filmmaking. (Let us be a very small part of us) These are people who live under the rocks of their lives and just tend to stick to the cinema's romance. This leads me to the next argument. American Movie captures the spirit of independent filmmaking. A bad story (nowadays) was about a digital film that has a sloppy effect and terrible performance because it is the best they can do with a few thousand dollar budget, not a multi-million dollar studio budget per day. This is the difference between low-end, low-end production and studio output. An independent filmmaker just wants to create a linear or even non-linear story to shoot as well as he can with the money he invests and the resources around him to see the final product on his end-use TV. Rigid individualism is realized in every art form. I find this film a great truth document for many filmmakers. And no, I'm not full. People, these people are fun. Their problems seem fun, their features are fun. The best line of the movie: "It's okay! That's okay! .. There's something to live! .. Jesus told me so!" Said a million times funny old man. The hat is at Tom Beach. Chicago Rules.
