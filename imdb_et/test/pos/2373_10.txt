I love these movies. Blood, revenge, lots of activities, very dark, cheese and more. But it doesn't give the genre you can expect. When I saw the Kite birds and Ichi killer before, I was fun to watch them, but why not? Dead or alive: The final is a decent anime and it's not hardcore and doesn't even expect nudity in this movie. At least add some more activities to your audience for entertainment. Even drama was not so good. Well, I don't want to spoil the film or the plot. But I felt dead or alive: the final is a bit nervous. So, without further action. I do not recommend this movie to everyone, but I recommend to people who love a decent and well-managed anime. <br /> <br /> Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine and University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne
