This series has a lot of beautiful materials for some of the most impressive underwater environments on this planet. Being amazing for five years would be less and less expected. I got the impression that some of the first episode scenes mentioned in the last episode, of course, are only small. David Attenborough is a narrator and comments are informative, leaving enough room for imagination and well positioned to give viewers plenty of time to reflect on breathtaking imagery. If you get the chance to try not to look at the translated version of this series. <br /> <br /> A definite must-see for anyone interested in the complexity of our blue continents and the best documentary on this topic ever.
