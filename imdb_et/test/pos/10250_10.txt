This film was a lot of laughter and real ground from the beginning to the end of my interest, which took place all over the cast. Glynn Turman (Preach Jackson) is a star of the picture who plays a smart guy who loves poetry and was a very sexy girl. Lawrence Hilton Jacobs (Cochise Morris) was Cooley H.S. and even won a scholarship to the famous college. In this picture, there are scenes where the Chicago Police Department is driving all these caves in Cadillac and visiting the Lincoln Park Zoo, which burns monkey manure. Music is outstanding and there is great photography around Chicago. Great movie, enjoy.
