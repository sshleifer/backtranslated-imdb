Irene Dunne is a beautiful, charming, extremely versatile and talented 5 or 6 actors in Israeli filmmaking. Over 21 - As in all his films, he lights up with the natural but glamorous presence of the screen. He is simultaneously an authentic and human, charismatic, inspirational model. This role is of crucial importance to Irene Dunne, full of sin and spirit, and little trouble. I love all his films, and this movie was a fantastic new discovery for me when TCM last night. I hope they will not wait for years to air again. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Charles Coburn is one of the greatest character actors in American film. True, he often depicts variations on the same subject, but I never talk about looking at the deaf with my soft heart. Here's her character for Irene Dunne's perfect foil, and Coburn is great at her. The conflicts in these films are absolutely fantastic. They will never forget. In addition, they represent the central conflict of the film depicted by Alexander Knox and the moral conflict of Irene Dunne's husband. <br /> <br /> I don't know Knox's work. He was recognizable, but it was all. Yet he owns Dunne and Coburn. It offers fine and nuances. His character is the noble motifs that are available to us with the Knox presentation, and which we have never held like a holy grail. He is noble but contradictory and doubts his ability to complete the OCS successfully. His communication with Dunne is always convincing. Dunne supports her without being syruped or martyred, and she responds in kind. Their scenes are very well done. <br /> <br /> The film itself is a fantastic snapshot and milieu that is not shown in other films. I do not remember one more film about my head, which still depicts America to fight against the Second World War, but whose vision ends and focuses on building a post-war world. Not an ordinary World War II movie! It is interesting in itself; it is also important for the plot and movie message. Unlike other commentators, I thought the climate call was fine, but not big. Knox did it very well, but it wasn't so "tightly" written when the assembly made me wait. I've heard better cinematic speeches on very similar topics. It served its purpose. <br /> <br /> For me, the greater value of the movie was the portrayal of Dunni and Knox's life, as it reflected a typical OCS experience. The community feeling of the spouses living on the Palmetto terrace seemed completely authentic - as Palmetto Terrace did, even though it was obviously a sound. Incredibly short meetings between spouses and their spouses. The rigors of OCS candidates studying complex and complex material. Runaway "Base Corps" - probably built quickly. Tired and worn out furnishings. Persistent and imminent short deadlines - return to the base, lessons, and further "posts" of trains. Tenants who run constantly in their predecessors and descendants in the base apartment when they moved in and out. Yes, I suspect that it was a glimpse of the real experience of World War II, dressed in some comedy but very affectionate. I loved it and I highly recommend it.
