Well ... What to say. <br /> <br /> I think I'll start with a confession. I've been crying 4 times in my life. once my dad died twice in the high school and at the end of this movie. This film addresses the real issues facing 6 school students, making them uncomfortably open to the whole world. I've never seen a film that would deal with both the emotional state of a human being and that. everything from incest to incontinence is covered here, and I doubt there are many people who are at least a few safe scenes. <br /> <br /> It starts with suicide. at 14:37. then, without knowing who died, the story begins to speak from the beginning. it follows the life of 6 school students up to 14:37. it is interchanged and handled by 6 teenage personal interviews to let you know everything about your life. their love, hate, dreams, desires, secrets, shame, false trust, suicide, corruption and arrogance. The overall result is a kind of "whodunn" that tries to detect the identity of suicide before it comes to the end of the movie. without breaking what I have to tell you. does not feel cheated at the end. it contains a very important lesson. <br /> <br /> And now a warning. this film is definitely not a weak heart. Many people walked halfway through the cinema when I saw it. Some of its content is terrible. Or maybe it is sometimes difficult to face reality with the cold hard truth. This is what high school has for many people. I'm sure most would agree.
