Putney Swope is a story of a black black man in the board of a large advertising agency, randomly voted chairman of the board when the business owner speaks, trying to figure out that he was probably quite excited. Of course, Putney takes on a new role in the heart and fires that are most in the agency, hires a new team (all black, except the symbolic white boy) and continues to pull out the most offensive and non-PC ads. for. Now it is a rather dirty team and has managed to get in the money somehow. I prefer a scene where potential advertisers get rid of the money from the bags and then they say they are coming out. And their ads will follow later or not. The story is good, but of course, nasty ads are highlighted here, especially the "Face Off" acne cream. It's a dated, but still fun movie and full of fun moments. Robert Downey Sr was at that time working for an advertising agency who made experimental ads, and I think it was his average finger on the agencies at Madison Avenue. Very good and pretty funny. 8 out of 10.
