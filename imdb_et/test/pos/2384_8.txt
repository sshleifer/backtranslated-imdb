cool down. enjoyable to watch. hope to see more from Carp Carpenter soon. I like positioning all references to New York. it was interesting how it all ends. the temporary factor was effective and working, though simple, was also effective in characterizing the characters. this movie has a number of clean little tricks that make it better. I think the supportive actor did his job with an excellent job. casting and directing this film seems to be seamless and the quality of shooting is quite impressive. the film is not without soft moments that gives it a pleasant balance.
