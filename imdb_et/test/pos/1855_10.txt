The movie you want to have is back to me. It is a story of inspiration and family love that turns to all ages. The story, though seemingly impossible, seeks divine intervention when a man loses his wife in a tragic accident and finds that love again is the woman's heart. David Duchovny and Minnie Driver give warm-hearted performances to the likes of people who meet at random. But the real story lies with those friends and family who love and support them during the trial. Carol O'Connor, as the grandmother of Minnie's leader, is authentic in every scene. Bonnie Hunt as a friend whose wit and encouragement emphasizes Minnie's sister is funny but warm in these places, especially James Belushi as her husband. The classic scene and writing make this story so enjoyable and again to see. Thank you for making a movie that shows families and friends as close, caring people who love each other through difficult times.
