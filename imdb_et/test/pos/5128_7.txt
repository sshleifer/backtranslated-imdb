It's a good family movie with some laughs. I wish it wouldn't have too much school stuff like a bully to fill this movie. It also seems a bit too easy to save the land from building. I mean, it just flowed too easily. This will make you aware of the wildlife. It was a nice way to introduce a country that was a fast runner but too slow for me. Too little and it reminded me of going back to school. Oh, the DVD is full of good, so don't miss. 7 movies from 10 out of 10 to 10 DVDs with extras worth watching. It is worth this time to see it!
