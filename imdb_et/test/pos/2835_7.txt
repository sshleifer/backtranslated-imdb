It is a western photographed by the creator of the "Rawhide" Charles Marquis Warren veteran. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is his main help. Its strong plot line can be said with a few sentences. Driving with a heavy nose, a cavalry officer, Captain Richard Lance, is hit by a massacre in the fortress after an Indian enemy leader. He demands that the man be returned to a trial sent to Tucson; his commander sends another person who tries to imprison him and the patrol is destroyed. This means that the driver has escaped and Lance must now lead the other patrol - and he chooses the men from whom the fortress can save the most, a company of troubles to protect the previously destroyed fortress and save the command from breaking the bottlenecks in this sector. Like Lance, the young Gregory Peck is pretty strong. Others in the big pains of this film, which really show the life of a cavalry outpost that looks like building a heterogeneous and quarrelsome army, include a war loan that is a powerful hard drinking sergeant, Neville Brand and Steve Brodie as troubles, Warner Anderson and Lon Chaney Jr. as psychological problems and Gig Young, Art Baker, Herbert Heyes as a spouse to Nana Bryant. Even Barbara Payton's interest in love can be a difficult one; Michael Ansara has been captured by warlord and Jeff Corey plays Fortu Scout. In this very well done western section there are really two big scenes - a long section of the fortress before the last patrol expulsion, and this long patrol is executed in Ft. Defiant itself. When that certainty has been, Peck will have his great speech, where, at the request of the men who match his orders, he will tell them why he took them. reading their shortcomings one by one; then they tell them why they think he sent his best friend, who died on his spot, to take his own language instead of indian - and he proves that he has wrongly won his lonely battle for intelligence and courage for the rest of the film. Franz Waxman's music is good, production features are admirable; an argument about what would happen when Lance happens to a warlord is true; other than this central character's insoluble error, this is the great west. it has been my favorite for fifty years.
