A sweet, entertaining story about young 17 1/2-year-old boys, controlled by a terrifying religious mother and retired father, and how she works with retired, eccentric and tragic actors. Well done, especially Julie Walters. Rupert Grint plays the role of teenage boys well, showing that his talent lasts longer than the Harry Potter movie series. Laura Linney plays her ruthlessly rigorous mother without redemption, so there's no room to please her. But the movie is a very entertaining film that has been well-designed by the British as they like to keep mothers and girls on the calendar.
