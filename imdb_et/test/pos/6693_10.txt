Life consists of endless possibilities; some known, other mysteries and remain there. And what are the major unknown areas for which knowledge has no established limits or parameters? Who says what exists or what is possible? The current issues, all raised and studied in a specific person's personal journey story, strange and dramatic odyssey that violates facts and logic, "K-PAX", directed by Iain Softley, and starring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges. Following an incident at New York Central Station, a man named Psychic Hospital (Spacey) is being transported to Man, where he is brought to the care of Dr. Mark Powell (Bridges), who tries to discover the truth about his patient claiming to be a distant planet from K-PAX. It is quickly becoming a challenge for Dr Powell, because Prot, with his calm, direct, impending way and inclination to produce (he eats bananas and all, and Red Delicious Apples are his favorites) is quite convincing. But this is Powell's work and his nature skeptical. However, Prot's claims remain intact and stand up to the most intense investigation and dr. Powell under the watchful eye of somebody with a mistake - Prot even tells him the exact date and time he leaves K. -PAX, a planned return that will allow Powell, but for a short time to sort everything out. And Powell just can't think of dealing with the nature of a real alien; and this is something he must quickly solve if he ever knows the truth. And he must know. After all, the truth is the only thing that makes it free in your mind. <br /> <br /> Softley has created and given a sensitive, thought-provoking film that challenges the Protector around the mystery of the viewer, forcing you to think about your ideas, which is actually possible. And if you certainly don't know Prot until you are finished, you will be able to identify with Powell by looking at the situation from his perspective and trying to solve the mystery with him. Softley creates a wonderful atmosphere and a real feeling to come across something that is truly unique when the story comes out and you begin to realize that Prot simply might be what he says. And in the context of this reality with which the film is destroyed, it is an appealing thing to try to surround your mind. How do you react when all the evidence contradicts the physical limitations we have set ourselves? Though the deep depth of humanity is at the heart of the film, which is evident not only in Protis but also in Dr. Powell. All this makes a very tempting and engaging drama. <br /> <br /> As we have been waiting, Kevin Spacey will deliver an excellent result as Prot, presenting his character from the inside, emotionally deep and physically convincing at the same time. It is a unique individual and Spacey brings him to life with caution and we can share those moments that are especially revealing, which increases the credibility of the nature and the credibility of the story. For this film to work, it is important that we believe who and what Prot is; we do and it does. Spacey just pulls it out perfectly. It is a memorable performance that develops a character that will stay with you for a long, long time. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges, meanwhile, appears equally with Spacey, dealing with dr. Powell. It is a fairly simple role and the challenge of Bridges was to take this very ordinary and ordinary character and make it unique on its own, which, unlike the nature of Prot, was not a small task. And again, for this movie to work, Bridgehead needed the event to rise. And with the extraordinary skill and perfect professional that he is, he succeeds without question. Bridges infuses Powell with sophisticated sophistication and gives it the job of making communication between Powell and Prot alive and at times intense. It is a demonstration of the best actors in two business activities that does what they do best by creating vibrant and inspiring dynamics. This is a great job for Bridges, who never tries to steal the focus of Protil, which raises the film's level to an even higher level. <br /> <br /> Supported by Mary McCormack (Rachel), Alfre Woodard (Dr Villers), Ajay Naidu (dr Naidiu), Vincent Laresca (Navarro), Kimberly Scott (Joyce), Conchata Ferrell (Betty) and Saul Williams (Ernie). An entertaining, emotionally engaging film "K-PAX" is about the possibilities of the thesis and exploring the ever-increasing complexities of the human situation. This is a film that requires an open mind and rewards those who can approach and embrace it under their own conditions. Finally, it realizes how real K-PAX is; and it will make you appreciate Proti's journey and how much we all share and share with those around us, people or foreigners. And it may just be thinking of your own journey - where you've been and where you go. And that's the magic of movies. I appreciate this one 10/10. <br /> <br />
