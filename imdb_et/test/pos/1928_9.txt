I accidentally happened to it. I was in my friends' house and had just started looking at it, so I sat down thinking that if I could play in the background, I'd shoot the wind. But after a few seconds I put this docu drama on, and we both spent the rest of the time fully and didn't say one to another. <br /> <br /> I never knew the first solo story of one of the world's yacht competitions, not to mention one man's tragic events against the contradictions that seemed to be his salvation for all his accidents, but in the end it will serve as an example. Without knowing this story, I looked at it with the same passion as I imagine those who read the competition at the time it actually took place, and being committed to what was going on and wishing for more information, hoping that a single amateur would go against that odds and beat pro, which makes the story shocking twists even more tragic, I felt I lived the story. <br /> <br /> The story is very carefully spoken and the interviewees have clearly had time to think about a tragedy that provides excellent knowledge, but also contradicts the archive material of interviews during the tragedy, as well as the recordings and photos of individual sailors. and the seafarers' thoughts and their consensus were excellent. <br /> <br /> I am shocked that this story is no longer known or has become a movie, but also grateful. Thanks to having this drama documentary to tell the story of those who knew this man, instead of adapting to some unwanted movie, and grateful that I got this pearl of the movie purely random. <br /> <br /> It must see whether you like a documentary or not.
