Three children are born during the solar eclipse and ten years later it has caused their growth without conscience. Due to the simultaneous approach of celebrating the tenth anniversary, they become cold and murderous cybercriminals. Nice girl, local servant Joyce Russel (Lori Lethin), is confronted with these little fears when most others fall for the behavior of their angels. <br /> <br /> Listening to movies like "Bad Seed" and "Village of the Fucking", this prerequisite for movies from evil children may not be completely original, but it is still quite disturbing. All three childrens - Elizabeth Hoy, Billy Jacoby and Andy Freeman - are convincingly convincing. Director Ed Hunt and his co-author Barry Pearson maintain an uncomfortable but convincing mood for the duration of the film; they go so far as to allow a little girl to enter the involuntary peep show with her older sister (future stand-up comediene and Julie Brown, whose striptease is real prominent). <br /> <br /> The name actors Susan Strasberg, as an icy teacher, and Jose Ferrer, who hardly has any time on the screen as a doctor, adds their presence to the proceedings, while KC Martel, one of the original "Amityville horror" youngsters , is very pleasing as a Joyces son. Other familiar faces such as Ellen Geer, B-film, male-man Michael Dudikoff, Cyril O'Reilly ("Porky's", "Damned Dance"), Joe Penny ("Jake and Fatman") and William Boyett ("The Hidden") ) is also visible. <br /> <br /> Touching older fears when children play the weapons they have discovered and locked into old refrigerators is a "bloody birthday" a little more than just an intermediate variation with children as antagonists. Arlon Obers' music scores support and support this movie more than some of his brothers without much backwardness (though this arrow through the eyeball works quite well). <br /> <br /> Happy, nasty and downhill, "Bloody Birthday" is worthy of curiosity. <br /> <br /> 7/10
