By the time he opened, the "gate of heaven" had, unfortunately, become a cultural phenomenon as a film. At a time when worrying about excessive budgets and the arrogance of directors grew, it was a convenient target because the last "auteur" was a far-reaching job to capture Hollywood. has given her criticism of the critics and the industry. As someone said at that time, no one started to jump on Warren Beatty for even more expensive and darker "reds" because Beatty was "one of us" while Michael Cimino hadn't achieved that status. But the "gate of heaven" was also influenced by the cultural change taking place at that time, the political movement to the right, and undoubtedly towards patriotism, and the consolidation of the western (and western) myth. A few years earlier, the demitologization of Cimino's borders seemed to be timely, fresh, and necessary correction. But by 1980, after Reagan's revolution, it was thought to be almost American. <br /> <br /> What is disgraceful because the film, which has been seen for several decades, is an exciting and thoughtful look at that particular time and place as a world where life was in Hobbes' words "disgusting, cruel and short." Kristofferson plays James Averill, a senior class in Eastern Europe, who, in search of adventure, becomes a sheriff in Wyoming, where he sees himself as an opponent and an invader against the attack of mercenaries hired by racial landowners, including Averill's best lifelong friend. In a more innocent time, hostile poor farmers would appear in Averill and his rag-tag "army"; but it is nothing more than a traditional western, and when the US cavalry joins the fight here, it is not on the "good boys" side. <br /> <br /> Like The Deer Hunter, Cimino's previous film "The Gate of Heaven" spends a lot of time building up the details of his leaders' life, giving the film an occasional peaceful pace, which nevertheless leads to an overwhelming conclusion. An excellent actor, a subtle musical result and a visual texture that believes it looks like "Old Western" through new eyes, is the "Gate of Heaven" film that rewards repetitive views. I just want the MGM to launch a new DVD with better transmission and Cimino comment. However, the current version is satisfactory enough for viewers to see what critics in the 1980s, which can be dazzled by the cultural subtypes of the film, ... ... "The Gate of Heaven" is a great film.
