I remember years ago when the BBC1 showed this movie in a very truncated form. I watched it a few years ago on the video and watched it again. The film is slow and slightly strange (mountain men look very strange) that the atmosphere was very effective. This is one of my favorite movies and I have no idea where to find the uncut version. Currently it is deleted everywhere (except in the US where it was accidentally placed in horror!). It's a shame that you can't see this movie because it was meant to be visible. The wrong move (the last movie produced by Stan Winston) owes much to Dawn. One of the best 80s movies and deserves a wider audience.
