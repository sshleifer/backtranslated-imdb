Walt Disney MICKEY MOUSE Cartoon. <br /> <br /> STEAMBOAT WILLIE, a naughty little rodent, ignores his pilots and scares his way into cinematography. <br /> <br /> On November 18, 1928, a young genius plagued the world's first successful copy with synchronous sound. Walt Disney or his ego for Mickey Mouse is not considered. The financial struggle would remain, but the world was their oyster bed, and Mickey could eventually become Chaplin's most recognizable cultural icon of the century. <br /> <br /> Like entertainment, the STEAMBOAT WILLIE is still fun to see where the work of the good animator Ub Iwerks and Mickey is showing to all the passions and indifference of a small child. He has to deal with a tyrannical captain (Pete, without peg-foot; he had appeared in Disney cartoons since February 1925), a striking parrot (after a few years it would be a duck) and a lovely little mouse called Minnie. These two rodents play music live on live bodies of goats, cats, goose, piglets and cows (the predecessor of Clarabelle) - everything happened comfortably on the steamer. More viewers and the pattern was determined for the following mice in the next few years. <br /> <br /> ********************** ******** <br /> <br /> Walt Disney (1901) -1966) has always been interested in pictures and drawings. As a Missouri Marceline boy, he sketched an animal for paper scraps; Later, when he was the head of the ambulance during World War I in France, he pulled cartoons on the sides of the vehicle. Back to Kansas City, Walt, the artist Ub Iwerks worked out a primitive animation studio that gave animated ads and small cartoons to local cinemas. Always an innovator, his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke real-time image placement in the multimedia universe. Business Reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 when Walt's older brother Roy became a leader and advisor to his lifelong business. When a distributor spread the lightly successful series of Oswald's Lucky Rabbit, Mickey Mouse's character remained in Walti's imagination, ensuring Disney's immortality. The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut on STEAMBOAT WILLIE (1928), which was a huge audience with the use of synchronized music. SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared, and Walt's growing team of marvelous talented animators quickly captured a new territory with full color, illusions of depth and radical progress in personality development, the scene where the Walt genius was second to none. Mickey's nervous, naughty behavior had hit millions of fans but soon joined them with other animated companions: temperamental Donald Duck, intellectually challenged with Goofy and energetic Pluto. All of this was in preparation for Walt's greatest dream - feature film length animated films. Over the next few decades, Walt was pleased by snow-white, Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi & Peter Pan's adventures against Doomsayer snowstorms. Walt never forgot that his fortunes began with a mouse or that childish message simplicity and a lot of hard work always cost.
