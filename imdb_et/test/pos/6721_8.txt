** and 1/2 star **** Lifeforce is one of the strangest films I've ever seen, so ridiculous, but at that time it's strange convincing and never a bit small. Regardless of whether it is caused by nudity, great violence and activity, everyone is entertaining for 2 hours in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Churchill's spacecraft has been sent to Halley Comet to discover something hiding in a giant rock coma. A small team led by Colonel Carlsen (Steve Railsback) has been sent to search for the area. Among them are hundreds of frozen bat creatures and three naked and seemingly unconscious humanoid beings inside strange crystal containers, two men and one female (Mathilda May). They decide to take all three back with them, resulting in a disaster. <br /> <br /> If the team doesn't respond from the team, the other team will be sent to find out what's going on. When they dock with Churchill, they find a team of scraps that are all recognized. Humanoids are still in perfect condition and they bring them back to London. <br /> <br /> After various attempts, scientists still don't know what these creatures really are. Then, one night, the compound security officer is forced to enter the room where the female has been kept. She touches her shoulder and she wakes up, stands and smiles in a seductive and evil way. She approaches her and starts kissing her when it turns out she's actually taking her vitality and sucking her whole energy (the effect is a bit cheesy). <br /> <br /> He escapes from the compound and starts to fall off. One more man, Colonel Caine (Peter Firth), is under his foot. Then men discover that there is a pattern in the life force process. The bodyguard's body wakes up in 2 hours and takes the doctor's vitality. It seems that every 2 hours this victim repeats the process. With the help of Churchill's only survivor, Carlsen, they try to track the girls before it's too late. <br /> <br /> Lifeforce is pretty good late night entertainment. It has all the elements you could look for in such a movie, nudity loads, blood / gore, and many special effects. This is definitely better than a similarly drawn film, Species, largely due to the more riveting finale. <br /> <br /> The performances range from decent to awful. Getting beyond the worst is just Steve Railsback, who crosses the end. Much better is Peter Firth, who comes through and convincingly, and boasts Mathilda May (he is as beautiful as French actors Sophie Marceau and Emmanuelle Seigner). May is practically all the role without wearing clothes, and there were reports that it was difficult during filming, so that the fact that it is able to go through every scene without fidgeting and uncomfortable watching is impressive. There are times when he can be quite creepy, just being seductive. Most of the movie works thanks to him. <br /> <br />
