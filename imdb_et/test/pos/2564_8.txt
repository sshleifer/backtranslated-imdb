Black Snake Moan is terrible. It is too rich, fantastically orchestrated, strange and cumbersome, unique and visionary. As Hustle & Flow continues, Brewer will paint his American southern portrait as an almost mythological land that could be expected of fantasy or ancient Greek epic. And yet so high that our movies hover, they are still rooted; deeper and darker soil is rooted. <br /> <br /> Like traditional fairy tales, Brewer paints his black portrait with Moan using extremes and exaggeration. Sharp and harsh traits, along with such extreme actions, constitute a chain-linking of a semi-cold white girl to attempt to redeem her, to exaggerate her, and to emphasize the metaphor in the same way as extreme visual techniques such as some characters in Color Pleasantville reinforced the metaphor of this fairytale film. But Brewer doesn't "start" his movie; in this film and also in Hustle & Flow, Brewer introduces a different fairy tale; dark, gothic, sex, prostitution and finally redemption. These themes go through film veins like blood and resonate and bloom in their dark, mortgages. <br /> <br /> But despite these harsh extreme conditions, Brewer treats his characters like humans and creates very well-executed, triple dimensions characterized by Lazarus and Raes, especially emphasizing their relationship with Lazer's friends at the pharmacy, Angela and Rae's mother. <br /> <br /> The actor is quite perfect everywhere. Feels that both Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson were born to play their roles. Their characterization is so intense and so strong; It is even more of a challenge for participants to keep their heads and craft realistic characters. And they're doing great. In particular, Samuel L. Jackson disappears from his character, which is the opposite of most of the previously played character. With films such as Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Shaft and others, she has designed her "ultimate bad ass". The Black Snake Moan Jackson plays an old, broken, defeated, and repute character that is quite different from what he used to do. And to be honest, it's just fantastic. But it is quite a surprise that Justin Timberlake's casting and more precisely the fact that he has adapted. Of course he doesn't have much time on the screen, but as Brewer did with Ludicrous in Hustle & Flow, he can actually act on Timberlake and do what he's going to do, and not come across as convincingly and irritably. > <br /> But for the movie it is so wonderful that Brewer creates the atmosphere. The southern places of the countryside make an advantage of creating a dark, dirty, gloomy, harsh and harsh texture for the whole film, which is mostly suited to the thematic and metaphorical aspects of the film. Brewer truly uses almost fantasy, using all sorts of elements, such as the cicadade's rising sound, when Rae gets her itch or when Lazarus plays her Black Snake Moan blues number on Rae. the world, undermined mythology in the southern rural areas. And it works so fantastic that Brewer's unique vision is. <br /> <br /> And Craig Brewer's movie can't be spoken without mentioning music. In Hustle & Flow, he used a sub-dirty, low-pitched, hip-hop music soundtrack to emphasize the atmosphere and vision. In this film, music works even better to fully polish and fully represent a unique atmosphere. It's a rural blues soundtrack, but it's the hardest, raw and toughest blues you've ever heard. And it just sounds absolutely fantastic. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie was a simple story of an old, broken, lonely, pious black blues singer who redeemed a young white woman who was sexually abused as a child and now suffers from nymphomania very much to write home. However, this film is not related to the plot, not even to the characters, but also to the film, no matter what. No, is this film a vision? and what a unique vision! It is about the atmosphere, mythology, the setting. It is anger, fear, salvation, and most importantly, blues. And it's all packed in unique, entertaining, stylized and impeccable tapes. Brewer has secured a seat on the list of the most promising drivers and, as a solid follow-up to Hustle & Flow, is definitely on my radar for future projects. <Br / It should also be mentioned that the film has one of the most fantastic and unique titles I've ever heard.
