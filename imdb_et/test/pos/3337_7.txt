Great entry into the RKO Saint series, which has a well-written original scenario, good camera work and transitions, good targeting for some twists, good editing to keep the flow constant and good action. George Sanders is smooth and witty. Jonathan Hale is just an inspector for Fernack. Paul Guilfoyle plays a cell phone that goes straight (and drinks milk) because he can't put pressure on him. He returns to the later series. The story begins with an ocean liner heading to the US where the Holy meets, but can't get in touch with Wendie Barrie. Eventually he goes against the Holy Graces, but at the end his heart ends. The inspector will help Fernack erase his name from the frame. Some roads are down the road. Good entertainment and above average movie. Look out.
