I can't call it a big movie, but it's fun. In my case, this film was when the film appeared, the same age as some movie tables. For me, I look back at this film for the memories of my camp years. Although some of the worship in this film, such as the camp director's staying in bed and his side, on the trees or on the lake, is a bit above the other parts of the upper part. When I went to the camp, the campers and advisers drew similar tricks, such as flying underwear to the flagpole, canoe battles and boys traveling in the girls' cabin. As I got older, I realized that the night raids on the girls' booth that I attended were carefully arranged by the advisors that we didn't find girls in embarrassing situations, but at a time when I thought it was real and fun. That's what the MEATBALLS (MB) is. <br /> <br /> MB not only delivers the beauty of the camp, but also the beauty of youth and neglect. MB gives an excellent example of pre-teens, teenagers and young adults living in their summer without worrying about other girls and girls. high school and college. The opening title of the song that goes "Are you ready for the summer? ... no more homework more books, no more teachers are dirty to look ..." describes exactly how school kids look at the summer. <br /> <br /> I personally liked the two campers Spaz and Fink. What boy, nerd or jock did not spend the whole camp to try some beautiful girls? Which guy didn't want other campers and advisors to accept it? Although these two characters are somewhat up, I am making sure that anyone who watches the film does not help but likes the two. These two characters are Charlie Brown's combination of PEANUTS and Jack Tripper & Larry Dallas from three companies. I would like to bet that most of the viewers will be happy even for Spazi with an egg-bearing competition and Fink when he tries to "win" in a stomach food competition. In the end, this film had ordinary children and advisers. There are no good models for advisers or campers who wore trendy clothes. It's fun just to kick back and watch this movie and remember when life was as fun as this movie.
