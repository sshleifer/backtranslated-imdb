The pace of the movie is a bit slow in some parts, but if you can tune your dirty speed and long default, this is a satisfying court-minded intrigue. The story of China's first emperor, his childhood and personal power. The film is a very atmospheric, extremely fashionable and polite ceremony and ritual that contradicts the sudden brutal violence. Filmed in a way that provokes shadows and cold spaces. Battle scenes are rare and short, focusing on the individual's struggle for what is right and whether the decisions justify the means. The Emperor's journey from an ideal peacekeeper to a ruthless tyrant strives to be subtle, but provides little background or convincing insight into the emperor's motivation, but his actions and goals do not change, but Gong Li's attitudes toward him change. The most interesting performances are Gong Li and title Assassin when they re-evaluate when to fight, when to withdraw, when to kill. The most expensive film ever made in China, the Emperor and the Assassin does not rely on hysterical emotions or big battles, but rather on a threatening threat and inevitability. Gong Li's fans are surprised to hear that it is as strangely beautiful as ever, giving underrated results.
