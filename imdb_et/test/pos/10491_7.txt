After the Civil War in America, President (Van Johnson) travels to Dallas and the corrupt officials and businessman who are hit by him and are interested in deploying a vice-president who can be extorted because of incriminating documents. Gunman (Guiliano Gemma) was convinced that his black friend was wrongly accused because the purpose of the murder was to discover the truth. Tonino Valeri led it as an exciting, flawed film, which is obviously an allegory of Kennedy's murder. The film may misrepresent black people working in plantations in Texas, but the film is enjoyable and offers an interesting interpretation - that Kennedy's death was due to coups that many Americans could not accept at that time. The murder of Oswald is being played here because the murdered black murderers are responsible men in the Fort Worth Prison. This film time is more melodramatic than Oswald's death with various transmitters before he passed the death scene. Nevertheless, it is certainly one of the most interesting and valuable western countries of spaghetti. Worth checking out!
