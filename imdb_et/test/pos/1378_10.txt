On many levels it is very good. In fact, given that it was a small budget British indie who was the first director of the feature film, who was largely funny, this is a great achievement. I don't know how much it costs. The £ 8,000 figure was publicly labeled, but you never know how reliable it is. The thing is that this film looks like it would cost a few million quids and it obviously cost a small part of it Great special effects, terrible production design, effective props and costumes, great photography, good acting and direction, impressive result and amazingly amazing the sound mixes. Even so, a lot of the script was great. The characters were clearly identified and everyone had something to do. It is a movie about ten men, all dressed in one place in one place, and it would be easy to be named, stupid workpieces, but they were ten characters - mostly through dialogue and how they responded to things. During the midst of a work in the middle, when the plot was developed, the script talked well and showed how it influenced the symbols. If the whole movie was similar to another, it would be stunning. <br /> <br /> Before the ship is blown up, twelve people make an individual escape or an "e-pod" that breaks off the ship. They are not much more than automatic metal coffins and poor rains are trapped, narrow and have no real idea of ​​where they are going - but that makes sense. I like e-pods - they are a great idea that is very well done and makes sense than a nice and spacious escape capsule. I also like how we are specifically told later that they are about to flee a ship-ship, but can almost put them on the planet in an emergency - because we are honest that these men were bloody happy that their ship was blown so close to the planet. This does not mean that I would not like the cargo ship to have 116 unused e-shops, and you have to think about how the prisoner will get to the e-pod - but he will. (And that's what happened to me: shouldn't the captain go aside from his ship and not be the first boy in it?) Anyway, e-pots all land on a fertile planet that has nothing but sand and rare vegetation - or at least on the sand of the planet, sparsely flora that may have icy waste and lush jungles elsewhere. Nah, this is the planet's sci-fi movie - that's exactly the same. We have to accept that all e-shops are within a few miles of each other, so that ten survivors are able to meet burning heaven in the sky to find one another. <br /> <br /> The captain, if a muscular mountain man who may be the right agent, can be a good career, decides that they should try to contact Captain Behan with whom they intend to meet. But they can't do it on the planet, they have to go to orbit. The engineer says that if they combine the power units of two e-shops, they can probably give one of them enough juice to lift themselves to the anti-gravity doodles high enough to blow up the air. This can be done automatically, but a pilot is needed to send the signal. The volunteer, voluntarily, in a voluntary but laudably reasonable movement, the engineer points out that placing the heaviest person in somewhat inevitably improved e-pots is ridiculous and that it must be the lightest member of the team. This is a child. I liked how he now points out that his name is David and the captain is going to use it, treat him with dignity and respect. It was good storytelling and good character.
