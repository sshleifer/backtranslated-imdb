I first saw Robin Hood: Men in Tights back in 1994 at the cinema. I went to see it because I always liked Robin Hood and I saw this movie trailer and thought it was fun. After seeing the movie, I have to say that it was even better than I thought. Not only is it very funny, but also a very well made film with beautiful sets and costumes and a very beautiful Hummie Mann score. The movie is also good, Cary Elwes is funny when Robin Hood and Tracey Ullman, Richard Lewis, Mark Blankfield, David Chapelle, Amy Yasbeck, Megan Cavanagh, Eric Allan Kramer, Matthew Porretta and Mel Brooks themselves are funny. But the best part of the movie is Roger Rees as Rottingham's evil Sheriff. He has the best scenes in the film and also the best dialogue ("The king is illegal to kill the wild pig is it" that denotes "It is illegal to kill wild boar wild boar"). words up and tells a sentence that no one understands. Robin Hood: Men in tights are one of the best Mel Brooks movies in my book and I can't say I'm laughing as much as that. It just laughs.
