Time makes extraordinary things. This is the ultimate judge. Time has given Married To The Mob an extra dose of freshness. There are no dead moments or cheap pictures. It's now more fun than ever. Michelle Pfeiffer creates a mafia widow that is so far from the caricature that she has ever done. True original creation that touches or implies a stereotype just to guide us through, but his Angela is quite unique. Legendary Dean Stockwell tells us the mafia commander is as threateningly real as he is. And Matthew Modine? So why did I think he had no chemistry with Pfeiffer? I was wrong. They are wonderful together. This time they remembered Barbara Stanwyck, Fred MacMurray, "Remember the Night". I'm writing this comment now to attract you to Jonathan Demme's pearl to visit or to look again.
