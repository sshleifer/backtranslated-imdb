It is a very inclusive series that is well cast and sensitive to portraits with great glory. We follow Michael Ealy as a secret FBI agent, Darwyn, who stepped into a terrorist cell led by Farik (Oder Fehr). The series is very well written and has enough land to sit at your seat to wait for what will happen next. <br /> <br /> Michael Ealy, in my definition, is one of the best actors I've seen a secret representative. A cold cold cold, but still a good person who is trying his best to keep his head on the very emotional roller-digger that the FBI has started him. Oder Fehr, on the other hand, comes out of a boy who can quite fit in any social scenario. Big and strong, but gray weight disappears when needed. Very authoritative and extremely clever. The way the two interact on the screen is nothing remarkable. <br /> <br /> How the story evolves and the degree of accuracy that the script offers makes the whole story extremely credible and very reliable for life. It is so big that you are left with insecure feelings, without knowing what could happen in real life. We read the terrorist every day and here we are given a good sneak peak to the underworld, most of which we know very little about. <br /> <br /> This is a series that will definitely be more, sitting on the edge of your seat, waiting for the next week's episode. This is a sure winner in my eyes and I have no problem with this series being my best ever.
