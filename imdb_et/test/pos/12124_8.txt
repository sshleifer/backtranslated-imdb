First of all, let me say that I think this is probably one of the ten most underrated films because it was released in 72 years. I loved this movie, it's a very urban, sharp, real Hollywood glamor. I know all the signs here, I love the blood that is just abundant here. Joe Pesci was pretty good here, but it seems to me that he was definitely the leading gentleman of Joe Cortes, now I don't know anything about him, but the boy can really act. I believe that this film is probably true, because you live in New Jersey, live near Philly, you are always here. I think if the film had a bigger budget and would say Robert denirot as a jerry boss, you would have a perfect movie, but hey, with whom I say that the film was so penetrated that it is already in my mind, with the middle streets. I want Hollywood to go back to this urbanized and sharp film production: it would serve them well. this film is a great drama with great actors in it. and I recommend it to anyone.
