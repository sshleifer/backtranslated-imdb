This is one of those films that will be better for every viewing. I watched it three times and registered at IMDb because I wanted to comment on it. Films about "food" have been made before, some are really good - such as some Japanese comedy that Asian cinema admirers still know. But it's really your league. His core is a Protestant Christian parable that symbolizes the ideal of kindness, but is far from dogmatic, but also deals with the "good" of everyone, regardless of our religious beliefs or their absence. Babette's party is a penetrating underestimation and accuracy, but it makes the film's message, if any, stronger, not at all weaker. If you can't attend the extraordinary physical gala dinner offered by Babette, you are still welcome to this soul party. Very recommended !!
