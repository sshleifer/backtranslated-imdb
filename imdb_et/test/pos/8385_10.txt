... "Inglorious", as our local theater decided to show its title on its tent, with a second word. It's a great cinema. <br /> <br /> I am not hesitant to recommend this movie to everyone except redundant. Let them never know what they are missing. <br /> <br /> I gave him ten stars because I had experience with Tarantino's earlier films. In any case, with the exception of Reservoir Dogs, they have improved through further viewing. <br /> <br /> So while I gave her ten stars, I did it reluctantly. It leaves me "up" to go. <br /> <br /> Yes, Christoph Waltz is the Nazis we all thought was the worst. He is a cultured, experienced, viable and most sadistic person, who can make a glass of milk, and who puts his cigarette sharply out of the groin, grinding it with whipped cream as he grinds his jug. <br /> <br /> To understand Tarantino movies, you only need a sense of dialogue, color and pace. Colors are as bright as needed and brighter if necessary. Open the scene on the French farm, they are silent and blind, but too big. Outside the bright sunshine, but in one room, everything in the bath is shaded and black. <br /> <br /> This is a great way to listen to Waltz as the "Jews" SS who captures his hosted French farmer to uncover what he can't reveal on many occasions, and he pulls him back into obedient lines of friendship and understanding. following. August Diehl, later acts as an important actor in the final plot. Diehl's Nazi Major, who has an ear for German accents, is almost as good as Waltz .... almost. <br /> <br /> Movie classes learn a lot about this movie. They should look carefully at the great pace. Tarantino knows how long the scene has to be pulled out, to skip the Hitchcock way, then at the breakpoint, reaching a sharp resolution. <br /> <br /> For color, look for the ultimate picture of a French theater where his secret Jewish owner is surprised by the Nazi leadership's top. <br /> <br /> We see him played by Melanie Laurent, waiting for the hated German dignataries who arrive at the film's last Deutsch movie masterpiece, a propaganda piece about a German hero and his dubious achievements. <br /> <br /> Laurent is framed on a balcony that is reflected in the glass mirrors of the magnificent theater, its red lips and the low-cut dress. reflects the intensity of its guest design everywhere. This is one movie that would be worth the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Many such pictures, more subtle dialogues and distances have been successful. <br /> <br /> In short, look at it. I'm sure you'll see it over and over again.
