This movie is perfectly tailored to the screen and extremely loyal to Mary Webb's press, a true masterpiece. In addition to the exceptionally talented rise, Janet Mcteer as a leader and one or two established players, the film mostly used little known names. But drama was even more convincing. The social and personal tension is almost tangible and I felt that the cast would have reacted to one another as if they had done in real life. I saw one commentator asked if Janet McTeer really had a rabbit-lips testimony of how good her character was. I saw it on the television when it was first shown, it was taped, but later the tape lost. But that will be clear as nothing in my mind. If you have any affection for the social period, it must be absolute.
