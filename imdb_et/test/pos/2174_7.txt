First of all, let me admit that I haven't read this particular Balzac novel, so maybe I will direct my horrors unfairly to the director and the editor. However, my experience with Balzac in other stories is that he writes as a realist, not as an obscurantist. This is definitely a film that is worth your while, but one will end up being confused at the end. Has the Colonel been a scam used by a lawyer for his own purposes (or for himself); or the Colonel was not a scam, but was used by a lawyer; or did the lawyer really try to earn a fair colonel? In my opinion, the director and / or the editor knowingly conceal these issues, which does not seem to be realistic for Balzac. At the same time, the film makes the character of the excellent work, if not their motives, and casting and production are great. This opening battlefield scene is bound to haunt dreams. It is still marvelous that today's filmmakers have the general certainty that preference will be given above all to ambiguity. Were the problems and motives of all these characters not complicated enough for Yves Angelo?
