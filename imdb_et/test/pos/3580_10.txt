An amazing look at the ocean and its life. <br /> <br /> Good: <br /> <br /> The camera's work was completely phenomenal. Every shot is done beautifully. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see all the different animals I never imagined. <br /> <br /> David Attenborough has the perfect narrator voice. No one could have done anything better. <br /> <br /> Bad: <br /> <br /> One or two different times was a sign that Earth was 1 million years old (I hold a different belief). <br /> <br /> Generally, TV shows can be enjoyed. I recommend buying it. 10/10 stars.
