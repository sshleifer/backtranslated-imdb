I saw it in the screener of the movie and the best movie I've seen. I love it!!!! James Franco is so hot and he and Sienna Miller make the perfect pair. I don't want to give up what's happening, but they're playing a couple of newborns who go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon, and doing pretty pretty wild things. I can't even say what it reminded me, but look at it! I cried so hard, but I really loved it and I want to see it again as soon as it comes out! My friends also called. I hope it will come out soon - does anyone know when? I'd really go see it when I was you
