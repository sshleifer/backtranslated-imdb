Challen Cates does an excellent job of representing a controversial bride torn between their professionally anticipated challenges, memories of the freedom she thought she was in college (inspired by a famous author), and she does not really love the security of her ongoing marriage with a man. This film is definitely worth seeing --- as predictable as it is, inspirational, and Challen Cates and Malcolm Jamaal Warner are real chemistry.
