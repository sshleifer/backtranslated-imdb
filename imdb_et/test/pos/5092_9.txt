30 years after the original film, "Goodbye, Mr Chips" was made as music. Peter O'Toole and Petula Clarke showed the beloved school teacher Chippington in admiration, which his beloved wife calls Chips. <br /> <br /> O'Toole was great here and got another Oscar nomination. You have to think about what Peter O'Toole has to do to win the Oscar. He has lost the lost prize 8 times. You should also be surprised that in 1969 he lost to "True Grit" by John Wayne, which really testified to Mr Wayne's long career and popularity. This year, Richard Burton's big appearances, "the thousands of days of Anne", as well as Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight celebrated "Midnight Cowboy". <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, Petula Clarke was Mrs Chippington. But because it was musical, the beautiful voice came out well and he did a nice thing. <br /> <br /> Who can forget about the scene when Chips continues in class despite the news that his beloved has been killed in bombing. He never had to tell him what great news he was waiting for. <br /> <br /> Beautiful cinema and music only increased the truly memorable experience.
