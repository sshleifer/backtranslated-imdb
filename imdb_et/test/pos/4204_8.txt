I didn't expect much from this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it and found it to be the most remarkable. This is remarkable mainly because of the courage and talent of John Garfield. He has to run and reach the sticks with Gloria Dickson and Dead End Kids. Here is an opportunity to redeem, but will the past come to him again? Garfield was an actor before her peers. Before the term "method" was even created and before Brando ever "Stella!" he brings "natural" to the screen. Its reputation for quality and amazing acting talent dominate this production. It is also interesting that his role here as a boxer is the shades of this "Golden Boy" role he desperately wanted to wear on the screen. Garfield looks at the type and goes to the boxer distance, proving its priceless value. <br /> <br /> Ann Sheridan is at the beginning of a small role as Jack's trampy girl Goldie. I've never thought much about Sheridan, but I liked it here. He plays well out of Garfield. Dickson's performance is a bit tired and he doesn't share good chemistry with Garfield. Dead End Kids is here and Garfield looks like their natural idol (even more than Cagney). Claude Rains has failed, and he sees the role in many scenes uncomfortable. Strangely, he was always such a trusted actor. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to note that director Busby Berkeley, who is known for his early musical dancing girls and kaleidoscope images, directs a different genre here. It maintains an amazing atmosphere all over the place. <br /> <br /> A very good movie that deserves more attention 8/10.
