Cooley High is considered one of the best time films. It certainly reminds me of the day my youngsters grew up in the cities of Cleveland and Chicago in the early, mid-and late 1960s. What happened to Brenda and Pooter? Someone has to follow these two. Brenda for her beauty and Pooter with her innocent spirit. They both deserve recognition even 31 years after the debut of this film. I think many fans of this movie would like to know what happened to them as well as others who acted in this fun movie. I think this movie must be entered in some FAME MOVIE HALL. The whole movie was great. My opinion is "Cooley High" to turn back the hands of time, these were fun years.
