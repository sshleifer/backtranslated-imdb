This is, in my opinion, the masterpiece of Clive Barker. The film has a great story and some amazing make-up and effects. One thing I would like to do is follow. The film was created for the next, and with the advanced technology, another film can be incredible. David Cronenberg must appear with both Craig Sheffer and his successor. But this particular film was a great original, creative and entertaining idea, and I can watch it over and over again. Cronenberg was perfect in this film and Sheffer added an interesting spice to the film.
