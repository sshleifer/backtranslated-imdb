I used the summary of The German Scream, but it was already taken at lol. It takes the anatomy nicely. If you are not a stranger to reading subtitles, the anatomy will fit exactly with the Scream / Urban Legend package. It is a serving horror that is set in a medical school where students go missing, then turn to a test laboratory for dissection. Cue is one happy student who is studying herself and discovering a gigantic conspiracy. <br /> <br /> When you look at the original German movie (I can't comment on dub after seeing English), the anatomy is sharply written and cleverly drawn so that tensions never let. Compared to American counterparts, the mystery is much faster, which means that instead of being finalized, anatomy develops a slasher-come-body horror movie into a smart and thrilling thriller during this run. It's a thrilling journey from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Hats for those involved. Franka Potente proves once again that she is an intelligent, intelligent actor who can carry on. His central performance as Paula is a great base for making a movie. Spooky faculty and their teachers are equally good pets, really predicting the presence all the time. <br /> <br /> It's also amazing that the movie doesn't drag a lot. Speed ​​is fast and potty, very similar to the earlier Urban Legend, which means there's always something that keeps your attention high. If there is one downside, it may be that some find Anatomy too harsh for them, but if you continue to graphically dissect sequences toward the first half, then the last half will be worth the thrill of the thrillers. I recommend anatomy to anyone who enjoys good teen-horror but is a bit confused with American things.
