I watched the fantabulosa! because in recent years Michael Sheen has become one of my favorite actresses, and if you haven't shamed her before, and secondly, get her hands on a copy of Heartlands or Dirty Filthy Love. This production was not disappointed - Michael Sheen made himself almost magically into Kenneth Williams and gave a performance that was so tragically touching as skillful. Nothing to take away from other shows, but like Kenneth, Michael really stole the show. I don't know how he does it, but every performance I've seen seems to appear to be a metamorphosis until his character is truly, completely believable, and no matter how hard I try, I can't injure him . Must Get My Way, Enjoy!
