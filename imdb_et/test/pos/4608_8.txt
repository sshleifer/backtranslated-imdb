Universal studios. The name captivates so many memories of the terrible fans of beautiful matte paintings ... er ... landscapes, faded lands, full moon, scary wolves, taverns and torches that use mobiles. Yet, it is rather strange looking back at these films, as the little era that produced the true classics lasted. In the 1930s it was masterpieces, but they were mostly from the same directors and many of their films are mostly of historical interest today. In the 40's, more fun-filled movies were made when he did high art, and most fans agree that the classic era of Gothic horror films ended in 1945 with the House of Dracula, worshiping Abbott & Costello's comedies and officially dying 50 and the era of the atom. <br /> <br /> So it is strange that one of the best Goths of the world has been made in the 50s! This alone makes the film strange because the costumes dramas were the way out everywhere. It may not be comparable to the all-time classic, such as James Whale movies and The Wolfman, but in the case of the devil, all these fun elements of these films condense to a delicious treat! Get ready for pure entertainment! As different social partners have changed, the film also revives violence that would not have previously been allowed; there is no blood, but we see signs that are directly caught and even a burning flashlight on the face. <br /> <br /> The film may not really be a horror movie, but it's sure it has an atmosphere, a look and a feeling! It starts at night with dead winds (and wolves), because two men close the graves of two seemingly dead young lovers, but wait! One of them is not dead, but he can't move! He is trapped, but talks quietly in his mind, unable to communicate! What is his story? Now that you start a horror movie .... <br /> <br /> The English businessman Sir Ronald Burton (Richard Greene giving his best performances) is Richard Beckett's pseudonym to investigate the disappearance of his friends who disappeared with one eye from the Austrian Count Von Bruno Castle (did Sacha Baron Cohen see it?). It seems many years ago that Von Bruno, the god of the natives of Africa, was stealing ivory, the men of Burton, and the natives scattered him. He now lives for revenge. <br /> <br /> The film has all the clichés, the castle of Jonathan Harker, a cozy village inn, a killer of deaths, and a multitude of servants (Lon Chaney Jr.). The scenes of the torture campaign are really tense, including a panel on the floor that activates a cave door (which later generates brilliant holiday information), a hunting tradition that includes an imported panther (!!! ??) and even an alligator! And then there is a fake death in the Roman and Juliet style leading to the film's prologue ... <br /> <br /> The plot is a cliché and the world view is black and white. But it's still incredibly fun because director Nathan Juran makes all the scenes in the atmosphere and looks fresh and new. There are also several plot holes. Why is Ronald trying to leave the castle so early? And he never solves what happened to his friends, though it is obvious, but he doesn't know when he gives up, and he seemed so sure earlier. Weird. <br /> <br /> All actors are great. Although Richard Greene is a rude classmate, Burton makes Burton one of the most pleasing protagonists I've ever seen in a horror film. Rita Corday is great as a "peasant woman" of the county, who gets Burton's love for her, she can have a stereotypical love of all the heroes of this era, but her portrayal of a long-suffering woman with an unbelievable marriage with a sadistic monster is very convincing, she also shows the suspicious and few of this age Heroes, even seeing Burton's forced attempt to silence him (and the paw necklace, though just analyzing it as an important hint) as an attempt to rape, but he never seems disgusted in his paranoia. Even if he is unable to feel Von Brunot as truly stranger and otherwise (he is a horror film for the film), Stephen McNally gives a truly cool sadistic nobility. When he discovers his burnt eye and laughs manically, it is really scary. Lon Chaney Jr is also great because he is a muted dwarf Gargon. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the best result is Boris Karloff as a mysterious doctor Dr. Meissen. At first he has little time, but he steals every scene he has. This is a performance that is so horrible, sad, mysterious and ultimately heroic. When he writes maliciously when he uses flames on one of the Bruno heaps, spies on our hero and speaks in this famous "You know I'm not good" voice only Karloff could do, you don't know if he's a hero or a villain, always breaking. And while he acts as the main agent of our hero's escape, he still shows human weakness, such as greed and fear for his life, even poisoning the cold blood for Burton before he even agrees with Burton. His plan to help our hero and heroine to escape also puts them directly in Von Bruno's clutches when he organizes an astonishingly sadistic (as incredibly faulty) death for those who had to inspire similar scenes in the Corman Store. It may not have a lot of screen time, but it is easily one of Boris's best performances. <br /> <br /> Although the ending may seem steep and anti-climatic, half of this fun spot and there has been a lot of excitement. Kick back and relive days when heroes were heroes and villains were villains. It's not a masterpiece, but it's the best.
