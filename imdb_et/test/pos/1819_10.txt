This pearl saves the life of the 80s perfectly. As a '83 boy <br /> <br /> himself, I have to say that Valley Girl (with Fast Times <br /> <br /> Ridgemont High) is facing a teen sex movie class > genre. Characters are exact representatives of the era; <br /> <br /> The coats of mall chicks, pseudo punk rebel, preppy jocks are all <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> I've seen it ten times already. The music in the movie was top <br /> <br />. Unfortunately, these stories were never as popular in their era as those played by arena lovers such as Journey, Styx or <br /> <br /> Loverboy. Before the soundtrack existed, I was looking for items from Josie Cotton, Sparks, Sparks, and Stickers (80s!). Plimsouls and Modern English. <Br /> <br /> This film deserves respect. It's not just a good 80's teen swing. This is a great movie <br /> <br />. Period.
