The Beatles had just done "Magical Mystery". The general felt that performance, peace and drugs went naturally. In LA there was a subculture of the film that knew something up. Nicholson was in many of these gangs. do it. "The Manuscript of Saragossa" is important. It's another. <br /> <br /> Jack writes. He plays a circular narrative, self-analysis, film reference, self-expression, pain of creation, on the edge of a secure kiddiepop. You have to see it if you only know something about Jack. <br /> <br /> Certain participants are digging themselves. This is the usual technique. Some dig deeply, but after a while they get bored because they are incredibly low. There are not enough things to maintain a career there. Think of DeNiro and Hackman. <br /> <br /> Others are quite interesting people who look more interesting over time. When they dig into the frame, they put the trench back because of the pain. Think about Sean Penn and Jack. At the bottom of Jack's barrel, at the end of which he spins, where each character is based on this experimental, risky writer / filmmaker. It's bad because it took risks. See if the director Annette wipes the tear. This is the loving horse of Brando that I heard from Marlon laughing. This is one of the richest moments in Hollywood film history. <br /> <br /> There is another reason to look at it. The music film has a strong root in dance. Movie revolution often depends on music. Whole cultures are thus wiped out. <br /> <br /> An unknown giant who invented how billions are now dancing is Toni Basil. He was as influential in popcoreography as Beatles music. He was already at his career when he was invited to work. But this is one of his earliest screen displays. You see her work all over and she's in the pretty cool Daddy's Girl segment, over one of Nilsson's better songs. (Followed by Frank Zappa.) McCartney refers to this scene in his special years of WayVee. <br /> <br /> The third reason to watch is on the movie early (about 6 1/2 minutes): a character called "Lady Pleasure" kisses every monkey with a longer continuous image and then leaves. He is credited as I.J. Jefferson, but is really Mimi Manchu, Nicholson's lover and LSD partner. Red hair, psychedelic behavior. Cute. This scene tells everyone how Jack feels about boys. <br /> <br /> Tedi Rating - 3 of 3: Worth checking out.
