David Tennant and Sarah Parish's great actors were tears for me because many scenes were so familiar to me. In 1977, my husband suffered from subaracetal haemorrhage and demanded a major surgery involving lifting the brain and closing the leak. Like Tricia, I was na√Øve to wait for her to return to her former self. After more than 25 years of loving and caring, he gave up without warning, and lived with the woman he barely knew. He then asked, and I'm going to divorce now. I hope that the program helped people understand what to do with brain damage.
