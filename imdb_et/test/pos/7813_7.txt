I found it to be an undervalued, quietly acting Spaghetti Western (also known as DEAD OR ALIVE). Despite modest powers (except for the multipurpose co-author / producer Albert Band, the only remarkable team member is the composer Carlo Rustichelli), the film clearly has three American alphabets (the new comer Alex Cord is an obscure anti-hero), while veterans Arthur Kennedy and Robert Ryan are in the process a mythical quality), as well as a gunfighter against an abnormal plot of land (which includes a broken main character, an amnesty that covers the city's strategic cleansing, and whose laws are ultimately final). <br /> <br /> Are there many difficult scenes? the movie is limited by the amazing climax where the star trio is confined within a relaxing lounge? plus a couple of shameful moments that are something of the western brand of Spaghetti: in the middle of the street, Cord sees a hidden weapon mail that is reflected in a whiskey bottle; A man who helps Cord escape is immersed several times in the oil pool. Nicoletta Machiavelli also makes a nice impression as a village girl with whom Cord plays; supportive cast is then familiar with familiar (if mostly anonymous) faces? all these were essentially genre competitions. <br /> <br /> I didn't know that the MGM / UA R1 DVD dubbed the movie in English was cut: I was deceived by the wrong running time on the back cover; the movie was only 99 minutes long and not 118? probably the killing character is killed in a longer Italian language!
