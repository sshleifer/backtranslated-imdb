I just watched a movie tonight and found it great. It has no special effects for your mind, and it's not violent or bloody, neither terrorist nor alien, but it's great. It's just nice, lovely, and it brought me a whole lot of time, a much simpler time, where people could walk their time down the street and watch the ocean. I think it was beautiful and I recommend it. Nick had a great character and his friendship with Harry was one of the most important films. Everyone has the right to their own opinion, but I believe that everyone should follow it, mostly when they feel dropped or if they want to share something nice with their friends.
