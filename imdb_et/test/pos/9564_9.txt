"Best In Show" tracks stories from some human competitors when they prepare for one of the biggest dog shows on the calendar. Any amateur psychologist would say that unconditional love and obsession with a pet is a sign that someone is missing in life, and that every character fills in the clich√© in some way. There is a former high school hottie who is now married to a geeky man, a childless, labeled yuppie-pair, a lonely rider, a young woman of a wealthy old encoder (with her short-haired dog trainer) and a gay couple. this movie is so funny, this is how it depicts these stereotypes with the utmost credibility - in many cases it is almost cordial. Any ridiculous thing one character does or says - with his dog as an innocent observer - seems like the behavior you would see at the show. <br /> <br /> The biggest laughs come from the American-style sportsman commentary team, which compares moments in dog show with baseball and his English academic, foil. <br /> <br /> The blonde woman meets an amazing number of men from her past, is always good to smile, as well as the demented behavior of the yuppie-pairs as the pressure builds, while their hounders remain completely uneven. <br /> <br /> Well worth watching - even if the cats are more in your bag.
