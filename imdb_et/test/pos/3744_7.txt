Successful surgeon dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere) has left his wife, his son (unauthorized James Franco) does not respect him and loses the patient he is working on. Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and she discovers that her husband has been cheating on her. They both have to go. At the same time, she looks at the beautiful oceanfront inn in Rodan. They're alone. You can find out pretty much. <br /> <br /> This is what we call a movie or a female film. It is beautifully fascinated by romantic content and many quiet scenes. There is tragedy, romance, more tragedy and an uplifting end (sort of). Gere and Lane's great action helps to hide the fact that this movie is not really much. Each plot bit is predictable. In some events I rolled a lot of eyes. It's too short too - I didn't believe in the romance between Gere and Lane. When it goes out and moves very fast. The movie still works. The house itself is absolutely proud and I was finally tears with most audiences. So it's a predictable but wonderful film with some wonderful actors. It does not deserve all the criticism it receives. I'll give her 7.
