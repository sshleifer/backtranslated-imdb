Having seen other Bollywood cinemas with Salman Khan, I can say that this is my favorite. Songs are all pretty fun, especially "O Priya O Priya", which seems to be a nice mix of Beatles, Indian music, and a little Prince (dare to say that). Love stories are a little more plausible than saying, Chal Mere Bhai. Occasionally, Premi's use of alcohol is worrying at times, because it doesn't seem to me to be worth it, but Khan has played it well - although his voice gets drunk when he is drinking.
