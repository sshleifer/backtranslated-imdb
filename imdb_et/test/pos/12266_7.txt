Important viewing for anyone watching TV news, because it can help a little more skeptically or even cynically. As a reminder to the personal note, I took a few years back on the course of interviewing the TV - what to do, what not to do. Course teachers impressed us that TV news was "show-biz". This film has been strengthened by this depressing view, which is probably more valid today than it was when it was made. Do not forget that the honesty of journalists, which counts, is a good look and a beautiful smile. And make sure you don't bite the camera. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the three main characters is the central part, each with its own ambitions, abilities and beliefs. Brooks takes these differences and puts them into the changing settings of the TV news studio and adds more than one love interest to the mix. The result is a complicated but somewhat long-lasting idea of ​​how we can compromise on a daily basis to fulfill our ambitions and take others with us. It is always entertaining, although the last scene was perhaps unnecessary given everything that had gone before.
