subtle !! in simple words ... both Aparna Sen and Konkona Sen understand each other quite well or maybe they are both too good. It may be his best actor as the actor and Aparna's best leader. Yes, maybe better than Mr. and Mrs. Iyer. Konkona plays the role of schizophrenia. Shabana Azmi plays the role of Anjali, the older sister of Mith (Konkona Sen). Shabana Azmi made the best of Anjali's character because she had to play a strong, responsible and arrogant role for her older sister, who was entirely responsible for her family. Aparna Sen has adorned Anjali's character, a strong woman who had to sacrifice her personal life, love for her family. <br /> <br /> Mith's behavior was not at all minor because it can be expected from most of India's roles in this role as many studies have done to understand the role of schizophrenia in Mith. If sometimes Mithi is a normal, sweet college going girl, she also scares you when she is shown sick .. so the parties are beautifully appreciated and played .. believe me, it reminds you sometimes girl exorcist .. it's scary though .. Generally. Aparna Sen, Konkona Sen and Shabana Azm.
