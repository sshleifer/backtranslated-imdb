This film is not only the last piece of trilogy, but also the best and one of the best films of the 90s. There is hardly any other film that wisely and consequently requires humanity and respect for every human being. <br /> <br /> Valentine (Irene Jacob) lives in Geneva, where she works as a model. Although he has a boy, he seems rather lonely. One night he has an accident and injured dog and takes him to his owner, a retired jugdie (Jean-Louis Trintignant) who is cynical and spies with his neighbors. He shouldn't go and they will meet again. Two lonely souls meet each other and become friends and develop deep love for one another. <br /> <br /> The story itself is too complicated to say it completely, there is another connection between the young man, who represents both the judge and the true love of Valentines, and their relationship is more than just friendship. br /> <br /> Actors are wonderful, Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant develop deep and authentic friendship. Topics are endless validity, brotherhood, not only in communicating with one another, but also in respecting the right to privacy. It seems alarming that we are losing this right more and more, which makes such films even more important than in 1994. <br /> <br /> Red is one of the strongest colors that represents internal instability, love, anger and passion. Used here as the second main character, it brings the unbalanced depth of the film. Masterpiece!
