It took me years to finally catch the pearl of the movie and it was worth it. In almost all of his films, Clint always plays a hero. Be it a hero, a hero or a hero hero. In this movie he is a pure villain and he plays it well. <br /> <br /> As a wounded union soldier, he brings students and teachers to the Confederate Girls' School for healing. Soon after he starts to seduce women regardless of their age and some are quite young. He also plays his jealousy and strikes them against each other. Finally, you are never so happy that Clint dies terribly. <br /> <br /> This makes this movie a pearl. Clint has never made any other such film and after that, she wanted to see the movie. He plays a villainous role so well that it makes you wonder why he didn't make such movies anymore. It also explains why the movie is not very often seen. Most people don't want Clint to be seen as a snare, and Dirty Harry will be released shortly after the movie that has become a hidden gem. If you are a Clint Eastwood fan, you owe it to watch this movie. You may not like what you see, but you won't forget it soon.
