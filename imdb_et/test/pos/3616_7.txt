After a somewhat slow start, I thought that the film about the occupation of the Italian island during World War II was quite pleasant for a few hours, mainly from two perspectives. <br /> <br /> The Triangle of Love is interesting and it seems plausible to me because I know it happened in different positions. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek girl who took part in Christian Bale. I had questions about the depth of my love from the beginning, but their future was interrupted when Italy invaded Greece, and Mandras went to fight. After German intervention, Greece is conquered and Pelagia Island lives during the Italian occupation, during which Pelagia meets and falls in love with Captain Corelli (Nicholas Cage). It was, of course, a dilemma for many young women in occupied countries. When they knew their invaders, they began to see them not as enemies but as real and sometimes in love - often to their neighbors. I just finished an interesting book about the occupation of the British Channel Islands in Germany, where it was a big problem. When Mandras returns to the island, Pelagia is torn between them. <br /> <br /> Another background issue is the Italian occupation, which I thought was quite realistic. First, it was the contempt with which the island was treated with its Italian occupiers. Greece won Italy (quite true from a historical perspective) and the Germans really conquered. Refusing to give a city to Italy and not asking a German officer to surrender it struck me as something that could have happened well (and was really funny. I loved this line, "we would rather give it to the German dog than your Italians.") Italy the portrayal of the forces also hit me. The Italian army had never fallen in love with its German ally and never won them with enthusiasm. Although Hitler and Mussolini were close friends, their soldiers tended to consider each other to be bad. Here the Italians are more interested in singing than fighting (which the German troops on the island just don't understand) and are ecstatic when Italy makes peace and leaves the war - until they find it can force the Germans. It was all well done, I thought. <br /> <br /> It ends with a bit too predictable finish but still deserves praise. <br /> <br /> 7/10
