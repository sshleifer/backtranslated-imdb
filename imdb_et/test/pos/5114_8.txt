It's a very good flick with awesome humor. As we know, Jim Verney was very good at facial expressions and shows it a lot in this movie. This is definitely the best of Ernest's films. I would definitely recommend it to every Ernest fan. I find that I have a good taste of movies and I'm sure someone will enjoy this movie. In the film, (Ernest) plays 2 roles, a bad guy and a good man and plays them pretty well. I really enjoy the exorbitant type of humor, where things just seem impossible, for example, in the movies of naked weapons, and there are many in this movie. I bought this movie right after that. Good management, good script to rent.
