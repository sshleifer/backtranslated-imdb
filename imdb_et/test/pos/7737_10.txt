Welcome to all the great fans of this movie who have not only seen and appreciated it, but (based on many book reviews) GET IT! I have unanimously held Paul Mazursky's "Tempest" on the same name as Shakespeare's game, as seen in another review here. On the other hand, if you are looking for a simpler game customization, you should look elsewhere. However, as an experiment, it is simply remarkable. Charming, touching, funny, sad, dramatic ... it's all and much more. Cast, locations, script, music is just awesome. Cassavetes and Rowland were never better. Susan Sarandon, in turn, more than referred to the great work she will do in the future. Molly Ringwald makes her film debut memorable and you just have to love Raul Julia's action ... she steals the show in several scenes. What's more, the always great Cassavete was sure and sure that the performer had given her permission! The study of which Shakespeare's classical elements can be life, if they are updated more "today", Mazursky's "Tempest" burns perfectly!
