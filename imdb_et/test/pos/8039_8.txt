Christian Duguay drew this regular little espionage thriller at the beginning of his career. He plays on television quite regularly, although some terrible violence and sexual scenes are unfortunately truncated. Finally, I got to see a 3-seater tape version of the local video store. The naval officer, Aidan Quinn, has been recruited to embody the infamous Carlos Jackal and he gets a little role. Donald Sutherland Ben Kingsley plays Quin Bosses, Sutherland is a real enthusiast and Kingsley as a higher level. The first half of this more fun flick shows that Quinn has been trained and indoctrinated. On the other side, he's out in the field, loving Jackal's wife and shooting it with different enemies. The idea is that Jack would look like a coat to the Russians and let them take care of the notorious assassination of the world. Things don't go exactly as planned. Sometimes I was almost waiting to be poured to break some dirty dialogue, but they all play it very straight. Finally, this is a terrible little thriller that deserves your attention. Jackal's former mistress who taught the very right and very married Quinnit to tighten him, lick blood from his face and then retreat, alone is worth the price of admission.
