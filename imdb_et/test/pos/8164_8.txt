Four holy young men from Mormon go to L.A to preach to the Gentiles of the Gospel cities. But one of the young Mormons is a repressed gay man who "happens" to cross the way "very" out of the young L.A. (What would be film pictures without accident?). These two, very different young men become friends and in the process affect each other's prospects, which inevitably creates confrontation between homo and mormon cultures. <br /> <br /> This is the premise that in the Last Days, the 2003 film, written and directed by C. Jay Cox, a former Mormon missionary. The story of the film is, of course, very important, especially in today's America. The variations of this story must be talked about and restarted, and hopefully rewritten into future films, as the underlying subject highlights the hateful attitude of Christian fundamentalists too often to gays. The "Last Day" is provocative and I doubt that the film is well received in Provos or Pocatello, even though the script is intelligent, sensitive and incomprehensible.
