Forget the recent terrible American remake, which regretted the reputation of the French original as the director participated in both. This is a dirty romantic 90s noir with many turns. It works best as a Gallic ode to Hitchcock's rear glass, because the concept of voyeurism is a continuous subject that burns in a complex scenario. The story is stunningly comprehensible, like the Picasso painting, providing a multi-faceted view of the same event and requiring the viewer to participate at all times. Settings, music and haunting scores are excellent as well as great bets. See it more than once.
