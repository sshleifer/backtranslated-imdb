In the sense of separating all my ideas and the current 2-part system and the political process, I think this is an excellent film. This movie is not a welcome comedy, but when I got over that movie really thought. So much of what we see and hear about the election is such a joke. There is a particular debate in this film about what seemed like a masterful criticism of our political debates and how politics is being discussed over them. I encourage everyone who thinks our process is good to see this movie. If you want to laugh, Robin Williams and Christopher Walken are not their usual selves. In this film, they show us that the truth is painful, not that the truth is funny.
