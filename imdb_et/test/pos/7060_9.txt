It's just the best of summer camp movies. In fact, few others are even fair, not to mention where it's as fun as it is. The film is just good, clean and fun. Many people who went to the summer camp see that it is presented here just as it usually was, but slapstick mixed with comedy. Bill Murray, as the camp's chief advisor, Tripper, runs a fine ensemble and is usually at the heart of a depressing mess. Tripper has large single-liners, which usually transmit their jokes as pseudo-messages through the camp's public address system. <br /> <br /> Many great supporters played campers and advisers to build a plethora of fun and interesting sub-blocks all the time in many of the camp's hi-jinx instances. Spaz (Jack Blum) and Fink (Keith Knight) were especially well done. These two adventures (and malformations) are fun. Each has classic lines and they are pleasing to you and roots. Look for Spaz's disco-dance scene. They are not foolish, naive, stupid, excess, nervous, or any other terrible, terrible maid stereotype. Kristine DeBell, Kate Lynch, Cindy Girling and others make these signs credible. <br /> <br /> The horrors needed are abundant, usually at the expense of the camp director Morty (Harvey Atkin). The nature of these bowels begins with outrageous and progressive progress. But all the fools, Tripper and others have their own merits. For example, Tripper interacts with the shy, lonely child, Rudy (Chris Makepeace) and takes him down under his wing. <br /> <br /> The story ends with a race against a sports camp. This is a great "root for the sub-dogs" finals. When the chips are left behind, Tripper's motivating "It's just not important" spiel is inspired and one of the best moments in the movie. And get ready for the root: "Spaz. Spaz! Spaz !!!" "
