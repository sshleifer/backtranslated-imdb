This film has no outstanding visions that American beauty or ice form offered, and since it was made after these films, it cannot be labeled as very original: music, though subtle brilliant, sounds like American beauty. <br /> <br /> The story is similar to Ice Storm (as well as Sigourney Weaver). The film may not try to rebuild the success of the two films mentioned above. Sometimes the story tends to be a little lower than it is for bigger, more successful "brothers", being too much going, or not offering the most effective dialogues. You can't write American Beauty here. But it can be said about most of the films ever made, even the best and much more like: the music score and (expected as cast) effective performances. Please note that Emile Hirsch appears a few years later at the outstanding "Into The Wild". <br /> <br /> In general, I can recommend this movie if you like suburbs, though this is not the first black list to add: 1 American Beauty 2 Ice Form 3 Toddler. <br /> <br /> If you have seen and liked them, look at it.
