this is a classic American film with comedy, romance and dream. You can say, â€œThere have been many such films. but just believe me, you will find it good because it is well targeted, scripted and played. Amanda Bynes is just amazingly amazing! He is humor, cute and charming both inside and outside the screen. he's really a MAN! the message I get from this is my fairy tale. what I mean "milk" is not a prince and a princess, but a "faith". namely, it tells us that you will keep your faith, your dream, and the things that will make you regret your whole life if you don't. one of the movies you can't forget in your life.
