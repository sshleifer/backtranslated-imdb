The first length of the game Muppet Movie, and maybe the Muppet Christmas Carol, is still looking for a movie guide around the world. Disney has made Muppet's service and this movie proves it over and over again. Classic comedy and guest star come in, maintain a simple but original plot, classic Muppet-lame joke, Paul Williams genius writing song, and Electric Mayhem madness and come out with an amazing movie, especially when you realize that the main cast is dolls. Only Croft has dolls near the Hensen gene. Half of fun games is that the comic actor / actress is still alive ???? I can only hope that Frank Oz and Dave Goelz and the rest of the surviving Muppeteers can somehow save and revive Kermit and Companyd from Disney's death grip.
