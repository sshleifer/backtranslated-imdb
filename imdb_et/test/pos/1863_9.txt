This is definitely a movie and Charles Darwin's personal struggle. The film is not only about fighting for the publication of the "origins" of its book, but also about its relationship with the oldest daughter. Her daughter was the only person in her family at first to approve her views, which she had to pay. From time to time I get him more. <br /> <br /> It is not an evolutionary propaganda film now, because I think it managed to remain very neutral. I find it hard to do. of course it does not allow the church to deal with the characters, in fact the opposite. If you need me to use big movies to illuminate this movie; it likes the deist and the atheists, but goes away from the court. The film speaks of evolution, and that is the case. <br /> <br /> Paul Bettany as Charles Darwin was incredible. Of course, we can all think of Darwin as an old man with a funny beard, but this film focuses on a man at the end of his 20s, early 30s. Jennifer Connelly (Emma Darwin) is great as always, but impressed actress was Martha West as Annie Darwin, daughter of Darwins. Definitely one of the best children's actors of the decade. The story is about Darwin and his daughter, and it has worked beautifully. <br /> <br /> Except for some jumps from the time that was confusing for a moment, the production of this movie is quite flawless. Some of the scenes that Darwin observes in nature are simply wonderful, almost the same as the high-performing national geographic documentary film. <br /> <br /> But I have to admit that I'm not quite sure why they chose "creation." title. I doubt it is irony, this film is too respectful. Well, I'm sure that also means just don't let him scare you. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie 9/10. It is a great honor for Charles Darwin to give him a chance.
