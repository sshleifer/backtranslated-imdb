I don't remember this series, I believe it can be "American masters", but it was broadcast in PBS in about 1980. Most people have a knowledge of the development of the A-bomb and those who have little or no, probably this is a pretty dry topic. Anyone who has looked at this seventh series does not know it. You will find out about the confusion of Oppenhemier's mind and how development changed his life forever. You understand the tragic figure he got and why. With 7 episodes you can find out the main players and intrigue and rebound. I've contacted PBS about getting a video or DVD, but never got a response. Too bad, I'd like to see it again.
