I recently hit "Passion ...." (opened scenes). Mrs Currier was praised for having the vision and the courage to bring such a strange Balzac story to the screen. I am grateful to all the pain and team for their parts in making such a thoroughly fine film. It must have as many scenes in the wilderness. And I don't understand how his coach copied such a "performance" from the leopard to Simoon. (This ad reminds you of the second pause adventure, "Naked Prey". Why isn't this movie more known? I hope to find this video.
