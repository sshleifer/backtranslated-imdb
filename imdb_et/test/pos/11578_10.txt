I've seen "Inside the Sea" today and I loved it. The film's actors are great (of course, Javier Bardem), but I thought Belén Rueda's role would be better. Lola Dueñas, Clara Segura and especially Mabel Rivera make great interpretations. And I can't forget Celso Bugallo and Joan Dalmaut (the main character's brother and father). I liked the song "Negra sombra" ("Dark Shadow") by Luz Casal with Carlos Núñez's music. compete in the Oscar Awards. I liked other Spanish productions like Almodóvar's "Bad Education", but Amenábar's film is much better. "Inside the Sea" deserves all the awards.
