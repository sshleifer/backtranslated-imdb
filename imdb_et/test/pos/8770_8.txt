The man is mistakenly accused of killing his friend's aircraft fire, and has to go cross-country to avoid police and discover the real embarrassment of this situation. The plot line that was later used by Hitchcock for classic North Burn burning, benefited Saboteur from both the very good performances and the masterful breaks from the master himself. <br /> <br /> A little bit familiar to every Hitchcock fan, but he was always able to give his memorable supportive characters and symbols. Here is a leading and charming Robert Cummings leader and will soon find that he is visiting many strange and peculiar characters who do not tolerate a group of circus performers, a wealthy hidden motive and a blind individual who shows him the best way to understand someone in every area, especially the antagonist motif , is pure originality and quality. However, there is a nice chemistry between Cummings and his lead partner, much less prized as a result of the real movement of Priscilla Lane, as well as Vaughn Glaser's blind movement. The best part is the final queue, which thoroughly reflects what Hitchcock would use later on the Northwest side, but this time it is at the top of New York. Certainly not his best, but Peter's Master gives us great moments to wait.
