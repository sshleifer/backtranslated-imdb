I can't tell how many times one line has made me laugh or how often I've described this scene to people who don't know this movie. I saw the year it appeared, I was 19. I don't think there were about ten people at night in this East Village theater. For years I thought we were the only ones to see it. It's nice to see that others found it as hysterical as I was, and I see its lasting value despite the past. Rent it, buy it or steal it.
