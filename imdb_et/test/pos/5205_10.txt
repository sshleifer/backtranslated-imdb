In addition to the low budget, one scene never seems to have more than 50 Germans, plus the same 2 half-lives, this film is an absolute top class. Everything is accurate. I think it's a uniform up to horror and disappointment. Everyone is both gray and blind in uniform. Gray men, whose lives are empty. Forget that the US made Gung ho garbage like Blackhawk and Private Ryan. This is one of the best war films. Only the Iron Cross will win it for tension and story. Please do we have the correct Unduplicated German with English subtitles in the UK? Without paying ridiculous import taxes from Europe. Most other DVDs are multilingual. Why not?
