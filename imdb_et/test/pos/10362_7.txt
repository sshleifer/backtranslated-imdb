I liked this movie. Many people talk about it as "Sabrina the Teenage Feminist". They do it with many movies that Melissa Joan Hart has turned on. But she really surprised me in this film because she was a big part of Mary, fighting for justice when her roommate was raped. You can say that Hart was extremely decisive in this film and it showed. I also liked Lisa Dean Ryan as a roommate of Mary. He was very effective in apologizing for his character after his rape. Josh Hopkins was good as a selfish and egoistic rapist. Lochlyn Munro played his character convincingly. In my opinion, acting in this movie is better than in most TV films. <br /> <br /> The film was quite predictable. I also waited for more than the end, it was too steep. The delivery could have been better. However, they are responsible for these problems and general plots.
