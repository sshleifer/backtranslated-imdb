I saw this cable. I liked. It was my interest and the dramatic choices were good. The old couple was very good and good when he was very scary. Cinema is not that big, but dirty video adds a sense of reality, so it's a compromise, you know? Sometimes a girl hit New England's accent hard. The emphasis would be on what will come and go. Anyway, I thought the film was pretty well done. The story was strong and it was considered a dramatic tension, because you felt that their hiding was somewhat small, even though things seemed everyday. Good work with low budget. Another good SUNY purchase. Make it.
