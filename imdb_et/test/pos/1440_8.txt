The crashing issue of the "Golden Army Man" is a classic 1950s entertainment. There is no nuance here, Frank comes back from the prison on the back with a monkey and goes back to the old neighborhood where old knees are still lurking. This is the story of his blind ride without touching all his emotional luggage. The performances are all a bit overripe, but it is part of the fun of watching. Darren McGavin and Arnold Stang are unforgettable and almost steal the show. This and the "Manchur Candidate", according to my most humble opinion, are the two biggest chairman of the board movie. Don't miss one of them.
