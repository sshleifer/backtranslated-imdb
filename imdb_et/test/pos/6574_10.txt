Roopa (Kamalinee Mukherjee) loses his parents and other family members in a terrible car accident. He starts living an independent woman without the help of his relatives. She has a boyfriend named Rahu (Anuj) and she is married to her, but she relies on her future mother's behavior and her boyfriend's lack of confidence. Anand (Raja) joins his neighborhood. And he starts to make Roopa feel comfortable and safe. The rest of the story is why Anand - AP's abundant company house MD - has decided to live as Roopa's neighbor and next. watch it in Indian movies. Although the story goes slow, you get a feeling of knowing it. Weave to the director shekhar for this awesome direction! Great music and background point, made up of K.M. Radhakrishnan adds quality. Kamalini Mukherjee as Rupa has provided excellent performance. I think he was the best choice for this role, thanks to his enchanting looks and amazing histrionics. Anand as Raja has done well. I watched this movie three times and enjoyed it every time. This is a class except for the daily dose of a dose fight. Very recommended !!
