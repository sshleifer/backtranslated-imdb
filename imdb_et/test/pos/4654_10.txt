Twenty years after seeing it, I still find myself in things like "Look between two giant melons", or start singing "Pabst Blue Ribbon Theme". On the other hand, 20 years later, I can now understand the "meat machine" because there are many more stereotypes that he used in this movie. These are good movie characters for me. I can say that this film is a test of time that I can't really say about many of the 80's movies. Let me continue by saying that this film is still on the list of many people's favorite films in the 1980s as a growing child. If you like games and have dreams of becoming a "Game Master" or if you find yourself in the 80s to live your childhood, you have to watch it. It is also sometimes sarcastic and funny. But one thing about this movie is for sure, if someone calls you a "big overnight", they don't mean X or acid travel, they mean, get Midnight Madness ready! You see. Everyone dies to play! hehehehheh.
