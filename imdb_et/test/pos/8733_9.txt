I've played this movie endlessly this month and I just love it. I was around in the 1960s (oh dear), so it is in some ways nostalgic. But this is a funny assumption, a horrible dialogue and great performances that look at me. <br /> <br /> Dr Winston's reaction at the end of Stephanie is invaluable. (I'd be more accurate, but I don't want to spoil it.) Who, besides Matthau, can play the man not entirely up and down and yet, but we still love him? As for Bergman costumes, I think he looks as bad as he should. I think "he was kidnapped" when he appeared in the evening dress. It doesn't fit her at all, which is too bad. I never wanted it when I first saw her and I still don't. <br /> <br /> Goldie won an Oscar for his role. People thought it was a breakthrough performance at the same time, but it is still one performance that I don't love as much as others. However, he has the right amount of sweetness and pleasure, which is important for this role. <br /> <br /> And I agree - I thought Rick Lenz was great at it and it's too bad that his movie career wasn't. Don't take it. <br /> <br /> I hope more people watch this movie ... they love it!
