On a scale of 1 to 10, "Suicidal Sweetheart" got 11 of me and everyone else. The picture was incredibly funny. I told my wife "It's obvious that this man walks on the water, but over the fire, it's a bit much." This is one of the best mixes of comedy, satire and innuendo I've seen since Mel Brooks' 'Young Frankenstein'. I can't believe that this picture was not taken by a big studio. The characters are real and the combination of a large script and large casting was obvious. Max and Grace are real people with real problems that are dealt with regardless of the likelihood of success. It keeps you smile while being serious and laughing with all that indirect humor that is perfectly built into this product.
