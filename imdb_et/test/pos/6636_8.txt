The meditation concerning the war of Ingmar Bergman concerns a couple living in an idyllic location on a small island on the coast (which country is not specified). Driving a distance is a war they only know in news. When they go to their day, they will have a war and it will soon become a battle for survival, as both sides do not care about them. A brief look at the human costs of war and those who are not easily struggled but caught in attack. This is a film that precedes its 40th anniversary, because the concept of the military was made in war, where most victims are civilians. This is a dark distracting film that is spoken of from the perspective of the average person with the complete sense of hopeless and confusing, which is best expressed by the idea that runs through my head, "what am I doing now?". Because film is an intellectual exercise, it's a movie that makes you think. As an emotional film, it never touches. I had never been emotionally moved, even when the horror of the situation turned my brain into a flip flop. (I should say that I admire Bergman intellectually for the ideas he brings to the table, but his films have never been moved. I am not a "fan." I am always in Fellin's argument for the old film class who was better for his films more emotions). Such reservations need to be seen, especially since we live in a world where most of us are in war, just on the television screen.
