I picked up my younger brother early and loved it (I liked it myself). I don't have to explain the plot because the film remains an award-winning, most sold book to the honest author Carl Hiaanen. The film takes a popular book and picks it up with beautiful cinematography (I want to go to Florida now!), Humor (thanks to a funny man, Luke Wilson and some newcomers) and Great music! I have to get Jimmy Buffet on CD now! I know the movie is good when I finally get the goose bumps. All in all, it was a big family movie that I felt in the hands of younger brothers. I recommend it to everyone and everyone.
