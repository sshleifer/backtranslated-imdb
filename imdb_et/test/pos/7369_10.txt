This movie is about four groups of friends carrying a car while driving. They build a campfire to get overnight and wait for help. As time passes, they tell stories that scare each other. Speaking of it would spoil the movie, so rent and enjoy it! <br /> <br /> I say it starts a little slow, but every story is better and better. This film marks some of today's hottest actors, Christine Taylor (The Brady Bunch Movies), James Marsden (disturbing behavior), and Ron Livingston (Office Space). So you can see that there are big stars there just not really big! GO rent or buy it ASAP !! This movie is awesome!
