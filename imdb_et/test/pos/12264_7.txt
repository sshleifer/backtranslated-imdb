James L. Brook is one of those directors who always look like a viable look. He's not just a "Simpsonside" producer, he has some classic comedies under his belt - "Broadcast News" is one of them. <br /> <br /> Although it does not match his later effort "As good as it goes," "Broadcast News" is still a very smart, funny and witty film about television broadcasting and all these problems. There is a great comedic sequence of physical humor, where Joan Cusack runs around the building, trying to rush the editing room in a matter of minutes before it is broadcast live on television. <br /> <br /> This is not only true of how radio services are operated, but also a skilful and honest imagination of people. <br /> <br /> A low key, subtle movie with a good actor (especially Hurt) who I don't always like so much and the apt.
