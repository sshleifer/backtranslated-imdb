This movie is absolutely beautiful. It's visually stunning and it's good because the dialog takes only one page or two papers. Action is great; it is subtle, passionate and intense. Ben Daniels is doing a fabulous job of making himself a creature and mixing this wild nature with a man's excessive passion and respect. There is no mistake, no mistake or a wrong moment that could be found everywhere. It's perfect, but only when you understand what you are experiencing. It's not a movie for anyone who wants normality.
