Vanaja (2006), written and directed by Rajnesh Domalpalli, is an extraordinary film from South India. Mamatha Bhukya plays 15-year-old Vanaja, who lives in a rural area with her loving but alcoholic father. When he succeeds in life, he must overcome the responsibilities of low boxes and poverty. <br /> <br /> I went to the movie, waiting for a wretched girl who was crushed by society. This is not what "Vanaja" shows us. A young woman is attractive, intelligent and ambitious. He does not agree with his tears or simple resignation. He wants to succeed and it is never clear that, despite being likely, he will not succeed. <br /> <br /> The actors that Mr Domalpall pulls out of the majority of his amateurs are wonderful. Mamatha Bhukya plays a prominent role, and Urmila Dammannagari is doing an extraordinary job as Rama Devi, a wealthy landowner who is a former classic dancer. <br /> <br /> In Vanaja, she learns South Indian classic dance as she did in real life. I couldn't say how good Vanja's dance was with Indian standards, but many dance scenes were fascinating. (Don't think about Bollywood - this is a classic dance. It's also very different from ballet, because in ballet the dancer moves his heels away from the floor. must not be forgotten. It works on a DVD but is better on the notification screen because the dance is shown better. However, if DVD is your only option, then look at it. Just look at it.
