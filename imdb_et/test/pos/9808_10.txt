Even people who do not like the film, usually because they find the ending is confusing, should appreciate the strong action of Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazello, who played two young leaders in this film. <br /> <br /> Spoiler WARNING: literally on the level, there is no point in the end. People who think that the end is in some sense meaningful, are divided among those who 1) think that his father was killed by his younger brother, whether Mike (elder boy) was away from the neighborhood or fleeing in his wagon to escape and the 2) who think that the younger brother is imaginative and his flight to a wagon that has been transformed into a flying machine shows that he is going beyond the abusive situation. <br /> <br /> I like 2). This makes a lot of sense as to how many children engage in abuse. It is not unusual for an abused child to divide his psyche and to misuse himself in another; stuffed animal, even imaginary friend. So it makes more sense to always have a younger boy abused and never Mike. In reality, it is unlikely that one of the two brothers would get all the abuse, even if it happens. Bobby, the younger brother who is also encouraging, is the one who demands that they overcome the situation. Likewise, an actual lifetime for abuse by an adult would have been too crushed in its history to become such a fantastic end.
