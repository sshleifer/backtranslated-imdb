Did you like "dead man not using Plaid"? But "Top Secret" and "Chorus Line"? Well Müllers Büro has all of these three fantastic Melange, as unlikely it may seem. A very funny "language in Cheek" Movie Noir get along with stunning songs and great dance. You need a little strange humor for this movie, but it's worth seeing. I voted for it nine if the end would be a little more logical than ten. This is how good this film is.
