Unfortunately, this film was undervalued, but it turned out to be truly exceptional. Entering the Theater I didn't know anything about the movie except that the friend wanted to see it. <br /> <br /> I was caught in high quality film. I couldn't imagine Ashton Kutcher's serious role, but his performance really proved his character. This movie is extraordinary and deserves our financial support, unlike many other films. I do not like to easily recommend any movie, but in this case I recommend everyone to see it. <br /> <br /> This movie is truly extraordinary!
