Before I forget, let me tell you that this work of art is outstanding. From trash bins to huge cruise ships, the drawings are beautifully made. If it were not animated, the critics would praise the "direction" because it is really good. . Placing a dock next to a large ship, he carries a Tweet in his cage. Tweety also puts it on her and you know her first comment - the same thing she always does when she puts it on a cat. Anyway, Sylvester runs over, opens the well and says, "Hi, breakfast!" Tweety hits his face with a mining glass and says, "You are an old old devil!" Cat gets into the water. - There's a "grandmother" at the door. Sylvester is beating because the old lady is protecting her pet again. But "funny," Granny says, "I've fallen out of my glasses. I don't see Betsey without" heavening "anything where these scammers are." <br /> <br /> The upper hand .... and the usual cat-catching-bird shenanigans are again like grandmother's glasses. Sylvester's smartest thing was to take his glasses and paint them a Tweety picture, so when he woke up and put them in, he saw the bird and thought it was okay. a very fun animated short that was fun to watch. As you can say with quotation marks, I love dialogue in some of these old cartoons.
