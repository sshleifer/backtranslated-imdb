I went to the MCRD Parrish Island in 1953 to a launch camp, and this film is exactly the same as the boots that went through this age, even when the stinking sandpap hatches. Many of the participants in the film were active marines. This film may be more pleasing to the Navy than others, but I feel that the film itself is very well done and Jack Webb made a "good DI". Semper Fi!
