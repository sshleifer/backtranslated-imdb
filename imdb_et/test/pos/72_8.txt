Even the bad Julie Andrews Musical is worth a look and it's not bad! In fact, it's quite fun. In fact, it is an appealing study that tries to manipulate a person with letters. <br /> <br /> Julie's "good two-shoe molding" game is played by a German spy / English musician. He then went to the movie S.O.B. and play drag queen Victor Victoria and other not so good girls usually Ukko Blake Edward. <br /> <br /> The film is really problematic It's hard to feel his character because he's a German spy. We want to love Julie, but she's on the wrong side. This movie is probably floped. Julie is a German spy? Our Mary Poppins? is our Maria Van Trapp suddenly a German spy? But never, it's musical and has Jullie. Oh and I mentioned hunky Rock Hudson's in it? <br /> <br /> Julie gives the incredible performance that every musical comedy buff shouldn't miss. Big WW 1 songs and beautiful Mancini songs. For example, why did Julie and her uncle suddenly try by the Germans when she smiled at them in a minute. <br /> <br /> But on another note, who cares? The musical number is fun and exciting. Costumes and landscapes are exceptionally large. The film is quite a sign. <br /> <br /> He has annoying idiotic discoveries that Blake Edwards puts on all his films. (Yawn) <br /> <br /> But this is Julie, who is desperately trying to change her image. (You can imagine a dinner with Blake and Julie - Julie: "Blake must change our picture." Blake: "I'll make you a German spy, then we'll take your clothes to another movie and then play transvestite in another movie. They don't know you. It's Maria Von Trapp's death "<br /> <br /> An exciting study of changing the image. Wonderful Julie. Musical comedy buffs, much more entertainment than Star!
