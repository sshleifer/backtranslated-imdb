I went to The Closer She Gets, knowing it was a story about a filmmaker's mother fighting cancer. I was expecting this to be a very harrowing, depressing film. And while the subject is certainly emotionally complicated, the remarkable thing about this film is the positive message it sends. This shows the full commitment of the family to the fight against cancer. They refuse to lose faith in one another even in the darkest moments. <br /> <br /> For me, the most moving moments when this belief is revealed. Little comment that mother and family make each other to reveal her (and their) will to survive, and their defiant emphasis on love and family reunion. In this way, it is an uplifting and deeply hopeful film. We should all be so happy that these families are surrounded by a serious illness.
