It has to be one of the most beautiful sick movies I've ever seen. Merhige has created a living painting that opens up to a minimalist demeaning of violence, sex and the life of Jesus Christ. The high contrast and the thick layer make you question what you really see, but using textures with extreme contrast creates an incredible viewing experience. This movie is not for everyone. I think you have to keep an open mind and not so fast to condemn this film for its content, which is extremely harsh, but makes a rather important statement about creation, God and humanity. The discussion is open to whether this film is a work of art or a value of shock.
