I recently had the privilege to watch the last 35 mm, Technicolor, stereo print and found it to be much more lively and moving than I remembered. Also closer to the original material - basically all of the screenwriter N. Richard Nash trimmed, changed a lot of recurring spoken dialogue and added a transition scene or two (including for the very fun Pearl Bailey). The design of Oliver Smith's production is the "Li'l Abner" - "Boys and Dolls" 50s Adaptation Mode, but it works well for its folklore, unrealistic quality. Stereotyping and racism exist, but not at a momentum. What's more, in the time of the film, it's quite honest - adultery, violent behavior, drug use, and self-destructive habits by Catfish Row's residents are not at all minimized. But there are debits starting with the text of all stages. So much compromise loses Gershwin's shine - it's no wonder this family doesn't like it. Reorchestration, especially Sammy Davis Jr.'s material, is unpleasantly trendy and vulgar. George knew what he was doing, people; you didn't have to mix that much. And while Poitier and Dandridge are doing well and singing their singing twice, there is a huge difference between the songs of the characters and the talking - you are constantly aware of it. Of course, there is certainly music here that has ever been written for the biggest theaters. Despite being eligible, it remains alive and you must be made of stone that it does not move. If the treatment is not entirely an estate (and it should not be), there is no reason not to spend the bucks to restore this ambitious filming in Gershwin's masterpiece and make new generations more aware of their genius.
