The Best Italian Workplace Occupation as a Film; good (not big) action, nice vision and pace, mediocre plot, but nothing bad <br /> <br /> walk. But if the new commercial MINI <br /> <br /> Coopers, this movie is remarkable! <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Ok, this is a typical Heist movie with an odd twist (underwater safe cracking was nice, if not unlikely) and cast was quite solid <br /> < br /> (except for rotten Wahlberg), but when everything came <br /> <br /> down, the actual "stars" of this picture were three MINI <br /> <br /> Cooper, all with their great flying, speed racing , ramp jumping, <br /> <br /> taking balls, golden reading, shiny new glory. Audience, where I actually sat between "ooed" and "ghosts" when Theron's little <br /> <br /> hit the screen for the first time (strangely enough, he and <br /> <br /> Wahlberg did not get the same response) . <br /> <br /> The film will be promising. Mos Def, Seth Green, Donald <br /> <br /> Sutherland, Edward Norton, and Jason Statham start with all the interesting and humorous characters whose only real uninspired performance is usually the value of a good brand. <br /> <br /> Wahlberg. Why does he claim to be his best film I can't imagine; his nature is a completely remarkable one and he plays him forever. <br /> <br /> was as if Mr. Rogers had come back from the dead and lived his body. Charlize is fine like a daughter of Sutherland, although there is nothing magical. The character of Seth Green is perfect and the fun of Napster (including Napster's founder, <br /> <br /> Shawn Fanning) is fun; He and some Mos Def's early <br /> <br /> lines add some much needed humor. Unfortunately, Edward Norton and Donald Sutherland cannot get enough time on the screen. <br /> <br /> You can see most of the plot that comes from and <br /> <br /> dialogue is widespread with bad liners and departures, but I doubt the filmmakers wanted to reinvent the wheel, so it's typical activity / break if it occurs. Worth seeing <br /> <br /> cheap night recommend. <br /> <br /> 7/10 Not worth the weight of gold, but make nice fillings.
