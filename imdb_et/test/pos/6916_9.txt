I enjoyed it well for the TV show. I was surfing the channel and at the beginning of the movie. Boy, I'm glad I stopped. This film has real hot pain, as well as a semi-credible plot. There's drama, comedy, action, and best of all, the human nature aspect of this movie is what makes it big. I hope it will appear in the Video because I buy a copy. Rating ... 9 stars out of 10
