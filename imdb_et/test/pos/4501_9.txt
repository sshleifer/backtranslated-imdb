I read the book before watching the movie and left me emotionally empty, but I felt that it really brought me to Afghanistan, a culture that I know little about. I had great hopes for this movie and it wasn't disappointed. I looked at someone who didn't read the book and enjoyed it. They had to shorten some things in the film, but it was a well-functioning and well-photographed film. This leaves the film thinking for a long time. You know the characters and their innocence. I recommend this movie to those who love emotionally drama and want to experience Afghan culture. There are some distracting scenes that are not suitable for children. This is a difficult drama that depicts the horror of life in a narrowing order.
