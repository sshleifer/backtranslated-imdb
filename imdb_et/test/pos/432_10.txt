I'm not a fan of musicals, but I'm a big fan of Jean Renoir and Jean Gabin. I rented this movie capriciously and I was pleasantly surprised, even if I expected the size of a classic director. This movie is BEAUTIFUL. The shots are like oil paintings with lots of motions that many executives try, but Renoir MASTERS. I can't express how much this film goes beyond ... it's not really musical but just a few well-placed musical numbers and a great dance final. But there is something in this film that makes you feel the absolute joy when you look at it. Schwarzenegger movies. I have to very easily turn off things that are too happy or "la la land", but this film has the overwhelming positive energy that is simply irresistible - not to mention every frame is great and the plot is good. 10 out of 10
