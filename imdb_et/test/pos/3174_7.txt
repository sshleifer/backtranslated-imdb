Extremely underground, well-made and operating "Rodeo" west. There is no need for gussies here, because all the cast members were ordinary people who talked about the real life of a rodeo hustler and his companions in the 60s and 70s west. But hats especially for Slim Pickens to give what I thought his signature was, especially given the fact that he was a real rodeo clown. His role went far beyond the role of a clown, as he was deeply engaged in the "ups and downs" of all the nose rodeo life and psychological destruction that so often surrounds such a lifestyle. He and Mr Coburn were very good partners, not only in circulation but also in the real world outside the coral. Also look at Anne Archer Coburn's Native American love interest in the last part of the movie. Must be one of his first roles. <br /> <br /> Not as flashy, perhaps as "Junior Bonner" but equally heart-shaping and the effect of depicting it. Thanks to the Encore Western Channel, this has occasionally shown that it is truly undervalued.
