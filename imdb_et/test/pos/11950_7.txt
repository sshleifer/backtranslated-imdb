This is the creation of follow-up to the Better Off Dead. In the competition, Better Off won Dead hands. But for star power, one crazy summer is in the right Savage Steve's better script. Problems with One Crazy Summer (OCS): Casting. Better off dead (BOD) was so much better. Friendship: The OCS shows Cusack, who is waiting for Bill Murray's little bro. Problem with the device? More outrageous friends at OCS, but more real friends at BSP. The plot was good. You predict this, but even the predicted parts will go further than you think they might. So, while it's better off, Dead is ugly, it's worth checking out. See Demi Moore before plastic surgery for any other reason. John Cusack fans, you have to see it to say you have. If you don't like Bobcat Golthwaite, I'm sorry. I don't like it either, but you can't escape him. At least he does a great job in the film, respecting the monster of another movie. Editing needs help on the beach, but mostly not much to complain about. Generally it is good and funny. But try not to compare it with BOD or find it missing. * sigh *
