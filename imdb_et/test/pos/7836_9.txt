Forget some coarse (and meaningless) comments some have left here. This series has worked well, well-photographed and makes a refreshing change on most TVs. <br /> <br /> Every stupid can make nitpick. But in this show, the characters are believing, the story is intriguing and convincing (but they need some intelligence from the viewers), it's generally enjoyable and it's British !! (We occasionally present some gems and this is one of them). <br /> <br /> Exhibitions are an hour and I think there are four (at least four of them). The exhibition clearly impressed some US television stations / directors who, despite the larger budget line, made a longer series that was far from influential. Hour.
