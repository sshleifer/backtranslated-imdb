Susie Q is original and not like other bad Disney movies, *** spoiler *** boy named Zach moves to a new city and is in school, he is good at basketball. A girl from the 1950s died with her boyfriend when their car crashed. Susie (Amy Jo Johnson) from the governors - pink ranger - helps Zach as a ghost to get a necklace along the path he has to explain to his sister about his ghost, and finally, this necklace, Susie returns to the bridge he died and then he gets his boyfriend ghostly in the car and they swim up. Later, if he doesn't, he finds a girl who looks like her. (Do you believe in reincarnation?) Susie Q is a good movie to see now and then, but they don't give it, because Disney has to fill all the stupid movies and show that I give it <br /> <br />
