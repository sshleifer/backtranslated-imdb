A fun bad movie that should entertain. One of Joan Crawford's latest performances as a successful successful editor vs. all those young beautiful bunches who are fresh from the Elite Seven Sisters College. A great 50-hour atmosphere in New York. Wonderful period of costumes and hair. Excellent art direction. Trite story, but tear. An abundant cadre of Robert Evans.
