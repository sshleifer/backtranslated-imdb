Key West, for too short a time, was "stuck on TV" for my family. I'd stop by the red lobster and take that night out when it was. The irony of the situation was that I was working at that time with my Fox partner and everyone from the station was tempted for not updating. Everything in this pain was great. Fisher Stevens ... perfect. Who could not identify the "eternal" who dreams of being a West West writer? Jennifer Tilly was always remarkable (and he is one of the Texas Hold'em players HECK). However, you can find a pilot episode on YouTube. Would they like to post a hurricane one. This episode alone should have won both Emmy and the rest.
