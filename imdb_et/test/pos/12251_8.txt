This is a love story that has been opposed to television news. The three main stars, William Hurt, Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks, create love for the triangle television network in the Washington office. <br /> <br /> Tom Grunick (Hurt) is a beautiful reporter, cared for by Jane (Hunter), a producer who admits that Tom has no intellectual gravity to be a true journalist but remains with him.Aaron Altman (Brooks) ) is a man who shares his opinions in press standards is also a man who really loves him. <br /> <br /> Holly Hunter was named the Best Actress Academy Award but lost to Cher (Moonstruck!). This is Hunter's movie. His character Jane is intelligent, merciless and fully motivated. He's also funny neurotic. His performance is perfect. Just look at her face when she looks at Tom's interview with a rape victim. Libra literally falls from his eyes. <br /> <br /> Wiliam Hurt's performance is less obvious. He plays a man who is well aware that he is a man and a scam, but is smart enough to find out that his rise is making people like Jane. He gives little clues to a person who is extremely abundant. <br /> <br /> The film commented on fame, journalism, integrity and the commercial pressures of news in the middle, focused on the bottom line. It predicted that the news would fall down to slow down the standards due to trade pressure. <br /> <br /> Think about it: this movie was released before the end of the Cold War and before the reality of TV. But it predicted the news slipping. The release of the Paris Hilton prison was treated as an important newsletter! To see how this movie is prophetic, just look at your evening news and mark a set, graphics, and presenters. Grunick and his clones are well and truly alive!
