John Huston, an actor and director known for the better price, such as "The Misfits" and "African Queen", directs her daughter Angelica Huston to be her last film. Indeed, the film was released after Huston's death. Based on a novel by James Joyce of the same name, "The Dead" talks about quiet history to celebrate a new anniversary in 1904 in Dublin. Huston, his cast and his screenwriters, including his son Tony, have created a pearl of the film. Novella is one of Joyce's best works (the only one being filmed). The film is a tribute to Huston's genius. She has taken a small beautiful story and made a small beautiful film. Donal McCann and Angelica Huston are shining (although the "shine" is too apparent, too glowing a word that describes their silent, undervalued performances). "The Dead" reflects Huston's love for Ireland and is the ultimate film for the legend in a quiet way.
