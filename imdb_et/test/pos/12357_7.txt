I thought it would be a more fantastic story. But the topic is rather a story compared to what I expected. In fact, there is much more social drama. As usual in "European authors' films". <br /> <br /> The actors are interesting, not exaggerated, as in the mid-silent movie. The pictures are not so good that you think you are stuck like a Bergman Smultron. <br /> <br /> It's true that comparing two movies is a key point here. The Smultron begins with a vision of the death, where Sjöström's character sees his body. Hands are bells. He is forced to look back at what he has done wrong. There's a vision of his happy family in the country. In Körkarlen, Sjöström's wife does not cheat her in front of her eyes, but she wants to escape with small children because she would never get better with her. Finally, Edit's confession is a living decision. <br /> <br /> Well I just add that Sjöström destroys the door with an ax because his wife locked up and plans to go away with the children, reminded me of The Shine. What was a lot more fantasy story with death.
