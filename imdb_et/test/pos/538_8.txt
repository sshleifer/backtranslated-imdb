Susan Sarandon. He made this movie for me. I've never appreciated his action more than I did in the movie. He was really like Adele August. I appreciate actors and actors who leave their individual personality and create a truly believable character. <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman, like Ann August, helped create an ideal antagonist when their characters developed through the film. The film was about them, so the other characters were peripheral. <br /> <br /> I gave this film eight ratings, but Susan got ten for my performance. As far as the ratio of movies to go, beaches and conditions of endearment had a greater impact on me than this film, but I highly recommend it.
