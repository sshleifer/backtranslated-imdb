I saw this movie in London's NFT, where it was part of BFI John Huston's season. I wasn't quite sure what to expect and very little in the first few minutes of the movie. In fact, the rest of the movie continued a little! There is no real plot, no action, no intercourse, very little drama and, except for a short paragraph at the end, there is no landscape. <br /> <br /> The lack of all these features, however, resulted in a wonderful film. I do not fully understand why, but I think this undervalued nature made the film almost perfect. Functioning, scripting and most importantly, casting was all on the ground and I don't remember cinema being in such a good cinema, but I still can't figure it out. I just know that I'm getting a DVD (this is one of those movies that I'm definitely a small screen as good as a cinematic experience, provided you find somewhere quiet to watch it!) And I'll see it again soon. I am also interested in finding out what my family and friends are thinking about. I am sure that this is not everyone's choice, but I am convinced that a large number will agree with my position. <br /> <br /> 9 out of ten.
