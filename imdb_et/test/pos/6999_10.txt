"Pitch Black" was a complete shock for me when I first saw it in 2000. In previous years, I was disappointed with all the flat sci-fi movies (such as STARSHIP TROOPERS) and I thought this film wouldn't be different. But to make it clear: this movie amazed me ... in a good way. I didn't know I was still afraid of the blind until I watched this movie; I have to bury my fear in the back of my subconscious when I was a child, and it justifiably deserves to be there. <br /> <br /> Alien creatures shelter my back; the person (s) who shaped them are twisted, but with a brilliant and creative imagination to find something so impressive and grotesque. <br /> <br /> I loved the way writers gave history to each protagonist and showed their mistakes and strengths without much confusion. <br /> <br /> A gift from Riddick (Vin Diesel) to escape any impossible situation and collision of hell was a jaw fall. At first you will see him as a cold intelligent villain, but in some short moments you will see something humane towards the animal. But as soon as you discover it, it makes something malicious. He will definitely keep you away until it finishes. I didn't know if to despise or admire him ... he's definitely a character of love / hatred. <br /> <br /> Johns (Cole Hauser) was a great example of a character that makes good, but through the necessity of greed he shows his real intentions and what he is ready to survive. John's ability to find out what buttons to press and say the right words puts him as hard as Riddick. <br /> <br /> Fry (Radha Mitchell) is a character who, as Johns said so well, saw him before considering the consequences. But what he loves is that he quickly understands the mistakes of his paths and desperately tries to pay for repentance, even if he threatens his life, when others threw away all human values ​​and went to the dark mountains. <br /> <br /> Jack (Rhiana Griffith) just wanted a hero and was the first to search for this hero in Riddick; It is good to see through evil blind clouds through the child's eye. I thought it was absolutely invaluable when Jack shaved his head to Riddick; You know what they say: Imitation is the best lure. <br /> <br /> Imam (Keith David), like Jack, is capable of seeing good in every evil. He uses philosophy to bring him through the difficulties he faces and when time allows, he rationally understands his losses and then the soldiers. In some ways, he was a moratorium on survivors, though most of the signs worked as if they were not listening. <br /> <br /> The selection of this movie was positively perfect. Each actor looked bright in their role and their talents blended well on the screen. <br /> <br /> This film may have been small, but the director's management and actor performances made the film work and allowed the audience to use their imagination instead of giving some terribly expensive special effect to all of them. This movie is a solid Sci-Fi class. Look at it and judge (openly) for yourself. It's worth it.
