Adopted is the 2006 teen flick, which stands for Mac and PC advertising. The film is about Bartelby .B. Gaines a man who has rejected all his colleagues he has applied for so decides to make his college and invites all other people who did not do so, the problem is hundreds of people to enroll in their school. The movie is fun and I was lucky enough to buy it for $ 5.00 for sale, and I've always watched it. In general, this movie is a must watch for fans of all comedy, because it is funny, witty and just a good movie all up. I appreciate this movie very fairly 78%. GO ACCEPTED MAKE SEQUEL GUYS HOW TO DO NOT ATTENTION.
