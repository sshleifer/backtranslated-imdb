I don't understand why everyone hates this movie, besides being just jealous of their musical career that never went like mega Popstar Aaron Carter. Like this or not, Aaron has seen more success in his younger life than most people who ever dream he has, so he seemed to be making a movie. Lou Pearlman and the company are well-known for their excessive use of pop-up areas, do you remember Justin Timberlake's uprising in TV movie modeling? This movie is not big and impressive, but it shouldn't be. It doesn't try to impress people or the Emmy Award winner, it appeared directly on DVD. It's just a cute little movie of an uncomfortable teenager who gets his dream with his favorite Popstar; I know many of you have dreamed about your favorite singer there at some point or not, don't deny it. It is sweet and gentle and I commend it for not having entered the field of sex, violence and vulgar language, which nowadays increasingly appear in our films. Where is the court? Where's the line? Teen dramas come in tens of these days because teenagers are a big market for businesses, at least it's more tolerant to me than the Bratz (aka Slutz), where all the fake little girls run around "Oh Mah Gawd!" in a tank and a mini skirt and are better than those that look like Saw. I know the main game girl because I was a funny girl in high school who loved Aaron Carter and NSYNC and Backstreet Boys and other pop music and still; and like Aaron's character, he can become a "testophobia", especially in mathematics. If you decide this movie just because you don't like it or are jealous of Aaron Carter and his fame, then of course you hate it and the trash can talk about it. The only reason Britney Spears rails on Crossroads got a higher score because she has chest. Accept this movie, what it is, not what you want. I think this happy formal teenage movie ends with a high star and makes you sing.
