While I understand some of the cinematographic points (I thought that a more focused approach would have been more supportive of a low film, home film knowledge), I have to say that I thought WHAT ALICE FOUND was a script and the action was great! Dean Bell has created a real legacy that Judith Ivey delighted with. His performance by Sandra is a joy - opening up alternately like a devilish and romantic. We are intrigued and rebounded immediately for our actions ... and have never given more information than needed. His and his painful efforts correspond to the postmodern fairy tales of Bell, which have wide broad hands. Emily Grace Alice is infused with dynamic magic. It looks like he forms like a clay in front of us, morphing into some beautiful, lost woods. Finally, we are in contradiction with the words as he is saying goodbye to his mother. Jane Lincoln Taylor - whose mother gives the right tragic historical weight - and Justin Parkinson - whose shy first time John, Sam, offers one of the sweetest, if not the most inconvenient sex scenes in the film, must also be mentioned in the tissue. Bell has created a first-class story and gained a lot of talent.
