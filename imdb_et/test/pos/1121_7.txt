Another endless amount of cookie cutters "Kickboxers fights with death to entertain the rich Scumbags movies, so much in the 90s ... Y'know, the ones created with the words" Death "," Blood "and" Steel "and the words" Ring ", "Fighting", "Competition" and "Drilling" and placing them in a random generator! Saying that Death Match is a pretty good entry in the over-exploited genre thanks to its exciting fighting scenes and a surprisingly good example of kickboxer. <br /> <br /> The story is related two friends - ex-Kickboxing World Champion John Larson (played by the puggy Middleweight Kickboxing Champ Ian Jacklin, probably best known for his terrible witch in the ring of fire 2) and Nick Wallace (Nick Hill, a nice man who is probably the most well-known street fighter in Sergio's role in Bloodsport 2), working in LA docks, loading boxes for ships, one discovery of tiny weapons and a short struggle later, our two heroes o n unemployed and supported by L.A bar. Reasonable John Larson decides to head north and look for work; The brilliant Nick Wallace has heard that a man pays good money to fighters to fight private kickboxing. "Why should things change?" says John, "If you need me, I'm there." Predictably, Nick is missing and his good friend is fighting a deadly "death ring" trying to find his lost friend. <br /> <br /> Certainly there are some awards for originality here, but as I said earlier, it is the strength of the films in his action, the cast and quite good results of real fighters he can take away from them. Ian Jacklin especially surprised me. Earlier I had just seen her as a bad guy in the 2 ring and tiny parts, like The Steel Ring, and I've always been quite entertained by how bad the actor she is (a good fighter!). But in Death Match he's pretty good! Considering a decent script and hairstyle, he proves himself to be a charismatic leading person! And his friendship with Nick is very well illustrated. Jacklin and Hill have a nice chemistry and you really believe these two characters are taking care of each other. Enough for one of them to lose a job, a trip to the whole country and risk of death to save another - I wish I had such a friend! It was also nice to see Matthias Hues as a somewhat deeper offender when we are used to seeing our many "criminals" roles. But do not be fooled into thinking that he is a star just because he is on a video sphere (together his head seems to be Michael Bernardo's body from the Shootfighter cover) - he's good at the screen, but on the Negative side, the movie is pretty slow, if not There are battles with lots of unnecessary scenes (which is the meaningless story of gangster Jimmie Fiorello about his grandfather?) and the end of the fight is disappointing, but overall I enjoyed it! Lots of struggles, most of them are good. Isn't that all the martial arts really need? And, of course, eye candy, here's a very nice Renee Ammann. All in all, it's a fun kickbox movie.
