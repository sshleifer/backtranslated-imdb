Setting the film atmosphere in the first 5 minutes is always a well-known and important control device. In important opening scenes, the film should show itself and notice the audience and be interested in the rest of the movie. Here we find the best example of "Mute Witness". <br /> <br /> * Scene Spoiler * <br /> <br /> For the first 5-10 minutes, the movie will open a very Hitchcockian scene with a beautiful blonde lady in her apartment, in the radio. He travels around, applying lipstick, sliding himself up and ignoring the news of the runaway serialist. Of course, the serum killer is in his house and watches his moves, with a knife. He hears the noise, looks at the room and his partner is in the blood pool. At his screams, he turns around to face a knife-holding maniac, who punches him repeatedly into a brutal and frightening work ... <br /> <br /> ... something strange happens. When a woman suffers from death, the killer sits down and takes a cigarette to see how her victim dies. Before he finds his lighter, the cigarette ... comes from another room! The camera will be released and we understand that there are more and more people in the room, some notes, filming, some about the recording of death, and that the woman will take a terribly long time and work very hard on it. When the audience understands what's going on, and the whole scene is part of the movie, it takes a intrusive and terrible scene with a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> * End Scene Spoiler * <br /> <br /> I have highlighted this opening scene for several reasons. First, it represents the atmosphere of the whole movie. Triller in the style of Hitchcock or De Palma, some very unpleasant and even black humorous moments. - It gives the central theme (the difference between "movie screen death" and "snuff death", a topic that was developed later in the movie), and finally introduces the characters' characters; everything as quiet as possible. <br /> <br /> Mute Witness Centers around Billy Hughes, American Special Effects Makeup artist who works on a set of films made in Moscow. Billy can't talk, but she communicates in sign language through her sister. After the end of the night's filming, Billy accidentally finds himself locked locked and is trying to escape, witnessing two crews who first make a porn film, but turns out to be a sniffer. Suddenly his escape from the warehouse is a matter of life and death. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the first side of the movie is powerful and absolutely thrilling. Billy saves grace and his drawback is that he cannot express the sound. (In fact, in my opinion, one of the best aspects of the film is that it is not full of screaming of a woman). There are some disturbing moments and some great real tensions (corridor and lift shafts are perfect examples). Timing is a fluid and the whole first half is an incredibly satisfying experience per se. <br /> <br /> The other side of the film introduces new concepts. Although there are several more distances, the focus is on the side of the plot. New characters are introduced and it is unclear which side they are. While there is nothing wrong with the other side of the film, it just doesn't measure to the first half. Some moments with black humor that fit perfectly and refresh very dramatic scenes, but there are also some very flat comedy moments (just come Billy's sister and her fianc√©, who will lead the film Billy), which almost destroys the film just because they are poorly positioned and / or damaged and destroy the pace. - Finally, the turns come from a fast fire and the climax of the film is suitably tense as in the first half. <br /> <br /> There are a number of things that actually make a movie work. The barriers to communication that Billy has to face, both in terms of noise and in Moscow's American sense, mean that even the emergency call becomes a dangerous situation. The actor who plays Billy, Natasha Zudina, is doing a great job in the film, featuring screen prescence and excellent performance, and ultimately the whole direction, but especially in the first half of the film, which is really a study of Alfred Hitchcock's temporary / thriller film techniques. <br /> <br /> As I have already said, movie shocks come from some awful comic release that doesn't really have to be added. The film already shows a consistent and effective dark humor without the need of Karen Hughes and Andy Clarke (sister and moving) characters to make their scenes unusual. Despite these drawbacks, the movie is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller, ideal for watching Halloween. (Definitely better than a normal horizontal film ...!)
