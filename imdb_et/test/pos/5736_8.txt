Six teenagers go to an old, remote deserted school where, 27 years ago, a terrible massacre took place for amusement and worship. Instead, the children go to the outrageous crazy guard (perfectly played by the Spanish horror scarecrow, Paul Naschy), who committed nasty killings. President Carlos Gil links the intriguing story at a brisk pace and is working hard to create a clever and mysterious atmosphere. The sharp script by Tino Blanco and Mercedes Holgueras offers a smart and inspired blend of slasher and supernatural elements that keep the viewers away. Fernando Arribas' slippery cinematography uses the expertise of light and shadow. Likewise, the trick also makes David San Jose's desperate score. Attractive and appealing young casting bets on live and interesting performances, especially the laudable turns of Carlos Fuentes, head of Ramon, Olivia Molina as panic Maria, Zoe Berriatua, the cruel joker of Jordi, and Carmen Morales as the dirty goth chick Sandra. Killing sets are all as bloody and cruel as they should be. The terrible surprise is also in the dark. Strong and satisfactory shock.
