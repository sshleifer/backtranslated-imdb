Gorgeous work of art.You can look at each movie's picture and see its beauty.First, I would like to say that "when I saw a German soldier helmet, I realized it was here" Star Wars "hade is inspired. The scene they were killing the baby is scary and when i saw it I don't like it. But when the movie was over, I thought about this scene and I changed my mind and thought it was exactly what the Germans did in the Second World War. <br /> <br /> the scene is some of the best war scenes I have seen (if not BEST) .They combine music from this movie and so wonderfully stunning visual images are really great. Then Prokofiev scored one of the most famous soundtracks in history and I thought it was some of the best <br /> <br /> What else can you say about Art.Eisenstein has created a stunning masterpiece, a propaganda film and a beautiful work of art, and I am very happy because I just got the criterion collection from Eisenstein.
