I'm new to this, so please take me. I'm a big fan of Surface. I thought the script and computer graphics were exceptional, as good as all the Sci Fi flicks seen in the theater. In February, Season Finale told the show that the artist said something, "... and now for the Surface season finals". Season Finale, not the finals of the series! I couldn't wait to fall there to see it happen. So fall here and it is nowhere! If NBC is not going to get it, what about Sci Fi or the US? It seems to me that Bay Watch won't last long on ABC and then the US picked it up and went to gang busters! (I bet that ABC pulled) Ha! If not a series, at least a mini-series to give us all loyal fans. What happened to our man's church tower trapped? Is the creature in Caper Nim? Did he have a spunk? Does the cloned guy come to us? There are so many unanswered questions. Thank you for hearing me!
