* SPOILERS AHEAD * <br /> <br /> The big wrestlers were still a few years away. But it was definitely a good one with lots of good races and one great game. <br /> <br /> Demolition was always the best of WrestleMania. I'm glad their last WM hoorah (I refuse to add another version) was a victory against the colossal community. I liked the Andrei gag that has never been tagged. <br /> <br /> Few fans know it was the first time someone beat Mr. Perfect. For some reason Brutus Beefcake's feat was not recognized. Or the fact that he did it quite easily. <br /> <br /> The Hart Foundation's victory over the Bolsheviks was the shortest in WM's history, including 24/9 second place in King Kong Bundy and S.D. Jones. <br /> <br /> I'm glad Jake and DiBias are fighting at WrestleMania. This was due to the fact that feud had to hold on to it for so long. <br /> <br /> I was expecting Big Bossman-Akeem to heat up, but Bossman just called him. As good as Bossman was like a heel, he was just a face. She was always intense and probably loved her job. <br /> <br /> If the warrior was just a better work ethic and perhaps tried to wrestle, he would have been a great WWF champion. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching, especially since boring games are too short to complain. And tag team games are all very exciting.
