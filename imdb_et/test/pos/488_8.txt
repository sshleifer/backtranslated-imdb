This TV movie is based on the innocent first-man leader of India's Winnipeg City Cowboy. The real case caused his fair share of racial tension in Canada, a small-scale Martin Luther King thing. The abuse of the first people is changing the Canadian cinema diet. What makes this movie valuable is the focus on family reactions. Gordon Toosos' father plays forgiveness and the brother of Eric Schweig calls for justice. The stars Gordon Tootoosis and Adam Beach (WINDTALKERS, SKINWALKERS) perform small, almost bullet-like performances. Soon the star Eric Schweig will make high-performance characters in this movie. Dear note, goes to veteran actor Gary Chalk, who has over 100 films on his credit. His Imagination of the Severe Soul Inspector Dowson was worth the Gemini Award (Canada Emmy) with Eric Schweig. Special effects (jumps, dream sequences) are random and not excessive. Connect it to some beautiful North Canadian landscapes and recent events involving police officers and First Nations people like Neil Stonechild, and you have a very satisfying and relevant viewing experience.
