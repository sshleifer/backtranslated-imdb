I was originally from Brazil ... the sad thing about this movie was the exploitation of this boy. They talked about their biography and never got the "centavo" (Brazilian cent) movie. Fernando is not the first and not the last to go through this lifestyle in Brazil. Sad ... but it's the world we live in. It means earning money to save lives. The question is: Where is Fernando today? Probably ... dead. We want to live in this "Disney filled fantasy bubble life". When somebody comes to the disc to help ... along the higher power, and says, "What can I do about it? Where's my cutting?" - I want people's conscience to speak!
