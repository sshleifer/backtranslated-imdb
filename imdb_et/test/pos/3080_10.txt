I thought this movie was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch the bit I missed when I held my belly! The critic who watched this movie on this site challenged someone who had an IQ over their shoe size to find this movie funny, well my IQ is about 135 ... I challenge this person to ask me and then eat my words! This movie is brilliant and if the above critic was not so boring, he can smile once in his life and take things as easily as they meant !!! <br /> <br /> Musical numbers were so imaginative! EVERYTHING, when you watch any movie from that time, they mark tights and understand how different it is to today's clothing and how funny we are today with the male population when they wore day-old tights! The idea of ​​dedicating a song to fleshy men dancing in pantyhose was as fresh as no one laughed! (In addition, when the hip-hop rapper ballet is always a hysterical-dancer, I have also made ballet and hip-hop and danced with the men who had to do both ... it still breaks every time !!!) <br /> <br /> I love this movie, if no one has seen it yet, don't listen to the critic ... look at it and then decide for yourself !!!
