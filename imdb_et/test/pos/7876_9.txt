My second favorite movie in 1970 (after five simple pieces) was completely rejected by many idiots, calling the audience-edible trash. The renowned Liberal Peter Boyle is incredible as a hard-working, with little problem with the young generation. He's a scary guy, but he's got a great imagination and it's very funny. I was a teenage liberal when it was released, but as terrible as Joe seemed to me, she broke me too! Susan Sarandon is in her first role as a perfect and mixed stone rich fox. Queen's Dinner is all fun and insightful for everyone. <br /> <br /> This is NOT a movie and the script (set by the Oscar) could have won this year. The director just didn't leave enough money to make it credible in Hollywood. Whatever your political aspiration, then and now, you like this movie. Definitely 9 out of 10. It's on DVD and on video. Look!
