John Schelesinger has been an exceptional director. We watched this movie when it came out for the first time, but wanted to see it again when it was recently shown by cable. The film has a look as it is being observed today, but it is still interesting because both leaders are capable. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, please don't read Chris and Daulton had two childhood friends who came from the upper middle class. Chris went to the seminar to be a priest but quit. Daulton became a drug user and trafficker for a short time. These two lives seem to be parallel because the couple is involved in illegal activities that prove their short-sightedness. In fact, this shows how both young men misdirected the CIA and the Soviet Union. In both cases, these two were so naive thinking that they could draw something that larger and better equipped people could not even imagine. <br /> <br /> Chris's motivation is justifiable because he feels discouraged by the agency's insignificant role he is working with in dealing with other nations, in this case Australia, which he finds randomly. When he's involved with Daulton, we know that the whole thing is doomed, because no one, as he is, ever has anything. In fact, Chris and Daulton had no idea what they were trying to do or the consequences. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton was in this period as an actor who was going on. He had proved that he had talent in his other films, so Mr Schlesinger's natural choice was to choose him, which is a good choice. Sean Penn was also a young actor who showed the intensity as never seen before. In fact, Mr Penn sometimes reminded us of making a young Robert Mitchum. The contribution of both participants to the film is incredible. One cannot think who could have played it, but rather those. <br /> <br /> "The Falcon and Snowman", though not with other major John Schlesinger films, is interesting to look at from our not too distant past.
