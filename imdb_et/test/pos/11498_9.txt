Joline (Heather Graham) will present her husband Carl (Luke Wilson), who disappeared, that he cleared his head and marriage. Joline, who is committed to her marriage, begins to find Carl, but the journey discovers a lot. During his journey, he experiences many interesting signs that unknowingly help him find his way. <br /> <br /> In my eyes, this is a classic tea clip that is moving at the right pace (some viewers may find it slow). Throughout the film, it keeps a humorous note, while Joline reacts to the madness of the surrounding world with a warm, conscious, sometimes sad smile. All actors and actors give great performances and the musical result is impeccable. 9/10
