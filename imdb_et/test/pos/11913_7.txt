"Game Soldiers" is a story about the confusion that boys (most notably Sean Astin, Wil Wheaton and Kieth Coogan) are trying to save their school from a terrorist invasion after the American government is against a leading father. Lou Gosset Jr. is a school headmaster who is a vigorous man trying to discipline his students. <br /> <br /> "Game Soldiers" is a funny and pretty cool action and definitely a better hostage-crisis-school movie. I think most of the complaint comes from teen cast, but also terrorists don't come out so utterly useless that in some movies they never seem to be a scary group they should. Runaway inside the school and threatening to kill when the army or the police intervenes, this is a very difficult challenge for those groups that are going to save the school. In fact, they're pretty smart too. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that it was a pretty good movie. It keeps pace and does not get ridiculously sentimental or anything like that. Astin and Gosset Jr give good results. <br /> <br /> I also agree that this is an undervalued action film.
