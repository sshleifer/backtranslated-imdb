Black Scorpion is a funny female superhero who wears leather tights and drives a car that is able to get into his sniper armored Scorpion Mobile. She fights with evil Breathtaker and it's all a great time for good IMHO. I loved a bit about saying "Yo" to get a car for computer orders! Breathtaker is so bad that he wants to give asthma to the whole city! It's all up and it's the beauty! The scene where Black Scorpion attacks his partner steals the exhibition. You know it when you see it. The DVD also has a fun interview with Joan Severance. She's a doll. Black Scorpion is a fun DVD. I loved it!
