it doesn't matter whether the pulled or flabby is all the babes, but there are many girls who are so beautiful and hot but they seem to be so outraged. This movie is not an Oscar-type film, but it has at least a good view of what life is for young or "real" people. It made us laugh and learn to accept who they really are. this film represents the real world and what really matters.
