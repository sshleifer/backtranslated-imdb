I saw this movie in September with my mother. I was waiting for a good movie and I saw a very good movie. This is now my most valuable film. It didn't leave me after leaving the theater. The situations of this film reminded me of my old grandmother. Meryl Streep and Renee Zellweger were equally incredible. This film has made me realize how important family relationships are. Rent it. I can't recommend it enough.
