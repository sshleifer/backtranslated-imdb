As a teenager, I watched this movie every time it was on television (and it was on LOT) because it was a smart, appealing teen humor. It may not be what the critics look at with the 4-star, but I love what it is - a fun comedy that is to be enjoyed by the audience. Teen actors from my generation (probably why I love the movie so much) and like all the fantasy of all the favorite TVs of the early 90s, full house, family affairs, fresh prince - all exhibitions were represented and the result was probably the best teen movie of the 90s. Although it may not contain greater nudity and violence, so many teenage filmmakers think that the success of young demographics (or perhaps its absence) is very important, I recommend it to pre-teens and teenagers.
