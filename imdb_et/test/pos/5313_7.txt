After slowing the boy down, fifteen-year-old troubled and pessimistic Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) is sent to a minor's detention. Her teacher and candidate writer Pearl Madison (Don Cheadle) is coming close and trying to understand her, with the intention of writing a book and later getting her friend. Leland slowly expresses his sad vision of the world, showing that he is a sociopath. <br /> <br /> "Leland United States" is a depressive and interesting study. The low-paced riveting scenario discloses story pieces like a puzzle; there are excellent lines and dialogues; performances are great, although twenty-three-year-old Ryan Gosling does not convince a fifteen-year-old teenager; but it seems that some are missing to complete the puzzle and make an unforgettable movie for "leland states". Indeed, the explanation for the fact that Leland is not convincing and touching about violent action against Ryan Pollard really shows that this character is a totally confusing sociopian with a strange and sick world view. Next, how Allen Harris gets Pearl's knife is ridiculous. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Mundo de Leland" ("Leland World")
