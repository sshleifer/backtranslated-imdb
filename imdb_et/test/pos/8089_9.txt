This satire is just really dead and no one has been saved. But while this film is a stupid story and a Hitler's grotesque imitation (often referred to as "Hynkel" and ridiculous pseudo-German), the overall tone is quite sad, perhaps due to the film's place in history. And the actors are not so exaggerated that I think. One of the greatest moments of the film of all time must be the ending of the Jewish hairdresser if only such things had ended. It's not really a character who speaks anymore, this Chaplin says something he really wanted to say. If you ignore the technical aspects, do not know the date of the movie or the old one, it actually moves at a pretty nice pace. And the sharp humor we find everywhere in this work never dies, the only thing I don't care about is blow, but it's just the era I think. It is incredibly bold, tough for fascism, it is so hard to hit after these years.
