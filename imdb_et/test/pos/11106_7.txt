Late night, BBC1 was on the way to bed, but curiosity, trying to catch a contemporary Irish film, so I stayed for a few minutes and then I ended up. I have to admit that the main attraction was the only English actress, Kelly Reilly, who has a stunning look. <br /> <br /> This is a bill as a black comedy, one of the hardest things to pull. It should be the perfect blend of horror and terrible laugh, so you don't know why you're laughing at the end - the best example for me is Martin Scorsese's aftertaste (1985). Dead bodies are more black than comedy, but plots are rolling and spirals are moving towards further dirt. I didn't find the last strokes because some other posters did it so I was appropriately surprised. <br /> <br /> As the current situation in the Irish film industry in 2003, it seems quite worthwhile; it does not seem that they spent too much to do so, so it was able to get their money back. The script might have been much sharper, but the action was generally pretty good. I'm glad I looked at it, the shortcomings and everything, I don't think I learned much from Ireland today, especially their police methods!
