Although Boris (Aleksey Batalov) has won the war against the Germans for his mother-Russia, his beloved Veronika (Tatyana Samojlova) marries his innate cousin Mark (Alexander Shvorin) in a moment of weakness after his parents die in Moscow. Through various trials and betrayals, Veronika waits for a word or letter from Boris, no matter how long it lasts, in the hope that he will return. <br /> <br /> Powerful cinematography is just an incredible photo work by Sergei Urusevsky. Some of the many superbly framed, moving frames contain a scene where the camera follows Veronica, who loves each other and loves to say goodbye to each other with Boris. even if we look at Boris unexpectedly despite the lap. In the queue after the air strike, where Veronika walks around the stairs around the destroyed building, which he repeatedly called home, and where Mark makes his fearsome move to Veronica, when another air strike continues right outside the building, because the wind speaks of curtains and the light of light comes out there are only two of many of examples where Sergei Urusevsky shows in his genius the images that last forever on the film. But without the power of the story and the tragedy, how war can forever shape a couple who dearly love each other, fate, this film did not become a visual beauty alone. But together we have been left with an amazing movie. It's just a haunting masterpiece of the Soviet Union after Stalin breathes his last breath. I am honored to have just seen such a big movie.
