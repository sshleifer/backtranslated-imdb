My father's hero was my favorite movie when I was younger. It's about Andre, a divorced French man who wants to take his beautiful daughter (katharine heigl) on vacation, hoping he'll get closer to him. puberty, I think he is angry and hurt that his father was never with him and decided to give him a hard time. One day at the beach, Nicole meets beautiful Ben and she does her and her wild story. The whole island goes together and the movie becomes a fun wild entertaining movie.
