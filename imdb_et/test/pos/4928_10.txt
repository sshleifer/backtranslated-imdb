Tiny Toons is the first comic that I remember as a child, and I loved it every minute. When I was four or five, my parents bought a video of how I used my vacation. I looked at it again and again until I get every word every time. Well, a few days ago my three-year-old cousin came and I had to seduce him. I decided to show him that old childhood remnant. <br /> <br /> New, he would laugh, but I was surprised how much I laughed. As with any Tiny Toons movie and episode, humor is based on humor and lush humor and succeeds tremendously. Bugs, Babs, Plucky Duck, Maton Pig and Fifi are suffering with amazing adventures of white water rafting from Bugs and Babs with Superman, Plucky Duck and Maton pigs who travel to the largest amusement park to drive only monorail and Elmyra goes on a strange quest Cute kittens in safari countryside. <br /> <br /> Some classic humor is in this Tiny Toon adventure and there are some of the best crazy comedies I've ever seen. My favorite gag was to be a monorail thing when Hamton and Plucky arrive, drive in and out) Plucky's outrage. No matter what your age, you laugh at tears, but don't have to deal with language and nudity. <br /> <br /> Tiny Toons Adventures: How I Use Your Vacation. Celebrating Charles Adler, Tress MacNeille, Joe Alaskey and Don Messick. 5 of 5 stars.
