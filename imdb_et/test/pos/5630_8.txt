I'm proud to be a student at UW-Milwaukee where some of the movie was shot. Yes, I admit the Mitchell hall, where I took the film class, perhaps the same course as my fellow student Smith. <br /> <br /> There I found out about "American movie". Our professor soon told us about it before it was released. To be sure, I was intrigued, but for some reason I put it in for several months (it must have done pretty well if it still plays, at least in Milwaukee). <br /> <br /> When I finally saw it, I thought it was a fun documentary. It's not a masterpiece - it's going a little too long, but I find Mark's passion and dedication inspiring. I hope this film shows the beginning of great and better things. Maybe his forthcoming "Northwest" draws her luck. Who knows? <br /> <br /> Rating: *** (out ****) <br /> <br /> 108 min / Sony Pictures Classics
