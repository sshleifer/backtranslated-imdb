In one of the best places in Charlie Chaplin's longer short films, he puts a small man in the trenches of World War I, where he brings his intolerable courtesy and endless patience to the life of a generation where troops lived several months before they finally went up to fight the enemy and usually their death. As a Chaplin skill comic, someone needs to do something as tough as ditching a ditch into this brilliant comedy, but the irony used in the film makes even the most inconvenient conditions very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Like all the best Chaplin movies, short films and otherwise it's full of brilliant and memorable scenes, like the scene where he marks kills with a plot of ditch on board, deleting one when he gets his helmet shot down, scene, where he and his fellow citizens are sleeping under water, opening a beer bottle and lighting a cigarette, and of course passing the enemy. All of these scenes are show caps that resemble the most wonderful Chaplin scenes. This should not be missed!
