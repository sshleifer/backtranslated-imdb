If I look hard enough, there may be some bugs in this movie, mainly with a script. I found that Wolf's character is not entirely convincing. These were my only complaints. Because when this movie started the cable, I just planned to record it and watch it later. But from the beginning, when the terrible music and Cameron Diaz did their 60's dances, I was cursed. I never got up until the movie was over. It seemed I never even flashed. <br /> <br /> The performance of Cameron Diaz and Jordana Brewster was great. The scenes were beautiful, the girls were beautiful and the music was haunting and very touching. The story was quite unique and sometimes it was surreal. The viewer tends to like the picture more if they have a good understanding of the mental state of the young in the 60s and 70s, especially in America. Many scenes have, in principle, been able to show something that is difficult to capture. It was a bit more complicated than the simplified statement that they wanted to change the world and were disappointed, although this could be the most obvious aspect. Phoebe learns more and more about it than the movie is progressing. <br /> <br /> One aspect that did not seem to be covered by other reviewers who might mention is how the two daughters seem to be alive. after his father's death. They both respected him and his presence was a stabilizing factor in their lives, and he probably loved them. We read so much today that boys who lose their fathers too soon lose their way. This film covers the effect of the father's loss on the daughters who are left behind, first on the older sister Faith, and then on her younger sister. Their mother feels inadequate to try to be both parents. This type of dynamics is hardly covered by other films, especially in so many different layers of plots and sub-blocks. Phoebe's anti-reality struggles and insights are gradually stripped of the layers of onion. <br /> <br /> Talking about a plot, this movie should be higher than here. I was expecting a great conspiracy to be clear about the death of faith. How it solved it, surprised me, even if others could guess much earlier. <br /> <br /> Maybe not for everyone, but I can watch this movie several times.
