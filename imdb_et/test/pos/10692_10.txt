Wow. I've never seen or heard this movie. It just came on TV (2:00) and I'm totally scared. Setting up: A number of rich fat cats are out of golf. One strikes the ball hard. It lands on NINJA !!!! Tuxedoed man walks the ball up to pick. Ninja grabs it. Crushes it in hand. The man pulls the gun. Ninja pulls the blower. Ninja blows to throw a gun into the barrel. GUN EXPLODES !!!! It's just the beginning of the size, the people. Everyone has to watch this movie. 10 great ol fat stars are reliable.
