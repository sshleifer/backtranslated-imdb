There are many people who put down these 80s movies, but these people may not be out of date. I just started college when this movie appeared, so I could really appreciate it and my friends and I still joke about the film from certain lines. As much as I liked Sean Penn's Character Jeff Spicol's "Fast Times", I enjoy more of Chris Penn's character "Tommy" because he is a leading figure with more real talk, not just one liner like Spicoli. Chris Penn should probably pop this movie into his VCR and use it to lose motivation. Yes, the sub-block with the Vietnamese vet Randy Quaid seems a bit inappropriate, but he does a convincing job in this role. If there's someone who hasn't seen this movie but liked other similar movies like "Fast Times" etc, I highly recommend it.
