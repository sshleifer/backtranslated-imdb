This little-known comedy about Ruth Gordon's game is a joy. The game-based script is spicy, rich and completely endless. Go out, but I have to emphasize the work of the leading lady Irene Dunne. Irene is just great - as usual - and lights up the screen with every shot she has (and she's a lot of it, thank you for the sky). In addition, director Vidor has given him some unusual close-ups that are amazing. What gal! I don't know of any other Hollywood actors of any age who have their versatility and so convincing in every film. Why is he so little known is the mystery. I've seen most of his films and it was a surprise to even a solid ID fan like me. Look at it, all!
