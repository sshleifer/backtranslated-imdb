Wow, it has been a while since I looked at something mysterious about how it is portrayed. <br /> <br /> A detective event uses old-fashioned black-and-white images to portray a private detective dressed in an old designed ditch and hat. The theme of this animation is reminiscent of Sam Spayed, which Ash briefly mentioned. The hacker, which he thought was a useful option for the sum of four figures, could not go down and the rest is history. <br /> <br /> The end was a bit happier, but still fine. For those who love old fashion stories, this is for you.
