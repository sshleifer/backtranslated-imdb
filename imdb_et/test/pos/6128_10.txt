Of course, my 10/10 rating is valid only when you are ready to come out completely and completely *. Because you know that only John Waters can do it. "Pink Flamingos" (his debut debut) depicts two families locked in the struggle to see who can be the poorest person. What the Divine does at the end answers a lot to this question. But even if left aside, the film is basically an excuse to shock people beyond what one would normally imagine. To watch this movie, you had a very strong stomach. Even some lines are quite fascinating. <br /> <br /> * Otherwise, avoid using a movie like your ebola virus!
