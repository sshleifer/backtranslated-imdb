SUPERMAN Cartoon <br /> <br /> There is a large golden shipment by train across the country. Using ultra-modern techniques, sophisticated hooded thieves try to catch gold. The impatient reporter Lois Lane, as the only passenger on board, has it to rescue Superman. But now that it has become a robbed train, can it even stop BILLION DOLLAR LIMITED? <br /> <br /> This was another great cartoon from Max Fleischer, produced for Paramount Studio. They have great animation and tense, fast moving plots. It is thought that they will be shown in cinemas, they will be in front of miles on their Saturday morning.
