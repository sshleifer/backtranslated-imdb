I think this movie is different from the other movies I've seen. It was somewhat exciting, and regardless of what others say, I was surprised at the final solution. Certainly it didn't come! While it's sad, it's worth a look. I can't think of a movie like that! The actors knew what they were doing. When you say that this movie sucks, you probably say what most people would say. But if someone says this movie is normal, I absolutely disagree. And Norman Reedus should be more noticed. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm a freak, but I really liked it. It was such a mess, but who cares? I'm tired of eternal and ordinary movies.
