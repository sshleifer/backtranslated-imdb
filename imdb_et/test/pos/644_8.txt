I finished this movie and my only comment is "OH! WOW!". Jennifer Beals is like a bride, but Yancy Butler as a female dance teacher is a pure sexual dynamite! Having watched him at WITCHBLADE, I was not ready for the pure, unsuccessful sensuality and raw sexual excitement he brings to the screen. <br /> <br /> I see this movie again ... as for Yancy Butler just like Corrinne!
