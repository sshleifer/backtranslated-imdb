The "good news" is that the circus is in town. The "bad news" is that Bugs Bunny's underground home is right. He wakes up when his place shakes like an earthquake when it strikes when workers weigh the stakes into the ground and the elephants rub, etc. Specifically, the lion cage is positioned just above the Bugs hole. The lion sniffs food and eliminates it being a rabbit. The bugs, the curious things that all the rackets are, know the way through the tunnel and breeze into the mouth of the lion. <br /> <br /> I'll tell BB about this: he's totally fearless, at least in this cartoon, and at least 30 seconds. When he reaches his mind, he runs like a crazy and gets the rest of the lion-versus rabbit battle. Once again, Bugs faces a silly opponent he calls "Nero", but the lion is tough and Bugs needs all his minds and somewhat fake breed to fight this beast. <br /> <br /> About half the gags are stupid and the other half funny, but always fast, colorful and good enough to recommend. I mean, it's not every day when you see a lion on a trap or do a hula dance!
