This wonderful 3-part BBC production is one of the most pleasing love stories I've ever seen. The actors are very high, especially Rachael Stirling, like Nan Astley. He's funny, seductive and cute. Scenes and close kisses are very erotic, regardless of their sexual preference. <br /> <br /> Characters are well defined and highly believable. I think this is a by-product of a good adaptation of a well-written novel. <br /> <br /> A truly remarkable and fast paced drama that quickly speeds up a couple of bored (but necessary) scenes at the beginning. <br /> <br /> My voice: 9/10
