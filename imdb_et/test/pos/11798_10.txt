I had never heard of this movie when it was given to me, so I didn't know what to expect. I checked it from IMDb and became curious. It didn't take long to understand that it was a pearl. Outstanding performances, a great story and so well-run and well-written. It's hard to compare with other movies, but "Stand by Me" comes to mind, although it has the same differences as Cure similarities. The story of extraordinary friendship between young boys and the dramatic and humorous elements are the most obvious similarities between this film and "Stand by Me". Other than the fact that "cure" is a good movie on its own, it is worth having a broader recognition. It's dramatic, but also adventurous, sad, but also humorous. I can't think of one thing that bothers me. That said, I don't want to give the impression that it's a "perfect movie", whatever that means, but rather that I enjoyed it enormously, it was very touching and didn't change anything in it. I'm not going to go into the story / detailed description of the plot, partly because it would be too general or too revealing, and partly because you find this information elsewhere on the site. Finally, I can only say: Wonderful movie, see if you have a chance.
