I first saw this docudrama in the United Kingdom in the 1980s and found myself interesting and then surprised at how such good intentions could go wrong. Earlier commentators (who are from Australia) have explained the details of a well-established plot better than I would ever have, but I would like to make an observation about what may be behind the sovereign power of the Governor-General of the United Kingdom. All modern laws, as I understand them, need an ethical or philosophical root to first exist and become law at all. In this case, and if so, the confusion in Conner / Khemlan was likely to have been created (how many businesses / millions were received by Khemlan, probably without a complaint), then the labor government could have been victims of "detention", which would certainly have had to be investigated by the Director General or until he saw that the budget deviation was the real result of Whitlam's disrespect, and NOT DEVELOPED by sponsor "man or person unknown"! If this is the case that Kerr did not actually have to refer to the law, because the fiscal circumstances ignore everything, then "royal power" is limited to injustice; Consequences in any Commonwealth country is that "fiscal rules" are literally and that every person or organization has Carte Blanche to break any other rule, physical or spiritual, as long as they have final control over the purses!
