I have spoken out of words to describe the beauty of "Cranes are flying", but I'm still trying to write about it. It is a powerful and gentle love story that is located in World War II. This is a classic story of lovers (Boris & Veronika), which is the difference between war and war. The images of the film are so proud that you are going away - the film is in the ideal sense of emotion. <br /> <br /> There are few scenes that represent war directly: Bombing - Wind, Lightning - Explosions - that have important consequences for the life of the main protagonist Veronika, who is waiting for Boris to return; and there is yet another scene where we are faced with an emotional / visual hurricane that shows images played in Boris's mind. The second scene works on the film and gives it the title - cranes flying in the sky. This image is a symbol of nature and its seasons and highlights the last message of the film: not to give up hope and fight for a better future. <br /> <br /> Kalatozov is a great director, this movie is visually stunning and it touched me deeply. It's not just a clean technique. <br /> <br /> Tatyana Samoylova is perfect as Veronica. What else to say? The film goes beyond the time it was made - the action takes place during World War II. But it could have happened anytime and anywhere. As long as there are wars (big or small), the film and its message will remain relevant.
