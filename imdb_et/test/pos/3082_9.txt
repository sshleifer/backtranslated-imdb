Like many babies born in the 1980s, I grew up in Mel Brooks films that were not necessarily "racers" like Blazing saddles and the world's first part of history (I saw them, of course, though not as often as now), but those designed for the whole family, Spaceballs and this movie. At that time I knew I didn't see a great art, but just a camel, a silly, though always laughing Robin Hood and / or adventure films. But by calling it in the family picture quotes, this means that: a) adults can enjoy it as much as children, if not more, because they are little joking and stupid, and b) when a child sees it again, when it looks again I have a couple of times, it's just as fresh, but some things aren't quite understandable for the first time. This is a comedy that is not only full of jokes in Robin Hood's movies and other films (of course Godfather, too little to mention about other contemporary films) but also Brooks' own films; it is a filmmaker who doesn't even let his style entertain himself. <br /> <br /> The main story - Robin Hood (Cary Elwes in one of his best appearances) returns home to see things endangered by King Richard and so goes back to recovering his land and of course robbing the rich to feed the poor. Along the way he meets Achoo (Dave Chappelle), butt head with Prince John (Richard Lewis) and sheriff, and of course games for Maid Marian's love. This is, of course, a regular laundry line for Brooks, which lets comedy go into scenes, and although sometimes it may not happen again, it may happen again. It also helps to make a few bits one of the best in Brooksfile, such as the godfather bit (Dom DeLouis at its best), Brooks' own body, such as Rabbbi, Lewis and Chappelle, and the endless bond lines and a few tongue-in-cheek songs. Some of this is obvious, yes, some of it just goes directly from the Blazing saddle pages, but is it the right time for the right crowd? Certainly - and for the parents who grew up in Brooks in the 1970s, this is a great opportunity to introduce young people to their work (not even relatives joking and not being R-ratings, all are fun).
