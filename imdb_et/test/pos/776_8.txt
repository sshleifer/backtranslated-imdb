"Driving Lessons" shows that two middle-class British families meet head-on when Grint's character touches Evee (Walters). Grint deceives her vigorous and transcendental mother (Linney) and goes to Eve with Scotland to take part in a trip to attend poetry reading, something she claims may be her last illness. <br /> <br /> The masterpiece of this movie is Grint's depiction of young people in a cage, brainwashed by a terrifying and even hypocritical mother. His portrayal of a fallen teenager seeking his true morals and happiness is exciting to watch all the time. The film is sharply captured and well-paced, with very few moments that make you tired, accomplished, especially considering the nature of the plot. Walters really grabs his character with both hands and brings the audience to him, emphasizing Linney's ironic immorality all the time. His role in "driving hours" is in some ways enjoyable and memorable. <br /> <br /> The plot is developing nicely, leaving the audience to grab Grint when he returns to Eve during his lunch break. the local bookstore apologizes for their violations. The values ​​on the piece are continued and brought out very consistently until final drawing. The overwhelming, (and alleviating) idea is that religion does not lead to happiness and certainly does not lead to morality. <br /> <br /> Audience is encouraged by a radical but loving Evee, and Grint made an irresistible partnership on the big screen, delivered straight from her debut in the Harry Potter series. Charismatic and beautiful action with a tense and true pace of script make it close to Christmas.
