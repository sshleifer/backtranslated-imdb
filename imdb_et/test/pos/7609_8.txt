I saw this movie for the first time years ago when it was still new and I was happy. This is a great story of Hollywood beliefs for teenagers. But it's not lifelike. As much as you would like to believe it, these stories will never happen. That's why it irritates watching such movies. They play with teenagers, but imagine how many girls still in high school believed in this magic and deceived. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my little sister or my cousin. The director should have thought about acting rather than thinking about the actor, but thinking. Yes, they (actors) were good, but the idea is not worth 10. There are many films about young people. Why don't we do better?
