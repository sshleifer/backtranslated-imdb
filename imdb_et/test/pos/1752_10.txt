Mr. Bug Goes to Town was the last great achievement that Fleischer studios produce. The quality of the Superman series produced at the same time is evident in this extraordinary film. <br /> <br /> The music and words of Frank Loesser and Hoagy Carmichael (with the help of Flieshcher veteran Sammy Timberg is pretty good, but not as much as evaluating Leigh Harline's image, who also captures the snow white for Disney. Harline " atmospheric music "is great and gentle for the ears. <br /> <br /> The layout and staging of the picture was outdated by Fleischer's annual artists, but the color beauty of the film cannot be denied, and although Hoppity's grasshopper is a star, Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito characters steal the picture. Pronunciation by Jack Mercer (Popeye's fame) is invaluable. Kenny Gardner (brother) Guy Lombardo ... and his vocal in his band ... makes his usual pleasant work in the role of Dick Dickinsen. Fleischer Studios were animation experts par excellence and it shows very clearly in the final product The film is loud, the story is very big at all ages and the ultimate scenes of their scanning errors are rising skyscrapers is one of the best productions and animations of any animated movie in the past and present. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this wonderfully hand-drawn movie. Also, the title sequence is not fully understood by Max Fleischer's remarkable three-step steroptic process, which took four months to build 16,000 small glasses in Manhattan's electrified buildings. <br /> Don't leave Mr Bug in town ... aka Hoppity goes to town. I bet you are on the lookout for the results!
