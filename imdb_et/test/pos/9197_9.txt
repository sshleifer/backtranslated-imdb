This is probably one of those films that was commented too much, but not discovered ... This is probably one of the masterpieces of Spanish cinema, like some of Bu√±uel's masterpieces. "15 Days With You" Could Be Better "Now And Their" Recurring Visits From Other Long-Lasting Movies: Could Be A Midnight Cowboy, But May Be "Les Amants du Pont-Neuf" Or Realistic And Non-Spot Look (but the most realistic) "trainspotting". This difficult story is a place for humor, love, and probably a dramatic idea. In the new social Spanish cinema, this little diamond could be the resurrection of Italian neo realism, mixed with the best Ken Loach films. <br /> <br /> Probably a better movie I discovered over the last 10 years.
