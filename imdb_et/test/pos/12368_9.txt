New Year's Eve, Astrid Holm's tuberculous sister asks her mother and her colleague Maria (Lisa Lundholm) to call David Holm (Victor Sjöström) to visit her in her deathbed. At the same time, alcoholic David speaks to two other drunken legends of the Phantom trainer and his coach legend: according to legend, the last sinner, a soul collector, will die at the New Year's Eve, gathering the souls of his coach. When David denies visiting Edit, his friends have an argument with him, they fight and David dies. When the trainer arrives, he recognizes his friend Georges (Tore Svennberg), who died at the end of last year. George again looks at David's disgusting life and setbacks, showing how average and selfish David was. <br /> <br /> "Körkarlen" is an impressive and stylish silent film with superb special effects (for a 1921 movie). The characters are very well developed; but the story is dated and there is a strange and inexplicable situation when Sister Edit says she loves David Holm. Why should an enlightened woman love such a despicable man who is wasting his life by breaking other people? Despite being religious today, it finally gives a beautiful message of faith and redemption. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Carroça Fantasma" ("The Phantom Coach")
