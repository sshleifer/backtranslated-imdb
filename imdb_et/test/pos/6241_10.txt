This is one of my favorite fear films of my time and I thought it was never really gone. This is until I read glowing comments here. Many seem to feel the same as I saw it for the first time. <br /> <br /> This is a horrible creepy movie and I've spent most of my life watching horrible movies. I've always found dolls, dummies, and such a fucking horrible! Check out the dolls on the "Door" and of course the great "Terrorism". And what a great Twilight Zone episode "Living Doll". Hell, dolls are horrible! The tourist has a few moments that make your hair on the back of your neck. Everything that is supported by a great soundtrack that just makes Connor's performance even harder than the heart. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this movie trailer on late night television and the thing, "Wow, I have to see it!" It was memorable. And this is one of the only trailers I remember as a boy who was trying to get me out. I took years to see it, but it was petting. <br /> <br /> Stephen King also mentions this movie in his "Danse Macabre" book and gives him a glowing recommendation. Pretty good company. <br /> <br /> This movie is always on my main view list. This is a true genre of the era and deserves to be among the top 70s.
