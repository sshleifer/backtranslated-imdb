So many great talents were used in "The Best Years of Life", the result of which must be somewhat wonderful. Think about what his director William Wyler was facing; After a military victory over the statistical authorities who had committed terrible crimes and fought the world when he fought, he made a film claiming that US leaders themselves were thoroughly anti-individual - that they had "wasted the best years of fighting or fighting the deceived life of people who have not ignored the rights of individuals was nothing more than a dispute about slavery. Julia Heron, Gregg Toland's cinematography and Robert E. Sherwood's "Rome on the Road" author and scripts are beautiful sets. The ironic title was used for a broad but thematic drama of actors such as Frederic March, Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, Dana Andrews, Virginia Mayo, Cathy O'Donnell and Hoagy Carmichael. The clever plot line was the experience of your "couples" after the soldiers (three enlightened) tried to get home to a "victory culture". Their bitter experience and their understanding of their need to fight again against what is happening The website gives a strong and pleasant contrast to the usual notion that "everything was fine" in America. March and her husband have a terrible time to adapt and drink; O'Donnell's young man Harold Russell has hooks on hands and wonders when life can even live, and the worst Andrews woman throws her dough guy and has lost years, causing employers to ignore or deny their rights to work that she is considering her individual values ​​so she would even have it what he had before his life and that was a danger to the arena - nothing and a loss of everything he had ever had. Three must respond n wanted to fight again, every one for his own good luck; and all three manage to find the courage to continue fighting - everyone has his own for the happiness that is now threatened by the curious anti-suicide that is indifferent to American America. Yeah, where Andrews is sitting in the mothballed B-17 cockpit, alone and Russell's wedding scene is great. It's the most powerful film and big one, one woman and men can agree once. Hugo Friedhofer's music and Irene Sharaff's costumes add to their brightness. One of the best and most unexpected movies of all time, stunning B / W.
