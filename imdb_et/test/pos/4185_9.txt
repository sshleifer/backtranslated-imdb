Injury monkeys. People have always accused them of being produced (what they were) or nothing other than attacking the Beatles America (again, what they were), but for the children of that time who were real, they were important, they were justified. Discussions about who was better in Monkee or The Beatles were common in school gardens, but critics, but they never bought it. In spite of the very memorable recording of classic pop music, Monkess did not get much respect for his albums. Unfortunately, the same fate met with a single film, despite being the best banners. Beatle fans may argue that "Hard Days Night" was better and I am sure many kids think "8 miles" was better, but none of these movies was as daring and inventive as "Good" and that's probably the reason why it failed. <br /> <br /> If the driver had said the story of A-B was a story, maybe it would have turned to fans of young fans, but pressing the envelope and using the film's chance to mock their picture really sabotaged their fans. Could you imagine Eminem turning to the camera and actually talking about how sad it is to be the best-selling boy in a genre where only 5% (and I am generous) of the actions is white. If you can imagine it, if you have an idea how bold Monkess was singing "Hey, Hey, we are monkeys. You know we want. Produced a picture with no philosophy". If you have a film in which Frank Zappa tells Davy that he should focus less on dancing and more music, then it is clear that there is much more than you expect. <br /> <br /> The story that exists exists for boys who are trying to escape their leader, who at one point forces them to play dandruff in commercial, but every time they flee, they reach the box. I don't think you have to be Fellini to figure out the bits of this bit. Some neat little comedy bits follow Davy as a boxer who has to give up the violin to dive in a big match and Peter refuses to throw away the ice cream cone he doesn't want because there are hungry children, so there is a wrong food waste, but the real point of sale for this movie is the music and its some of the best bands. Even if the story is rejected, you can sit back and enjoy the fun of music. <br /> <br /> Every movie that starts and ends with Mickey, who tries to jump from a suicide bridge (at the end of the band will never be a classic class, but if you are a fan of an era or an experimental cinema, you will enjoy it movie.
