I was fortunate to see a few months ago a screening test of El Padrino in Santa Monica. I was blown. You can't see such movies anymore. In Scosese vein, Chapa tells the story of Kilo trilically when he maneuvers through the steep streets of LA to rise above the ranks to become a drug lord. The characters are complex and contradictory. Emotions are real. Action is fast and furious. Stunts are wide. And Tilly is hot. He hasn't looked at this good since his "tied" days. I recommend it to anyone. This is a fantastic honor for the epic films of the late 80s and early 90s. And to all naysayers there? check it again; you probably had your eyes closed for the first time. Congratulations to everyone in the film. I read the days until the sequel is released. Who has this date?
