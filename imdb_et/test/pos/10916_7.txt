*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** I loved the setting and constantly smiled the whole movie. Action was great because my favorite was Howard (Kevin Kline), who is trying to be a man. The team and the parents did a great job as a supportive pain. Spoiler Warning: Attempting to accept his conservative family and courtesy was warm and credible from the heart. My only problem at the end was that Howard was actually gay. The film's structure is "who you want to be," but the film actually does the opposite. Howard's logic behind his "discovery" is that he loves Barbra Streisand's films and enjoys dancing with music. His admonitions and flavors seem to be gay and it is not until he is told that he understands it. Instead of releasing Howard, he displaces him. She likes to dance to music if she has to be gay. His confession in the marriage felt bending to the wishes of society. Ultimately, the movie becomes a gay rights film that was not the original course. It gets almost boring. I believe that the film would have been better when the Howard was straight. It would have been more serious to the message.
