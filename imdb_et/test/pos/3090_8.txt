As another IMDb reviewer says, "... imagine 2001: the cosmos in the Odyssey desert" and you would not be far from a brief summary of what this cinema should expect (I am very afraid of the word "film"). A lecture on philosophical views on creativity, myths surrounding humanitarian existence, before and after, it has been, is and will be. It may be on some sand, or 2001, but they solve different philosophical views, one on development and the future, hope and the potential of humanity, while Fata Morgana is a somewhat metaphysical trek. I only hope that I will be able to communicate it effectively enough. <br /> <br /> Herzogs don't like the style, and those who don't adhere to the cinematic viewing branch are very likely to find it hard, and may not even see their finale in 72 minutes. Fata Morgana is an assembly from the Sahara, including villages, villagers and many other places in the Sahara, including villages, villagers and various places that are somewhat surreal, music of different genres, and almost mythical narration, but it is extremely slow at the moment, but ultimately extremely rewarding. <br /> <br /> Open with assembly on landing planes of various filmed frames for almost five minutes, you will already be tremendously confused with the introduction of the film and the fact that it is not everything you have seen before you remember your mind. The three sections, creation, paradise and golden age are divided into Fata Morgan and succeeds in matching the natural beauty of the desert with human factors. His three segments are spoken by different individuals who are specifically involved in a particular section, with a particular emphasis on long soliloquy and desolation. <br /> <br /> Fata Morgana is a film about human existence on our Earth. It looks at the beauty of nature on Earth while looking at the potential beauty within us that shows us our negative contribution to the world in which we live. Each shot is purposefully designed using what can be described in the context of this film as "filming the Holy Trinity" in pictures, words and music. Each of these three parts gives something special to each picture, but when they are brought together, they create something bigger than their parts, they create an unlimited beauty and deep sense of our mind. I can't do this movie with just the words he deserves, that is, when I have pictures and scores, and I know that the masses don't understand it, but it's deep and I'm not using the term "feature film" because it's just art. It is a moving art that moves your mind and irritates the soul. Whether creativity is your wish is irrelevant because this film is a smart design.
