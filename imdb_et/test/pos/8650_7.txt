The whole movie made me think of Dante's first round of Inferno, where the souls who "fool" themselves, believing that they are happy, go. They will never realize that they are actually inferno, but nothing is enjoyable, they just move without emotions. In this sense, Dante thought they were worse because they would never try to change their situation. No one can die in this place, but will certainly try to hurt. I'm not sure if the writer relied on his medieval manuscript or not, but the similarity is absolutely striking. <br /> <br /> I didn't enjoy this movie when I watched it because I was expecting a climax that never came. Nevertheless, it made me think after that and now I think it's a good movie - it's definitely sure.
