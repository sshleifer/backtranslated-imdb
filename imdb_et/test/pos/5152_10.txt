Roy Anderssons "Du Levande" is not entirely original because it is the opponent of the previous film "Sånger från andra våningen". The film, however, has full originality. Some movie agreements are still being thrown away: most of the actors do not see what you would expect in the movie and the shots take a long time. Most time cameras don't move, but people move around. The shots begin somewhere and landscapes accumulate repeatedly in amazing proportions. W.G. Sebald recalls the same technique in the literature. Due to the time invested in every shot, the suspension in many scenes is really high. There is a story and no - it is up to the viewer to build his own. This movie is positive. Certainly, this is not negatively perceived and at the same time it does not pass social injustice. The one message I got was that maybe not all the bugs and accidents could be fatal. Great movie.
