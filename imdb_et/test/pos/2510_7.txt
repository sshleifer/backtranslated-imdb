Although it is definitely an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours and it is always worth checking out, this film never meets the goals that should be for two reasons. First, after the first forty-five minutes, it is heavily focused on Helen and Johnny, who have much less interesting signs than most others - Janet, Jennifer, George and Miss Scattergoods are much more appealing. Although it initially works, we do not always know anything about life, and since the idea that perhaps Helen might be involved with her, she will quickly wear thin and we want to see other characters. Secondly, the film seems to lose its way in the second half of the year. The letter itself is of much less importance than in the first half, and again, although it works in some ways well, it seems strange to leave as much potential as it is in the first half of the year. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is sweet and good-natured, with some really fun moments - for example, Janet, who explains the delicious audience. The lazy, but quietly desperate atmosphere that Helen feels is difficult and the feeling of living in a small seaside town is accurately depicted, but the film is not as smart as it is trying. It just disappears as a light romantic comedy as well as a portrait of smart life. But it is still good and if you get the chance it is definitely worth it.
