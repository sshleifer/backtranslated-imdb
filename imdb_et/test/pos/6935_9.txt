Just Zombie Bloodbath finished the first part of CAMP Motion Pictures' amazing Zombie Bloodbath Trilogy DVD. Zombie Bloodbath 2: The rage of Undead is as follows. Now it was a bit of a confusion for me because there are some holes in the plot and some confusing twists, but this is a better film on many levels. Indeed, director Todd Sheets shows great style and talent between two films. Again, it is not for people who want shiny and Hollywood-style horror movies, it's for people who like their zombies bloody, raw and grainy. The story as far as I could say was basically about two robbers who tried and stole from older couples only in 1945 to find that the couple is a member of the cult. One man is simply killed and the other who is responsible has basically become a scarecrow and a cross, and they stand in a close life, still alive, but die. The cut-to-date commercial and full of college kids will break near the farmhouse. At the same time, the convicted group gets access to a nearby prison. Both groups arrive in the same house. The house was the one with whom the elderly lived, and if one of the convicted people captures the peacock and takes the jacket, it causes the awakening of the peacocks and, in turn, brings the members of the cult back to death. Wow. And it's all in the first half of the year. There is another plot in the city where a few types of killer have taken some of the workers hostage. It actually works because the people trapped in the house finally flee and reach the same Delhi. Most twists work pretty well, but it is obvious that the film was too good in some places because it's good. It all ends with a huge showdown with the rest of the heroes who find a delivery truck or something full of meat eating bacterial vials. Of course, they throw it at the Undead and cause some big thaws and a couple of heads explode and then we get an odd, thought provoking end. First, let me say that although it was not always easy to follow, I still had a lot of time with this movie. It was fun and the actor was pretty bad for a low budget effort. It was obvious that Todd Sheets really tried to bring more to the table than a normal zombie film, and in this respect he has succeeded. It had better special effects than the first movie, high tempo and some cool music and visual plus. In addition, INSIDE has become a real show-cap when the knife is stuck through it. Take care here and it shows. The weakness lies in the scripts and some lazers. Again, I recommend listening to the comment line. It was even better than the first and I learned a lot. As you know, some scenes were shot on the Super 8 film to make the film happen and the movie was destroyed and used by the lab. And they had made the film for a while when they got back to the movie, so some confusion arises from some of the scenes that aren't on the film. I also learned that Todd Sheets really has a passion and love for making movies. It shows. The film is a good example of the fact that the budget cinema has not yet written, but still looks more like most DV movies. Not quite as fun as the first film, though a technically better film. I really admire Capacity as one of the true innovators and migrants in the DV cinema field ... and it's a great addition to the cheap zombie genre!
