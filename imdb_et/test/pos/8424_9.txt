This review has been written by someone who has read it (many times) and knows what they are talking about. Firstly, I have read other comments and noticed that some of the objections were really quite stupid. People who have read a book and other Jane Austen or any of these things know that sticking to the book is very important because you need to trust the author about what they are doing. If the viewer does not like it, it MUST be well on the book and shows that they do not understand Jane Austen and probably are not a real fan. <br /> <br /> First of all, if the viewer really loved the book or Jane Austen, it wouldn't be difficult to watch it in four hours. Secondly, their society took much care of their appearance and so large, fancy hair styles showed how wealthy you were, which was the key factor in "good" societies on their day. I have to admit that the women's costumes were not great, but there were only a few bad ones and the men prepared it; through their uniforms for school or work because they have casual clothes and it was the same in the 19th century. Also, if it works, it is very good, it's fine because Jayne Austen writes! and the scene at the end is beautiful. You can't compare filming with the 1995 version because the technology has so much improved because it is ridiculous to compare them. An actor playing Ann is too old, but her air is working and how she does it. <br /> <br /> People seem to prefer the 1995 version for some reason I don't understand! It doesn't stick with the book at all, and it is flat, the end is sentimental, they make bigger scenes, the only good actors are the leaders and they give you a good job for what was given to them. Obviously, those who are really, really like, (I'm sorry) fools, because they don't understand persuasion and need it too much. The 1971 version is beautiful, romantic, written by a great script writer (the same as the inspector Morse), was a very good actor, and indeed it is a movie that can be seen many times and you can enjoy it every time.
