This is another Hollywood Arrogance case that requires a French style mask. The original, Mon Pere ce heros, was one of the most charming films of 1991, so Hollywood accountants naturally thought they could hire Depardie and call the rest. They did, however, take precautionary steps to hire Francis Veber to write English. version, although it uses almost every original word. Depardieu brings his Gallic charm and Katherine Heigl shows all the promises that have now been made. The thing is that when the French make a sort of Lolita, they get away with it because the "dirty French postcard" thinks for them; here's the slight nuance of Hollywood's idea that Depardieu (completely unaware that his daughter has actually announced that he is his lover) ruled to play and sing "something in French", starting with a cheerful version of "Little Heavenly Girls. See the original.
