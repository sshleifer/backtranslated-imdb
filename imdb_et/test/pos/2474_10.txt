The most amazing film I've ever seen. I didn't read programming, and I accidentally hit the movie. I thought it was a real documentary and I felt sick. I only found that it was a movie after it was finished, and I looked at the web for more information about the "Penalty Park" in the US. It seemed incredibly real and it is easy to believe that this has happened in the US when you are from Europe. I have to admit that when I was watching the movie, and before I found out that it did not, I felt truly American.
