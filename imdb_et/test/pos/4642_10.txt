For a movie that was PG, it's one fun movie. I grew up watching this movie over and over again. It's really fun, I don't know how today's audience would respond, but if you grew up or loved it, it's a great movie. Stephen Furst is great as Harold, who I think is one of the best characters in the movie. Paul Ruebens will also appear for about 10 minutes. I love nostalgia.
