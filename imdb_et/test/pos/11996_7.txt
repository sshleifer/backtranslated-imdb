Caddyshack 2 has a terrible reputation, just because it is a highly regarded classic. People have criticized the film for a lot of reasons, but they all finally return to the fact that it is not Caddyshack. <br /> <br /> To begin with, I would just like to say that we should simply take the Caddyshack equation and consider this film on its own initiative, but I think it would be unfair. The film has much in common with its predecessor. Class-related topics "snobs versus slobs" and the desire to place their class are as common as the first film. Two things that are really missing here are Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield, who are replaced by Dan Ackroyd and Jackie Mason respectively. <br /> <br /> Now I am not going to try and claim that Ackroyd is coming to Murray, but Jackie Mason is an amazing successor to Dangerfield. He leaves as a cross between Dangerfield and Arnold Stang, but without biting too much. I wouldn't say he's somewhere funny when Dangerfield is in Caddyshack, but there are many more references to his character and dilemma in the film. </p> A movie that is another popular complaint. Maybe these naysayers did not notice that he only got up the first movie a few times. For my money, his scenes here are a lot more fun than being somewhat overridden. <br /> <br /> Although I'm on this subject, it's really an excessive direction for this movie that brings it down. It is so much self-conscious when trying to laugh. Many jokes work and there are too many of Gopher who seem to have taken a lot of anthropomorphic personality and voice when we didn't think of the idea that it was funny. > <br /> The characters are similarly worshiped at home, especially the smarmy yuppy kids. Jackie Mason rarely misses a shot and is consistently pleasant and very funny, but we don't need a tango at all! The director is probably not the same as the school of Harold Ramis. Not to say that Caddyshack was subtle, but the local jokes are just over boiled and most of them are unnecessarily decorated with original music. <br /> <br /> All the things that are fun, funny movie say something about class and identity that very few movies at that time were told. Don't put it in an awful low rating for IMDb, look at it yourself.
