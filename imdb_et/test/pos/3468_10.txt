I've been waiting for this movie since I first hooked up, and I'm so glad I got it. This is a really great movie. The actors are great, writing is fresh and real, the whole thing was on the spot. I love James McAvoy on this issue and I can't wait to see him in "Lion, Witch, and Wardrobe". Romola Garai is also great. Be sure to check it out with your favorite movie "I hit the castle" or "Nicholas Nickleby". In general, I thought I liked this movie because it wasn't a chicken. It's a difficult topic to talk about the fact that you are very likely to offend many people or confuse and turn it into some too sentimental-sweet sweet love. But they refrained from doing this and instead made a movie that is real, honest and touching, yes, but never up. Very well done. Amazingly well done. Go out and see, and you know exactly what I mean.
