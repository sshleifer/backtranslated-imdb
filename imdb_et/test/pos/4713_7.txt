A powerful film that has recovered in the second half of 2007 with much of its meaning after the Burmese people's new despair against these tyrants. I felt a complicated mix of feelings about the people there, the same compassion and admiration at the same time, with some rage, because I feel that no one, neither the world nor myself, does anything to stop this shame. I think these feelings changed directly from the movie and that they were meant to be done, so it's a successful film. The desire for peace, the search for enlightenment, the respect for life sometimes leads to subordination. In fact, the Buddhist Burmese culture has left the doors open to their dictators. But how can you be angry with these poor people?
