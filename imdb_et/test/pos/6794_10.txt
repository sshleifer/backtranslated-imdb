This film is boring and probably children today, even if the whole thing is not a Jedi. Of course, Elizabeth Taylor was the most beautiful child in the world, and her actions are also great. Even Mickey Rooney is good; so are Anne Revere and Angela Lansbury. The world was the film where this film appeared, and it is definitely a great place to visit.
