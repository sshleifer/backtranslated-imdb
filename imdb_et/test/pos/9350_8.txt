Record your noir best. The "Crossfire" immediately following the Second World War (1946) represents the good, the bad and the ugly of this time. Monty Montgomery kills Sami because Sam is a Jew and is therefore automatically perceived by Monty's narrow lens that he has abandoned his fight against a soldier. Monty doesn't like such people. The truth is that Sam was also a soldier, but the truth is something that disappears when you correctly feel the hatred of ideologies that you dive and the world is full of dirty and that is the "cleansing" brand you need. <br /> <br /> Monty is a soldier's winner. The losers of World War II also had more than their share, and hated, prejudiced leaders and soldiers hated. Some of them were hanging on war crimes, such as starting an "aggressive war". <br /> <br /> This movie got its creators in trouble when another American sadistic cleaner Joe McCarthy got his hearings in the early 1950s. <br /> <br /> See "Crossfire" to see how good the actor Robert Ryan was. Real Robert Ryan was not Monty. He was great, underestimated, under the actor used. <br /> <br /> See "Crossfire" and get a taste of America after World War II. Look at this to get the good taste of the late 40s. Robert Mitchim and Robert Young also play a leading role. Mitchim could have played the role of Ryani, in fact he did it when he played psychopath "Cape Fear".
