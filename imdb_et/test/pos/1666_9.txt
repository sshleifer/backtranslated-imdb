I heard they intend to do this French classics in 2007 and I see that this is in the 2011 development. This is a disgrace because Hollywood put Jules Dassini, a writer / director, on the notorious black list. They should not have the right to redesign their films. <br /> <br /> I love "capri" movies and "movie noir" and it combines the best of both. <br /> <br /> Tony (Jean Servais) comes out after nickle and wins his old girlfriend (Marie Sabouret) with his friends Mario (Robert Manuel) and Jo (Carl MÃ¶hner), which makes it The big capricious planning of robbery is paying attention to detail. You see, this is reflected in the capes of George Clooney Vegas. Nothing leaves random. <br /> <br /> Capri gets big, but Grutter (Marcel Lupovici) sends his sons for Robert Hossein and Pierre Grasset to Tony and Gang. After blowing with Mario, they kidnap Jo's son. Many balls fly before it ends. <br /> <br /> Great director's big movie. Standard to measure other capric films.
