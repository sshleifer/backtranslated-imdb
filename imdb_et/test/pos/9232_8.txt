Someone has defined the definition of the INTELLECTUAL: "The person who can listen to" The William Tell Overture "without thinking about LONE RANGER!" We accept this with heart! It would certainly be a long task to achieve this and one that Leopold Stokowski, Arturo Toscanini or .Leonard Bernstein would all find almost impossible. <br /> <br /> And there is no shame. Radio series and TV series, along with some film series, film films, syndicate comic strips and comic books, played a part in making the "Plains Man of the Plains and his faithful Indian companion, Tonto" a deeply sown element. about our collective psyche and our literary folklore. <br /> <br /> As with most legends, it all started gradually, first with Radio Plays, written for local use in Detroit via WXYZ. The creator was one of George W. Trendle, and Sir Trendle's brother-in-law, Mr. Fran Striker. The year was 1933 when Ranger first traveled to the plains of the United States of America! The Lone Ranger, the Tonto and the Radio Series successfully managed the Depression Era Americans from the mid-1930s to the Second World War. But the post-war era was found in the state's Super-Nova Explosion invention and technology. The new communication devices were ready in the wings, but could not go on until both VE Day and VJ Day were reached. When they were achieved, the world and America were ready to settle down and prosper. "New Technology" was, of course, TELEVISION! And we would definitely need something other than "Roller Derby" and "Wrestling From Marigold Arena". And although at the beginning there was something on the television station except for the portrait of the Mohican chief (Test Pattern, Schultz!) Very quickly and after the hurry, the networks started their existing natural resources, their existing programming! Almost everyone would be ready to adapt to the TV screen. <br /> <br /> So the people who were over Lone Ranger, Incorporated were very interested in getting all the manufacturers Jack Chertok, Harry Poppe, Sherman Harris and Jack Wrather approaching them for a deal that put masked man and Tonto on TV waves, as well as radio. <br /> <br /> Immediately they went to work and gave us the first season that used the radio's dramatic return to the Dramas, all potentially adaptable TV shows. They put Clayton Moore, a supportive actor in many feature films and about ten years of experience. He had also worked on Serials over at Republic Pictures "Thrill Factory", which would be an invaluable experience in making "LONE RANGER". Create your "faithful Indian companion" and partner in bringing Frontier into different parts, and we had the perfect character-supporting actor Jay Silverheels. ** We have to mention that, at about 53, it was a split when Clayton Moore walked and replaced with John Hart. After the season, Mr. Moore was so far back! Now, back to our story! The first years of filming gave the episodes a look and sound. They made good use of the Narrator screen, which gave them the authenticity and individual feel of a sort of series. The workers were all veterans of the later silent films in the 1930s and 1940s. Many of them were almost exclusively "Cowboy Movie" players. A good example of this is the casting of Glenn Strange (Bartender Sam's "GUNSMOKE"), a murderous gang leader, Butch Cavandish. And it was Cavendish Gang's massacre in Texas Rangers, which brought John Reid (believed to have been killed by other Texas Rangers) to the origin of "LONE RANGER". <br /> <br /> In addition, old timers are cast, you will find lots of new and up and coming talent (then) cast. We see people like Phyllis Coates, Dwayne Hickman, Denver Pyle and others a week. All of this, always with a call for fair play, justice and peace in the western world. <br /> <br /> The last few seasons have been marked by great changes. First, the use of color films. It didn't change because the set of color television sets was still far from our household. The second was a new set of musical themes and queues. (Except for Rossini's finals "U NO Wutt!") New music was never a big deal for us because we preferred "old radio" inventory. <br /> <br /> For this series and two feature films made during this period, LONE RANGER (Warner Brothers, 1956) and LONE RANGER and GOLD WHOLESALE (United Artists, 1958), this nature is permanently and indelibly impressive in our identity as people, our Americans!
