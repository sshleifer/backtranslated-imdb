I haven't seen this movie because it came out of theater history and I've been looking for it. At a time when I was 12 years old and I was excited; and now, the end ends for me. It was the youngest love, not to mention John's song and Taupin's words. The story (at that time) hit my psyche. I'm a lover of sentimental movies and it's still hanging in my head for 35 years - that's so good. Place yourself in adolescence and let your fantasies ride. If this film didn't excite your curiosity, you were just too old. Look forward to seeing it again (even at my age)! If nostalgia is your place, I'm sure it's an interesting movie. It's simply amazing and its simplicity is so simple and enjoyable.
