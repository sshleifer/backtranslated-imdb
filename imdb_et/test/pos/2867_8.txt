I liked it a lot. <br /> <br /> Camera corners are cool, it's not all nervous like Blair's witch. And I thought they did a good job with Sound when we saw things from Kane's point of view. A lot of fun. Many people shouted on the screen! <br /> <br /> Kane did a great job with his various psychological emotions. He is much less one-dimensional than most horror heroes. <br /> <br /> Kane is much less frightening and plausible than most movie psychics. It was not clear to me how he would react to different situations. There are not many twists here, but it's smart and original. Good, horrible, B-movie ticket price.
