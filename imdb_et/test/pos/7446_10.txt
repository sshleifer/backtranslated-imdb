Square indeed landed on it. They didn't try to please everyone and instead focused only on Final Fantasy 7 fans. And boy, are they happy fans when they see this movie! The story may not be all interesting or plausible, but it does relate properly to the story of the game and has many honestly divine funny moments! Here is a surprise and also welcome. <br /> <br /> There are also many benefits and funny references to the game. And most importantly: fighting scenes are so harsh that they could cut a diamond! They are indeed all awesomeness and would have made the movie worth it even when everything else sucked. I mean, these are some of the best-created PERIODs. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. PS: I know my review sounds like teen girl attacks. It was like what I saw.
