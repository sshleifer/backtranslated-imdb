It is not so bad at the end of the 80s. There's a lot of pretty funny lining ("That's a big theft!" - "Thanks!") And Madonna is good; there is nothing here, but it's Razzies and Oscars.

As a side note, I have to meet an actor who played one of his motorcycles with the police; he said it was a fun movie to work on, but gave me sad news that the actor who played Buckit's UPS delivery boy died about a year later who is this girl
