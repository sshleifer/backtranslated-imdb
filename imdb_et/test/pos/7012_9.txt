Welcome to all your lovely Dirty Dancing fans !!!! I came up with this bulletin board when I was bored everyday and I think it's cool. I love DD! I saw it for the first time in my friends' house when I was 13 years old (now I'm 17 years old) and got stuck! I saw it there at least ten times and soon after that I bought a DVD for myself. At this stage I have remembered most of the script and I can always say it when someone asks me about it. '' I spent watermelon?! '' It is so bad that I bought a soundtrack and recorded Micky and Sylvia's song and now it's my phone ringtone! Most of my friends think this is a nonsense film, but I don't care what they think of it, I know it's a brill! I read these comments earlier and I have a lot of questions for you - 1. Why do you ask trivial questions like what age Lisa and Baby are? I don't think that's so much. They're teenagers in the 60's, aren't they? 2. Where did you get this special edition, what are you all talking about? It sounds very interesting ... Please answer it. I'd like to see the opinions of other fans ... Cheers! charliesangel415 xxx
