For the first time, I heard about Begotten when my girlfriend chose this in the "classic" section of the local video shop. She knew I liked the hidden art films so I rented it and brought it home. It sat on my TV for a few days and then I put this video recorder just before bedtime. I thought maybe I could see what it was like first, and dedicate more time to it the next day. It followed that it really aroused me. I sat through the movie and loved it. After I went through the closing credit, I looked at it again. Only after you see the closing credit will you understand who is. After you know you can reassess it again. Don't listen to people who tear this film. It's not for everyone. If you are someone who does not like reading subtitles if this movie is not for you (not subtitles, there is no dialogue at all). If you are someone who actually owns Rush Hour 2, this movie is not for you. <br /> <br /> This movie is truly original and inspirational. That's what other movies have never done. It seems to be nothing more and more courageous than anything out there - from 1989 until now. You can say that all those involved in making this movie love what they do and understand what can be done in cinema. <br /> <br /> If you want to be entertaining, the movie is not for you. But it is pure escapism in some extreme and film form. It's like someone who fixed the wires in my head and recorded one of my worst nightmares. But this nightmare makes sense if you are really sitting and watching the pictures, giving up the actors' activities and not sitting passively with the guitar, but watch and don't blink. but Begotten has so much more. I'm not kidding when I say it's my favorite movie. It is an important film that stimulates visually, mechanically inspiring and hypnotic. One review I read about it is true, "nobody can get out of the Begot without mentioning it."
