This is the best movie I watched this year! Great detail and story (for remake). <br /> <br /> This will give you "what if" a situation where the Japanese island can be completely wiped out of this country. Pointless provocation, life and death situation and not to mention the whole life on earth (well in this particular Japan). It is also a great and genius solution to this massive tragedy. <br /> <br /> Horror, action, intercourse, sci fi, documentary, love story, and the whole story of human interest you can get here! But I warn you that this is a real tear! Those actors and everyone are all great, better than all Hollywood movies! <br /> <br /> The thing is ... it can really happen anywhere on earth! Let me now ask you after you have seen it ... "what would you do if you were facing this life and death"?
