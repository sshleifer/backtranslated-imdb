Or vice versa. <br /> <br /> This is a French movie noir, directed by American filmmaker (Jules Dassin), who was supposed to blacklist Hollywood, thanks to HUAC. The story is a prerequisite for being quite familiar - one last Tony le Stephanois and his buds jeweler - and so is the end where everyone gets ... Well, there are no spoilers here, because this is the movie where the stress is important. <br /> <br /> Dassin filmed black and white in realistic light on the streets of Paris using actors and actors who are not glamorous. The interesting - sometimes invasive - result of Georges Auric improves the film and reminds us of many similar results from the American films of the early forties and fifties. Jean Servais plays the leading lead in Fedora, as Humphrey Bogart could play. Tony has recently left prison, her main, but still harsh and decisive, if she has to be, her mind is sharp when she is focused, a type of hero whose eyes are water, though tears never fall. <br /> <br /> Dassin plays Italian safecracker and wishing to know the rules, but carelessly. <br /> <br /> The film's character is forced to identify the movie with bad logic and focus. Often there is a level of bad boys, "good" bad guys and "bad" bad guys who can't do good bad guys, and then maybe there's really bad, bad bad guy or two. (Here is the Remi Grutter, played by a little sadistic drug, Robert Hossein.) Then there are police officers who are irrelevant or almost so. In more modern films, bad guys are not even "good" bad guys, and they get along or near it. In the old movie noir, which emerged from the thirties of gangsters, was following the old Hollywood code, the usual motto "Crime does not pay", whereby every criminal must pay for his crime before. the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Rifif's most impressive feature is probably how well the movie moves. The plot opens quickly and smoothly, as the big directors always did, directors like Stanley Kubrick, Louis Malle and Hitchcock. Some have actually compared it with Kubrick's killing (1956) and suggest that Kubrick stole a bit. Well, the directors always steal, if necessary, and have some or similar similarities as the "one last attack" for the main character and he has a girl's bow. Similarities may go deeper, because at the end of this movie I thought suddenly, oh, no! the cafe in the back seat is out of the convertible, hit the ground, breaks open and all the money is flying! Those who saw the killing may recall what has happened to the money that ended with the film! What reminds me of another movie that has something wrong with money: Oliver Stone's U Turn (1997), where Sean Penn plays. There's money blown by a shotgun in his backpack. Ha, ha, ha! Obtaining this dubbed version of this movie would be a sacred doctrine by dialogue (if there are some: the clergyman is totally without dialogue, about 30 minutes worth), is superficial and easy to follow, requiring only a random look at the subtitles, which is quite utilitarian and guiding, not every word. clarification. <br /> <br /> Another thing: all the brutality is done so that the sex was done in a movie that is off the camera. The guy gets his throat slit. We don't see it. I like this approach. We don't have to see gore. You can almost let your children see Rifif - almost. <br /> <br /> Get it now and watch Hollywood's reprise, which plays Al Pacino and is directed by Harold Becker next year, where you can make sure that violent scenes are played completely.
