Johnny Crawford is a great filmmaker in a difficult age village that was in the midst of a cultural and spiritual upheaval. Billy Graham is doing a good job of depicting life in this sweet, sometimes horny, but totally sincere trembling. He gives us an overview not only of the social scene, but of good advice that is valid today about morality, decision-making, the generation gap, the introduction of teenagers (some of the statistics in this movie are amazing. Today's statistics). It's worth seeing Billy on his younger days. This is a fantastic movie. It made me realize that human nature is not changing, although hair, fashion and language can change, people are still struggling with the same problems they have won for thousands of years.
