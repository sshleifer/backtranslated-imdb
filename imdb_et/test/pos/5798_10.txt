One of the main aspects of "Malenkaya Vera" is that it was the first Soviet film with a sex scene, albeit short. The title is important: Vera is the Russian word for "faith", which indicates that punk Vera (Natalja Negoda) believes in the Soviet system. And as the film shows, there is not much faith in it. Open scene shows Zdanov's industrial city, almost hell on earth. When Vera's lover Sergei (Andrei Sokolov) moves with his family, it brings some unexpected events. <br /> <br /> Like many Russian films, people's names also describe their characters. For example, Viktor (remember that "winner" means winner). All in all, this is a good look at the collapse of the Soviet Union - and we can see why it collapsed. Very good.
