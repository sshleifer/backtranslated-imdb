I love this movie and all its aspects that are well targeted to comedy and drama. The action is enormous, performed by all the stars cast, who play great in New York society. The terrain is incredible, absolutely breathtaking. I also love this story: a successful NYC architect who passes through the midlife crisis leaves his cheating spouse and runs to the Greek island to hide his daughter who decides to go with him. <br /> <br /> I just can't express my love affair enough for my movie. "Show me the charm".
