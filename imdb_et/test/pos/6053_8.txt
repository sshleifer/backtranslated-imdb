I am serving Corrismanina on the island of Parris in the late 60s, just over 10 years after "D. I." was shot. I was in a barracks where they filmed some indoor scenes. I knew a lot about Drill Instructors and many recruits. I think the film is as close as any film that shows the life of the recruiter and the drill teacher. No doubt I think this is the best thing Jack Webb ever did. If you've been in the army, you have to watch this movie. It was so. This shows how important it is to recruit a number of raw recruiters and change the men who are ready to defend our country. One interesting feature is that most characters are played by real navies, not by actors.
