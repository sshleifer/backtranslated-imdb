John Landis himself overcame Michael Jackson's THRILLER short film. Of course it is funny, the dialogue is terrible and everything seems too funny, but it's perfect, not less. <br /> <br /> Michael and his date are in the cinema to see the last horror. If it changes too little for a date, it will leave. Michael follows. At home, they decide a shortcut through the local cemetery. That's where it starts. <br /> <br /> The real thriller dance is amazing. It's full of these trademark Jackson moves, as well as some memorable zombie moves too. It doesn't seem to hurry at all or for too long. The whole thing looks like a movie and it's actually pretty scary. Of course, this is one of the most famous music videos of all time and it is probably the biggest music video ever made. <br /> <br /> Generally: Take it seriously. These 13 minutes are some of the best that you ever look at the screen. (5/5)
