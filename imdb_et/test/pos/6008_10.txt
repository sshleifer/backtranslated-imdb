Ted Danson was a great choice to play Gulliver. Although her background was mostly comedy, she shows here that she can do the drama as well or even better (though it has a lot of humor). It's hard to face his American accent, especially since his character should be English, but it's just a little thing. <br /> <br /> All the villains are equally well cast: James Fox, Edward Fox, Peter O 'Toole, Warwick Davis, John Standing, etc. Despite the fact that most of them are small people or giants, they are everything they do they do, 100% plausible, and their motivation is very clear, for example, the disgruntled suspicion of the Flower Pupils about the hatred of Gulliver, Grildrig's (giant) dwarf, who wanted his trial as a judge, Dr. Bates's attempt to prove Gulliver crazy so he could marry Mary. <br /> <br /> Mary Steenburgen is great, like Mary Gulliver (the second 17th-century English with an American accent, but never). She's deeply tortured because she's been waiting for nine years her husband would return home and when he finally did, he would talk about small people, giant, flying island and talking horses! Mary, despite being a powerful fantasy element, has a very plausible character. <br /> <br /> Special effects are amazing, especially if you think it was filmed on television while CGI was in its infancy. It looks very real when we see a six-foot-tall man walking through a city full of people 6 inches long. <br /> <br /> The future is also great: Omar Sharif, Richard Wilson, Sir John Gielgud, Kristin Scott Thomas, Ned Beatty. All the great actors who create a strong cast that complement Danson's great acting skills. <br /> <br /> Houynhnhms and Yahoos are probably the most effective elements on the saddle side of things: in the society of talking horses who are not anything people have, while Yahoos are primitive, disgusting people who speak forcefully and call their leader depending on when he is disgusting. The study by Gulliver and Mistress about them is also very well done and shows the differences and similarities between people and Yahoo. <br /> <br /> Best version of Gulliver's Travels and one of the best mini-series.
