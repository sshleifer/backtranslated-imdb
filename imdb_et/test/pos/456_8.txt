Yul Brynner is Major Surov, singing, dancing, vodka drinking Russian officer, located near the Austrian-Hungarian border in the Hungarian uprising in 1956 at Anatole Litvak's The Journey. Although the film has not yet appeared on video or DVD, it is still one of Brynner's most compelling performances. Due to political upheavals, group passengers cannot leave Budapest but are put in Vienna. Before they reach the border, their passports are taken and they are captured by the Russians led by Major Surov. <br /> <br /> Major has reason to suspect that the Hungarian freedom fighter is smuggling out of the country. Indeed, Lady Ashmore hides a mysterious passenger, Paul Fleming (Jason Robards, Jr.), who pretends to be America, but fools. He helps Fleming to repay the debt he owes mainly because his earlier association caused him. Among other travelers, there is a British journalist playing with E.G. Marshall, her husband Anne Jackson and their two children, one of whom is the debut of a small Ron Howard screen. <br /> <br /> Major Surov has a romantic interest in Lady Diana Ashmore (Deborah Kerr) and romance develops between them. He does not offer him anything but contempt and a rigid upper lip, even though we suspect he is still hitting his heart. The Cold War intrigue and powerful actor bear the story, but romance is never convincing. However, this is one of my favorite Yul Brynner films and deserves to be seen as just his passionate power.
