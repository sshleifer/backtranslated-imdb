Amazing, amazing, amazing. What more can be said? Jacobi is the best Hamlet who ever likes to stage and captures every character. All Hamlet's nuances and elements are well represented and depicted. Some people have complained about their age, but you can't honestly say when watching a movie. If anything, it looks drastically younger than 40. I just want to have found more worthy of Ophelia. His behavior is satisfactory, but he just doesn't look at this part. The only real extraordinary performance is Jacob and Stewart, who is a great Claudius. The rest is good, but Jacobi really does raise the teleplay.
