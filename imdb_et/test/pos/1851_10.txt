I love this movie! That's it! Bonnie Hunt wrote a fantastic job of writing and film. David Duchovny is just hot. and Minnie Driver is as cute as ever. connect all this talent between David Allen Grier, Carol O'Connor, Robert Loggia, Joley Richardson and Jim Belush. I'm surprised they didn't get it. if you haven't seen it, go to the DVD to rent it, check it once when you make the director's comments ... Bonnie Hunt is great!
