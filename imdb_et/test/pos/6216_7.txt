This educational exhibition focuses on emotions, communication and relationships. It was produced by Detroit ABC partner and syndicate in 90 countries. Last week, Detroit Public TV showed a 1-2 hour clip as part of its pledge. Wow, the memories that rose again! While I remember this show, there were segments I forgot, but I remember as soon as they started ("Hot Fudge HOLY MOLEY!", Detective Tomatoes and Pies on her face). <br /> <br /> Search for "Hot Fudge Comin 'Atcha Concert"
