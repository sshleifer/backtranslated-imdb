Black Day Blue Night was actually a good modern noir. Three young nomads, who come from their lives, are on the road in the middle of a desert (like the most modern dwarfs). One woman thinks her husband is cheating on her, and after she has found a hotel room, she decides to start and start again. Strangely enough, he and his husband, who are forgiving, are driving, because sleazebag never told him he was married. And together, when they ride in the rainfall, they meet a third, very mysterious young man with a suitcase full of secrets. Although they are ridiculous and free, and everyone doubts each other, the police have been denounced by the police as suspects. <br /> <br /> The Black Day Blue Night begins with an immediate confrontation and throws a fairly good story on all of its twists, designed to mislead your doubts after one character leading to a very unusual end. This means that the film begins with an immediate confrontation, and if you think the story has been solved, immediately push it around the second plot, revealing just a little more than you expected before the movie ended. <br /> <br /> But as some viewers have written, the end is a bit confusing and a bit let go. The killer is not the one you would expect right now, and when it has appeared, it becomes quite confusing with a rather thin explanation that reveals the motive needed to solve the mystery. But in fact, the finals are beyond what I think the film is the most interesting. Because a modern rook always includes a range of criminal suspects that are almost always guilty, it is also a genre that always includes money. So the question of these films always changes - how far are the characters ready to go for the money? <br /> <br /> If you like this modern movie Noir transfer, I would recommend watching Red Rock West (that's also got JT Walsh and some moves in the broken wilderness)!
