We saw La Spettatrice at Syracuse International Film Festival & liked it. <br /> <br /> This movie grew to the fear of all of us. Fear of rejection, fear of closeness, and the most important fear of our own shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Three leading players, Barbora Bobulova Valeriana, Brigitte Catillon Flaviana, Andrea Renzi, Massimo, have their roles and are excellent. It was a pleasure to recognize these three dynamics as it seemed real. <br /> <br /> I believe Barbora Bobulova is eye-catching. I hope we will see him a lot more in the coming years. <br /> <br /> This movie does not take off easily. Thumbs up an Italian team who put this movie together. Highly recommended.
