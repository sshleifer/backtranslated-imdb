Actually, I admit that I am a political junkie, so it resonated with me, but the insecure nature of Mrs Green (yes I know what they did to her), but the end was such copying and totally contradictory to the film. Why can't Barry L and the team just ask us what he's going to do? Instead, let's talk about it. <br /> <br /> Instead, they have "oh I'm not worth it," and it just shows that if the chips were left behind, it is better to leave the table instead of doubling. Stop Disney and take it over. Life is not easy, they should have had the courage to give the main character some backbone. <br /> <br /> We had to listen to the whole film's rhetoric ... and then he turned to slip and stupid, Green Green's behavior (when the mess was out of his system) just made the end of the end of the movie.
