* Small spoilers * I just wanted to say that for anyone who likes a fun baseball movie, it's definitely my top three. Only the Little Big League and the Major League compete in my mind. I would also like to congratulate the writers of this film for creating such a pleasant dialogue! To put it too much, I would say that these lines fit every character. Tom Selleck seems to have no problem creating a realistic character as a ball player. His reluctance to play abroad in Japan highlights the comical but substantial interaction with his new team, Dragons. She has to adapt to life in Japan ("First wash, then swim!") She sees her eye with her trainer and sets her goals to be the last spectacular season, though in a much different environment than ever imagined! So for every baseball fan, or someone who wants to watch a good baseball movie, Mr. Baseball won't let you down!
