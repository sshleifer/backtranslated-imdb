First I want to say that Ang Lee did a great job! I looked at it yesterday and I was surprised at the moment. The story is very good, but all the unknown people say, "It sucks people can't fly!" I'll tell them it's FICTION and that's it. It does not have to be taken as a reality film that could be said to be a "fairy tale". And very pleasant to see the Asian fairy tale. An image can actually blow your mind. Being so artistically filmed there, Ang Lee has a great (unapreciated u can say) great talent. The fight scene is very cool and beautifully bring the viewer. But it is sad, but this film didn't get the recognition it should have. But fortunately, Ang Lee got the attention he deserved because of his bomb attack. So even for viewers who aren't interested in this story, the pictures are fun enough!
