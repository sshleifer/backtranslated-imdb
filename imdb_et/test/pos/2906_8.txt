I was one way out of the morning when I checked something about T.V and came over to this movie. I don't remember it or hear it. What a fun and interesting thing to watch. My meeting was rejected because I couldn't get out of this movie. There were some real interesting things that marked the history and some fun things they don't have in today's movie, because it's not pretty beautiful. Well, there was a lot of realism. The exhibition was good for the 1954 film. Fine and real actions for those characters who had to follow me what they were going to do next. That's why I was watching it. I don't know why they don't show it more often. I'd rather look at it than some movies they play more than necessary. For historians, people who love periodicals and those who are in film recognition groups like it. "Egyptian" has a variety of flavors that deal with many things to look at in a human nature that hasn't changed since time. What does it say about us? Those who don't like movies that take the time to open up and tell a good story .... are not on the film. but if I get the chance to see it again, I would probably vote 10.
