Being an American, I have never encountered this character before, which is good because some of you are disappointed. I have nothing to compare with it. I didn't find any enjoyment of frantic idiot humor in American teen movies, and although it's a little like humor, I couldn't stop laughing. I can hardly laugh at the film. And usually the film has some funny parts for me, but it was funny from the beginning to the end. My only disappointment was when it was over. I really buy it on a DVD when I find it.
