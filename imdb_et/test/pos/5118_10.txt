If I had to decide what was the best Ernest movie and that didn't work like that, it wouldn't happen all the time, it would. <br /> <br /> All Ernest's movies are fun, but the best ones are Jim Varney's many different characters. In addition, I know I enjoy Bill Byrge and Gailard Sartain's comedy brothers Chuck and Bobby Tulip. "Ernest Goes to Jail" includes all these elements, as well as funny scripts and supportive light that includes a number of beloved characters. <br /> <br /> That's why I've chosen "Ernest Goes to Jail" as the king of all Ernest movies. I don't agree if you need to, but deeply, you know I'm right.
