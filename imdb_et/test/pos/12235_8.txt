I cannot argue with the other comments that the story focuses more on the romance of the characters of Mary Martin and Allan Jones, which is a lot of "Showboat" than Victor Herbert's life. But in the 1930s would it have been in the ticket office? It might have been VH music instead of VH. There's a lot of it. <br /> <br /> For me, the film's excitement was close to the film when Susanna Foster sings "Romance Land". It has been more than a decade since I received this film for the second time in the local 'old films' theater. At first, the audience was stunned; then it penetrated into a spontaneous applause. I remember the shades that run up and down my back. My trivia memory recalled the information the local journalist asked the public when the film first came out in the late 1930s. "The note that Miss Foster struck was far higher than C." <br /> <br /> He may not have four octaves a la Yma Sumac, but then the teenagers definitely had a range!
