I'm a butterfly on B-films. I love the old Drive-In ticket like this movie. It seems that this movie, made with very little money, does one thing that some of the bigger budget movies fail. This is fun. It's crazy. It doesn't have a real plot, but it knew me for an hour and a half. I laughed or covered my eyes. There are some great effects, like a boyfriend from INSIDE, when he grabs his lap and it slips through his tongue and slips his mouth to the roof and one slit out when the man gets his eyes out. But there are also many zombies and some psychological killers are designed after the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and the demon had a scarecrow. I loved the dialogue that killers had when they tortured and killed people. It has great camera work and some cool editing tricks. It is more original than the first Bloodbath and undead looks better, but it is still in the patterns after being called trashy zombie films in the 70s and 80s and still has a powerful high force. Don't wait for Romero, but for the second-hand Fulci. I'd say Horror fans like it, it's a funny and funny and fast ride through B-movie Land.
