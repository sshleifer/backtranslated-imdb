Great thriller all the time. Vijay Anand is different from the director and editor. The performances of Dev Anand, Vyjayantimala, Tanuja and Ashok Kumar prove useful for the film as its scenario has been elaborated in the most detailed way. Cinematography adds a story to mystery, glamor, and other demands. And all up, Sachin Dev Burman's music is unforgettable. Kishore Kumari, Asha Bhosle "Raat Akeli Shark", Lata, "Aasman Ke Niche", Lata and Rafi and "Hothon pe aisi baat main" by Lata, "Yeh dil na hota bechara". Re-attach the unique character of Burman Dada as a cutting-edge composer with its own style.
