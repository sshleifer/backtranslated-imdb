Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more of the complex life of singer Karen Carpenter. Although it does not provide accurate facts and details. <br /> <br /> Cynthia Gibb (depicting Karen) was not a good choice. He's a good actor, but he's a very naive and kind of stupid Karen Carpenter. I think the role needs a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality. <br /> <br /> The role of Louise Fletcher as Agnes Carpenter is terrible, she is doing a great job as Karen's mother. <br /> <br /> She has great songs that could have been added to the soundtrack album. Unfortunately, they were not, even though this film was at the top of US and other country ratings
