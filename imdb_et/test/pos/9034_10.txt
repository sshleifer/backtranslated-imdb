hello there; I would just like to say how much I enjoyed your review and comments on this great film 'Invader Dust'. I believe your points were insightful, intelligent, and completely valid. it is also a disgrace that this movie has never been shown on television these days and it is not in the DVD region 2 - I live in England. again, great thanks for the review. The actress Juan Hernandez was in another glorious movie, "The Young Man with the Horn", which also celebrated the Kirk Duglas and Lauren Bacall. it was a very nice and stylish movie with great music. I want someone with an impact to release the entire back catalog of DVD region 2 movies like "johnny belinda", "remember mama" and "New Year's Eve", we love these movies in the UK. I'm not a retirement age, I'm still relatively young and my family and I love classic movies !! such films were so beautifully made and they bring back great memories. anyway ...! much thanks for the comments!
