Richard Condie's ultimate madness "The Big Snit" is a journey through qwerkyness, madness, mountainousness, enjoyable backgrounds, melting stars and the conclusion that almost always brings me to the joyful tear when I see it. <br /> <br /> This is the short I've seen and seen over and over again, and I've never traveled (luckily, it's tape on television)! It never ceases to make me laugh uncontrollably and then reach my mind deeper, emphasizing the size of the human condition. The reason somebody says, "Come on, let's finish the game" is everything in the world okay, and the everyday problems we face are everything that is short to stop fighting and worrying. . This movie looks like a simple cartoon fun first, but it's a lot more. This film hits the human race a greater sense of spiritual meaning when everything seems to be so bad and trivial. <br /> <br /> It's flawless ... in every sense. AND DAMN FUNNY TOO;) <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
