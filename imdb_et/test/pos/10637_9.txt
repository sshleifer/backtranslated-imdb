I saw this movie at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival. La Pianiste strengthens the "Australians = Gloomy" theses I make. Isabelle Huppert won the Best Decoration Award in Cannes for a woman who tried to lose her humanity for her artistic ideal. His talents embraced his emotions and sexuality until they can only be expressed in twisted and terrible ways. When a younger student falls in love with her, our hopes will rise, but will soon break if she does not realize that she does not get the love of others. It is too late for him and the last 30 minutes of the movie are obviously out of the beautiful music that was the first 90 minutes. The message seems to be that the music itself is not enough without its descriptive life and beauty.
