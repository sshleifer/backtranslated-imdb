I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and couldn't see the original TV a few days ago and it is much better than the sequel. Okay, it's not a million miles from the SEVEN plot, but it's still convincing. Much of my praise is related to Ken Stot's performance as a DCI Red Metcalfe cop who seems to have led a very unhappy life and someone with a terrible secret. Stots are easy to go over the top, but they play a role in a rather fine way. Similarly, the murders are very shocking, but - unlike the aftermath where murders are carried out on screen in OTT - there is little violence. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that the red herring was too red herring, which meant that I didn't have a twist of beats (And you would probably see a fire spinning, so I didn't miss the spoiler warning) and that when a real murderer was revealed, it seemed a little pulled and caused a story in the hole of some plot. When I remember correctly, the sequel was a similar problem when the murderer appeared, so maybe it would be a good idea not to do MESSIAH 3
