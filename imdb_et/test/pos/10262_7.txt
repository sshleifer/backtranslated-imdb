Shameless Screen Entertainment is a relatively new and British (I think) DVD label that specializes in brilliant and overly violent cult film? mostly Italians - from the glorious ages, when everything was possible, namely from the late 60s to the mid 80s. The selection of labels seems like a cross between creations between "Mondo Macabro" and "No Shame" (they may even borrow the last name) and they had already issued some very rare Italian puppies like "Ratman", "My Dear Killer", "Killer Nun" , Death Fantom and Torso. The "scared woman" was completely unknown to me, but because my local colleagues, whose opinions I greatly appreciated, described it as one of the greatest and most enchanting psychedelic euro-sexploitation films of my era. pick it up. This is a very strange movie and probably not about 99% of the average cinema-loving audience. If you are part of this remaining 1%, you are truly unique. Style, atmosphere and content are similar to Jess Franco's "Succubus" and Massimo Dallamano's "Venus Furs", but are generally considered classic, while "Frightened Woman" is virtually unknown. It's all about profiling and good marketing. The story literally turns to a dirty doctor (he lives in a giganticly separated mansion, has a number of old cars and has a very impressive collection of artistic relics, including a doll of life-size dummy). attitude towards women. He sees them as a threat to the survival of male races and thus spends his days in abduction, humiliating and sexually abusive situations he takes up on the street. Then Dr Sayer will rob an ambitious journalist, Maria, with the intention of breaking her wife's spirit completely, but she will fall with her slowly. Just he starts believing in true love, he strikes back with revenge. It's not really for everyone, but if you appreciate the moody and embarrassing sexy atmosphere, the odd landscape toys and the psychedelic touches that seem completely unreliable and surreal, you may consider it the ultimate recommendation. It's slow, stylish and buggy shameless entertainment, well!
