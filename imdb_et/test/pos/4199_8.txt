After fighting the championship, John Garfield (like Johnnie Bradfield) marks a drinking behavior that leads to the death of a deadly reporter. Although his leader killed a man, Garfield is accused. When a driver dies in a car accident, wearing a Garfield stolen watch, the authorities think the boxer is dead. Still WANTED man, Garfield makes his identity "Jack Dorney" and moves to Arizona ranch. There, Garfield meets "Dead End Kids": Billy Halop (like Tommy), Bobby Jordan (Angelina), Leo Gorcey (spit), Huntz Hall (like Dippy), Gabriel Dell (TB) and Bernard Punsly (Garfield binds young people) Dead End "sons who were sent to the sweet" Grandma Rafferty "(May Robson) as an alternative to the reform school" Dead Rafferty. "Garfield falls in love with Halop's sister," Peggy "(Gloria Dickson), who is keeping an eye on the children. Obviously, Garfield's past must be haunted by him? "John Garfield and" Dead End "children make beautiful (Max Steiner) music with an efficient direction and photography by Busby Berkeley and James Wong Howe. The story is predictable because Warner Brothers supports the team. "Dead End" children are a winning combination, although Garfield did not make additional movies with the "East Side" gang, the studio was almost instantly with Billy Halop and Bobby Jordan for "Dust Be My Destiny". <br /> <br /> Boxing Scenes are nicely staged. But the most exciting sequence is Garfield and four New York Kids (Halop, Jordan, Hall and Punsly) that climb a giant water tank for swimming, which unexpectedly puts their lives at risk. Other, shorter highlights are the cozy Ann Sheridan (like Goldie), the cozy Barbara Pepper (Budgie) and the young Ronald Sinclair (like Douglas) who lose the band poker. <br /> <br /> ****** ** They made me a criminal case (1/21/39) Busby Berkeley ~ John Garfield, Billy Halop, Bobby Jordan
