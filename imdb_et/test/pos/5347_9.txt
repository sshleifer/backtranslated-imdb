Imagination, fast paced, satirical! Americans do so. "Enthusiastic", but the British do "witty" - and they love to have fun (ahem: unpleasant teeth, big lips / nose, "Veddy" ordinary or "Veddy" snobby, obsession with "gahden"). Inside jokes for the older crowd, lots of activities for kids. Fine use of other classic movie equipment (see "Back to the Future", "Indiana Jones ..", "Harvey", "Shakes" and more). It is also a nice "friend" movie (Gromit is a quiet but inventive sidekick). Add Bonham-Carter and Fiennes's excellent voice work (is it true? The best thing to do these days is animation?) - enjoy! I saw it with grandkids. fun time for everyone. - familiar
