This film is the godfather of Latino. The unlikely mobile will bridge the gap with some unlikely alliances and form the empire. I liked the act and the bomb attacks with lots of actors and colored characters. This movie is not an Oscar winner, but definitely fun. Hey, who still needs an Oscar? <br /> <br /> Chapa got some movies that guide and act (do I think she did that?). Reminds me of another filmmaker who loves to do that, Robert Rodrigez. Keep it up, is there a sequel to the job? There are a bunch of strings to be tied. Will the son come back and the daddy dies?
