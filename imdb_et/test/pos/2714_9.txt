I watched this movie in a Singapore theater yesterday (February 4, 2006) and came out to better understand what schizophrenic patients and their loved ones are going through. <br /> <br /> Madam Aparna Senit must not only be congratulated on adopting a complex subject, but also on addressing the spiritual challenge with a deep understanding of their dangerous situation, which is necessary to help them cope with the storm of disorientation, hallucinations and their instability in their minds. <br /> <br /> We have had Hollywood films on this subject, such as "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", where Jack Nicholson wins. Since then, research has helped to better understand the problem and some misconceptions about treatment. For example, "... paw in the nest" is a barbaric representation of shock therapy, but "15 ..." is said not to be as bad as it has been done. <Br / Another misconception is that child abuse is the cause of schizophrenia. But scientists like Dr. E. Fuller Torrey has emphasized that research has shown that childhood schizophrenia is a brain disease and is thought to have some genetic roots. It has now been established that schizophrenia can be treated as any clinical disease and its progress can be controlled by early detection. Even at fairly advanced stages, regular treatment and counseling can be effective. <br /> <br /> The same understanding that Mrs Sen has shown is how participants play their parts. In line with the gravity of the subject, the actor is checked with all the confusing silences and eyes of Mrs Konkana Sen-Sharma, reflecting the disruption of the disturbed minds who speak louder than some of those we are accustomed to in most of the films that are the characters of the Spiritual Challenge. <br /> <br /> Like me, most of the theater seemed confused at the end of the audience. This leaves a lot of questions that are hanging on the plot. <br /> <br /> Has the Meth search been completed? Why didn't he find no. 15? Did the children actually play when Meethi went into the gates when his eyes whispered? Can anyone find out this jigsaw puzzle?
