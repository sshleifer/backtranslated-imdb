It was my second experience in the Monkey Iceland series, seven years after the first show. What was my answer? "Oh, great, we're playing comics." I'm glad my brother closed me and played because the jokes once again caught my attention, as well as Armato's excellent Guybrush voice action - let alone all the others (I still think CMI Elaine sounds better than EMI). The cutting flights do something that illustrates something, and the art of both the game and the cuts is great. When we found revenge on CD originals, Secret and LeChuck, we were both ecstatic and spent hours in Revenge - one of those moments was where we just sat and blew for half a day. However, CMI must be the Monkey Island game that I played most, especially to fight sword fighting and offshore. At the moment you meet Kenny and tells you he's gone straight and then, "I work with weapons!" there were tears in my brother and me for laughter. And this is not the best part of the game, not far away.
