The "mild murder case" is a great TV movie that is worth the price of rent. William H. Macy is great as a film critic who accidentally kills his lover and then has to try to hide the crime. Although it may seem dark, the movie is actually quite light and funny, with many memorable lines ("Action is harder than I thought you are seeing BODY HEAT? I think I owe Bill Hurt an excuse" and my personal favorite "next week to answer these two questions about the film noir about what these people are doing during the day and why is it always rain?) The film has a great supportive cast, including Macy's real-life wife Felcity Huffman, James Cromwell and Adam Arkin.
