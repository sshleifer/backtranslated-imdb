In France, Xavier (Romain Duris) is a twenty-year-old young economist who seeks to work in a government agency through his father's friend. To get a good position, she is recommended to specialize in Spanish economy and language. She decides to apply for the European Erasmus program and move to Barcelona to improve her knowledge of Spanish culture and language. He leaves his girlfriend Martine (Audry Tautou), allowing him to keep in close contact with him and once in Barcelona is temporarily stayed with French doctor Jean-Michel (Xavier de Guillebon) and his young and lonely Anne-Sophie (Judith Godrèche) with whom he met in the airport. Later he moves to an apartment with international students: English Wendy (Kelly Reilly), Spanish Soledad (Cristina Brondo), Italian Alessandro (Fédérico D'anna), Danish Lars (Christian Pagh) and German Tobias (Barnaby) Metschurat). Then join a group of Belgian Isabelle (Cécile de France) and Wendy's brother William (Kevin Bishop) and Xavier study Spanish and find their foreign experience in friendship and love. "L 'Auberge Espagnole" is one of those films that, at the end of the day, gets sad. The story is a delightful and funny story about friendship and love in a globalized world and a united Europe. This very charming film made me well and happy, even though I've never experienced a student in the republic. Newcomer William provokes the story of the most fun mouth and short brain. In addition, it is nice to see a fresh approach to students living together, unlike those stupid American brotherhoods and their stereotypes that are common in American films. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Albergue Espanhol" (Spanish Auberge)
