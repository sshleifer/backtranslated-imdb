The film is not perfect in any way, but despite that it is a lot of fun and fun to watch. I'm the first to agree that Victor Fox isn't really that attractive and his music and style are quite exciting. I also agree that the film has some strange confusions and some scenes do not work well. So what? If it makes you smile and you enjoy who cares? Does every movie make sense? Must every movie be perfect? No. A person could get kidnapped by admitting that they love this movie. Again, what? It's charitable characters, it's well-nailed, the actor is usually good, it never gets too big or dramatic, it's peculiar. See how many people love Jeanne's dream. Is it perfect? Heck no! And although it is very different, I say it out and you are happy after that.
