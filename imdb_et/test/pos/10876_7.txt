I was really happy when I played this game. The graphics were something new. The missions were excellent. But still, I felt I wanted more out of this game. For James Bond's game it's pretty good, but not as good as his other games. It would be nice if they could do it 360Remake. That would be much better then. It could just be cuz I'm games like Resident Evil, Dead Rises and These Games .So it could be better but it was OK to play. One thing I absolutely hated in this game was Natalya! She was irritating dying all the time and she couldn't run either. I recommend this game to those who like FPS games more than May 7/10 STARS
