I'm getting a new challenge for those who call it, great, their rights to that opinion, but the new series isn't there yet, that's right there. That's definitely good. <br /> <br /> First of all, good things. Special effects are probably better 20 years later because Doctor Who 'Battlefield' was sent from the last episode. <br /> <br /> One of the things the BBC has always liked is the Doctorate (unless they tried to cancel the 70s and 80s). But expectations and pressures were great, but I think the new series has passed the test, it's good, it's still not great because it has its drawbacks. Some of the songs "Dalek" were very bad. I assume some idiots wrote a few minutes written that he did not want to change the character of Dalek or ever bothered the old age group. <br /> <br /> "The Aliens in London" was probably the best episode so far, it started a new story about aliens who have been going through several episodes, including "Boomtown". <br /> <br /> Now, no other bad thing, companion, Rose, Billie Piper. He's actually quite annoying, but like dr. Who the young young boy was finally chosen and got part of it. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eccleston is quite respectable, he has begun to catch his niche. He tried to play this character, then straight to the funny punchline, but he took it much more seriously and shows. <br /> <br /> Continuity is still some of the problems that were not well resolved, Paul Mcgann was still a doctor before that, but he couldn't get back. <br /> <br /> Besides, although the series is pretty good in general, I haven't missed an episode and it's never boring, so I recommend all the doctors who fans to see it and see the new doctoral text.
