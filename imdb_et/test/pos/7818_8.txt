A captivating film, complemented by a musical and vocal background, especially during the competition. My understanding is that there was never a soundtrack, but did you know through my sources where I can get information about the singer and the likelihood of getting a copy of the song. Your help would be appreciated. The song touched me and my wife, and we would like to secure a copy if possible so we can play it as background music when we have our family and friends for our "Italian night". If you can get this information to us, we would be grateful forever. Even if you want to contact the studio so we can go straight. <br /> <br /> John Payling, <br /> <br />
