I saw it just by looking at what I haven't read in the book, but I heard a lot of good things about it. <br /> <br /> The film was absolutely fantastic, very touching. What is a roller-coaster of emotions, then you are completely connected with the characters. Shaun Toub was great, it was a complete deviation from his usual roles and his action on Persian / Darian understanding was incredible. One thing to note is that Khaled Hossein loved the movie, which is unusual for movie adaptation films. Even after the movie several times the vision of "he sobbis". <br /> <br /> Intro animation was also subtle, names like Persian calligraphy, very unique! Sometimes the translation was not clearly transmitted, but it was a great movie.
