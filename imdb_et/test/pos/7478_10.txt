I loved this movie! Fantastically original and different! A strong, intense, hard core and a stopping film that has just the right (dark?) Humor. If you're tired of a typical, surprised, ridiculous Hollywood B.S. movies, how many great explosions and terrible and unrealistic shooting games that offend your intelligence, this movie is for you. Fantastic characters that are wonderfully original and believable, and a solid performance by all actors, not the weak character or performance of the film. The Skip Woods film is a breath of fresh air and I commend his originality and efforts, his film has the feeling of crossing between Quentin Tarantino and Cohen's brothers film (not in my opinion a bad mix). This movie takes you to the throat and doesn't let it go, there's no dull or bubble about this movie. The only disappointment is that nobody seems to know about it, all I suggested to thank it and share my opinion. This film is a change / alternative to the conserved Hollywood mainstream garbage produced today, even with their big name players, big explosions, special effects and big budgets. It's terribly wild, intense, violent, graphic, humorous, and raw (I mean, here's a good chance, not a fake Hollywood Polish). Thank you to all those involved in making this movie, you did an incredible job!
