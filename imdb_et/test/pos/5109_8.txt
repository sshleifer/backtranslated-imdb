If you only see one Ernest movie in your life, do it! It is the best in the series because it is a ridiculous and smart humor that is suitable for all ages. The other "Ernesti" valves were also good, but most people tend to get tired of it quickly (not ME.). <br /> <br /> In this movie, Ernest P. Whorrel is assigned a jury duty as a jury. The killer, Nash, just looks exactly like our bumblebee hero Ernest. Mr. Nash believes that this is a good way to escape from the prison by tapping him through an identity change, and so we can see how Ernest reacts to the slam. <br /> <br /> Great number! If you haven't seen it yet, look at it!
