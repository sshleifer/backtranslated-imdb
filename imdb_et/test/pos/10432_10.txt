It's the best movie I've ever watched. At the age of 12 I was late and ran over the film. It was on the US channel Gilbert Godfrey's Up All Night. I'll never forget. At a time when my friends and I were dealing with very different problems, some were sexual. You know 12 is a very tough and weird age. Looks like you're between a little girl and a young lady. This movie really helped answer many questions. I now have a daughter who is 12. We've been looking for a couple of years for this movie. If it ever appeared on a DVD, I'd be the first to buy. It would be advisable for every parent to look at it with their child when they reach this very carmin and heavy age.
