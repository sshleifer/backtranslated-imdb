A real surprise. Not exactly family entertainment "Disney". Violence, a lot of tense moments and a big fact based on the fact. "Overnight" theme is, determination wins. Two East German families will never be able to jeopardize their goal, their bold balloons will be released. The story is both harrowing and heart-warming. Time is not on their side. The East German police are closing down and the result is very far to the end. If you are looking for a good evening entertainment that does not include nudity and little violence, I recommend overnight. This is pure entertainment. - MERK
