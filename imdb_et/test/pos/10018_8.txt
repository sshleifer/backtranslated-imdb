I have certainly not seen all of Jean Rollin's films, but mostly they seem to be bloody vampires naked women who, if you like, are not bad, but this is a big departure and can almost be Cronenberg minus the bio-mechanical nightmare things. Except it is in French, of course with subtitles. A man traveling by night gets to a woman who is in her slippers and a bathrobe and chooses her while there is another woman in the background who is not wearing anything. As they drive along, it is obvious that a woman has nothing right, because she forgets things almost as quickly as they happen. However, this does not prevent a man from having sex with him when they return to Paris and his apartment. The man leaves for work and some strangers appear and take the woman to this "tower base", a large apartment building called the Black Tower, where other species (for whom there is no memory). seems to be the least of their problems) for some reason. Time and events are marching in a movie that mostly tries to find out what's going on and get out of this woman's building, and she can make a call to Robert, who has chosen her for the first time. him, her. The revelation of what is happening is in the last moments of the film, which has a rather strange but yet touching end. By avoiding what seemed like his "typical" formula, Rollin created what I feel is his most exciting and disturbing film. I like it a lot, look at it. 8 out of 10.
