I saw this very emotionally painful image and it was exciting. There is illumination between Williams' public-private conflicts and the pressure under him, so that even those who knew about him would be surprised. The cast was great, but Michael Sheen was outstanding. I realized it was when I saw a previous comment. He sees this role as being completely physically different from any other role I have seen him or herself. Williams's autobiography differs significantly from his diaries, as represented in this film. Watching a movie is sometimes sensitive to emotional anxiety. But this is a useful experience and a movie that can be highly recommended.
