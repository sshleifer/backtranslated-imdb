An extensive and deeply moving love story featuring powerful performances by Ralph Fiennes, Willem Defoe and Juliette Binoche. <br /> <br /> This is about a poorly burned man (Ralph Fiennes) who pulls out of the plane. World War II and his sister (Juliette Binoche) tells her story. <br /> <br /> Immediately before the war he fell in love with Katherine Clifton (Kristen Scott Thomas), but she is married to Jeffery Clifton (Colin Firth) and two are starting a passionate and banned affair. <br /> <br /> A very strange and tragic story of love and desire placed in some of the great places in the desert. You must see especially if your Anthony Minghellas fan work, but be prepared to tear down many tears, especially at the end.
