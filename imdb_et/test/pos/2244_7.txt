Age of Steel follows the previous episode, the rise of cyber men, which in some ways was excellent, in others it was missing. RotC had some positive elements, the most important of which was Tennant's excellent doctoral thesis. Indeed, his kind of frightening bears this writer a shadow of Tom Baker's Doctor, a sort of subconscious (as if you mark the time periods when Mickey keeps the button in Tardis), but brings with him the superiority of a La McCoy doctor, he promises events around him. Some reviewers and fans whose pieces I read are a little clumsy when such a young actor represents someone who must be over 1000 years old, but I disagree. Indeed, Tennant's doctor "bears the weight of the world on his shoulders", as he outlines in this episode, and can be seen in his almost insidious trait, as he finally meets Lumic / The Cybercontroller. His tired, eye-rolled "anothermaniacherewegoagain" sort of attitude is refreshing, especially after Eccleston's excellent pseudo-working class, bada ** character interpretation, more action man than Tennant's fresh-looking pseudo-doofus. The best moment for Tennant may be after the end when he restores Tardis with his big funny Baker front when Tardis starts again. Here we are going to get to know this new doctor, a character who is a little more than the average personality aspects of a person divided into 13 people; some contradictory, some more pleasing than others, but all are part of the whole. These two episodes were unsatisfactory but weak. The concept of revitalizing cyber-men is very welcome and they look fantastic, but the parallel Land where this activity takes place does not seem right. True, here is the allegory of people's dependence on technology and their need to serve as the doctor directs, but it would be easy to place on or near today's Earth. Some other weaknesses are, as others have pointed out, a physician whom a doctor and a co-worker have. get out of tight places. the air of death from the Tardis component, the seemingly endless use of Sonic Screwdriver (my wife laughed when they used it to burn the rope at the end of the ladder; she barely watched who, so I had to explain that a plot was used traditionally to separate symbols from situations that did not no other escape! Used here unfortunately). Some of the actors didn't want to, especially Mickey, who really needed his commitment, and some of the painful pains. Lumic was horrible as he was supposed to be, his voice even sounding like Cyberman's performance. The result was terrible, however, because the volume of music was often the scene. In general, I found that Cyberman's rise was more interesting, although the other half was satisfactory. Understanding what we knew was inevitable, but the resolution was disappointing. Too many unlikely escapes, the development of supporting casting, and Tennant, in my opinion, are not enough. This new show is remarkable, and Davies takes it in the right direction, but the dialogue (outside the doctorate) needs to be tightened up, as Mickey's good-bye conclusions show were pure ham.
