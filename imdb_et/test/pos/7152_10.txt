saw this movie and loved it perfectly. this is definitely my movie that you don't know in a movie that I love independent movies that are so much more profitable. my husband and i really enjoyed Jay's style. if you are an open minded person who loves a mindset that provokes movies and loves conversation after that, this film loves it. It's definitely supposed to provoke. The movie definitely takes on some toes, but who cares about these people will probably not go to see this movie. It is amazing to see the formation of characters. Jay Floyd has really hit both sides of the table. Applause applause Jay hope you work on another movie.
