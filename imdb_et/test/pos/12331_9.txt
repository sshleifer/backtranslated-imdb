You have to see this movie ... I saw it at the age of 13 in my theater, on my first date ... Faster ahead in 20 years and I'm now gay (Thank you so much for One Dark Night !! LOL!). This movie pulled me out of hell as a child (mausoleum still doing!), But as an adult, the thrill of this movie is not a story, but a hysterical laugh what it keeps ... Highlights Listening Names Teenagers call each other, from "nerdlebrain" (my personal favorite) ) "Turkey". Also, keep your eyes down when Carol (blonde, headdress) tries to hang her phone's fabric (can't believe they haven't restarted it!). dramatic outbursts and whores. If you are a fan of true horror, I recommend this movie just because it is almost a horror for me in paradise. There is def. A horrible factor and plot is good, but don't look at it if you want to scare your nonsense (if you're not 10 years old or anything else).
