A very violent and nicely filmed movie. Paulina is a bad sexy girl who shows that men can also be raped. This film has a lot of black humor. This man kills everything to forget that he was a former gangster. Sometimes it happens when you do not know whether to tremble or smile and think, "Do I laugh at someone who kills people?"
