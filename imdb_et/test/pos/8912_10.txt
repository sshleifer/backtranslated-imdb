Alien Warrior (or the King of the Streets) is one of those 80s gems that you stumble upon, then looked at the astonishment, admiring how wonderfully stupid and upward it was. <br /> <br /> A pretty hunky alien arrives on earth (LA is accurate) and stumbles upon drug dealers, gangs, and corrupt police. She falls in love with flax hair, a beautiful teacher who only wants to help children in the city town read more. He also succeeds in angry with a coke-jumping drug injector that allows him to be destroyed. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with this movie for the first time ... surely it's hockey, silly and low budget. But you can say that the filmmakers were in the right place in their hearts and the fuck when it didn't work! I only pray that it will be on DVD soon. <br /> <br /> It has a hot soundtrack, dancing, violence, nudity ... all with a positive and healthy message! Look at this.
