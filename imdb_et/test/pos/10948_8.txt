Like a very expensive Buffy episode with lots of humor. Lots of wire and stunt kung fu. Twins Effect goes to the classic list to be seen in HK films. Vampires have cool alternating ghost types and a beautiful boy in European style. If you have the opportunity to see it in the theater, it's worth a 30-minute drive, otherwise you can buy an import DVD before anyone screws it, giving it a bad dub.
