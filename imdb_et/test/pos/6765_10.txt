It's really a great movie. The story is grotesque, but the actors are great. The performance of Mads Mikkelsen as Svend is especially great. This is a simple story of two men who want to do it on their own, but it opens up to a strange and absurd story where many people accidentally kill and serve these chicken. If only more people understand Spanish ... It can be a great candidate in English. It is also worth noting Ole Thestrup, who always adds to this plot, with Holger's slightly mad character. I can only recommend this movie to a Danish audience. Also see Anders Thomas Jensen's film Adams lerbler (2005), as well as Mads Mikkelsen, who plays well with Ulrich Thomsen.
