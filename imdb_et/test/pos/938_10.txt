It is almost impossible for me to sit down and write in three colors: red without people having any idea of ​​what Krysztoff Kieszlowski has written in the past two such trilogys. The more I see them and think about them and imagine myself in my world, the more I get on this topic: that we are more related to each other than we would like to think, and everything that it takes is a little destiny to move some events. SINIS played Juliette Binoche's nervous widow whose plan to live her life without the past, when she met someone unexpectedly. In WHITE, the act of cruelty creates unlikely friendship between two men who, with contradictory circumstances, blame the criminal justice and the whole circle. And now, in RED, all the elements of fate and obvious coincidence apply to the young Geneva model and retired judge who have a habit of tempting other people's lives. <br /> <br /> This young girl has been appropriately named: Valentine (luminous Irene Jacob), who has this radiation and even smiles during the landing. Not that he is without luggage: he has an unseen boyfriend who also asks what he always does, he has a brother who worries him, and he rejects a photographer working on his picture for a huge billboard. He hits the dog while he is driving and takes care of him, but when he takes him to the retired judge (Jean Louis Trintingnant), he doesn't want him. "I don't want anything," he says coldly, and SINI's elements suddenly reveal himself, because this arrogant man who lives in anonymity and in a visible, free-floating freedom oversees unscrupulous people. This Juliette Binoche is the first man to be shocked by Valentine - she says she can only regret her when she goes away in horror, but the occasional event has returned to her and here is when she exposes who she is at the same time. : The story of a young man, Auguste (Jean Pierre Lorit), who will become a judge and who lives all over the world on Valentine's street - but they will disappear. The option is word. As Valentine won the jackpot at the grocery store she is visiting, there are occasional pepper in her life and Auguste. She has a girlfriend who also supplies people with weather conditions. One of them is an old judge. He knows him more than Auguste, and he never met him. Like God or Prospero, he slowly creates a storm that breaks the current state of correspondence and brings a new meaning to "We Meet Again". This is the parallelism between the old and the young judges, which makes PUNA so beautiful and transcendental, because time is actually much more liquid than we would like. There are people we meet in life that if we were just born in similar time frames, so many things would be different. <br /> <br /> This is both a Valentine and an old judge. I believe that the strong brotherhood of the soul binds them together in a close relationship: he is the woman he or she did not fill - accidentally or not - and whether he knows it or not, is trying to make it a big risk of discovering and to become a social challenge. But it doesn't stop there. One of the many links between the three films is the old woman walking with a large waste container. When Julie didn't see her (and would never have helped her) and Karol publicly humiliated her thinking, she thought, "Someone is worse than I am," Valentine is the one who helps her. If necessary, it can happen everywhere, and Kieszlowski also applies it here with a small character. <br /> <br /> Now RED is as much a story. Valentine, an old judge, Auguste, even a Rita dog: they are not narrative limited. The American version would destroy the idea and market the occasional meetings and lead to a shrinking end. RED is such a clean linear, fixed plot that any of these people can happen, and the chances that this story could have cut in so many directions was one of the important elements that didn't happen at the exact moment and place. > <br /> Adding characters that reflect each other regardless of time frame or location is the subject of sexual treachery. It is also an important and characteristic element in all three films: SINIS was Julie's husband's mistress, and she also puts Olivier out when she realized she was emotionally dead. At WHITE, Dominique Karol hears his moan over the phone (which becomes an important device in RED) because he is having sex with men while Brigite Bardot's CONTEMPT stand is watching. RED restores the old judge's love and betrayal. And all this time, Valentine's billboard is over them as an idea of ​​what comes at the same time as Rita, the dog of Valentine's car, hit seven sons, in a life that has been upgraded to six major players in this trilogy that is probably filmed care and love. Why do I say six? You have to watch the movie and wonder.
