Cary Elwes has to say that it gives a better result when Costner did in RHPOT, but in any case. <br /> <br /> It has to be said that this movie just makes me laugh because the actors seem to really do what they just sit there and wonder what the hell they are, but in very very good ways. The occasional outbursts of the songs were brilliant and well, and the musical score used really liked. so in my roles <br /> <br /> it is shameful to me <br /> <br /> 'Because, unlike some other Robin Hoods, I can speak English accent'
