This is one of the most traditional warfare I've seen. Instead of typical films that emphasize glory and perhaps super-human characters (such as John Wayne), this film is just the opposite - emphasizing the humanitarian nature of the ALSO war. The story concerns the Japanese, who, after the return of the United States at the end of 1944 and early 1945, went to Phillipines. At a time when the film started, the Japanese are clearly beaten, but because of Bushido's mad logic, they can't afford to consider handing over. One of the many fun moments at the beginning of the film tells the hospital that he is unable to fight for his tuberculosis. The problem is that the hospital doesn't accept him, so his commander tells him he's going to the hospital again - and if they don't accept him, he should kick himself with a grenade! Well, it happens just in the first five minutes of the movie - much worse things get into this soldier and a few straggers because they don't give up. In addition, the film is a case where a soldier tries to give up, but has been attacked. It happened much later in the war, because so often the Japanese soldiers attacked to give up that they were going to blow. In addition, the film shows the most nervous image of hunger and the accompanying madness I've seen. In addition, it is a very sharp, realistic and depressing realistic film accompanied by cannibalism, cowardice and betrayal. You just couldn't make this type of better movie. Terrible, but great.
