This is a great comedy that highlights what you wanted to live next to a racist bigot. But it also shows that both main characters are actually as bad as each other. Based on the ITV comedy, it is very politically wrong. And the better is that comedy is after all entertainment. Movies with only a real flaw are out there with not much plot. But the cast is as big as usual. Jack Smethurst and Rudolph Walker make one hell team by playing each other unanimously. It has been several years since I saw this movie and last week I had the opportunity to buy it on DVD. The fact that the film still contains loud moments means that I can recommend this film as if I wanted to return in the 1970s.
