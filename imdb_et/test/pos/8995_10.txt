My family enjoyed this movie. As much as what this film does for Rugby in the US is fine ... I'm sure it's controversial. But like me and others around me, I know we've been more interested in sports for seeing the movie and I personally got more play. You may ask how this is possible, especially since the film does not dive or explain Rugby. But it is easy for you to put you in the emotions of game and life. The film was inspiring and fun. It made us laugh and cry. Chemistry between Sean Astin, Big Budah and Sean Faris worked well. Some may think the film is a little cliché, but I really want Hollywood to have more of these movies. I couldn't draw the analogy between the game and life struggles. At the end of it I discovered that I was studying my life to see what I had to do better to be the best person I could be. Frankly, I was grateful that this film taught morals, values ​​and teamwork, so much the opposite. After watching it, I really hope that my children will be guided by someone with a philosophy like Coach Gelwix.
