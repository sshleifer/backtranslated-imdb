Okay, I love this movie !!!!! I watched it over and over again. It's so hard to say who the attacker is. You think it's one person, the other one, then back to the first person, then the other person. It is so tight if you want the TV to move forward to see who it is. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY: Gail Osborne has been raped and left at home. She is in the hospital and starts talking about how she was raped. His meeting with his constant boyfriend, his teacher who likes him, his former boyfriend, all the different stories, all suspects. But who did it? <br /> <br /> I love the actor, they have great talent here. The break is great and the settings are great. If it's on television, check it out. *** 1/2 stars 10/10
