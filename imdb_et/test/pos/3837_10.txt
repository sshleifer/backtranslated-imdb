I really enjoyed this movie and I don't usually like animated pictures. But I thought the cats were tempting and the story was charming. There is a good song called "Everybody wants to be a cat", which is very fun. It has some comics and it's an interesting adventure. I think it helps to be a lively cat lover to enjoy this movie.
