I saw this movie when he passed on in Lifetime in 2004. I've never seen it, but I've often thought about it. It gave me the impression that I've been looking for it lately. I finally found it and realized it was only for television. The film is amazing - it's full of great writing and acting. William Petersen is perfect, as always. This film was unspoken and tearful to me. It is a great story of faith, love and compassion. Does anyone know how to get a copy of this movie from my home? Is this possible with television movies? I really love seeing it again. It's mandatory for my collection!
