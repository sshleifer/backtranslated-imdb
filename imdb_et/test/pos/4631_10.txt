I think this movie is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I think Debbie Reynolds is fun and the chemistry between him and Glenn Ford is perfect. The film is not the dullest moment and Debbie looks beautiful as always. <br /> <br /> The story comes from showgirl Maggie (Debbie Reynolds), who meets a rude soldier, Joe (Glenn Ford). He immediately remembers him, but after he accidentally tears, he returns him on condition that he goes with him one day. They finally get married at night when they have their date after one kiss. Joe and Maggie move to Spain and find that they have nothing in common but physical attractiveness, so Maggie proposes that they live in one month, but not both man and woman, meaning that Joe can't kiss Maggie or sleep, lots of Joe's frustrating fun piece and great movie. Must not be skipped.
