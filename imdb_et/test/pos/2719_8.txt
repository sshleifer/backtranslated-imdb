I thought I was wasting my valuable 50 bucks who were going to watch this movie. But at the real demand of my friend, who is a terrifying fan of Aparna Seni, I decided to turn to the movie. Going to this cheap theater, I was disturbed that I saw King Kong at $ 50 in one of the city's best theaters. Anywasy movie starts and surprisingly I didn't complain. A great story and some truly wonderful shows for Shabana Azm and Konkona Sen Sharma. The divorce of Shabana Azmi, who has devoted her life to the welfare of her mother and step-sister. Konkona Sen Sharma is a schizophrenic (hiding me in spelling), which represents the thing all the time. Rahul Bose also gives a star. The story is that Mith (Sen Sharma) is schizophrenic, and after being raped as a violent reporter, his levels have indeed increased, his groom is leaving for him. His whole world falls on him. His older step-sister, Shabana Azmi, takes care of her and Mith, with her imagination, believes she is married to her fiancé, has 5 children and they remain in the 15th Park Area (which is actually a place in New York). The plot goes on when Mith becomes suicidal because he believes that no one believes in him and is being held captive by his wife. When fate should be, Mith and his fiancé will meet when both are out. 11 years after the brutal rape, his fiancée does not exist in the real world, he does not recognize him. His groom, now married and father of two children, feels it is his duty to correct what he did 11 years ago and allow him to Park Avenue. and he does. He takes him to Kolkata, which apparently looks like his wife's home. Like Joydeep / Jojo (Rahul Bose), his groom tells his mobile phone that he is losing the Mith's trail. Everyone is coming to look for him, but he wasn't found. Eventually, he gets to him, his family, his own imaginary family, in his own 15th Park Area. <br /> <br /> I have to say that it touched my heart. I'm a fan of Aparna Sen now. Camera work is great. And the quality of performance is the limitation of spelling. Konkona Sen Sharma gives a strong result as a schizophrenic child. Shabana Azmi gives another desperate older sister with a burden to keep her family. Peaceful Bose, another clean and quiet role (I don't know why this guy doesn't get big breaks, he has so many options). Finally, Aparna Senil will still be able to fascinate the audience even if she is not in front of and behind the camera. <br /> <br /> Very well earned 8/10.
