I remember the police team! When he first came to ABC in 1982 and I thought it was a very funny show, thanks to many views, non-organizers and scripts full of words. In one episode there was a line where a man named once was shot twice. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, ABC canceled the show only after six episodes. I felt that it deserved a much longer time, but the network manager thought that the exhibition required too much attention from the viewer because all the episodes saw. I remember it was an opening where the title of the episode was different from the title shown on the screen. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielsen's image of Frank Drebin was dead but very funny, and his role was in Jack Webb's Dragnet's narrative style. Alan North did well and Peter Lupus, one of his few tasks since his mission: Impossible was not bad, like Norberg, but one sign that seemed to be in sight was Johnny Shoeshine Boy, played by William Duell. After giving Drebin advice, Dick Clark, Dr Joyce Brothers, and then Dodger leader Tommy LaSorda. <br /> <br /> While the police team! ABC had a short life span, Zucker Brothers did not give up the concept that proved to be more successful in the franchise of Naked Gun. I close with a regular shutdown. Freeze the end here.
