To see this kicker, I went straight to the big screen. This is the only flick I know Tarsem Singh has driven, but the boy was intense. This film was a stimulus for all peace of mind and one of the best special effects of this type. <br /> <br /> The characters were alive and not something that you thought was a nightmare. This film is scary and interesting and bombards the senses with fear and joy. This movie compares none of the other things I've seen except beautifully weird. In this regard, this is a rather big step over "Clockwork Orange". Be sure to watch this movie on the big screen and don't wait until it appears on the tape. It is not half-good for tape. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for easy glare. It mixes your mind and leaves you with pictures that forget the time. But for those who want to be puzzled ..... ENJOY!
