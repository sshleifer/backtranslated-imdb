During the Farrelly Brothers and Jackass series, to get the movie and present the Americans come out, which is well paced and full of charm as well as fun is almost wonderful. This band has been behind some other efforts, most recently "A Mighty Wind", which was so subtle, seemed to be a real documentary without entertainment, but "Best In Show" hits all the cylinders. It is perfectly cast with some of the best current US actors, Parker Posey, who publishes energy even when he is standing, Eugene Levy as a tolerant eternal who is not a cover, even if he seems to be (or maybe "insatiable") door mat ‚Äù)). Fred Willard's great styles, so many other underrated performances that aren't usually associated with American or American actors. One of the few humorous films I watch again and again.
