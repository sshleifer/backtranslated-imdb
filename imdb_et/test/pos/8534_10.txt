(Spoiler warning) I can't say good enough about this movie. This is a great horror comedy / junk that makes everything right for change. Humor is great and the funny funny jokes-joking jokes vary. In one scene Ed edits and deletes a large scene. When his boss looks at Ed's editing, he says, "Where is fu% # is my cluster cookie scene?!?!" Hysterical. There are also many other great, humorous and memorable quotes and moments: Ed encourages "Don't you fu # $ ing me!" while some poor scores face repeatedly. Very funny stuff. The plot's own plot is so ridiculous that it is priceless: Ed is a lightweight everyday man who goes over the horror film editing department and after a while goes nuts, sees monsters, and attacks people by quoting movies that he has edited in horror. This movie is all and just fun. The DVD only costs about $ 7 and is a great deal because it has an unrated wide screen. I have many DVDs, most of which cost much more than this, but many are not as big as this movie. My Evil Ed DVD is one of my collection's highlights and I beat someone's phone receiver when they tried to steal it. Evil Ed oozes style and quality - something that Hollywood filmmakers have to learn. Evil Ed is a rare pearl and I would like to thank everyone involved in making this wonderful movie - you did everything right and I love Evil Ed! 10 out of 10 !!!
