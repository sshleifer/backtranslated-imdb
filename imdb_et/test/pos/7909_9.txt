The 1955 musician Peter Pani with Mary Martin is that it is for most of the original Broadway pains, including Kathleen Nolan Wendy, who was a more natural actor than the girl they were hired to play in 1960's color television. It's disgraceful that most people are no longer seated in black and white, because in many aspects it is an earlier production - that doesn't even appear in IMDb lists when you put "Peter Pan" in the search engine! It's better than the cutesier color version most people have watched. I got the original on the plate and worked on it to make it digitally better. Now that I put the 1960 color version on it, it looks tough. I suspect that Mary Martin herself preferred this original 1955 b / w production presentation on television. <br /> <br /> As an added plus disc, I also showed original advertising and opening. As far back as the 1950s, it is such an innocent time. I miss that.
