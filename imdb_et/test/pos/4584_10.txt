I had never heard of this movie, how good a friend suggested it. I trust the taste of this friend so I bought this DVD. My wife and I sat to see it without knowing what it was. I thought it was a more fun movie I've seen for a long time, mainly because I saw the truth in satire. I strongly recommend this movie to all my friends. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for everyone. Some people see the stupid humor and the aura of stupidity and find that Idiocracy is one of the stupid movies they have seen. What these people do not understand is that crass humor exists, not to entertain the audience, but to show what the mores like in the future. <br /> <br /> Luke Wilson is a well-cast "average Joe." He must mainly be in the film about the popular society of this film. Many of the funniest bits are in the background, so it's worth many times. What makes the film even more fun and frightening is that I see its elements in everyday life, in the people I meet or in the media. Then I go back and look at the pre-democracy and understand how good it is. <br /> <br /> Few people who have seen and enjoyed this movie can be part of an elite club. I see an ad for some products that have a new breakthrough component, and turn to my wife and say, "It has electrolytes!" He knows exactly what I'm saying.
