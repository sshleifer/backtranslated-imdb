This movie was not only exhilarating, but it took me back to the memory card with my vivid soundtrack. These were the things we said and do ... these were the songs we listened to ... all at the same time, in the same era, south of Alabama. I may not be one skateboard, but I was definitely one of the observers who sat at the border with the old transistor radio, listening to Neil Young, looking at them more bold than I ever hoped because they spin their surfboards on wheels, using Alva and Adams tricks, hoping they might just take a short time in Zephyr's style. It simply shows how much we all have these wonderful days. ~ KLJ
