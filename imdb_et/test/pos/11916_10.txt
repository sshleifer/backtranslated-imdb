This movie is a great example of great imprisonment! I loved this movie and sucked from the beginning. Of course, this is just an activity, but is it not fun to watch movies? <br /> <br /> Casting this movie is very strong, with pleasant characters. Boys' friendship is so realistic and appealing, it's heart warming and fun to see a group of teenage boys interacting - especially this group of boys! Sean Astin makes a great rebel, successfully avoiding the adolescent. <br /> <br /> If you want fun, check out this movie! I enjoyed it thoroughly, even though I looked at it in a very dirty and old VHS, which was terrible quality (Go DVD!)
