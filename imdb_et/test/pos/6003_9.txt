I remember when this NBC mini-series spoke when I was in high school. After reading the novel, I thought I was looking at some adjustments. Didn't expect much from the TV mini-series, but now I have some more. It's actually a great and best possible movie version. Writer Simon Moore, who wrote the original Traffic mini-series, based on Soderberg's film, came up with a brilliant narrative idea that helps to keep the story running smoothly: it frames Gulliver's adventures with setbacks, with a real story at the beginning when Gulliver returns home for the first time (all happened on one trip). Gulliver, played by Cheers' Ted Danson, is kind of crazy when his wife Mary Steenburgen welcomes her back to her home. Unfortunately, the house now belongs to a local doctor, James Fox, who has Steenburgen designs. Gulliver seems to be just disturbed first, but when he starts talking about small people, this is all the evidence Fox has to throw at his crazy shelter. All four of Gulliver's journeys are linked in this version, in the same order as the novel (the only time it has been made on the film). I love how his current situation reflects his setbacks. The little son of Gulliver, whom he never met before, reminds him of flower buds. Doctors who watch him in his cell of mezzanine over him and remind him of the scientific study of Brogdingnagian and doctors reminds him of the mad scientific experiments and theories of the professors of Laputans and the Academy. Finally, when he is brought to court, he is reminded of Houyhnhnm and Yahos. The amount of this thing is amazing and includes Peter O'Toole, Ned Beatty, Alfre Woodard, John Gielgud, Kristin Scott Thomas, Omar Sharif and Warwick Davis. The biggest mistake in the Mini series is that the actor is really uneven. You have all these fine actors, but fewer characters are often played by actors who apparently were beautiful in episodes of the L.A. Law, but don't make this costume in drama. Ted Danson is not very big, although he has a couple of sequences where he stands out. It's probably better than he didn't try to do it, but all the other movie characters speak English. Steenburgen is actually pretty good and generally good. Another mistake is that adventures happen too fast. It is unlikely that Gulliver spent eight years away from home, as claimed. But in general it is very good for Swift's tone and purpose, while its structure provides a new emotional level.
