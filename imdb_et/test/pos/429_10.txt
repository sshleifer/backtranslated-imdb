Hack seems to have been described as unreal ... but that's what the TV is. The TV is meant to escape from everyday life and I feel that Hack is doing a lot of work on this. Add a slow process to reveal your past and interesting / interesting parcels; you just don't seem enough. Plus, the great actors like David Morse, Andre Braugher, and even the little Mathew Borish, what else can you ask. So if you are looking for an inclusive experience and want to like the "underdog" characters, I suggest giving Hack a chance, especially now that he can finally get off his feet.
