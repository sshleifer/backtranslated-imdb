This is a thoroughly successful example of the 1950s. It has a harsh and beautiful young hero - well, not so young on the screen; great, as unlikely, the direction of Billy Wilder; a distracting, fully orchestrated musical score from the lifting weights and, if necessary, Franz Waxman's heavenly strings; strong supporters; a thrilling story; Hitchcock's favorite Robert Burks; and the narrative singular of a historical event. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Jimmy Stewart when Charles Lindbergh tries to sleep in a Long Island hotel before his epic solo flight across the Atlantic from New York to Paris. And she can't sleep. <br /> <br /> The flight itself is full of Lindbergh's personal history and his unique high-gloss monopoly, The St. St. Louis, Missouri, has been backed by a partnership home. (Even money was spoken in 1927.) In any case, the film had to have several setbacks and a Stewart story. What is an alternative. Consider the unity? Thirty-three hours watching Jimmy Stewart, who sat quietly on his noisy plane while the days and nights came and go? I found the script and headed impressive from my time. The unpleasant things are, of course, omitted in order not to create more ambiguity than a modern audience may happen. <br /> <br /> My contribution is that Le Bourget, a grieving mobile phone around Lindbergh, hung an airplane for souvenirs. And, of course, something about a pilot's relief tube, even though it would have added more humor. Some of today's viewers find some incidents when they think too much about them. Stewart's conversations with friendly climbing fly to wake him quietly when he lands on his cheek at a critical moment. Later, St. The Christopher medal he gave to his father Hussman gently touches the glass crystal of one instrument, as Stewart tries desperately to land. Atheist Stewart has been rescued twice - once on a flight and once from God. <br /> <br /> But never remember it. This is an impressive film. This landing at Le Bourget, exhausted with Stewart behind the joy, confused with lighting, sweaty fear and collapse with fatigue, is really convincing. "I'm planning to tear this plane," he says, and we can believe him. <br /> <br /> Driving with a light plane is not like driving a car. There is no smooth curve of the road to tell where to go, there is no lane to give directions. You're busy every second. You need to look at the instruments, check every wings to see that they touch the horizon, fly the nose of the aircraft and constantly watch up, down and sideways with other traffic, though the latter wouldn't have caused much trouble for Lindbergh. He was alone across the ocean. <br /> <br /> Why? One of the film's filmmaker's moments is Stewart and Murray Hamilton, who are two Roma barnstormer in the 1920s, near their planes in the middle of the west. "What is it? What makes us so much about love?" Asks Hamilton. (No answer.) Later, his financial supporters try to tell him about the flight. Five other planes have already died. "But do you not understand? This has to be done," says the disgraceful Stewart. <br /> <br /> Well, it's not a big answer. Why do we need to do it now and why is Lindbergh? Why not wait ten years and meanwhile lose a life? The answer, dear Socrates, is partly in our glands. Pilots are peaceful and confident batches given occasionally to excitement. Their main problem may be dependence on the internal rate of adrenaline. I was joking. Some of my best friends are pilots. However, Lindbergh must be a pretty guy. He deserves to be treated as a hero. Not only because he flew himself, but because of his later behavior - quiet, modest, family man. We can simply forget our admiration for Hitler because he did more than the Corsair fighters in the Pacific and advised the Navy on how to weaken the aircraft and achieve the best results. <br /> <br /> See if you have the opportunity. If nothing else, this is a lesson of history with visual glory.
