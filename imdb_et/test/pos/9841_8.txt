Remember - before it was Sidney, Dudley was. <br /> <br /> Dudley Digges is hardly remembered - because his flowering period in the sound films was in the late 1920s and 1930s. Except for one major performance: the ship's benevolent, when the cute doctor in 1935 MUTINY IS THE BOUNTY, most of his films are hardly revived. I'm more sorry because he was a great actor. In 1931, he played Casper Gutman (the original actor who played this offender) in front of Ricardo Cortez Sam Spade in the first THE MALTESE FALCON. Similarly, at the same time, he played Leslie Howard's version of OUTWARD BOUND - the same role that Sidney Greenstreet had dealt with two worlds in twenty years. <br /> <br /> Digge can be pleasant and cute (this ship's doctor again) or detestable (CHINA SEAS as the first Mate to judge the poor Lewis Stone but proved to be the same coward at the time of the crisis ). He kept his person against Paul Robeson at EMPEROR JONES. He is a Chinese freedom fighter working with Gary Cooper DAWN GENERAL. Digges could do something. <br /> <br /> Here is Mr. Thompson, a hypocritical and stealing caregiver at the Reform School, to whom Frankie Darro and his friends are being sent to rob the owner of the robbery and the Greek-American shop (in recent cases). The miners here are as bad as the CHINA SEAS, but it's a nice thing that he doesn't like it at all. He can somehow overcome his roles ... later later. Darro has urban criminals (including a Jewish boy and "Farina" "OUR GANG"). As noted in the second review, this is the prototype of the Bowery boys. We see that they shake car owners to pay them for "tracking and protecting cars". If one boy does not, they will carry their car peacefully. Grab-abduction and robbery in the Greek-American shop is also graphically shown - his skull breaks in breakage. The boys have been rounded up and pulled in front of a stern, but decent judge Arthur Byron, who understands that he cannot leave children with his parents: the parents cannot look at them or are incompetent. Unfortunately, there are three racial stereotypes in this order: a Jewish father who is more interested in his business than his father Farin's stereotype "Yassum", and an Italian father whose co-operation can give his son a break from reform at school. <br /> <br /> When boys find the mode oppressive. Sometimes a guard or nurse (Madge Evans) tries to talk about them. But Digges has no time to encode. He is the mode set to stop the boys from behaving. Unfortunately, Digges and his accountant partners are greedy. They have earned poorer food for boys and earned a profit. <br /> <br /> One day a government official will come to look at the reform school. This is Jimmy Cagney, a hacker whose gang got a voice for Edward Maxwell. As compensation (he did not get a position as a Park Commissioner), Cagney became a school inspector. He is supported by his hangers and factoring Allan Jenkins (in his first Warner Brother movie). The irony is that if Digges were a little cautious, Cagney would probably let him continue to run things. But Cagney is coming to see Darrot to bring him to Digges. Warden and Darrow have had problems with respect in the past, and Digges is now going to punish Darro, who is fleeing - but severely injuring Digges' barbed wire fences and using his free droplets. Cagney stops Digges and lets Evans heal Darro. And he explains the reality of Cagney's situation and his own idea of ​​the real reform of the boys, creating a responsible trust in them. <br /> <br /> The movie follows it to the end, showing that Cagney and Evans are on the right track, turning the Reformator into a "republic" so boys can drive properly. This leads to a conflict with Digges, whose profitability is being reduced because it no longer receives supplies. However, Cagney himself finds that the scheme is on track if he finds that he may have serious problems with the law. Digges sees its opportunity and takes it fully. But then he goes too far ... much more than ever. <br /> <br /> In the 1930s, there were many films showing that children took steps to correct the right mistakes and change things. Darro appeared on roads like WILD BOYS OF THE ROAD. Cecil B. De Mille did that day and AGE where the children taught a lesson to Charles Bickford's gangster, who scares him. So it went in the 1930s. HELLOW MAYOR comes to the same intensity of retaliation and the search for a juvenile court. But this is one of the problems with the movie. Digge's character is a roll and a hypocrite, so we can never rejoice at him, but if he wasn't a thief, we could go along with his opinion (even if it is the opposite). Scenes at the beginning of Darro and getting his gang to people actually make the harshness of Digges seem quite understandable (even if his methods of stealing are not). He also has a moment when he is rightly angry with Cagney - at this point he hides his contradiction with the law - giving orders to Digge far from the phone. When Digges learns what happened, he is rightly angry at Cagney, teaching him about the right behavior. This is the closest thing to do to Mr Thompson's way of thinking about this fine movie.
