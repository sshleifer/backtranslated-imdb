I saw Peter Watkin Culloden and the war game a few months before and was very impressed. The technique is essentially the same or at least very similar in this film, describing, on the one hand, the attempts of dissidents in California (apparently) in the near future and, on the other, the group of convicted "criminals" 50 miles from the desert to win their freedom as an alternative to a government-led "punishment park" prison. Watkins filming everything in a documentary style that causes more than a little inconvenience or demanded a strong suspicion of belief: how is the camera team with a group of hungry and burned prisoners within 2 days without offering help? And this is just the most obvious example. But the questionable storytelling discards it as a punch; there is no doubt that you should be interested in making a political film, but the film is not really anything else at the time: it does not pull strokes, does not offer simple solutions. The left-wing political figures are certainly sometimes widely painted, but they are not all similar; Right-wing government functionaries seem a bit more comic, but even they are allowed to show at least a bit of humanity. In general, the film gives a lot of thought and leaves an indelible taste ..... 8/10 DVD rental
