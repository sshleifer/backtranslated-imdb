It surprised me. <br /> <br /> I read some reviews that called it a good B-class movie and were the worst. Halfway through it, I suddenly realized that I had it completely packed and enjoyed a lot. There were some really tense moments where you sat forward nervously by moving the remote control or some other accessible object. In general, this film certainly does not deserve a B-class label. <br /> <br /> Credit must be given to director Gary Ellis and writers, Bill Boatman and Todd King for their film debut. I hope these guys will continue with larger budgets and some studio support.
