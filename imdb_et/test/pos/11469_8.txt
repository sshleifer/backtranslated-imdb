This movie was a lot of ups and downs ... The story is strong, telling Ma 'Barker's saga to grow up, and then his failure with his boys and FBI .. Theresa Russell is very talented and his beauty even shines through Ma' Barker's public enemies through. Mark L. Lester's direction, though not as good as the 85th Command, was still very interesting. <br /> <br /> Eric Roberts plays a short-time role as a security guard, turned into a thug (and Ma's Lover), and Alyssa Milano plays a prostitute hanging with a gang, Frank Stallone, plays a thug who helps the gang, and when one exploits, he can in one of the boy's trouble, he gets himself out in the finals to talk ... <br /> <br /> I was confused, intrigued, and fascinated throughout this movie. So I wonder what movie all those who voted so low have watched! .. For all those who thought .. UM FBI was actually so bad in the beginning, there were no tommy weapons as the laws were, and were therefore quite disadvantaged when they got into the shootout's with the gang of this era. Because everything I saw represented In the 1930s, I felt it was more realistic than many other films that depicted this era ... It can be like a train wreck happens. atch, but JUST is too .. Enjoy!
