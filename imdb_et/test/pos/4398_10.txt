I was a movie right now. I've seen other Coen movies except Arizona, and I've noticed that each of their films has color. Fargo is gray / white, Lebowski is bright orange, and this movie is pleasant yellow. <br /> <br /> The bright pleasurable qualities of this movie will begin immediately. Soon, great and great music will come with the look. It is old folk music, a kind of music written at a time when music was enjoyed as part of everyday life. Enjoy everyone, the chains, the church choirs and even the prison escape. <br /> <br /> Now, Prison Escape. I don't know what kind of crime their characters could have done because they are very friendly groups. Clooney is fantastic, totally ridiculous with his role. <br /> <br /> Go as fast as you can. I believe that everyone can enjoy it at some level. For some reason, there was a theater where I was, full of old women and old men, and they loved it. <br /> <br /> You love it too, I promise. I was forced to get the soundtrack right away.
