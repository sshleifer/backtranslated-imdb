This movie is great! Wesley snipes plays a clean class in the vampire hunter, hitting the ass in a liquid and violent way that would make Bruce Lee proud. The film is a fast paced, exciting thrill and great stunts. The first site and the last one are prominent, and Wesley looks like a Terminator when he runs around, wiping all the heads. The script is a pretty good and too sharp dialog. Wesley should have made more action films than she is, I know she is a very good actor and has not played so much a comic or drama role, but in the action stars she is their best actor. all, just Bruce Willis, Stallone and maybe Tom Cruise (when he reads the action star). Steven Dorff is also very good when Wesley is quality. It was an unexpected surprise that a low-growth person, compared to Snipes, should be dangerous, but he does. In general, the film is sharp, stylish and I hope that the order will be the same.
