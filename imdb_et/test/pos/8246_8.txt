There is an interesting split (at least at the moment) in voting on this movie. Those who are waiting for a documentary are impressed or at least not disappointed. I assume that those who give a movie to one in ten are the ones who were waiting for the re-use of a war movie or Gallipoli invasion. <br /> <br /> So - if you want to see actors, fire and gore, this movie doesn't suit you. If you want to see an independent documentary about Gallipoli, without bias in any aspect (the only enemy in these events was war itself), then you come both impressed and beautiful. I found it to be a very moving movie and even liked Captain Guy Nightingale.
