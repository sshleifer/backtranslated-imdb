I have not read a novel based on "Kite Runner". My wife and daughter, who did this, thought the movie was far from the book, and I'm ready to speak for it. But the film itself is good - not big, but good. How exactly does this represent the destruction of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan? How convincing does this show the unobservable Taliban regime? I appreciate it on the C + first and B + on the other. The human story, the Afghan-American, who returned to his childhood to rescue his boyfriend's son, is well done, but it is this census that says the book was much more convincing than the film. The most exciting part of the film - but the dragon races in Kabul and later the mini-race in California - is not equal to the book. I put money on it.
