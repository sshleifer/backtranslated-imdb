I give it to 8 out of 10 because it is a cult classic. It is also led by the legendary sasquatch hunter Robert W Morgan, who also plays the part of Jarvis in the film. Listening to a recent blogtalkradio show called AARF (Robert Morgan is a co-host), he says that as it has become such a cult class and well at film conferences and such, it is planned to continue this film. I think he said the two initial letters have been signed and hope they will have some more. Robert is a good man and I hope it is fine. He has dedicated 50+ years of tireless work as a Sassquatch researcher (which is also in my interest) and author. Look at your show in paranormal and maybe look for Blood Stalkers II in the near future.
