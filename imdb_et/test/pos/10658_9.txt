On June 14, 1905, the sailors on board the Russian battleship Potemkin rebelled against this year's oppressive officer. The disappointed second-tier treatment, especially with the camp-infected meat that they are forced to eat, is decided by a crew led by the inspiring Bolshevik sailor Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov) that time is ripe for revolution. This is how the classic "Bronenosets Potyomkin / The Battleship Potemkin" by Sergei M. Eisenstein's Russian propaganda begins. <br /> <br /> The film itself is characterized by an amazing example of stunning visual images: Drag the glasses of the captain of the dropped ship gently from the side rope to which he was thrown; the body of the dead mutin is on the shore calmly, a sign on his chest, which is "DEATH BIRTH"; shots are taken by hundreds of spectators who are finally exhausted by the tsarist regime; Odessa with steps like desperate spectators watching with breath (this scene was "borrowed" by Brasi De Palma, especially "for exchange"); The barrels of numerous canons are maliciously leveled at the Potemkin of a large number of battleships. <br /> <br /> But the film itself is best analyzed? not as a fragmented selection of memorable scenes? just one movie and every scene is truly memorable. Although it is divided into five quite different chapters, the whole film is going to flow perfectly; we are in no way interested, and we never doubt who we should understand. <br /> <br /> The movie is often called "propaganda", and that's exactly what it is, but it doesn't have to bear any negative meaning. The "Battleship Potemkin" is produced by Eisenstein for a specific purpose, and it achieves it perfectly in every sense. Designed by the Soviet Central Committee to coincide with the success of the 20th century revolution of 1905, Potemkin was predicted to be a popular film in his home country, symbolizing the revival of Russian art after the revolution. It is therefore somewhat regrettable that Eisenstein's film did not work well in the Russian office, as allegedly, Allan Dwan's 1922 Robin Hood film was beaten during his opening week and lasted only four short weeks. Fortunately, despite the fact that it has been banned in several countries in several countries, the Potemkin battleship went well abroad. <br /> <br /> The film also proved Eisenstein's successful vehicle to test his "assembly" theories. With fast editing and many extras from many extras, the audience must not be understood by individual characters, but by the revolutionary population in general. Eisenstein shreds this form briefly, but in a scene where Vakulinchuk escapes from a ship officer trying to kill him, and of course known as Odessa in the order of steps when our hearts frighten the life of an unhappy child in a nursery. The added music of music I looked at, which was largely characterized by Dmitry Shostakovich's orchestral work, served the emotional impact of such scenes perfectly. <br /> <br /> One of the greatest films of the quieter era, "The House of Potemkin is the triumph of phenomenal filmmaking, which is an important part of cinematography. The extremely exaggerated events of the film (among other things, never been a violent massacre in the Odessa stages) are so fully involved in memory that we are often uncertain of the true history behind the events depicted. This is a great achievement.
