I saw this television version of Christie's mystery when it was shown on Channel 5 in New York in 1980. At a time when I was surprised, I wasn't shown in Channel 13, a public television station that showed most of the Masterpiece theater programs, but (in addition to some of Dorothy Sayer's "Lord Peter Wimsey's store and THE MOONSTONE), BBC productions were rarely dealt with British detective stories . The second series, SHERLOCK HOLMES RIVALS, had dealt with the stories of the Victorian and Edwardian epochs, so the charm of the era was involved in getting these stories on channel 13. ASK EVANS? is dealing with a younger couple who stumbles upon a dead person, who is the only last word, the story is a headline question (the novel was originally called WHY DOES NOT EVANS?), but was later reused in THE BOOMERANG CLUE. A young couple begins to investigate the murder and follow a series of people around the suspicious doctor (Eric Porter). In spite of the warnings of the hero's father (John Gielgud), the hero (James Warwick) and the heroine (Francesca Annis) continue to investigate - even if it becomes more murky and dangerous. The death of another suspect with suicide increases the obvious danger, as the killer begins to investigate the silencing of two amateur detectives. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie, although I agree that for one night it was a bit too long for entertainment (if it had been done later with Mar Mares episodes with Joan Hickson or Hercule Poirot episodes, it would have been better). But it has its strengths. One of them is Porter's main suspect use and a clever scene later in the film, where he seems to be spying on a mysterious young couple. When you get to the movie, you'll later be a fair surprise. <br /> <br /> But it has one failure. When dealing with Christie's novel, the song numbers must be rigid, so that the reader can understand the secret of the plot. I just add that if you hear the dialogue from one point and how the little boy was almost killed (but not), you will find all the parts of the story together and what were the motivations of the offender. br /> <br /> Except for this and the long time the TV film takes to tell this story, it's a pretty good movie and worth one of the best programs based on Christie's story when their sudden renaissance in movies based on his novels .
