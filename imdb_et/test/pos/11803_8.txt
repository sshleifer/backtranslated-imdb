"The Cure" is a very moving and embarrassing drama. The film focuses on two neighbors who become good friends. One of the guys is AIDS. The boys become good friends, despite the fact that Erik is at first. The film shows the boy's journey to discover the "treatment" that is "Ohio State Examiner" and how it affects their relationship. The actor is wonderful (I have never seen Annabella Scioror better) and the film is just plain. I couldn't cry with the shoe scene. This is a good tear. Keep close to kleenex. 8/10
