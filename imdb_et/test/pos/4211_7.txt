They made me a criminal case, which was the Warner Brothers' film "The Life of Jimmy Dolan", which celebrated Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. In the case of the Hays office, this remake is actually better than the original. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., is terribly puggy. John Garfield with his background and style is part of what he was born to play. <br /> <br /> They made me a criminal case led by Busby Berkeley, who believed that Jack Warner was holding the musicals. Berkeley would soon go from Warner Brothers to MGM. <br /> <br /> Berkeley is doing a good job here, keeping the action at a good pace. I especially like the scene where four Dead End Kids and Garfield swim in the water tank and fall into the water level there. They get it quite narrowly and with some good inventiveness. <br /> <br /> Other performances apart from Garfield and the children to remember are May Robson, who runs a summer camp for children and Claude Rains as an obsession with Detective Garfield Trail.
