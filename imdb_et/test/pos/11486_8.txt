When the slow start is in progress, the film will start to come out and will indeed become a lot of unexpected fun. The ensemble's cast is really good because Heather Graham is perhaps the weakest. Casey Affleck, if her brother is really good and very pleasant when you try to drift. <br /> <br /> I recommend a movie if you just want a good time. Teenagers should really enjoy this movie - it speaks a lot about relationships.
