I have to tell you that I've been a boyfriend of Star Trek TNG. <br /> <br /> Well, when did I give my friend a few DS9 episodes and asked him <br /> <br /> "Hey man you look at lately, because I've done all the TNG episodes." "Well, I got those Farscape episodes". I said, "Ok, let me try it out" I was at that time sure I liked it because I was just finished watching TNG and found it great. "<br /> <br /> I had 3 episodes, viewed them, but the show didn't impress me, I found it originally childish and I thought it was just another TV show, a nice adventure, but music was a bit different, clean special effects and I had a vague impression that the participants did not fully reach the skin of the characters. <br /> <br /> I looked at 3 more episodes to think that 3 eps is not enough to decide if I like it or not. a good grip on this activity and wanted to see what happened next to the poor Crichton. The rest is history. <br /> <br /> I think mostly the freedom of the characters in the context of the action is different from Star Trek, where everyone slept when they had to and too much high tech shit. <br /> <br /> The show got better with every episode, very interesting what I say, this movie is like poetry. <br /> <br /> I recommend it !!!
