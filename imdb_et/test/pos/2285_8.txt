It doesn't seem like too many people know about this movie. What's too bad because I think it's pretty good. Of course, this is a bit cheesy from time to time and can be predictable. But the film's presentation is pretty well done. I think casting is good with visible actors / characters. Tom Selleck does a good job of playing a baseball player (go drawing ... not too much stretching) and Ken Takakura (Black Rain) plays the leader (Japanese baseball team coach). There are not too many complaints to make. It's just a light, simple, happy comedy and I recommend it.
