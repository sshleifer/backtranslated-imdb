Just watching this movie and it's not bad; there are some tense moments and not much long dialogue. Becomes relatively intelligent; almost like "documentary". This movie highlights some nostalgia and a bit of cold war paranoia for cars, street scenes and 50's lifetime. The action is quite certain and it takes a good pace to drive for 85 minutes. Atomic film should not leave it.
