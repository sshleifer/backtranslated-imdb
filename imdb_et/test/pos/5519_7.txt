I saw this movie in my local cable system entitled "Over the Redemption". I was looking for new material to watch because most of the Saturday morning repetitions didn't interest me. I've always been a fan of Andrew McCarthy and Michael Ironside, so I chose this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> I personally enjoyed the movie. Rich Roesing, who commented on the film's film-watching film, scenes from the movie on the back of the video, is well founded. I was not disappointed to know anything about the movie beforehand. This made me rate the average score of the movie on the page. <br /> <br /> I like temporary movies and it was no exception. The film kept me until the end. I was surprised when the end is! <br /> <br /> The moments of reflection and commemoration of past experience by the main character of the film only between appendices. His reaction to these memories gave the film the side of humanitarian, as well as controversial, police work. The struggle for faith is also welcome. <br /> <br /> If you like temporary movies, but also movies that characterize the character's feelings, personal incision, this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> If you find this movie in your local cable or satellite system guide, check it out! <br /> <br /> However, if you are looking for a rental video, follow Rich Roesing's advice and let someone watch the video before watching it.
