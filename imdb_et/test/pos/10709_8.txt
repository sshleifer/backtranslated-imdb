Favela Rising is a documentary about Rio bogs, favelade, especially the most violent, Vigário Gerali. According to this film, more children have died violently in Rio de Janeiro in the last decade than in Israel / Palestine during the same period - it is astonishingly true, which shows how little known this social problem is. to the rest of the world. This is an important issue, especially for those who see hope in grassroots efforts through a culture program that is weak and vulnerable. This is a convincing documentary, when sometimes the somewhat over-personalized version of events and the terrible digital video and film that sometimes guess you need to look into your eyes are sometimes violated. <br /> <br /> The rules of favelas and weapons of adult teenage boys are the main drug dealers, as in Colombian parts. Fernando Meirelles' "City God / Cidade de Deus" is accused of marking violence (Cidade de Deus is still one of Rio's many favelas). But the early part of Favela Rising shows that in fact favela boys are celebrating violence and want to deal with drugs where money and activities are. It's cool to carry a gun there, cool down to work as a drug dealer: it's fifty times more profitable than other tools. <br /> <br /> Mochary first discovered the AfroReggae movement and its leaders, Anderson Sá and José Junior, visited Rio and urged their friend and mentor Zimbalist to finish their work and come down to help finance the film's own promise. Sá decorating and charisma, and the amazing twist in her life make her the center of the film and its main narrator, but like favelads, she's also filming with other people. There is no doubt that Sá is a remarkable leader, organizer and artist. <br /> <br /> Vigário Geral is compared to Bosnia: shooting was very dangerous. Anderson Sá's friendship and protection, as well as cautiousness and diplomacy, made it possible for filmmakers to access and capture detailed material on their subject (mostly: there were close calls), avoiding serious confrontation with drug owners or drug dealers. They also trained boys to use cameras and left them home for a trip. This resulted in 10% of the film material, including rare violent incidents, including police beatings. Outside it is difficult to track the police massacre in Rio. In the early 1990s, there was one story, and it inspired Sat, who ended his early involvement in drug trafficking to lead his cultural movement. Prisoners are in all drug trafficking and if someone doesn't like sick trained police paramilitaries coming (often wearing black ski masks) and shooting in the neighborhood, killing many innocents. <br /> <br /> This is pretty much the picture we get in Meirelles Castle, except that this time Sá, Junior and other men come, starting with Vigário Geralis, but eventually spread to a number of other favelas to give impact classes that attract tens of young people - girls and boys. The AfroReggae (Grupo Cultural AfroReggae or GCAR) program, created in 1993, is a new alternative way of life for young black men in Rio ghetto. This leads them to quit smoking, alcohol and drugs (this is the rule) to explode with rape, singing, percussion and gymnastics in expressive, galvanic performances. Finally, Sá's best performers appear with local producers in front of large local audiences and their Banda AfroReggae has an international registration agreement. <br /> <br /> Other centers and groups have been created through or through the GCAR over the years at Vigário Geralis and other favelas to seek out youth improvement by providing music, capoeira, theater, hiphop and dance training and staging performances at GCAR centers. <br /> <br /> Performing art is not everything but the centerpiece. GCAR is also a movement for wider social change. Public awareness raising through such performances also provides training in information (newspapers, radio, internet, e-mail links), hygiene and sexual education to try to bridge the gap between rich and poor in black and white and to provide workshops in audiovisual work, including documentary production. The program is currently active in four other favelas. <br /> <br /> Favela Rising has many scenes of favela and home life, and they see very similar images of a city of God that has a significant difference that focuses on and the result is very positive. Not that it's not an uphill battle. Police corruption, social inequality and the indifference of the Brazilian population are not directly addressed. But there is a scene where Sá talks to another child about another favel, cynical boys are not enthusiastic about AfroReggae and have decided to work in drug trafficking like Sá himself as a boy. Sá does not seem to be convincing, despite the fact that traffickers do not do it for fifty years. But we know that the most negative guy in this group, Richard Morales, joined the movement five months later. There is also an understandable accident that displaced Sá, but with a positive result. <br /> <br /> It would be nice if the pictures were sharper and clearer and if the story was slightly edited, but it is a lively, inspirational material and is a dedicated, risk-taking documentary and it is nice that Favela Rising has been added to seven film festivals and has won several awards, including the best new documentary filmmaker at Tribeca Film Festival. It is currently being shown at the London Institute of Contemporary Art. However, it seems that the US art lovers are somewhat unlikely. <br /> <br /> Including SFIFF 2006
