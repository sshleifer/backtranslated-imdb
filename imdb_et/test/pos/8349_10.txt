Since watching the trailer on the DVD "The Little Mermaid II: Return to The Sea", I had the feeling that this movie was great because I'm a big Disney fan. And guess what? I am right! This film is the successor of the original classic "Lady and the Tramp". <br /> <br /> It speaks of Scamp, Lady and Tramp misleading son Scamp, who wants to live and live freely. housing life. Although the film may not be as good as the first, it has a great moral that you didn't find anywhere else until you watch it. <br /> <br /> I admit that the movie is not for everyone, but for those who hate you, I can tell you that you don't have that spirit and I suggest you shouldn't see it any more. But hey! This is a really fantastic story full of brilliant animations, music and star-studded talents, featuring Scott Wolf (five parties) and Alyssa Milano (Charmed). So if you haven't seen the movie, why is it there? Go and copy a copy !!!
