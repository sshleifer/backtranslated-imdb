Little Vera is a story of a Russian teenager, his family, and his efforts to find meaning and value in life that is increasingly disintegrating. In search of his meaning, he falls in love with the more intellectual and rebellious Sergei, whose hate against his deeply faulty parents is quickly controlled by spirals. <br /> <br /> Little Vera is shocking and disturbing in almost every sense. Drinking the father, not understanding the mother and understanding it, accidental lies and brother directing and Vera herself, forgiving them all, are all shocking and a little disturbing. But the raw honesty of the film can somehow become even more shocking than the plot or characters. In confined spaces and major urban breakdowns, Little Vera has given the Soviet life much different views than it has seen before. In fact, Small Vera is a portrait of the collapse of Soviet society painted in the shades of pain, despair and rust. This is the torture of the family against the collapse of the entire social order. <br /> <br /> Although the film is painful and desperate, it's definitely worth seeing only those feelings and cultures that still shape Russia today.
