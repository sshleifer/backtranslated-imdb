I saw this movie for the second time with my 8-year-old daughter and I remembered why we first liked it. All those people who say it's bad are too tense and critical! It's just a fun little movie, it shouldn't change the world. I thought all the actors did a great job with their characters. (Except for Jeremy Jordan as a Guy - he was a storm who looked seriously at the necessity of soap and shampoo. If he were to be a hot boy at his school, they had some funny jokes.) But I was wrong, "Drew Barrymore was pleasant, as usual, and David Arquette was even enjoyable, and I usually don't get him in the stomach, just because of their STUPID AT&T ads! Molly Shannon is always entertaining and Leelee Sobieski did an excellent job in the tortured brain. Some parts were really painful, reminding me of high school. Although luckily I didn't start to joke, it made my heart pain. Such films are really good for children - my daughter made a number of observations about the brutality of some students and its falsehood. This movie is suitable for everyone and a good way after 2 hours. If you ever have time to see a lightweight film with a happy ending where you don't have to think very much, it's definitely a reward.
