I have to be honest, I really had a good time to see he was a man. Despite being a typical teen comedy, or if you are changing a sex movie, it was a pretty good laugh that I think someone could get. Both adults and teens enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is your typical rebellious teen who dresses and acts like a boy, and when he has tried the boy for a football team, he decides to take over his brother's appearance to prove himself worthy of a boy's football team. Of course, love shows itself when it meets another man who thinks he is his brother. She also has a girl who is pursuing her. Well, the tag line says it all. <br /> <br /> This is a fun little teen drama that I think will be remembered for a while. Amanda Bynes proved something in the movie, it's really hard as a man. : D Well, that's true! <br /> <br /> 8/10
