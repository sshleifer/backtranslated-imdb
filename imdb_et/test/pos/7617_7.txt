Unfortunately, I can relate to this movie because I am 17 years old and still kiss them, so I really feel for Josie. Seeing this movie has been around for a while, but to write this review, I watched it again and remember everything I loved about it. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is a great actor and this role was very good for him at that time. Chemistry between Sam and Josie was really good and Michael Vartan was this great actor. <br /> <br /> I also loved the story - as I said there, I could associate and it is rare. a movie with which you can fully communicate. <br /> <br /> All - I loved it. 7/10
