The team varied between Scully and Mulder, two other scientists, a pilot and a man playing Bana in Seinfeld, going to an Arctic research site where all members are dead by killing or killing each other. They discover that there is a worm virus that is parasitic about madness and death. The problem is that after a dog's lashes, someone can be infected but who? It's not just my first season's favorite episode but also one of my favorites. The Arctic environment is surrounded by characters, and, of course, like Carpenter's thing, it's fun to watch these uniformly hardened characters suddenly emerge in dramatic scenes. And the visual effects of the worm and its consequences under the skin are cheesy, I don't mind them at all. The end result of the inter-character drama is more than usual due to tension and because all actors (including Bana's dude) understand what is happening in the northwest. And as usual, I loved the uncertainty of the end. Highly recommended.
