Fata Morgana is by far one of the most strange and amazing films I've ever seen. I call it a documentary, because although it has elements of documenting its own images, the images are so unusual, so hallucinogenic, so unclear that I don't know if it was really worth the story just to have those pictures. The film is basically the story of the earth and the creation of the land, taken from the perspective of an external person, whether alien or anything else unspeakable, all in the Sahara desert. The title of the picture is related to the illusion or reflection of both real and hallucinating images that people in the desert often know. They are also known as mirages. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with a plane plane, followed by a plane that lands again and then again and again and again and again. For each landing pass, the actual architecture of both its location and aircraft begins to dissolve slowly with less and less real and more reflective images. The images in this film only grow more intensively and more unusual when the picture continues. The narration of the film speaks of the creation of the universe because of the amazing sexual image of sand and landscape from the camera. The shots go further and further into the desert and Herzog films he sees and finds. The strangest reflections in the world are far away, while Herzog meets some of the cleanest and most photogenic outliers you can see. When Leonard Cohen's soundtrack starts, you can be sure that you are a world lover of the world in love with the universe. <br /> <br /> I can't say much more about this movie without destroying anything, but I say it's a fun experience and nothing like that. I love to see movies that are only in their classes. This film is certainly a good example of how Herzog loves converting narrative storytelling and documentary into an interchangeable form. Unfortunately, Fata Morgana is longer than welcome only a bit, but by the time it is near, images are probably burned to your mind forever. Surely it must be seen by those who are obsessed with the nature and origin of the universe.
