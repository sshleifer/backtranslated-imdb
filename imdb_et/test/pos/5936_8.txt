Royal Rumble's 2005 edition was released by Kressi's Fresno Save Mart Center. Protected against the two highest WWE championships, The Undertaker fought against Heidenreich in the Casket match, Shawn Michaels took Edge in a terrible game built from October last year, and of course every man himself ropes at the Royal Rumble. Who took that price this year? Chris Benoit? Edge? Eddie Guerrero? Edge? John Cena? Batista? Edge? Shawn Michaels? There was no shortage of candidates. <br /> <br /> It was Batista, which won a major victory in the main event battle, but not without controversy or should I say it is a botched finish. The last two men in the ring were Batista and John Cena. Batista had to throw the young Smackdown out! The star over the upper rope, but everything went wrong and both went to the floor. The judges acted on their feet when we had a Breton and Lex Luger retrieval contest in 1994. This brought out the chairman of the board. Vinnie Mac only walked around as she could, but hurt herself badly. It was unusual to see Vince McMahon sitting down, saying that the two men would start the game again. Batista then had to do the first round and dumped the price on the floor, which sealed his future with the championship WrestleMania 21. <br /> <br /> This year's Royal Map of Rumble had a very strong line with many WWE biggest characters. Each brand had two big games. <br /> <br /> Raw opened the evening between Shawn Michaels and Edge. It was a good technical competition. Back and fourth, until Edge hit. It was a smart booking decision and kept Edge in the world heavy truck championship. <br /> <br /> The second night was a race between the Undertaker and Heidenreich. The suitability was not classic, but then are their classic Casket games again? It was fun. Especially when Snitsky participated and then Kane jumped to the big pop. Undertaker was unable to surprise anyone, when he won, closed Heidenreich's lid and its mediocre hatred. <br /> <br /> The first of the two championships at night was John Bradshaw Layfields, who defended the WWE championship. triple threat attack against both the Kurt Corner and the Great Exhibition. This game was very good. Again, it's not classic, it's fun. JBL won after capturing Kurt Angle. His party was short, but when the upside down teddy told him he didn't know he would have defended the WWE championship against Barbed Wire's Steel Show with the Big Show. Not a very nice way to spend a Sunday night. <br /> <br /> And of course there is no punch without a show. Of course, the Punch World Championship is triple H. His rematch from 2004 Unforgivenist Randy Orton was much better than the original meeting. I'm sorry they just don't seem to click the ring well and it would be a great deal of trouble if they did. Orton played the excitement very well and went down to the game. <br /> <br /> So the first big year of 2005 was good. It achieved its goals. Feuds ended and the new ones started. We were officially on WrestleMania 21.
