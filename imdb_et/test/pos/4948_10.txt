It was a fantastic movie that was incredibly realistic! I've seen it many times, and it's always been watching me. I myself am a big fan of the air force and love to watch a movie where I look at the F-16. If you like Top Gun, I guarantee you love this movie. Except for a slight damn word, it's a great movie for the whole family. It has a large plot and it has no dull moment throughout the film. Every second, the action is packed and keeps you on the edge of your seat, waiting to see what follows. So I would highly recommend this movie !!!
