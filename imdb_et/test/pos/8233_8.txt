This is a very strong Randolph Scott Western. He plays Bat Masterson and goes to Liberal, Kansas to clean the city. He will be good friends with Robert Ryan, who played a very straight-forward man. Only after that did Robert Ryan start to play a lot of darker roles. In fact, in 1947, Randolph Scott made another film that was not western and never made anything western until he retired in 1962. This movie is amazing and is constantly based on excellence. I can't say anymore because it would give the plot away. Be sure to check it out. 8/10
