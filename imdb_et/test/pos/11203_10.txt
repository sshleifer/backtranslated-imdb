After the collapse of Yesilcam (Turkey's answer to Hollywood) in the mid-1990s, few but the most preferred observers could see that in the Turkish film industry such a recent pique would obviously be based on the work of former photographer Nuri Bilge Ceylan. br /> <br /> Uzak is the third feature of the director and is the trilogy of his two previous pictures (May Kasaba and Clouds), which follow similar themes and techniques. The film features a commercial photographer Mahmoud, who lives alone in a small apartment in Istanbul, occasionally visited by his brusque, married lover. His nephew Yusuf has left his country after closing the factory and losing his job. The younger man is staying with Mahmoud while looking for work in the city, drinking in cafes and nervously watching the young women he never goes. <br /> <br /> The movie's title is translated "far away" and the film illustrates the possible meaning of every word; The physical distance of Yusuf from home, Mahmoud's emotional distance from his surrounding world and the intergenerational distance between two men. <br /> <br /> Ceylan's films rarely contain heightened drama, allowing perfect and rich characters to develop in densely framed, static shots. He is a director, producer, writer, operator and co-editor and casts friends and family in many roles. Such a limited and isolated approach to filmmaking can assume that films are hard-to-penetrate and contact most of the viewers, making Uzaki even more remarkable for mankind. <br /> <br /> Ceylan, however, is a better filmmaker than a dramatist, taking the reign of past cinema languages ​​such as Ozu and Tarkovsky. After looking at Uzaki, I can better match some tasks.
