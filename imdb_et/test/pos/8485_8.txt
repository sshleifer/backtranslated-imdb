Do not turn the bush here, Taylor Hackford's undoubtedly sliding film is little to stand out from the biological genre, except for the extraordinary career of Jamie Foxx. Remember that the year in which they gave special effects to the Oscar Terminator 2 was indisputable? They should do the same with this year's best actor gong. <br /> <br /> This Ray Charles story is worth filming, it is not contested. Indeed, many of the setbacks to his traumatic childhood are being used well and reasonably. But for such a unique life, the film looks incredible and familiar. This is followed by the history of the almost flawless genius model: difficulties and exploitation, women and drugs, recording signs, bands, rehab, yes yes. And was there more humor in his life than we treat here? <br /> <br /> I appreciate Charles's music, but where a properly cut medley would have had a story, Hackford promises to be full - too many songs - in gin joints, recording studios, concert halls, infinitely. For narrative and non-devotees, they start acting like a movie. It may sound harsh on the biological evaluation of music, but with a catalog as extensive as Ray, we need a taste not the whole cup. Otherwise, we would buy albums. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, when I was, I watched my watch once. So if the whole Foxx shine would Ray have been a two-part HBO?
