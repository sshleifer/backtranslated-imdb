Most families have similarities with their family and what was created by Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon. Natalie creates a screen image that justifies her as one of the best actors in America and one of the Golden Globe nominations. His emotional control is so tactical that at any point in the film he can take them and forget the unforgettable scene. Susan is also amazing in this film because she once again chose her role, which is as different as any other and carries it with real professionalism. <br /> <br /> Every Natalie fan would have seen a success of his movie based on his past, but you should also see it in the emotions released during the movie. This is a truly modest experience.
