I am very happy to have the opportunity to see not only this movie, but also to learn more about this exciting person and time. Lumumba is an outstanding image, giving the story in its fullest sense, without going into the usual Hollywood streaks - yes, she is shown with her wife and children, but the nature of the story is her policy and still developing an independent Congolese policy. The film has been brilliantly made and is constantly moving fast. Waiting for other Raoul Peck films, but also Eric Ebouaney!
