This movie for me and my wife is more fun than all the block-buster violent thrillers / mysteries / murder movies that are abundant. This is the life of real people. They are just India and the main characters are law enforcement. Realistic action and a great landscape make the land a little less incredible. Sound is by BC Smith, who also made Coyote Waits soundtrack and is great. Adam Beach plays a clergyman who is a bit unhappy and Wes Studi is a stoic clever professional detective. Graham Greene, Tantoo Cardinal, and others have many other fine supporting or camel roles. We've also seen Coyote Waits, another adaptation of Hillerman's novel, and we enjoyed it very much.
