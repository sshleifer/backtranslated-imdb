Okay, so this series takes the path "here we go again!" A week, a week through David Morse's character, he helps his ride who is a bit of a marinade - but what's wrong with that? David Morse is one of the greatest actors in the actors there, and certainly the coolest, and get him a series created by David Koepp - a great writer - is heaven !! <br /> <br /> Because of the lack of love for this show, I don't see it in the season series - but you never know? The amount of garbage that has gone beyond that will create me - we hope that something good can go past the first series!
