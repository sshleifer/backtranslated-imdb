My Santa Lucia cream was chosen for this movie. All 100 plus. While filming the film, I was asked to choose only 10. Oh my goodness. We had a little gal who went early to get his almonds out because he wanted to be in the movie. It was difficult to make choices. The Georgetown people are just as cute as the people they show in the film. Cute, kind, believers. The city sponsors an annual Christmas brand on the first two weekends of each year. I was there this year and it was wonderful. The city is lovely and people work hard to make it magical. The city will appear today as it did when it was made. A lot of credits go to the historical society that works to preserve historical value. The Colorado Guardian awarded the volunteers a school that has changed to the Charter School.
