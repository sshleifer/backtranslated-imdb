I didn't know anything about this movie until I watched it ... my brother suggested that I look at it. Usually, however, his suggestions are not much of a policeman, but I was stuck to see something I was watching. <br /> <br /> I gave it a short story to short cut. <Br /> <br /> The film focuses on two people who meet in the same place. First, it depends on the institution around it, the other is on the insurgency. One does what he wants, the other as he says. <br /> <br /> From the first moments of the movie, we can quickly see the friendship between the two buildings and see how they rub a little. This is a remarkable work that can say that twists can not twist good stories, people jump out of the bath or come to save the superheroes from the day. <br /> <br /> There, not everyone may ever just go right - not all gaps can ever be measured - and this movie shows a lot of joy. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie and are not impressed ..... I would recommend you do not follow anything.
