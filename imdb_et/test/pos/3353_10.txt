That's what porn used to be, it's a real classic. I mean, this is x-rated music based on the real book! There's a real plot and how many x-rated movies can boast that these days? It belongs to the exclusive list of the real pornographic classic, including Debby Dallas, deep throat and green door. I think the problem with "pornographic films" today is that it is a "pornographic" and not a "movie" issue. Alice in Wonderland has a solid graphical image of sex, but in fact it is a story at the same time. Not one typical "Oh, Mr. Police Man, don't write me a ticket", it takes one more step and makes it musical! Fabulous! If you want to see an example of good porn, this is one of the best.
