Ernst Lubitsch gave us great movies such as Design for Living, Ninotchka, The Shop around the corner, To be or not to be and other wonderful movies. But Bluebear's eighth woman usually puts Lubitsch in the weakest films. <br /> <br /> But I consider this movie an important film. This film started the collaboration between Charles Bracket and Billy Wilder. Charles Brackett, Billy Wilder and Walter Reisch wrote the scenario of Ernst Lubitschi Ninotchka. Of course, Lubitsch worked with writers in the writing process. After that, Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder worked together. Together they wrote the screenplay for well-known films such as The Lost Weekend and Sunset Blvd. <br /> <br /> The movie has a lot of funny moments. I thought "Friction" was very funny. There is a famous phrase "Movies are Slices of Life". And here is a great example of Bluebeard's eighth woman (1938). <br /> <br /> At the first scripting session, Lubitsch asked this question: how can a boy and a girl get together? Billy Wilder immediately suggested that the department store's men's shop should be the opening. "The boy is trying to buy a pajamas," he said beautifully. "But he sleeps only in the top places. He is economical, so he demands to buy only a cup. The secretary says he must also buy pants. It looks like a disaster. Then the girl goes to the shop and buys pants because she sleeps only Ernst Lubitsch and Charles Brackett were fascinated. Only a month later, they discovered that Billy Wilder himself was just the upper sleeping place and that he had taken care of waiting for a month to use it. <br /> <br /> I got this information book. I think this movie can be considered the return of Ernst Lubitsch. Immediately after this movie he made wonderful films, such as Ninotchka, Shop around the corner, and not to be. <br /> <br /> I thought Gary Cooper's performance was good. I think Lubitsch probably threw Gary Cooper because Gary Cooper was playing Long Fellow's actions, which inherited the property of Frank Capra, Mr Deed's fortune. But that's just my opinion. <br /> <br /> As for me, I enjoyed the movie very much. I appreciate this movie from 10 out of 10. Lubitsch's films are different because his films are slices of life.
