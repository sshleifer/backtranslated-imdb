"Love Letter" is a somewhat pleasant, very very low key romantic comedy, where the use of the right few words in a mysterious love letter opens up the secret passions and longings of the inhabitants of a dreamy seaside city. > <br /> Not for all viewers. "The Letter of Love" is, in my opinion, a simple and silent tone. Never deliberately nervous and fake like most romantic comedies, it's peculiar, picturesque and comfortable. But for these exact reasons, many viewers are bored and gone. <br /> <br /> Cast is nice. It's nice to see Tom Sellec again and it's such an under-filled role. And it's hard to believe it's the same Kate Capshaw with whom we met the "Indiana Jones and Doom Temple" 15 years ago. He is, of course, good here; improving every role I have seen since Indy's nerves were looted. And is it possible that Capshaw will just be easier and more loving in terms of age? (What is this Spielberg!?) <br /> <br /> It's not much; but after another noisy summer season I will probably look for a short love for this light-gentle feather romance.
