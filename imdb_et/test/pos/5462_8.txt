Okay, so maybe Jay Leno and David Letterman aren't on the spot, but you can still feel who these people are and how they work behind the screen. Bob Balaban and Treat Williams are great as Warren Littlefield and Micheal Ovitz. <br /> <br /> Film is not a joke and a punchline, but it's still funny. Kathy Bates is especially amazing as the chairman of Leno. <br /> <br /> Funny, amazing, interesting, very observable, it's a good TV movie.
