This is a summary of the events covered by several publications, and I had read two books - "Ava Madmen and Donald Crowhurst's strange last trip" before seeing the film in Sheffield just before Christmas. I have to say that it exceeded all expectations during the 1968 Sunday World Gold Hunt. These men tried to do something that had never been done before, without support ships, wooden ships, satellite phones, GPS, and just their wisdom and skill, so that they could put one piece around the world. Not to mention the individual's months, the thunderous ocean south, the small bedrooms and the boats that often surrounded them. <br /> <br /> This documentary is, in my opinion, perfectly put together, tightly modified with a great story. Archive material and interviews are exciting and bring the story to life. Clare Crowhurst's interview material is particularly revealing and touching, as she links the events that led her husband, Donald Crowhurst, to Teignmouth, doubts and fears in his mind, and his reaction to subsequent events. <br /> <br /> I had moved and even had tears or two bursts of time when credits started, and I heard other people expressing similar feelings. <br /> <br /> The two books mentioned above are useful in more detail and in retrospect, which could not be installed within 90 minutes and I would recommend them. <br /> <br /> This is finally a true story of people's courage and human weakness. You must see anyone interested in sailing, adventure, human aspirations and actual heroes.
