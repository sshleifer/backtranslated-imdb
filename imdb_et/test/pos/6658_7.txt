Well, I was expecting an epic civil war drama for all leap and Oscar candidates (& something that has "the same size as an" English patient "). This movie is not epic, but it turns out to be easier. It is a love story in the middle of a war where young men are fighting, deserters are being tracked and killed, and women and children are left to care for themselves when men are gone. <br /> Anyway, I thought Nicole Kidman and Rene Zelleweger were pretty decent and didn't know much about Jewish law, she was all right. It seems that Rene Z had a more fun part of the 3 wires, and she can cleverly play a delightful, weak, cunning female woman with lots of strokes. It was also good for me to see actor Kathy Baker ... someone's talent must be more recognized / recognized. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth it. really, but maybe because it's part of America. <br /> <br />
