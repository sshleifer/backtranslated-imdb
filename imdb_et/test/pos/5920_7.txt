"In 1927, a young man in a single-engine plane from New York to Roosevelt Field flown around the North Atlantic to Le Bourget in Paris, three thousand six hundred and ten miles. The triumph of mind, body, and spirit, Charles A. Lindbergh, influenced everyone's lives on earth - because in 33 hours and thirty minutes flight time became a reality. This is the story of this flight. /> <br /> Billy Wilder adapts to Charles A. Lindberghi's Pulitzer Prize with the same novel as the re-creation of Lindbergh's historic 1927 solo flight. For the management that Lindberg is very strong and containing the wise scenario of Wilder and Wendell's Mayes, Spirit Of St. Louis is a sincerely well-talked story. <br /> <br /> In time, threatening to become a monotonous film, Wilder keeps it, When he uses Lindbergh's setbacks to life, after a successful event, such as the risk that Nungesser and Coli will disappear [never found] while trying to in the opposite direction of the same journey, we learn such things as his first airplane and working with a flying circus. It's all a relative to understand the man and his obvious passion for flying. It also helps us give us a complete picture of Lindbergh, putting us in our insulated cab when it takes this dangerous journey. The struggle for isolation (its only company is a flight) and chronic fatigue, this is where Stewart represents Lindbergh's commitment to tasks. Thanks to Franz Waxman's and the Academy's wide-ranging results, named by Louis Lichtenfield, Wilder's film reveals an interesting human interest that received profound professional production. 7/10
