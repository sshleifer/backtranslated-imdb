I've seen this movie only once, many years ago. But I remember it very well. <br /> <br /> ** Front Spoilers ** An old famous opera singer has retired and decides to give money to cats. His boss hears it and plots to get rid of the cats so he has a fortune. He's putting his milk out. When they wake up, they find themselves miles away. They have to drive back to their house before it's too late. With independent thinking and the help of other animal companions, avoiding the carnivorous and avoiding your plan. Maybe it might have been better, but it could have been much worse. <br /> <br /> My score: 7/10.
