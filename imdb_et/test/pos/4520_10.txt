Recently I was lucky enough to see "Kite Runner" in a small theater surrounded by experienced filmmakers who knew how to enjoy such complexity. With all the controversy surrounding the central scene of this film, I expected both crude oil and violent pieces. However, the way Mr Forster dealt with the delicate subject touched and indeed deeply moved. Although the film's credit was China's main location, I could have sworn to see Kabul throughout the scenes for Afghanistan. Both professionals and professional actors work great and casting is great. So, this is a film that I would see again and again, because although it is unquestionably sad about my subject, this masterful way in today's cinema awakens a whole new hope.
