The phrase is moral ambiguity. There are good guys and bad guys in the SÃ¶derbergh remake. The character of Benicio del Toro is clearly a good man, morally pure and corrupt. His colleague in the BBC's original, Fazal, the farmer turned to the seller, is actually flawed and inconsistent with his fate. Two relentless police are alike. In America they won our hearts. In the BBC, they are too eager, almost obsessive. <br /> <br /> The best moment for me in Soderberg was when a college student rhetorically asked the Drug Tsar: "What would you do if you were poor and black and rich white people came to your neighborhood looking for drugs?" had entered the whole BBC exhibition and crystallized in Jack Lithgow's last speech. Both are excellent, but the BBC towers are around. My conclusion, after seeing both examples, is that dealers are innocent pawns who only offer demand and that the demand is causing so much suffering.
