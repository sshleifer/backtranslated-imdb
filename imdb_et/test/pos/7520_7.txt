I had never paid much attention to this flick until I found out that Paddy Chayefsky, the author of the brilliant "network", was a screenwriter. His work there was so genius for me, so when "Hospital" appeared in TMC, I was able to see it. I was not disappointed. Looking at both this film and the "Network", it seems that his great theme is the absurdity, failure and honesty of large human businesses (such as hospitals, networks), and the holiness of personal experience and human spirit, all of which are completely black humor. "Hospital" is a comedy as "Network" with the same black and great pain, led by an incomparable Scott, making his work completely fair. It's a keeper; be sure not to miss.
