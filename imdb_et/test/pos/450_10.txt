Most people think that Yul Brynner's greatest performance was King of Siam and I definitely gave him many different moods to test his abilities to learn comic, tragic, eager to dominate hate. He also showed him the advantage of a "singer" and a dancer. Finally, as it was also his Tony award winning Broadway, the film also promised a great Broadway performance. <br /> <br /> But he also made other films that showed his talents as well as THE KING AND I. His comic move with ONCE MORE WITH FEELING was pretty nice. So was his performance as General Bunin in ANASTASIA or his Rams in TEN. Yet he came terribly close to Eric Von Stroheim's successor in the 1950s as a "man you love to hate." A certain vulnerability in his actions and roles gave him a film, even after his best years when the star was behind him - and he was increasingly relegated to repeating Siam's art on television and stage. <br /> <br /> My best results are the 1959 drama Deborah Kerr, Jason Robards Jr, Robert Morley, EG Marshall, Anne Jackson and Ronnie Howard. The film has been set in quite modern times - a powder barrel, which was in Hungary in 1956, when it seemed that the iron curtain came under the reform of the Hungarian patriot Imre Nagy and his supporters. But the Hungarian revolution fell due to bad timing. The Russians and their Polish and East German allies sent tanks to break the rebellion (arrested and executed by the Great and other reformers). The West stood and let it happen: England and France were hit by the Suez crisis and the US had attacked them and Israel from Egypt. The actions of the three close allies of the United States made it difficult to understand the overcrowding of the Western Soviet Union. It was a deplorable situation and the Hungarians never forgot how they were abandoned in this. <br /> <br /> The film features Brynner, the major Russian intelligence officer Major Surov, who oversees some of the Hungarian leaders. Rebellion, one of which is Jason Robards. Some of the western bus trips through Hungary, led by Robert Morley (including Marshall, Jackson, Howard and Kerr), can be helped in the Kedes. The latter is kept in the hotel when their bus is repaired, and Brynner mixes with them, hoping it will lead to Robards. But Brynner is a human being - he is trying to be with those people (everyone who sees him as a monster), and, as he is a bit too drunk, he faces the issues that have plagued the historian since 1945: How (even if to note that in Russia there was a responsibility to Stalin) that relations between Russia and the West fell so fast? In general, the Allies worked well together between 1941 and 1945, but after Yalta and Potsdam all mutual doubts broke down. Did they have to? Surov is a good officer, but he has been half loyal to the communist regimes in the Soviet Union and in Hungary, which he supports, and his growing affection for Kerr, who hides Robard, but is also ready to see more human attachment to the Russian ambassadors. And when the film reaches its tragic peak, let's see how Surov has to decide whether he will follow his sense of duty or repent of Kerr, Robards, and other westerners who want to leave. It becomes a real struggle for him - and what he can win too late. It was a great film about the post-war tragedy of Europe and perhaps the most thoughtful role that Yul Brynner once imagined.
