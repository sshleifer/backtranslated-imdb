"Cell" is a rather difficult film for classification. If you read the plot sketch, "psychotherapist trips inside a comic serum killer in the hope of rescuing his last victim," one might think that it is a thriller with a little science fiction. But that's not the fairness of the movie. The subconscious mind has a fantastic aspect, which is a stunning, spectacular visual and incredible scenario. There's drama because the above-mentioned psychotherapist (played by Lopez before he became a romantic comedy component) is contacting the child and knows his terrifying upbringing. And there is a constant aspect of fear caused by the worsening of the evil personality of the serum killer. The film tries to function at many different levels and crosses the genre. Although I feel that it is quite a strange experience, I find it completely exciting. <br /> <br /> Immediately after the launch, Lopez rides a horse through the desert, dressed in white clothing. know you are a visual treat. Every time the audience leaves the reality and follows it into the subconscious depths of its "patients", they are provided with visual and phonetic pleasure. Costumes are great angles and colors. The camera leaves the regularities on the door and moves around the world where they are up and down. Characters become rulers of their domains and become beings that deserve such growth. If you don't have anything else about "The Cell," you have the impression that these scenes have been made. <br /> <br /> Casting is also the upper limit. Jennifer Lopez is here in her element, using her natural, compassionate and almost motherly sensitivity, while combining her striking looks with lush surroundings, makeup and costumes. He is incredibly sexy and I personally want someone else to find him / her outside of the romantic world he has written that would allow him to experiment. Vince Vaughn is quite convincing as an FBI agent who does something to save a young woman. But it is undoubtedly Vincent D'Onofrio, who has the greatest impression here. This is an extremely difficult role, because it is bound to bring out many emotions inside the viewer. We are disgusting about our actions, but we are compassionate about it because of the trauma experienced in our lives. He looks great in his field, but still insecure and vulnerable in the real world. This is an excellent performance for an underrated actress. <br /> <br /> Although the "cell" does not work well at every level it ambitiously tries (some of the characters' actions are unreliable) and although it is all based on somewhat uncomfortable scientific logic, it is occasionally shocking, visually amazing The main trip that rewards many views.
