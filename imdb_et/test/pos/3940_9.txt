Only for Coop lovers, though Clint Eastwood is a very strong but unobtrusive presence, this is a very good documentary. It is Gary Cooper's biography, based mainly on his filmography, but also on more private archives that show him as a child, a young man as a family, with some of his friends (Picasso, Hemingway, etc.). ) as an older man, finally a man who is sick and close to death. After the "end" I didn't feel like I knew this man better. But I have spent a very good moment reviewing the best moments of my films; and my respect for very talented actors and a great professional was increased tenfold. The film shows most interestingly how Cooper's career can be parallel to the development of US society before and after WW2. Two great moments are the time when Cooper has to respond to communism in the world of film. and when James Stewart (also very big) received the Cooper award one month before his death. I'm not a bitch, but ... it was close! See if you can: it's worth it. ... If you love Cooper, that's it. Or older American ...
