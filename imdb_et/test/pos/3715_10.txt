Two soldiers are a great example of making fine films. The director and producer took a warm-hearted story and brought it to life with highly skilled and dedicated cast, excellent cinematography and highly creative art. with great details and sharp contrast to the militaristic lifestyle they entered. Communication between the brothers brought laughter and tears as they fought a hard but peaceful life in the backwoods of North Carolina and even harder for warfare. <br /> <br /> The show was great, especially for the younger brother, who is on the big screen (played by Jonathan Furr), the older brother (played by Ben Allison) and the powerful colonel (played by Ron Perlman). The performance was very well cast. <br /> <br /> It was a pleasure to enjoy the magic of two soldiers, and I recommend it to the audience of all ages.
