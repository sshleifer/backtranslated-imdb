This classic has so many large liners and inadvertently fun scenes that I don't even know where to start. If you want advice on dating, then here. Just ignore the person you want and pull out the classic lines like "Chicken Good ... I like chicken" and before you know it, you have one night in the basement (this is the NICE basement). a woman who is 35 years younger than you. Bronson does it all in this movie. He buys a car without good reason so he can murder two gang members ... pay with "CASH" ...... chunnng .... He buys ice cream just because "it's America, not" t it " and ends with wasting someone called "giggler - he laughs when he runs" just because he stole his camera. By the way, this "giggler" is so fast that Bronson's usual gun can't even catch up with him, he needs to clean it so that it can eat a really stinky meal (stuffed cabbage) with a few old kittens who want to wear heavy clothing in 90-degree weather, he goes to the dentist. the crowbar, if it needs it (and the same!) And last but not least, it seems that it always has a rocket launcher when he needs Richie Cunningham's older brother Chuck, who is now pulled out and needs a makeover. everything is reasonable when you are e have seen this classics ... all I can say is enjoy! "I owed you one DUDE"
