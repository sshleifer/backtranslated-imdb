There are a few movies that have been waiting for me and waiting for release more than this. This is the latest film by The Dead Gentlemen, who is responsible for the original Gamers movie and Demon Hunters films. This group has not been very active in recent years, but this movie is a definite reason to try and keep your progress. <br /> <br /> This movie follows a group of players trying to end the campaign that GM drives, deceiving his group of ignorance. With the new blood, they help the campaign again, hoping to end this time. <br /> <br /> This movie is a fresh air breath in the film community and a great improvement over the original. The film shows respect for the game, like the original film, but it shows a dramatic improvement in special effects that triggers it beyond the simplicity of college films. Action is pretty decent and the jokes are pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, many jokes are joking, so if you are not a player, the movie may not be funny than others. This is why I give 9 instead of 8, which I originally thought. Each case, if you are a player or a game announcement, check it out if you enjoy it.
