This kind of hamlet, Danish prince production is best for me. While this may not have the value of some of the latest customizations, it is the most important element: Sir Derek Jacobi as Hamlet. . His emotional imagery is cast down from hatred to sadness, love to revenge, and anywhere else on the map, but without seemingly forced or overwhelmed. In fact, there are some powerful sequences when it lowers them, with silence, soft speech and thoughtful expression. Does he interpret Hamlet as crazy or sensible ... should you decide for yourself; I changed my mind more than once. At one point, he seems to have thought himself reasonable and just playing madness, but suspects that he is actually mad ... revelation himself, striving beautifully. Being a part of Hamlet in the production has been directed by more than any other participant in history, Jacob's affinity for this role is too small a surprise. filmed copy "of a performance game with little special effects or fancy camera work, minimal sets and musical broadcasting to talk about. This production is based on the acting ability of cast actors and the words of Shakespeare to create emotions and interest for their audience. And it works. Other players are also top-notch, especially "Claudius" by Patrick Stewart and "Gertrude" by Claire Bloom. Together, the ensemble is a seamless band. <br /> <br /> The last (but by far the least) element that makes it stand out is the game itself. Here it is presented in its entirety, the rarity of the film, but strangely, I have never noticed time, I was too busy to get the story.
