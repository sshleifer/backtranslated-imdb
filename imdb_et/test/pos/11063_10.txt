I grew up in New York and every afternoon ABC showed a 4:30 movie - Saratoga Trunk was one of the first movies I remember as a baby. I loved this movie and it has been with me for years. I looked at it recently and thought it was great - maybe I'm just romantic - but I thought it was well done. I don't want to say that this movie was good only for the main actors - I really didn't know who they were when I first saw this movie - I think I just felt quality as a baby. Both Bergman and Cooper were excellent. I especially loved seeing the old New Orleans during the movie. If you get a chance to visit New Orleans - you should watch movies that show the city during that time - if you see some old homes in the French Quarter (not just Bourbon Street) or downtown, you can truly imagine life like it was 100 years ago . <br /> <br /> I love old movies - it's a good flick to me!
