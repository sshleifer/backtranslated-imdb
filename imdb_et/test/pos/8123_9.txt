This film sometimes makes it hard to imagine the ones they represent are cast. This unlimited passion and action at times makes it a very enjoyable and interesting movie. It wouldn't even have been known, except for HBO late at night. And the biggest reason I like British movies much better than American is that the actors are not afraid of what they need.
