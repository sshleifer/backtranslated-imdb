Leos Carax is brilliant and is one of the best film and camera boys, so it should not be surprising that Pola X is an almost perfect film that is never the most intestinal. Seriously. If I could have climbed inside my video monitor in some way, I would be Pierre one inch away from my life. No one has the right to be so absorbed and stupid, both at the same time, except for Heathcliff Emily Bronte at Wuthering Heights. After 134 minutes with Pierre, I need a big glass brand. I've never been so angry with the head. Having said this, Pola X is a stunning movie that has one of the very honest sexual scenes I've ever seen in any movie. here, by the way. Pola X beats you from hell, so make sure you're ready for it, if you decide to watch it.
