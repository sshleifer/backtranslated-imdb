Sometimes it is possible to watch movies with subtitles (in this case Danish), but watching is worth it. When the story progresses, choosing two sisters, caring for the father is justified, but their society is different. Their choice leaves them alone until the French woman comes. The question may be why a French woman came to her place of residence and it has never been fully developed. The event that will later take place due to unexpected funds from France is an extraordinary joy for everyone involved and something they never experienced before. This will give you a good gratitude for the goodness that has been given to the guests. Shooting in the dark aura and displaying poverty is a beautiful experience for the viewer.
