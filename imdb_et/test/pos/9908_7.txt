This movie was recently shown with Australian special broadcasting subtitles that are not dubbed. I thought I read here that sometimes the assumption is that * the revenge of the rats is a sequel. In fact, rats get revenge for this film or things done in human history. At the moment, I don't know prequel. <br /> <br /> Now we get Hamelin out of Piper Piper. Perhaps this story, in my opinion, exceeded the time of watching the movie, but that's all. At the end of the movie, the word "cache" was used. The frustrated mayor is trying to justify his actions by saying "the coffers were empty". "Cards" are not the words you hear these days if you don't read your children like I do. Since I saw * Ratsi's Revenge *, I've read two versions of Hamelin's Piper Piper. Now I see a comparison. Metaphoric fat, but literally a ugly mayor allows more than a city to afford to get rid of the rats. It's about as much as I can follow the analogy. Children are not led to the mountain door where one flat boy is left to talk about wings of horses and fountains where it is always spring and everyone is always happy. <br /> <br /> A lot that is quite common about this movie. Especially romance and resolution. Female characters have a potentially powerful role in society, but they are really quite impotent. If this film is quite rebellious (compared to American cinema), it is authoritarian. The mayor strikes the helicopter as a "good" pilot. The mayor and the local government represent a corrupt and big money reversal. Finally, one Frankfurt doctor is dealing with an epidemic of lethal and infectious disease. There is probably no national infectious disease authority to coordinate or back up things. <br /> <br /> I am not a horror aficionado, so all the horrors I see are usually mixed with humor. Immediately from a blood bank, you can see that most viewers have the right balance between horror and comedy. A large number of rats are impressive and also spooky fans are happy.
