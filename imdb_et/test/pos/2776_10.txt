Susie Q is one of those rare and sweet movies that gives you a warm feeling. It's bitter but healthy and it's fun and amazing. First of all, I thought this film would be clich√©s that took me five minutes, but I was wrong. It made me tear from time to time and this plot was tempting, making me good guys. I loved the movie and I remember it 9 years later! I highly recommend it to ANYONE and the film is family-friendly so you don't have to worry about inappropriate content. Indeed, if Disney showed more movies equal to Susie Q, this would be the most popular family-based channel in the world. Now if only Disney would show it once! ^ _ ^ Go Susie Q. !!
