*** SPOILERS *** A well-made and interesting film in the 1950s on American alienated youth. Many parents managed to make big bucks and live high these days, forget that their children, especially teenagers, needed much more than a car and hefty grants to feel part of the family. They also needed love and attention, their growing problems, the 16-year-old Hal Ditmar, James MacArthur never became his successful film producer, Mr.Tom Dmitmar, James Daly. <br /> <br /> Never really joining his father Hal is growing beyond him and his caring mother, Helen Ditmar, Kim Hunter, as well as society. After placing his father in Hal, who wanted to borrow his car, a late luxury sedan, he and his friend Jerry, Jeffery Silver, drove to the local West with hitting Bali and using the 1930s barley to catch the last Western game. <br /> <br /> Feeling out of the world, Hal acts like a real first-class jerk that grabs the feet of almost a couple, Eddie Ryder and Jean Corbett, sitting in front of him and watching Jerry's movie. So Hal, as well as his friend Jerry, will lead not only to theatrical theater, but to his theatrical director, Mr. Grebbs, Whit Bissell. It turned out that at least Hal was ready to leave the theater without being able to get the money back, but when Grebbs tries to get him around Halis and kiss him, he's right now. real hot water, accused of attack and battery, puts his "James Dean" into a local police station, making it too cool or just stupid to figure out what he has done; almost knocked out Mr. Grebbs teeth. This is when Sgt.Shipley, James Gergory, tells Hal that his dad should pick him up when he finally fits in with what he's done. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the movie, Hal will try to stretch out, but he will not be able to do it because his father has badly appreciated him. Asking his father to understand what he did, Mr Grebbs, was in self-defense. Hal's father acts as if he had been there, in the theater, and saw the whole incident with his son Hal, who acted as a grabbing and pushing a young man without provocation, instead of the street thug. <br /> <br /> At the announcement of Mr Grebbs, he did not apologize for what Hal did, he actually agreed to admit his hooligan behavior, but he wanted both Mr Grebbs and his father at least to treat him with discretion; Gebbs was provoking Hal and Mr. Ditmas that he didn't even bother to hear him! Feeling like an offender, without anyone, but his mother, to actually become too desperate, loses slowly that both are Sgt later. Shipley and Mr. Grabbs agree to lower the charge. You think Hal has finally learned his lesson, but the real lesson, more than stretching behind, is that Hal is so desperately needed for his father to completely ignore it! Being there when her son needs her the most and Mr. Ditmar wasn't able to hit the flying colors. <br /> <br /> Things will only make the movie look for everyone after Mr Grebbs gets a lap belt. Sir, who once again Hal, who returns to Grebbs Theater, tries to call him to his father and tell him that Hal only defended himself when he first called him, not the second time. Finally, Hal learned a real lesson in communicating with people when he did not give his problems to other people's problems. But most of all, Hal's father, Mr. Ditmar, learned the most valuable lesson of understanding his disillusioned and alienated son and acting like his father instead of a combined prison keeper and a sugar father. As the song says, "Everything you need to love" to get things right and his son Hal was both in love and in the understanding that Mr. Ditmar was the most out of the movie until the end of the movie.
