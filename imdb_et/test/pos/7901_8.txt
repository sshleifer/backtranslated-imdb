Of the 28 awards, 26 won this film as one of the best in 2007. The fact that this has been done by non-professionals who were trained to act and dance, does so much more than this is Bollywood's production, but it is an art. The lower box girl wants to sing and dance. He wants to move in society, but there is a limit. Everyone cannot be the president of India, the caste system exists, and the narrow minds don't let it spoil. <br /> <br /> Vanaja (Mamatha Bhukya) goes out of school for 15 years and goes to a homeowner (Urmila Dammannagari), who had once achieved a dancer. After some time, the animals are taught to sing and dance. The film is amazingly beautiful with rich colors. It is amazing what can be done with $ 20,000 because this film was a master's project for the writer's director. <br /> <br /> The city owner's son (Karan Singh) returns to America to travel to the office and is hit by a girl. But he is a lower box and can only be a ship of his lust. Things aren't better at home when his father drinks and eats and steals his money. She gets pregnant and has to sell her child. <br /> <br /> Finally, he never rises above his box, but the story was exciting and the actor was very good.
