Thirty years since this film was made, it has somewhat stopped and keeps the public alert as I am sure it happened in 1979. one finds his sad importance today (see the story of the FirstEnergy Davis-Besse nuclear power plant). At the top of a series of actors and at a constant pace, one can learn to forget about the environment of the 70's and see it as a political criticism of what it is. However, I doubt that it will survive the time experiment. It may not be completely forgotten due to its pain, but otherwise dialogue, setup and score will make it a must for the remake of this movie. Since the oil situation is now comparable to that of the 1970s and alternative energy sources are getting hotter again, we can only hope that the current generation will keep such warnings about (privatized) nuclear risks.
