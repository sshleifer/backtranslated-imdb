Lovely Candace Bergen as a widow Perdicaris is kidnapped and held for ransom by Sheik Raisul, played by one of the fun Sean Connery. This incident comes in 1904 when Theodore Roosevelt elects his presidency. Brian Keith, who wants to show the United States muscle foreign policy, gives Roosevelt a stunning declaration to Moroccan Sultan "Perdicaris alive or Raisul dead." <br /> <br /> But in this adaptation of this incident, this ad is the only real thing. This Perdicar was actually one of Ion Perdicaris, who was a Greek immigrant and dilettante playboy. In fact, Perdicaris had withdrawn his American citizenship many years ago and returned as a Greek citizen. Do not forget that although its inconsistency was sufficiently usable by that time. <br /> <br /> The troubled girl changes the material on the right screen so that she is a widow's wife and her two children who are sorry here. Of course, as has been said here, some of our European authorities are also using the case in Morocco. The intrigues surpass the brigade's demand for ransom. <br /> <br /> Wind and lion are hardly history. But it's an enjoyable movie and Sean Connery is always fun to watch. Brian Keith also fits into my concept Theodore Roosevelt and Roosevelt White House scenes speaks to all stories. John Huston will ever play the afflicted Secretary of State John Hay, who had inherited Roosevelt from his predecessor, William McKinley. However, children do not use this film to skip reading the historical task in Theodore Roosevelt's history.
