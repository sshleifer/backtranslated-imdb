The most sold novel The Dismissal, The Missing Star, the latest known Italian director Gianni Amelio, is a story of growing friendship between an older Italian carer and young translators working in Shanghai. through China. Vincenzo Buonovolonta is the maintenance manager of the closed steel mill in Italy and the blast furnace sold to China. When Vincenzo (Sergio Castellitto) discovers that the oven control unit is defective and potentially dangerous, he drives to China to find a steel plant where this part has been sold in the hope of preventing a fatal accident. > The film is, of course, a journey that is not a destination to use the familiar clich√©, and in this journey we have a story from China that has all its enormous beauty and complexity through Luca Bigazzi's outstanding cinematography. The film takes us to Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongquing, Baotou and a trip along the Yangstze River, showing us the coastal areas that are supposed to flood when Three Gorges Dam is a fully functional, Chinese mega-project that has led to relocation. 1.2 million people. The journey brings passengers face to face with poverty, overcrowded housing and caring for themselves. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the relationship between Vincenzo and translator Liu Hua (Thai Ling). Italy, where his impatience with his translations at a dinner dinner causes him to lose his job. When he pursues him in Shanghai, he works in a library and is resistant to Vincenzo's approach. Looking at his offer to help him travel a little bit more than a well-paid job in China, he reluctantly agrees to go with him. Their relationship, however, is growing as they move from city to city, and its interpretation skills are a lot of evidence to help Vincenzo, who is not a mobile phone, confused. <br /> <br /> As they slowly open up to each other, they are exposed to each other's vulnerability, and the film goes into its past and present-day life, and how they came to their present situation. We meet Liu's son (Lin Wang) at his grandmother's home. In one of China's child policies, she is one of the unwanted children who are "hidden" because the boy's father gave up his family. Although the meeting between Vincenzo and the boy is casual, their relationship becomes central to how the story plays. <br /> <br /> Castellitto is a great actor (though one longing for the younger Enrico Lo Verso in this role). But he is emotionally distant in the film, his expression rarely changes far from the voice of the voice. Although Thai Ling has a lot of presence on his role, his relationship with many older Vincenz never seemed real to me, and the end seemed to exist only in the reality known in the movies. Although Amelio is one of my favorite leaders who come to House's brilliant key heels, there is a missing letter of disappointment.
