The display is a very topical issue in the form of a very tight thriller. It's a thrilling and not preaching film. Seeing the Arab state with a blend of Arab and European audiences gave him an extra atmosphere. The film was completely captured by the viewers and after that loud applause. The Egyptian story, married to Americans, raised suspicions of links to terrorist organizations and was sent to a friendly (US) Arab country for "enhanced interrogation" (as Meryl Streep describes in the movie: "We don't have torture in the US") seems to be on today's news front. There is a very clean connection between the different characters in the movie, and the film will never lose its pace. Jake Gyllenhal has described in his film that many more terrorists are being created in the case of the kidnapping and torture of suspects. It is equally excellent with Streep and Reese Witherspoon.
