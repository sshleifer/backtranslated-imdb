It was a great movie, I compare it to The Game. You reach the end of flick and cant ... your brain is removed and shaken (not mixed) and put back on your head. Do not plan anything after this movie, you need time to think about what just happened. <br /> <br /> Don't get into this movie, waiting for the multi-million-matrix multiplayer effect on special effects. , they keep you involved, no, they suck you and don't let the movie last. Great acting, great plot ... very enjoyable movie, I can't say enough. Also a very original plot, lots of twists and ideas I've never thought of. The end is steep and leaves you hanging to wonder if it was real? Is this really the end? Good end, not to say it's bad ... just leaves you thinking and a little frazzled. <br /> <br /> A great movie for those who like the action, like a good plot (don't try to break the bathroom with this movie, the lights are gone) and like mind games, because that's exactly what it is.
