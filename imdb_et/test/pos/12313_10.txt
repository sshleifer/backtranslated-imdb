I believe John's "The Dead" is a real classic. It was not only Houston's last film, but it is quoted as saying, "everything I know about cinema is in this movie." The tightly tuned story of James Joyce's "Dubliners" is a great piece of ensemble featuring actors from John's daughter Angelica Houston, England and Ireland who bring the story to life. This is a film that should be part of every serious collection, not just because it is visually elegant, but because the story is timeless and very tempting. The film is not rushed or accused. Rather, it opens up a story of characters bringing light and meaning to dialogue. The end of the film is stunning, poetic and haunting. I recommend "The Dead" without reservation as one of the best movies.
