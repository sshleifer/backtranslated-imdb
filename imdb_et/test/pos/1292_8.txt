Humphrey Bogart sees her first star as very young, works well, but has a clear lisps hints later in her career. However, he is a very good and very tempting inventor of the new aircraft engine's idealistic youth. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Mackaill is a true star here, playing a casual woman torn between her true love of Bogart (she's also broken) and the comfort and safety (Hale Hamilton) of getting married with older men. <br /> <br /> While driving, Astrid Allwyn is the sister of Bogart, Bradley Page, as his future producer, Barbara Leonard as a cosmetologist, Jack Kennedy Gilligan and Halliwell Hobbes as a faithful (and wise) butler. <br /> <br /> Both Mackaill (which had been a silent movie star) and Bogart tried to speak in 1932. Bogart was a slow tumor in Broadway; Mackaill was sliding and soon appeared on the production of lines like PICTURE BRIDES. Yet they are both very good. Mackaill wasn't even 30 when he appeared in the movie!
