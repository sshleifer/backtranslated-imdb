It was a television show that I watched as a child in the 1960s and was fascinated by it. Over the years that have passed, I have often thought about this exhibition and how good it would be to look again, but being aware that things in the past are not always as good as you remember them. It was an excellent show in the 1960s and did not lose anything, even now in 2007. Of course, there are some odd defects that you see while watching old exhibitions, and it takes a few episodes to practice dubbed voice, but after doing so I was so fascinated when I was back in the 1960s. Samurai plays Koichi Ose, who plays the role very humbly. I remember during the 60s that because of the popularity of the exhibition here in Australia, he went through a sword game, and was amazed by the interest in the exhibition and against him. It was wonderful that one of my favorite exhibitions of all time was still magical, which he did in childhood. A must see the series.
