Well, where to start. Did you know that some of the leading robots were offered to the famous mime team Shields and Arnez? But he didn't. But they turned it up, complaining about the robot makeup. Then they faded in shadow. Now this movie has everything. A scared killer robot who thinks he's dirty Harry. A lot of cool robots. It's funny, it concerns, it's the perfect date for the film for people who love sci-fi and romantic comedies. This is the first robot for a romantic comedy. Of course, very few movies are perfect now and there are some questions. But there are very few and can be ignored. I think couples enjoy this movie and want to watch it again and again. 9 STARS.
