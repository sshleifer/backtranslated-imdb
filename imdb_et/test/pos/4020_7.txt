Hey, all you get, you rocks the fox, you mean. Watch out for killing in town! If you're looking for a bad ass, a funky movie to watch at night, it's just right. "Killing" is back and is just trying to relax after his adventures in Mexico. But if you're a narrow-minded gangster like "Duncan", you must look for revenge. Why, I don't know. Was Hoffo the first brother or what? Anyone who. The film begins with the old "murder plane" routine. We all know that this is the most effective way to take one boy out on a picnic, full of people. Needless to say, killing will survive, but Cmndt. Eric Lassard, sorry that George Gaynes is not so happy. SMACK! The best friend, Pratt, is also killed. This is the beginning of a great adventure, full of hippies and funkiest music that James Brown himself offers. It's the right "God of the Spirit" has put its mark on this bad boy. In addition to leading the role of Jim Brown, this film is full of the biggest names the blaxploitation scene offers. How about Scatman Crothers, Dick Anthony Williams, Gloria Hendry and Brock Peters. In other parts, nobody sees anything other than Judith M. Brown and last but certainly the least fantastic Don Stroud as an evil man.
