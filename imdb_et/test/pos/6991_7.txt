Although this film begins with the usual: something goes wrong, the spacecraft runs together, people are left behind, etc. it still pulls out and introduces some new ideas to the viewer. Riddick is a somewhat bad ass convicted and has changed his eyes so that he can see in the dark what the ship's crew member is and what he's looking for because of his entrance. Cutting the film is great and emphasizes the mystery surrounding the hero and the male main character, "Riddick". Pitch Black's story, as already mentioned, is somewhat very irregular and dissatisfied, but cutting and cutting the film, mixed with some surprising elements that are included in the story, is still very supportive, and one is more hybrid after that and feeling hungry. Vin Diesel works really well in the role of Riddick, and although his character is difficult, difficult to survive, he still takes moral decisions on a near-right edge, but that does not mean his decisions will not change in his favor at the end ... Why destroy already the perfect reputation? All in all, this is a very good movie, though not perfect. The story seems very unnatural on the surface, but under it enough originality is reflected for entertainment. In some scenes, this is a wow factor, while it is a bit better than average. Perhaps it could be described as a cult film and it is definitely a recommendation for people who want a spicy sci-fi story mixed with some small psychological moments and intriguing main character, Riddick.
