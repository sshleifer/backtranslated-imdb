I am a big fan of the $ 5.50 DVD on my local WalMart. Hopefully your local branch is. You will find a bunch of sweaters, a bunch of trash and a casual surprise. This movie is one of the surprises. My friend bought it recently and thought it would be another kung-fu laughing cheer, I was really surprised how good it was. I watch a lot of movies and as a result, I can almost always call how the movie appears; and if there is a twist on the plot, what is it. Not that movie! Leadership is brilliant, the plot is fantastic and fighting is incredibly inventive. If you see that it sits somewhere in a dirt-cheap price, then get it! If you see it at full price, I would recommend it.
