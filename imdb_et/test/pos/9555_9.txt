<br /> <br /> This is the best film from the show I've seen for a long time. Very long time. Well, it will ever be accepted. Isn't that a part of charm? The idea really is to make a movie that mocks a documentary about the event that most people might be odd. Even if there were no big laughs, the idea would still be ridiculous. All the movies that try to read something new in my proverb book. I also loved dogs!
