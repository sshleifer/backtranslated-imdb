Gilmore's girls are about one mother with a 16-year-old daughter. Now the daughter is 16 years old (in season 1) and they live like sisters. Sharing everyone, trusting each other. I like The Gilmore Girls, but I'm not sure why. Mother, named Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and daughter named Rory (short Lorelai, played by Alexis Bledel), are both very beautiful women, they are both funny and they are charming on their paths. There are some funny supportive characters like Luke (Scott Patterson). He and Lorelai, like everyone, can be loving each other, but neither of them really works. They have their little moments. There are other supportive symbols, most of which are very funny, and their winning moments are great. <br /> <br /> I like to see the relationship between young mothers and daughter who are becoming adults the most. The dialogue between them is fast, sharp, funny and sometimes touching. They are beautiful. Gilmore girls feel good to try it.
