This movie is full of surprises, many of which are funny. The fact that it was written and directed at the age of 24 blows in my mind. Some scenes where high school kids use ecstasy made me very uncomfortable because I have this childhood and I can use it. As a second parent, I found that parent-child interactions are accurate, because I enjoyed a lot of jokes about the movie, and I enjoyed not everything was perfect and all the questions were not finally resolved. The truth of Mark Twain's paraphrase is unfamiliar to fiction, as fiction is bound to remain as possible while truth is not. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that plays with the viewer, allowing us to believe that people are what other people think they can later understand that the people we assumed were right, the real situation fully aware. One of the strongest scenes in the film, a scene from which we feel very relieved and sympathetic about what nature is doing, is a totally false premise, and the character, though admirable, is totally wrong. I think it's very delicately done. Very realistic. <br /> <br /> I liked the score a lot - I thought it really contributed to the movie, really helped set the mood - the film has a few moments of screws and background music helps to make sure that. <br /> <br /> The Valedictorian speech is clean and half-hearted - got a big laugh! The film is now in my head - I saw it this morning. Trying to see it again, allowing time. Dozens are hard to find, but there are nine in my book.
