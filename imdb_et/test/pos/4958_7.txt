Sorry, but I just can't help, I love watching Iron Eagle. Now, don't misunderstand me, I'm not saying it's a great movie. I'd rather say it's an endlessly fun movie. For people who cut this movie into pieces because they are not realistic, there is no point. Of course Iron Eagle's plot was ridiculous. But I believe his target audience was kids, and I certainly remember when I was little. Now I find it fun like innocent pleasure, like Road House. This film is part of the great pantheon of the 80s, films made up of adult children. You must remember D.A.R.Y.L, Real Genius, E.T. This whole sequence was so STUPID! But at the same time, it was fun, funny, totally in the 80's, all this good thing. So Iron Eagle is a great 80-year-old guilty pleasure. Hairstyles, dancing, music, dialogue, everything is funny as hell. I have a Iron Eagle on a DVD, and for me it was totally worth $ 9.99 for Best Buy. If you love to laugh on dated, unrealistic movies, this is a must-see. Oh yeah, and I think his plot was just a little stupider than the 1986 second fighter pilot project, Top Gun.
