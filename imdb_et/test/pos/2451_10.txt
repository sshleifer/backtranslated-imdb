I have to agree with the previous author's comments about the great performances and the plot. I started this movie randomly ... (lazy on Sunday afternoon clicking on the channels to see if something was good) ... and Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez are glamorous. Wow! Gut wrenching! Weave to everyone (always admired Martin Sheen) but was particularly impressed by Emilio! Great for doing and managing ... just great! Why have I never heard of this movie? I have to distribute the news.
