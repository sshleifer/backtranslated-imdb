I have no words to describe this series. </p> What was finally the creation of Haruh, because he wants a world of aliens, escorts and travelers - is a recurring anime series and a breath of fresh air in the world with non-innovative TV shows. The characters are well developed and you will eventually love them, some less than others. The word describing the work of animation does not exist because "great" would really be inadequate to describe how it was done. There are many funny situations that either make you smile or put you in deep thoughts. Don't get the impression of the first episode because it's just the tip of the iceberg, because novels are coming. <br /> <br /> The only problem is due to lack of chronological sequence of episodes, but can you solve this problem, right? Conclusion: Undoubtedly one of the best 2006 series.
