I have the emotions associated with this film, especially if it's comparable to its predecessor, <br /> <br /> "The American werewolf in London." There were funny moments in this movie, it was still a horror story. This updated version, now set in Paris, has no such "edge" at all and just doesn't belong to the same class .... but it has some good things that the first movie didn't and overall is still fun to watch. So, "werewolf purists", most of whom think this film is pure rubbish compared to the London version, still give it a decent sign because I don't care what others think. I liked it, although I agree with "London" is better and I also prefer this version. <br /> <br /> The first 30 to 40 minutes of this movie are played with a strict smile, including a hysterical scene with a balloon in the restaurant. Julie Delpy is also introduced to a female female. I don't see this actor enough. It looks like he's not doing a lot of movies or at least what I'm listening to here in America. This French actress is a face that is classic beauty, so the film got points for putting her in and she looks good. . I also liked the embarrassment of this film, unlike the first one: there are no f-words and no name of the Lord in vain - amazing! <br /> <br /> However, there are many sexual comments and there is one scene when the boy runs out of a cross that was pious to me. Soundtrack is a heavy metal that I also don't like for a middle-aged man like me. This movie is much more targeted at 20-somethings than it helps anyone. <br /> <br /> It's fun ..... just don't expect it to live on the first movie.
