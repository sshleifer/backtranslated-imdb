A funny show with so many great stories that it reflects the world today, as we know it, so funny that it literally stole my laughs at other exhibitions. I laughed so hard that I just found another comedy that shows it to be ununny. The unique admissions of each character are a great original technique that makes the show funny and very humorous. It is believed that this is an average comedy that shows the family a difficult life. That's what I first thought, but I learned that he has new and unique techniques that distinguish it completely from all other other comedy shows. Michael Rapaport is a star. I want this exhibition not canceled.
