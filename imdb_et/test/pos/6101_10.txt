*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Wow, which is a contradiction Joanna has discovered herself. After the accidental ride of a small child, he gets help to get back to the criminal site in the middle of the group with very angry spectators. Understandably, it is too much to handle, and he escapes from the scene. Fortunately, the child does not die but is seriously injured and coma. So Joanna's life's greatest struggle begins: should she be silent or talk? At first he does not, but in the end he understands that torture lives with such a terrible secret. <br /> <br /> At one point he even joins a search partner to help find the culprit. And gradually, the detective begins to question this woman's behavior. She wants to tell the truth and she never wanted to leave the crime scene, but is it worth saying and the whole city hates you for that? <br /> <br /> The thing about this movie is that you don't choose sides. Joanna is a very good example, although she has been wrong. You know him, though you know what he did was wrong. His journey is a good presentation of what every person would go through if something happened to them. <br /> <br /> Margaret Colin is an absolutely brilliant actress. He was an amazing TV series, Now and Again, and big in movies like Independence Day and Fucking. His presence here is so realistic and impossible that he will carry us all through the film. Finally, I wanted to see him more. Lisa Vidal also gave some good support as a delicate, inventive detective. <br /> <br /> To switch to seeing a movie that makes you think long afterwards, "It's a reality," you don't want to miss it. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 9/10
