Lucio Fulci's "Don't Torture Duck Bird" paints an extremely small town with the Sicilian afflicted portrait of a series of brutal murders among young boys. Almost dead children are depicted as randomly cruel and tortuous dancing, and Bruno's naked Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet) must be truly believed in the near future. Highly recommended - especially for a couple of "House with Windows" laughing (1976).
