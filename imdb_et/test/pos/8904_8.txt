... but I laughed. Much. <br /> <br /> I saw "Astérix et les Vikings" openly during the World Cup. The sound was weak, it was too bright to see the screen properly, but I still enjoyed myself. The names of some of the characters were in my roll: Smsix, Abba, Vikea ... Not a very witty but good Astérix tradition. Some very good jokes, but also some that everyone didn't see. <br /> <br /> The only thing I didn't like was the Astérix and Obélix voices at least in German. Voice attendants are very well known here, which was the only reason they really were. They don't fit at all in characters. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is a good opportunity to spend some time (and if it's free, as in my case, the better) and a couple laugh. 8 out of 10.
