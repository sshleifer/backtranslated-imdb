Niagra Niagra was definitely not the best movie I've ever seen. But I can't describe how I felt when I felt the film and how I felt like it was finished and how I feel it now. Very few films have such an effect on me. I like them or I don't. I look at Niagra Niagra as a work of art. We all see something in it and it can remind us of something or it can put fear or fun things, etc. This movie was not the best mood for me. In fact, it left me somehow empty. I think the life that these two people were driving was so empty. They had no direction. Their only direction was to direct. They had many problems to deal with, and I think I have to get away from what wouldn't have been a happy life. But how things really just worsened. Persistent decline from the beginning. It was sad because it worked so well and I think we've all probably seen someone who can somehow resemble the situation where they were. They could have been a good life if they had a clue how. But it is clear that they did not know what to do. So they were like Rambled to whom they had heard. There is no real goal. They had no idea how to achieve the goal. They had no idea how to overcome their life. I felt bad but couldn't watch the movie. Only good actors can make me feel so much of what I wouldn't want if someone played those parts. These two did a good job at the point you just didn't see. I am very impressed and want to buy a movie when it is available on DVD. You know. It felt a little like me leaving Los Angeles. But again it is in its class. Not a big movie, just right or worth an hour or two on the right day. If you are a person with problems, I would not recommend looking at it. It can suppress you. It depressed me and I don't have these conditions. JimmyJoeJetter
