I've never posted anything so far, but after viewing Noro, I felt I had to write down my thoughts on it. <br /> <br /> First, it doesn't compare to Blair Witch, this movie deserves it better! Simply put, Noroi is (probably) one of the best horror films I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot!). <br /> <br /> I liked the movie not being an ordinary horror, but as a documentary film about what the reporter (in my opinion?) called Kobayashi and his operator. Without much damage to the plot, I can say that it starts with Kobayashi, who is doing research on a number of seemingly independent events that turn out to be something darker and darker. <br /> <br /> The story may not be original, what really struck me with Noroi was an incredibly terrible atmosphere. If you are looking for cheap fears and seat-jumping scenes, this movie may not be for you. This film is about the mood it depicts, with the haunting images and the general feeling that the tensions are predicting. Filming a documentary style makes this farm more credible. <br /> <br /> This has also been helped by what's great, although it doesn't fit in the film's general part! Much better than most other movies of this type of genre. <br /> <br /> I'm very good when I like it, I recommend Norol to everyone, it's tight, horrible, well-behaved and the first movie that has frightened me in age.
