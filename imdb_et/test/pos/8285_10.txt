AWWWW, I just love this movie. I and my relatives enjoy this movie a lot and I'm just that big! I hope they will bring the TVs off the DVD soon. Come to mention it, I can't see TV shows for a long time. This time! Where I come from Australia Chipmunk Adventure is only known in the later years of teenagers and adults who are a little sad because young children don't know what's missing. <br /> <br /> The songs in this movie are Ace, those I love most rock n'roll, Diamond Dolls, and song, which I definitely want my mom to cry. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely both young and SEND CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE TODAY !!! Of 10 out of 10, this great movie.
