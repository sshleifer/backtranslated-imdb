This film would have worked much better if it was the first Critter movie, it was a low budget movie with only two (2) Criters. Why it looks like a failure is that it's the last Critter movie and it's so low a budget that it seems the director made the whole movie with his pocket money. But I liked this movie, I compare it mostly to the third film (which was bad). Critters 4 has a more serious tone in it, in the first half of the movie (despite one more Critter), you have a frightening feeling watching it, too bad that they're "not" out of Critters, I mean even if they only had two ( 2) a doll that they would have used much more on the screen. Critters also has various deaths in this movie that made it a little special, especially at the end of the frozen Critter. Ug is a promoter in this respect and it is different in this film that surprised me. Finally I liked it because it also has some kind of conclusion for the series, so at least we don't see Critter 5 any more. The last thing I missed in one of the scenes of this movie, we never see a Critter who would shoot behind him, maybe these dolls didn't have this feature, but I was very disappointed not to see it (in Critters 3 we see a lot of spikes) -flashing, which was the only good thing I liked about this movie.
