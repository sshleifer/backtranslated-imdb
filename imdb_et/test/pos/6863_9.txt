I was shocked at how good this German version is for films like Scream. Overcoming all the modern American aspirations in films. <br /> <br /> What not all these movies do. Probable characters, real mystery, intercourse, graphic murders and brilliant soundtrack. This stylish horror film is one of the best of its kind in years. The German cinema is getting strong recently. The shame the more people are going to see such movies because they are gone. It is easily accessible from the DVD, so even if you hate subtitles, you should see it. This is one of the best horror films you see all year round.
