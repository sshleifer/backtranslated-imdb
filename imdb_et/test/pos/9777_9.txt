I have heard some remarks, especially from prisoners of war, that CHANGI is not historically accurate and it is disappointing. Maybe it is for those who had to go through this thing, and much worse. But the rest of us who don't really know how prisoners were treated during World War II in Japan are a remarkable introduction to CHANGI. But CHANGI is not a documentary of war - if it had been, the historical aspect of accuracy would have been extremely important. It is a mini-series drama that has fictional characters and fictional situations (though loosely based on the actual events I've heard and read) - and at the heart of the story is the matehip ideal. This group of young Australian soldiers who were taken by Japanese prisoners and who had been dreadful for years, became reluctant and their friendships continued throughout their lives after the war. It is also a cultural study of the differences between time and the world of Japan, music, games and entertainment: Part 5, when it turns out that Japan is losing the war after Germany has given up Europe, the colonel of the Japanese prison camp emphasizes that his country must investigate its prisoners culture - in order to win the nation, its culture must be defeated - and it must be understood. All in all, Australia continues its tradition of producing a rich traditional television ministry and is a world leader in this field: CHANGI's AFI award is MY BROTHER JACK, the adaptation of George Johnston's novel and a worthy winner. Minorities in recent years include the Day of Roses (Glanville Train Accident Research Story), KINGS GRASS CASTLES (Adapting Mary Durack's Historical Presentation on Pioneering Ancestors), KANGAROO PALACE (About Friendship), a city in Australia, traveling to London and changing and growing out of each other ) and the adaptation of Bryce Courtenay's powerful novel, POTATO FACTORY (a little disappointing). Later: Nancy Cato's extensive saga of life Murray - ALL RIVERS RUN; Cusack's and James's brilliant novel from postwar life in Sydney - COME IN SPINNER; Colleen McCullough's outstanding pioneer - THORN BIRDS; RIVER KINGS; Ruth Park's novel THE HARP IN SOUTH; BODYLINE; EUREKA STOCKADE; ANZACS; etc ... etc etc. (Of course, there have been some not so good performances - such as MOBY DICK, DO OR DIE, BEACH, THORN BIRDS: MISSING years, etc.) Generally, however, when Australian mini-devices do, make sure you see it - and it goes to CHANGI, which is a superbly directed masterpiece, double. Rating: 9/10
