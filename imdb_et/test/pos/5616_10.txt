Although many of the recordings of great musicians such as Jascha Heifetz survive, cinematographic or television recordings are indeed limited. This is why the musical offer like "They hold music" is such rare gems. Although the plot can be torn in the eyes and ears of today, the mindful viewer should put the unique joy of this film in its right perspective. The purpose of the plot was to turn to the young and the old age, but it is enjoyable to this day. An important aspect of watching classic movies is to see them in the eyes of the moviego of this era. <br /> <br /> I have to challenge a reviewer who complains about a black-and-white film or who is obliged to declare their students expressing such reservations. These are juvenile complaints that reflect a limited historical perspective. For the teacher, this should provide an educational opportunity to explain the unique features of black and white photography and its location in cinematography. Color can actually get a good story or music. For example, John Ford's "Stagecoach" black and white photography is like artistic masterpieces in Ansel Adams' photographs. <br /> <br /> When Heifetz was wood, I could no longer accept. If you want a blatant emotional attitude, go to a rock concert. The role of a classical musician, such as Heifetz, is the movement of the audience, not his own. Heifetz's emotions are transmitted through his playing, not through his body language. He had the rare ability to take out and transfer any musical emotional nuance to his listeners. The listener should move, not the artist. By the way, one reviewer asked how to see Heifetz on YouTube playing the first movement of the Tchaikovsky violin concert with the audience Frank McHugh. It comes from the 1947 film "Carnegie Hall", not "They Have Music", "Carnegie Hall" is an even greater treasure of many great classical artists at their head. We are blessed to have filmmakers who, at least in these limited cases, chose these artists. There was still an era that was not completely overestimated by the lowest common denominator we get today.
