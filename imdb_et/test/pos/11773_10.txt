It's my favorite movie all the time. It's never the best scam for a fantastic movie; the fact that it was sending Star Wars did just that. <br /> <br /> I love slapstick. Think of it when Marx brothers or three Stooges meet Star Wars. Writing is fun. Impacts are hoot. The free association, which continues, provides all sorts of things that go out of the left. (I almost mark my pants when the Wookie Monster rose to the princess.) <br /> <br /> Space Balls was a much longer movie, but it only had about 15 minutes of good material, and I felt like it was hanging later, buy a burger, which turned out to be mostly filler. Hardware wars, even though they are only about 15 minutes long, would be charged to the IMO price.
