"The Dresser" is probably the clearest backdrop. The film is witty and spiritual, mostly of the "energetic" nature of Norman (Tom Courtenay). Although his character is clearly gay and it is definitely the leading performer (Albert Finney) whom he is helping, the film never lives on it or does more than it does. <br /> <br /> Peter Yates, who worked so well with Bullitt, is once again featured and gives the film realism and coherence. It is rated as a lot of story that has so easily become annoying. In the end, "The Dresser" carried a lot of people into stupidity, but it's really a pleasure for those who love British cinema. <br /> <br /> 7.7 out of 10
