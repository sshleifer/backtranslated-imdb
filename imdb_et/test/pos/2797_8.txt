As a European, the film is a nice setback for my academic life in the 1980s and the experience I lived abroad and interacted with other nations, although the circumstances were slightly different. Klapisch (director) went to the New York Film School from 1982 to 1985, so he thinks he is using this experience. <br /> <br /> It is interesting how the film balances the message that "there should be no generalization" with the notion that "there is a basis for any stereotype." For example, the Italian character is based on the pothead aspect rather than on any known Italian stereotype. The German character is still characterized by some tried and tested stereotypes, but the most stereotypical aspect of the film is not nature, but the central theme of infidelity, as the critic observes, infidelity for the French film is as important as the class is for British film. be unintentional, but some citizens have elements that could be considered a metaphor for their role in the EU. The British woman has an American (who is an entertainer like the US president of 1980), while a Frenchman shows herself as a natural leader (when the landlord appears). br /> <br /> Although Europe is not as diverse as New York, it is striking that we only see two non-white characters. a Chilean woman with peoples qualities, who, despite the appearance of our main character, is not seen as a potential interest. The other is a gambia-spanish or rather a gambia-catalan man who seems a bit invented. <br /> <br /> One might wonder why Klapisch chose the protagonists, who were all Western European long-term members. Although these nations reflect what we see as students in the 1980s, I believe that today's European exchange programs are much more diverse. The Erasmus program covers some 30 countries from Iceland to Eastern Europe, many of which are not members of the EU. I understand, however, that the choice of the most sensitive nationalities may be necessary in order not to deviate from the contrast Klapisch wants to create between the peoples of Europe and the bureaucratic Europe. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that minors have a big movie, they made me live in Europe. My French friend, who also left the United States in the US, hit our common feelings in this contradiction "If Europe were more of a US, I'd leave it to the heartbeat".
