although i liked it west, i have to say that this is not my favorite john ford westerns.for me, he just doesn't have what most of his other movies (the ones i've seen anyway) sure that nothing is, there is nothing tangible. The story is also the most important train of the Mormon wagon used by the band of the illegal band as a hero. There are some interesting characters, some nice scenery, a bit of action and excitement.it all adds a attentive experience. Surely it is not boring. not quite standard for John Ford. 7/10
