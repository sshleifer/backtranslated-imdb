This is one of the most outstanding horror films I've seen in my lifetime. Forget about the exorcist and all the other hype horror movies out there. The biggest thing about this movie after 17 years is that it is not dated, it looks fresh and new and you don't get many movies like this. Back in 1982 it was E.T. and of course it failed and was a box. Over the years, it's like a video and a vv of selling and so many new fans. Ultimately, this film captures the ass and me that it has never disappeared because it is a fear to scare you and me to be a horror movie. Long Live John Carpenter !!
