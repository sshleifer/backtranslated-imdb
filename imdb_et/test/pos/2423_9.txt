*** SPOILERS *** Feeling alone and needing companionship and love with Frances Austen, Sandy Dennis keeps all these emotions inside when she goes through life as a popular young single lady with many high-class friends. But because of his own deep uncertainty, he keeps them in the length of the weapons. As for Frances's male friends who are not close to her age, she has no reason to engage in romance. <br /> <br /> One early night when Frances amused some of his friends, he went outside his apartment building, the young man Michael Burns, who sat alone in cold weather. Feeling he's homeless and alone after leaving his friends, Frances goes out to the park and offers young men a shelter until the rain gets off and even stay at the guest house he has. You see immediately that Frances is more interested in the fact that the young men are cold and the rain safely forced, then he wants to be a lover of a friend or even play the toy himself and when the movie progresses, you see that they were right. <br /> <br /> A really amazing performance by Sandy Dennis, which is very similar to the Kathy Bates Academy Award in Misery, which was made in 1990 about twenty-one years later. Frances thought that the young man was alone and homeless, and later, when he meets him, he quietly sees that he has the right person to have a real friend. He is by no means his equal or better than his friends, medical lawyers of Indian chiefs and thus he is totally dependent on him. Later it turns out that the young man is not a lonely and homeless person whom Frances thought he was. This is when he slowly discovers that he does not need him as well as manipulating him, instead of turning something else out of Frances, which proves to be the proportions of murderers. <br /> <br /> A really weird movie directed by Robert Altman who goes deep into the depths of loneliness and human mind depression. Actress Sandy Dennis is the perfect Dr. Jekyll and Miss. Hyde's personality in her loneliness, but at the same time in dangerous Frances Austen, and it is a pity that not only did she not receive the Academy Award for the prize, but it was not even mentioned. <br /> <br /> Like most of Robert Altman's films, there are many improvisations among film and advertising dialogue participants, especially between the young man's sister Nina, Susanne Benton, and her boyfriend Nick David Garfield. The only thing I found confused about the film is when we see that Frances goes to the city clinic to get a full gynecological exam and tells the doctor that she hopes to get married very quickly. Was his wife a young man staying in his apartment? But besides this, the story of the film sticks quite well and the end is a real shock to both the audience and the young people. Finally, he finally understands that Frances is not only a bit off-the-wall, but also bitterly crazy.
