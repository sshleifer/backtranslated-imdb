The Ali G sign works great in comedy performance, but it doesn't work the same way as a movie. <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong - this is a very funny movie full of biting, clever dialogue that carries the modern British chavy perfectly, providing the viewer fun as an unrealistic story. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that the script and content are either fantastically brilliant, or it is embarrassing to look. When I say embarrassment, I don't mean that it would be a funny embarrassing office or attachment, but rather you wouldn't want it to be included in the final paragraph. One example of this is adding a music video after the end of the movie, "This is how we do it". When I watch the movie, I stop the DVD when it says the end and leave it there. <br /> <br /> Generally, Ali G Indahouse is a good movie that you should watch several times. The script is somewhat enjoyable, and there are no operational issues. However, the correction is the key word here. <br /> <br /> Ali G is a better TV show. Borat is a better film.
