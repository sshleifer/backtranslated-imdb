I just get a chance to complain about Austen's movie in the past and I picked it up because of persuasion, has been, and is always my favorite work, Jane Austen and Anne Elliot, my favorite Austen heroine. So it was, as expected, that I put a disc on my player. <br /> <br /> I wasn't disappointed either. I knew there were certainly some setbacks, so I'll tell them and try to be too thick for them. Anne Elliot is the most introverted of Austen stars; he is the least talkative and the least witty. There are sections in the book where Anne says nothing - only her feelings are described. Does it work well when printing, but how can it be successfully delivered to a large screen? There is no thoughtful voice transmission (which will grow annoying within four hours), you have a long consecutive picture where the heroine says little or no, and has to communicate only through your facial expression. This may leave a feeling that the film is slow and absent. If you need Austen's clearer style, this is definitely not the movie for you; but if you are more modest in your style, and you tend to say no to the vibe, it meets all expectations. <br /> <br /> Anne Firbank (like Anne Elliot) is fortunately an actor whose face can be passed on. She looked like I had always imagined that Anne Elliot would look like: no collision - Anne should not have been an elegant or the first youth of the family, which is occasionally highlighted by lighting and make-up. What you see is someone who is very similar to Austen's character: someone whose appearance can go over once; but listen to him talk and look closer and he will grow more attractive, the better you know him. This is Anne Elliot, as Anne Firbanki brought. <br /> <br /> Captain Wentworth's depiction is led by Bryan Marshall. Bitterness is obviously not obvious (except at the concert); And yes, I found it hard to believe that he saw Louisa Musgrove interesting when she was shown. But this is another point in Austen's book: he didn't find him interesting, he wanted to find him interesting and eventually failed (a victim of relief). So it also fits into Austen's original story. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the portrayal of Lady Russell whom I thought was not depicted in TRULY halban; this is also evident in this adaptation. <br /> <br /> So this is one movie that closely followed the book; I could write a lot more about how faithfully everything was played back, but I get out of here. Charles Musgrove stayed one of the busiest (fun), Mary's most annoying (I died to just shut it down - but I felt like I was reading the book), the captains and the admiral I thought was charming <br /> > Cinematography I thought was a bit stiff. It didn't disappear from the screen or it was almost gone - maybe it's because it's a TV movie. One scene - CHOP! - Next scene, participants enter right, move left and - CHOP! - Another scene where the same thing happens. It was the only part of the film I felt a little cheated. The low budget must show itself somewhere as I think. <br /> <br /> And as I said before, if you like to go with Jane Austen, don't worry about it because it's too slow. I enjoyed it enormously because it brought lots of details (the sets were richly elegant!) To perfectly adapt my favorite Austen novel. I highly recommend it!
