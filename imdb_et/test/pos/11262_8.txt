as a high school student, I have to take a health class. this year is the topic of drugs. we learn about the damage they can cause to a person. Of what we are talking about, I still believe and know that drugs can really confuse a person. anyway, my teacher wanted us to look at it. of course we silence and start to sleep, but like my rest of the class, I enjoyed this movie. it was completely real and not at all covered with sugar. the characters were amazing and plausible. even the plot was exceptionally realistic and credible. What I liked about this movie was mainly how it affects a drug abuser, and the consequences a person has to deal with. everyone confirms to themselves that nothing will happen to them. Well lets get serious. In a small town, something can happen, even to your best friend, like Sam and Chris. this movie shows it. a person can really learn a lot about it. it was quite effective.
