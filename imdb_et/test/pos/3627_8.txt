In the "Old Dark House", the sub-genre, which dominated the talks early, is rarely disappointed when we look at the old day. Here is one that offers so many suspicious symbols that you need to think about how they can tie any loose ends in a 6-reel working time. <br /> <br /> Crooked Circle is a counterfeiter and thief who has decided to get to Colonel Walters (Berton Churchill), who has sent one of his rank to prison. They decide he must die this night. Meanwhile, the Colonel's own group, the Sphinx Club, is sure to protect him at all costs. It does not fit well with the brother of Brand Osborne (Ben Lyon, late mega-budget HELL'S ANGELS (1930)) member of Thelma (Irene Purcell) who wants to give up his club and endanger his life. Brand promises to give up after saving Colonel's life. Everyone manages Walter's newly purchased manor house in Long Island to wait for an assassin. <br /> <br /> The Colonel may be the new owner of the Melody Manor, but it is an old dark house with eccentric neighbors (like Raymond Hatton as a local hermit) and perhaps even a ghost. Top Bill Zasu Pitts is Nora, a housekeeper who hopes to see around every corner. Throw the police (James Gleason) who is sure Brand is a criminal and we have a picture full of activities and surprises. <br /> <br /> You will immediately notice that the script writer has lost too much dialogue because many characters repeat the same lines over and over again. Yoganda (C. Henry Gordon) is a Hindu mystic (from which time films were) says, "The evil is on the way." many times and i lost the count on how often Ms. Pitts says, "Something always happens to someone!" There are many suspects and two characters (Mr Gleason as a stereotype for a foolish policeman and Roscoe Karns as Mr Lyon's palm) who earn comedy relief. The house itself is suitably a spooky look (in fact, I think the same set was used in PHANTOM (1931)), which has a lot of secret passage and violin music that has come out of empty rooms, but in no way can you endanger it. Perhaps it is because someone in the movie and I don't want anyone! Ultimately it all comes out; but to find out more details, it would be a serious breach of Robert Frazer (WHITE ZOMBIE) and Frank Reicher (best remembered as Captain Engelhorn KING KONG). suspects. <br /> <br /> FROZEN RING is a fun movie. Some aspects of the plot are predictable and then many others. I suspect you enjoy it.
