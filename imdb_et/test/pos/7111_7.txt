One year after the central release of the "Frankenstein House", Universal released another Monster Mashi, where all their famous characters come into contact again. The "Drakula House" would combine Dracula, the Frankenstein creature and Wolf Man, which would be their last battle and eventually close the studio era. "Drakula House" led by Erle C. Kenton has slightly, but noticeably improved over the previous film, and offers a better-structured (albeit still flawed) story that is far from perfect, more suitable for closing than in the previous film <br /> <br /> The story ignores most of the events of the previous "Frankenstein House" and introduce the story from a new angle. Count Dracula (John Carradine), who is tired of hiding in the sun, asks for help from a brilliant scientist, Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens), a doctor who is well-known for his biology research. Edelman is fascinated by Dracula, and soon begins experimental treatment, while Wolfs Man Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.) visits Edelman with the aim of getting rid of his rage. Soon, Edelman understands that Dracula is a monster to be destroyed, but his own exposure to Dracula's blood also causes his illness. The discovery of the Franken monster (Glenn Strange) in the nearby catacombs brings more confusion to the mind of a brilliant scientist. <br /> <br /> After the previous clash of monsters, it is good to see that the series goes back to the roots and the almost straightforward Gothic horror that returns to the pessimistic pessimistic nature of such a film and away from the comical relief of earlier records. Story (Edward T. Lowe Jr.) Has many interesting topics, such as contrast between Dracula and Talbot (both looking for treatment, but for different purposes) and Edelman's growing madness. Probably the most interesting topics are the character of Nina, the gorgeous but deformed woman who helps Dr. Edelman hope to cure his condition. <br /> <br /> Director Erle C. Kenton is back again and this time she will finally capture the darkness of the three characters that have probably disappeared in the previous movie. Despite the low budget, Kenton is dealing with a Gothic horror, which is simple, but quite effective, and even succeeds in retrieving such characters from the old partners. Although it is never at the original level, "House of Dracula" restores the magic that was previously used by Universal Studios horror films, and Kenton ensures that at least the last time monsters can shine. <br /> Very good cast this time, Carradine, Chaney and Strange repeat their roles (though Strange's role is much smaller) with enthusiasm than the previous film. Adding Onslow Stevens, Jane Adams, and Martha O'Driscoll to the pain brings a tragedy and drama that Stevens gave terrible work to dr. Edelmani. Lionel Atwill's small comer and the presence of Skelton Knaggs as a horrible Steinmuhl are one of the better cast of the Universal Horror films for years. <br /> <br /> "House of Dracula" is a great addition to the series, especially after the medieval "Frankenstein House". It's nice to see Kenton back in the form of a somewhat serious horror film, and while the plot is quite original, it suffers not only because of the budget, but because the film is trying to get a lot of bad results in a very short time. It is true that the characters have all the very inventive stories, but the film devotes very little time to each of them, and the film seems very rushed and loose. far from the series worst. "House of Dracula" is a nice closure to one of the best times in the genre of horror, when spirits and ghouls looked at the foggy nights, and mad scientists gave life to the outrageous monsters. Later, monsters would be back to "Bud Abbott & Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948), but that would be a completely different context. After disappointing past entries, it is easy to trigger the "Drakula House", but give him the chance and let the monster go for the last time. 7/10
