Many people say there was no point at the end, but he did it. The fissures of the female vampire burst into the earth, and the ship went away, with hundreds of thousands of souls going through a lot of vitality. It is enough for these hexagonal cells to re-energize and create new bat beings. They seem to have no flesh sex like legend vampires. <br /> <br /> The vampire bats in the outdoor space may be ridiculous, but killing them with the qui-power centers below the heartbeat is consistent. All you can ask is consistency. The viewer must stop belief even in sci-fi. <br /> <br /> The only problem is sword or bet, not bullets. This puts a supernatural twist that is not compatible with sci-fi. So this is a problem. <br /> <br /> The only big contradiction I have found is the killing of male vampires with a sword, but the soul of the girl and Carlsen is on the ship. I assume that the male souls went up the ship, but didn't show it. <br /> <br /> What are all the people killed? Do their qui ("souls") go to the ship as separate units, do all the vitality become one for use in the ship? In other words, all human souls who went to the ship could bats around the body. <br /> <br /> The basic concept is no longer ridiculous than Star Wars "Force" or even re-incarnation. <br /> <br /> This movie was up on the kitchen sink (Dawn of the Dead meets an alien meeting with Dracula), but in many ways. It was also a beautiful love story. The beginning and the end were essential. Both started ("what's happening to me") and ended the story of love. <br /> <br /> Most of the film's criticism is that it is odd. Bizarre is an art form. What's ridiculous, it's all right. The break concept is much more interesting and subtle than foreigners who just kill people. Maybe they didn't need the blood of Patrick Steward to make a girl, but it was a very distant, surreal, scene. Another reason why the film is hated is because it is over. But the end is perfect for the beginning. People are so naked in the girl that they are missing from the core of the film. His love story, from start to finish. It starts with Carlsen and the girl with the alien spaceship and ended in the same way. So it fits perfectly. Most people are fixed in a hero who kills a monster, and this movie doesn't end in that way, so I love it. Instead, it is a happy ending, with two of them going back to the ship to restore. The Way heroer as a hero kills the end of the monster, but that's why it was bombarded. It was not a general horror or even a sci-fi / horror, but a love story that had a beautiful start and end. All those souls who look on the ship. And the crystal space pulsed a new life. <br /> <br /> Most people can't do a love story that is alien.
