Jay Craven's critically ignored film is the tranquil breathing of fresh air in an independent film generally in the narcissistic and derivative world. First of all, photography is a pure aesthetic joy, capturing the profound beauty of all of Northern England in the late autumn (operator Paul Ryan made the 2nd unit at Malick's Heavenly Days). Secondly, the performances are equally excellent - Rip Torni Noel Lourdes is terribly charming and Tantoo's Cardinal Bangor is immediately sensitive and overflowing, saying something about the pain-supporting pains. All in all, it is a tribute to the narrative strength of the film that the story retains a strong and lively pace, while it continues to evolve over time, and the film reaches a natural and true conclusion that, however, does not seem to be expected. It is one of the rare cells of human dignity in the independent film world, a film that explores a small part of the intersection of people and history.
