Elegant Documentary - <br /> <br /> Don't look at this movie ... if you're an egoistic physics student. This much less than one percent (minimum) of the population may find that this exhibition tells them what they have already learned and already knew. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie! - If you are one of the largest people who belong to more than 99% of the population who do not study or already have good physics, including relativity, quantum, string and M theory. br /> <br /> What a great architectural documentary. Starting with some useful historical backgrounds, you have the lead with an elegant step into the universe and dimensions of pure magic. I've always appreciated math. This movie can easily give you an insight into what beautifully beautiful language math does not make you feel that you are starting to fail. <br /> <br /> The show is repetitive when the original format was a mini-series divided between three exhibitions. Therefore, it makes sense to give us polite small reminders of the principles presented. I found it to be immensely helpful because it reminded me of many questions and possible answers that make up this astonishing tapestry of our existence. <br /> <br /> We are all (and all around us) vibrating energy in the natural harmony. This film can blow your mind - or at least help you realize that the universe is much larger than what we see around us (even with the Hubble telescope) and much less than the protons and neutrons in the atoms we learned in High School. M-theory has many great sizes of "opportunities". <br /> <br /> It just seemed so appropriate that all of this elegance should move by nature (the reception of many great scientists) that is not part of the world of Science and Philosophy. <br /> <br /> You don't have to be religious at all to feel that this movie brings you one step closer to God. <br /> <br /> Bravo Brian Greene. Well done. <br /> <br /> P.S. If you are interested to feel more comfortable and at home in your universe and would like some more information on "opportunities", you can bring quantum mechanics mixed with spirituality (all things), and I suggest you also look at "What Bleep! August down ". Yes, I know they make some foolish mistakes, suggesting that shaman may not be able to see the boat if it hasn't seen it before (my eyes work just fine reflections of light - I see things every day I've never seen) brain cells there are cells in the body that really do not share. But if you can overcome these little obstacles and put things you don't like and hang on to the ones you do - it's a lot of fun about this movie. <br /> <br /> Then look for "Secret" (2006 documentary about the Right of Attraction - search IMDb title "tt0846789"). This information can change your life thoroughly - forever. If you are looking deeper, you may even find that the Universe is telling us about thinking (when you listen) - and some are - and that is truly incredible. Nowadays Jesus / Mohammad / Buddha lives (those who, among other things, show that history is communicating with non-physical) and lives in Texas. I know some of you know what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> I don't believe myself in any traditional definition, but I've never felt comfortable at home or in the universe as it is today.
