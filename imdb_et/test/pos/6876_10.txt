if i know walter never loves another set. I was in my 30s when I first saw this sweet, loving and unabashedly romantic movie. I loved it from the first scene and to the end. Art Carney was his usual self; Glenda matched Walter's step to witticism, and Richard Benjamin gave the voice of a sarcastic reason he does so well. There were many actors we all know by doing our usual shine. There are a couple of lines that my SO and I have used over the years, but I'm not talking about them here. I'm pretty sure you know what I'm talking about. Just get this movie. Make some popcorn, grab your squeeze (if she's as cute as me is, for which I'm grateful) and enjoy this standout romantic comedy from the 70's. You don't have to be disappointed. But I have the feeling that I preach to the choir here, because anyone who loves Walter already has it. I'm very glad it is now on DVD, finally.
