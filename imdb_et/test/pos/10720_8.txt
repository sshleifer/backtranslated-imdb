It comes from its inner relationship when it tries to understand and live with what is going on; his relationship with Meryl Streep (and his friend who gets his friend) and his relationship with his son. <br /> <br /> While Meryl Streep was great, did he set the least time for the Oscar to win? He's sure he'll be even when he's.
