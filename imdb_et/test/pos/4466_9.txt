I will fiercely hear the reputation of Lucio Fulci's director. Too often, he is classified as a non-talented filmmaker, just to shock and bother the entire audience with pure Gore images. True, his films contain more of an environment of American production, but his films are always wide-ranging and the plots are very bad. Don't Torture Duckling is another story! This film is a pure pearl of Italian shock cinema! I just dare to call this movie a masterpiece? It is an old-fashioned giallo that contains all the great aspects of a real horror. The film shows the search for an inhuman series of murderers in small Italian mountain areas. There are 3 young men's bodies that are terribly damaged. There are quite a few pseudo-crazy in the city, but every path leads somewhere. Among the suspects is the greedy dust and the scary woman, who is attached to witchcraft and voodoo. Like a real mastermind, Fulci knows the right horrible tone for his film. It depicts a small town as a claustrophobic and inevitable macabre event device supported by an amazing soundtrack. Fulci also develops genius as a storyteller. The script is always one step ahead of you and a complex plot will mislead you more than once. In other words, it is a unique giallo (horror slash murder mystery). Gore is not presented as grotesque and explicit, as in Lucio's later milestones (including the legendary Zombie 2, The Beyond, and New York Ripper), although there are still a few nausea and hard-to-track strokes. . <br /> <br /> The Torture Duckling is the most convincing and effective achievement ever made by Lucio Fulci and is one of the biggest horrorfacts ever made in Italy. Mario Bava and Dario Argento masterpieces. The film is exciting from start to finish, some aspects of the plot are alarmingly realistic and tensions are always rushing to adrenaline! Must see the horror fans and the absolute priority to Italian shock lovers!
