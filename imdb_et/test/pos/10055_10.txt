I have to evaluate this movie 10. I'm sorry, but I think it's a classic comedy. when you rate it for other Madonna movies ... well, what? Do you want to say it's never his best movie ever? Mira Sorvino won the Oscar for almost the same result, not ten years later? please, this movie deserves much more credit than it can. plus, I like to think of it as an A + sociological study of the 80s lifestyle. remember if you could buy Sam Goody and Cartier the same day? Remember when women wore proudly wrinkled eyebrows? so it wasn't the "last emperor", it was still good. there are certain movies that I would be willing to watch every day. three, in fact, that sleep my day and make me smile. if you like "Who is this girl?" I would also recommend "Party Girl" and "Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion".
