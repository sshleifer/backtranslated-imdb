I liked MUPPET MOVIE very much. It was the first Muppet film and it is best because it is both creative and fresh. Later in the case of films, the idea did not seem so original. But here we see Kermit and Miss Piggyi riding bikes (incredibly heavy scene), a great ensemble cast and just fun. I loved every minute Muppets performed and I would have appreciated the movie much higher, except one serious problem. In this and the latest Muppet films, there were some abilities that you felt needed to add a lot of non-cups, especially the many stars marked by the stars. Some worked well (like Charles Durning), but many just seemed insignificant and slowed down until the grinding stopped. Probably the worst was Edgar Bergan. Yes, he was an amazing man who inspired Jim Henson and the rest of his team, but the tiny scene he just didn't like was needed and most came. Despite this great complaint, this is a great movie for the whole family - from children to the most demanding adults.
