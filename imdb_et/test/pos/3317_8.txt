Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) just kills the time of getting a job. His real goal is to marry Eddie and become a child. April (Diane Baker) is too innocent to stay so long and fall in love too easily, a dangerous combination. <br /> <br /> Greg (Suzy Parker) is a go-getter and wants to be an actor. <br /> <br /> All three are doomed to "The Best of Everything," the 1959 Soap Opera / Moral Game / Sometimes a Solid Movie Aging by the Other. <br /> <br /> Curved with a notorious world that is not as tricky as the "Valley of the Dolls", but not as vanilla as the "Three Coin Fountain". <br /> <br /> The men in the man mixed - Brian Aherne, Stephen Boyd, Louis Jourdan and Robert Evans - are mostly slippery, well dressed and good. Aherne is a resident sex offender - sees something walking and making unwanted progress right and left. His character is offensive than hell, but it hasn't been seriously played at all. I don't think harassment was detected yet. Boyd works there too, though you don't really see him. He's too busy, older, wiser and drunk. Evans is abroad, so Diane Baker can suffer from style - he is a rich boy who has been "in trouble" so that instead of marrying him as he promised, he takes him for "surgery". <br /> <br /> Jourdan is the director who made a mistake with Parker. Such a film has a film that is quite abandoned, but the scene has finally destroyed the Parker histronics. He can almost trace him, and he really does not deserve such a terrible destiny, despite being bad. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford breathes fire as Amanda Farrow, a resident who is automatically rude and any legion of his secretaries. Well, they're younger, aren't they? Isn't that a good reason to hate a person? Caroline does not think as she admires Miss Farrow at every opportunity. Crawford can only be released once, when he tells his married boy that "you can both go to a hell with a woman standing with your rabbit" and hit the phone. You never see a poor soul who dares to baptize him. <br /> <br /> Martha Hyer's 'storyline' is very weak, and she's a painful mother. Wearing a white "W" ("whore") on his sweater goes like a pathetic confusion on most of his screen time. Worse still, it is not a courtesy that it is all "in one way or another". It doesn't matter so much, but still .. <br /> <br /> It is painfully obvious that it all happened in a completely different world. People were more beautiful to each other, and mostly the work was not dragging, but something exciting for a girl outside NYC. <br /> <br /> One unbelievable state of intoxication aside, Hope Lange helps her to feel really real. Caroline, who has at least one side in nature. <br /> <br /> I admire that women see their opinion, opportunity and choice. Not that it is not a nice bow, but it does some points for equality. In 1959, it was probably remarkable and perhaps controversial. 7/10
