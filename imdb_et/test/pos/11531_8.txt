I caught this late, late Mexican cable and I have to talk about it. The title was translated "Secretos" (Secrets). Well there's a secret that is an important part of the movie, but come on! We're not stupid. We know that there is a novel behind it. <br /> <br /> In any case, this movie is quite interesting and it is carried by a solid, ramanic performance. Always beautiful and stunning, Jordana Brewster and Christopher Eccleston give great performances and have such great chemistry. Cameron Daza is also good, although he has a minimum display time. Blythe Danner is perfect and the last appearance in the film touches sad. Great performances. <br /> <br /> Jordan's character and his sister's former boyfriend travel to Europe so he can cope with his demons and understand why his sister died. Through the returns, we learn the sad truth and we cannot help but feel sorry for the whole family. The end is really mobile. So it is nudity, but it is minimal. In fact, sex scenes are artistic and are not going to be steamy or sexy. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I watched it in the charming and beautiful Joranda Brewster screen. And I finished the story and dramatic presentations. <br /> <br /> Give this movie a try if you like solid dramatic qualities. Great movie. The last one, the last scene was very sad. Two little sisters through setbacks.
