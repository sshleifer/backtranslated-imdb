It is certainly an experience and a common experience. Using color is exciting and sometimes frustrating. Much of what is happening on the screen is incredibly difficult to do. Your view is hidden by a sudden, strange change in color and tone, signs and random cuts. Sound is very haunting and welcome. It really helps the nihilistic and hopeless tone that captures this movie. <br /> <br /> As far as what is born, the theory of "environmental rape and rebirth" is quite accurate to me. But I would not spend much time focusing on meaning, it is practically insignificant. It is clear that the director did not want to explain anything. He just presents it as it is, and if you want to look for a sense that is up to you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Surely, walking in the park is not a walk in the park, but I was fascinated by the discovery. It's really like a man's worst nightmare. What we see is sometimes worrying and very unpleasant, but there is surreal dream. If you're an art theme / experimental fan and you haven't seen Begotten yet, make it a priority. I doubt you will ever forget it. I know I won't.
