"Chips" is a great mix of music, light comedy and drama, and Peter O 'Toole's perfect presentation and Petula Clark's powerful romantic supportive performance. O 'Toole is able to show a shy, disinterested teacher who wants to love her students so much and can only express her love when she married Katherine (Clark). He brings him to the world "What a lot of flowers" and he has changed forever. He becomes a tragedy tragedy to Brookfield's beloved leader, but he knows that he would have achieved his goal only through Katherine's love. Songs (except the number of the music hall) are all "thought-songs" that come from character emotions and thoughts, and the more they listen, the more beautiful they become - "Walk through the world" and "You and I". The best moment for O'Toole is the last speech he gives to the students (this was the reason for the Oscar nomination). As a teacher, we question what the "book" is ever learning - but as Chips says, we taught them how to behave with each other and it really counts. Beautifully filmed, perfectly organized John Williams and one of the most mobile movies about love and how it can change you. "Did I fill the world with love?" boys sing their school song. Finally Chips understands that he can do this, but only the reason Catherine was there.
