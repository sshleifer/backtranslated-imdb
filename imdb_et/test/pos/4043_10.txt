Enchanting. The best time to see this movie is sometimes unhappy or sad. It's all so cute, everyone, even with the white bear loving the queen's secret and finally getting her, and Gerda and Kai got two young actresses. It is also music is very nice. Both of us are always combined with sad piano tones in some places that give a very touching result, and if either of them looks at one time, he sees a snow queen not so bad. He tries to love himself wrong. Evening this movie was here (first part) I only looked at it because I was bored, but I loved it much later and was very angry when they didn't show the next part because of the Pope's funeral. Yes, it was terribly sad for me. But when they said it was next week, I was so happy that I saved it and now I'm happy to do it.
