My friend sent me to this movie. I had never heard of it, but I thought it was Christopher Lampbert, so I rented it and came to know that it wasn't Christopher Lampbert, it was Thomas Jane who was this movie. I love the fact that almost all the film is in this suburban house. The characters were all great, and the script was amazing. I really want Skip Woods to write and direct another movie. In my book Thursday is a flawless story about a man who tries to make a woman's and a child's thing a shadowy past, but then his old friend of drug dealer shows up and it gets quite Thursday. This is one of my favorite films and it shows some real potential at Thomas Jane. But this movie is very rare, but I've found this couple of Hollywood videos on VHS. So dust off the old VCR and pop on Thursday as it gets Pee Wee approval
