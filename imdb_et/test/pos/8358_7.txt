Aslan Adam or Lionman, as it is more known to an English-speaking audience, starts with epic battles when King Solomon and his army lose their boys, although I'm not sure who they were and the film itself is not too helpful in identifying the fact. Anyway, when King Solomon has killed all these boys Princess Maria, Bishop Osorio & Commander Antoine is forced to sign a contract that will allow King Solomon to lead almost everything in sight. Soon after Princess Maria attracts Solomon and they have sex, the shortest wedding ceremony ever (only two sentences long) Antoine assists Princess Maria and plans to get Solomon rebellious and enjoy a sweet revenge. Antoine and her guards attack and kill Solomon, although her pregnant wife, Princess Almunia, escapes with her defender Rostin with Antoine guards after the shortest working time (less than 5 minutes or the time it takes around the bush) Princess Almunia gives birth to a young boy who is Antoine ' i hidden from the guards. Unfortunately, when Rostin tries to restore a little boy, he finds that the child has adopted his own Lion's pride! A year later & the evil Antoine now rules treating the mercy of their subjects, Princess Maria has given birth and she is a son, but Rostin is still hitting around trying to bring the insurgents down to Antoine to overthrow, the task seems hopeless when they can use the legendary Lionman help who is more beast as a man ... <br /> <br /> This Turkish Greek co-production was directed by Natuk Baytan as Natuch Baitan and is a kind of film, I found it fun badly, but at the same time very interesting. The script never seems to be taken seriously, it is an occasionally funny movie, it moves along the rocket and is never boring or boring, and some English-language dialogues are just funny in the context that happens on the screen. None of this makes any sense, we get the boys raised by Lion, the evil king, the generation, the family of the blind, the birthmarks, which make up the shape of Lion as an element of the story that was before raising Lion, mad. fighting scenes, torture scenes where posts people should be tied to wobble, ancient castle interiors that randomly contain zip wires and gymnastic rings, idiotic bad guys who all seem to have extensive facial hair and a central character who has jaw-like house-brick, can be doubled, the hands are covered with acid (this sour can eat through steel seams, but it is kept in a ceramic spoon!) and lowered to the concrete floor by over 20 feet, but still does not hurt! Aslan Adam is a terrible entertaining movie, I don't think I've seen a similar movie that I could compare if you are looking for something serious, forget it, but if you like "so bad they are - good movies and want to have fun, laugh and be entertaining, then Aslan Adam should be on the top of your list. A total of 100% gold for bad movie fans and those who are seasoned for different and curvy. On the disappointing side, Lionman gets his steel nails only 10 minutes before the end, which is a disgrace. <br /> <br /> Director Bayten keeps things moving fast, though not well done. One moment the boys fight on the sand dune next to their grassland, where the trees are in the background! There is one point where Lionman uses "branching" on a semi-spar, but this is probably just a long tube surrounded by a vine! Then there is a situation where the bleeding bleeding pack should be behind Lionman, but the dogs used are clearly different breeds, including some of the most harmless looking dogs! In Aslan Adam there are so many single scenes that are just fun, stupid, bizarre, or all three that I have ever been able to go on forever. Just check the end when Lionman jumps and flies everywhere he can fly. There is a lot of blood in Aslan Adam, though not a lot of actual graphic color or violence, some nuances, and someone has their hands cut off as graphic as it gets. <br /> <br /> Technically Aslan Adam is a pretty rope, period costumes are light and white with purple, yellow, red and different light colors. Fighting scenes are cheap, but at least filmmakers tried to put as many actions as possible. The music seemed to fit the classical ballet rather than the action film and is another bizarre aspect of Aslan Adam. Action was bad, even duplicated, which could be said to be bad. <br /> <br /> Aslan Adam is pure gold from start to finish, there are so many things that you like, laugh and enjoy in this movie that I just ended it really. In no way can Aslan Adam read a good movie in some sense, but it is one of the fun entertainment. Maybe we have to look at it soon to prove to myself that I didn't dream of it! The best Turkish action film about the Lion-raised person you will ever see. Proven popular to spawn a sequel, Lionman II: The Witchqueen (1979).
