It has always been my favorite movie. I have a copy of VHS and a few months ago I found a DVD that is also part of my video collection. I also have a big baseball fan, and as part of my off-season reading, I accepted Robert Whiting's excellent "You Gotta Have WA", which describes Japanese baseball and challenges. that foreign players have played in Japan. As I read yesterday, I began to think about this film because it seems that the scenario was almost literally based on this book. Parallels are unpleasant. Jack Elliot's character closely resembles Bob Horner, an aging MLB slugger whose best days were behind him. Horner's teammate Leon Lee is also depicted by Japanese league veteran Max "Hammer", who has made his peace with the frustrations of the Japanese game and helps keep his teammate healthy. Elliot's character goes through the same meeting as Horner, the great signing of fanfare, the early advances that feed already robbing sports media, and the resulting gap that encourages disappointment, alienation from teammates, fans and media, and the resulting disappointment that forces us to return to the US. The only difference is that the film adds such a Hollywood as love interest and a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Talking about the interests of love, I am sure many viewers have reached this site (as I did) to look for an actor who played "Hiroko" (beautiful Aya Takanashi) and what other work she has done. It only lists this movie. It turns out that I read from the article that the short love scene he's in with Tom Sellec (an alien), which is in our film (light by our standards - basically capable of being in the bath and wearing a towel) caused such a Japanese public (especially men). ) resentment that he has never been offered any other role in films or television - mainly by the Japanese film industry. This is a real shame because he is a pretty talented actor in this film. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie for baseball elements and cultural differences, go to Robert Whiting's "You Gotta Have WA" copy. Good movie reading and great companion.
