I love this movie absolutely and I've seen it many times. I stuck it around in 1987 when it was shown on Four, but my tape is now very worn and I love a new copy. I have sent four films by e-mail to ask them to show it again because it has never been available on video and as far as I know it has not been repeated since the 1980s. I have no answer and it is still not repeated. The performances are great. The movie has everything. His funny, sad, disturbing, exciting and completely back to school days. It is very fast and grabs you from start to finish. The shower room scene is especially terrible. I also can't hear the song Badge by Cream and don't think about that movie. This film deserves to be seen by a much larger audience because it is great. Fourth channel, please show again or release on video or DVD.
