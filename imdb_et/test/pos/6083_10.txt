I watched this movie when it appeared and really young and not too much in the cinema, it was one of the most exciting cinematic experiences I've ever had, and it left a mark inside me. probably the correlations between the past and the present failed because the film presents them to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Years after I first watched, I was able to watch it again and it was a time when I fell in love with the "English patient", it touched me so deeply and for me it was the best film ever. <br /> <br /> Anthony Minghella made a totally stunning movie, all the places are amazing and through her camera she can create incredible emotions inside you. <br /> <br /> Of course, the music of the movie is so much a part of the emotional journey of the characters and the film would not be the same without it. <br /> But personally the best thing was the fragile performance Ralph Fiennes gave to the masterpiece. He plays so well that a man who falls in love slowly but so deeply with Katherine Clifton opens his heart and dives into the forbidden thing. <br /> <br /> For me, the most heart-centered scene is always one that hurts Katherine's Almasy Swimmer Cave and she's carrying her with the milk she bought. He says, â€œI've always been wearing it. I always love you and she starts crying in the pain that flows inside her. <br /> <br /> Juliette Binoche is also amazing in her performance and really earned the Oscar she won. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a movie that anyone who declares himself a cinema friend should look at his life.
