It's not really about wine. No, Nossiter's real goals are those who go smoothly and embrace the peculiarities of local (wine) production for commercial purposes. For that, he has made an excellent, objective film. Spiritual, harsh, emotional, and erroneous independent wine producers are side by side with media protection, anodynesprech Amercians and Auld-Europeans: the art of winemaking for market-based, laboratory products. This is an open exhibition that does not refer to the conclusion. <br /> <br /> The Nossiter film is worshiping from time to time - cameras are by no means hidden or stable. There are also many titles and subtitles that are often too short on the screen. <br /> <br /> But it goes beyond Michael Moore's game that Moore can't play anyway. The characters speak for themselves - and condemn - themselves. Worth checking out 7/10
