Others' main criticism of this film - namely, that Macy is suddenly waiting for the Jew when she opens her glasses - is misplaced. Eyeglasses are just the small changes needed to prove the other CASE. The scene in which she tells her (paraphrasing) "but you know what my background is," with another discussion with her mother, suggests that she must fight the same premise in the past. The glasses now make him enough Jewish to "confirm" the existing doubts of his neighbor and co-workers. Then her big wife's big nose and taste is a strong dress that COURSE means she is a Jew. The point of the film is how these small stereotypical remarks become the basis for the evaluation of others. <br /> <br /> If he has a lisp, he must be gay. If she has long hair, she smokes. If he is a Spaniard, he has a knife ... and if he has round black glasses and he is easy to build, he must be a Jew. These statements sound like me (im). If the conclusion was that people jumped into Focus, it was wise to lose the whole story.
