One could say that two of the main actors, Mrs Toussaint & pr. From the pot, their relationship with the camera and off was real.

Historical struggles, tragedies and triumphs, relationships, everyday situations, every household has the same situation, no matter who the members are, it really just came to show a great family that at the end of every episode you can just sit in the living room sofa and tell yourself "now what I I learned from this particular episode ". <br /> <br /> I have to say that I have recorded most episodes and I watch them over and over again. /> <br /> Now you know why I gave him 10+!
