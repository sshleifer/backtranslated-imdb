Below the prized, invisible pearl. Estevez does a remarkable job of illustrating the tension in the bouncing, heartbreaking fashion that arises between hell and the back of his son, and his parents who are unable to begin to understand the emotional scarring left behind. It was not born differently on the fourth of July, because it deals with the emotional and mental distribution of soldiers after serving Vietnam, but at the same time focused more on post-Vietnam politics (anti-war calls, etc.). it deals with much more personal issues: the family. One man's struggle to restore normality after life-changing experience and his parents' inability to see the change. Estevez offers a ridiculous performance to Jeremy Collier. You can feel the pain and frustration that goes down under the surface. There he fits in an inch to his real father, Martin Sheen. This is a journey that looks at the two aside, because you get the idea that they are trying to catch each other. It's like each other's presence inspired the couple to do their best, and their performances won because of it. <br /> <br /> Recommended for anyone who appreciates solid action, writing, and leadership. And any Vietnamese breakfast breakfast. <br /> <br /> **** / ***** (8/10)
