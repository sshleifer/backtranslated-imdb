This is a typical Sandra Bullock film where she plays a mousy (but profane) woman who is in trouble, but finds a way to survive and be a hero. Sound familiar? <br /> <br /> There are many holes in this story. Things just don't add and some relationships are a bit outraged. But - this relationship is very good. There are many tensions in this story that have strong paranoia through it. The story begins slowly, but starts quite soon and remains so, making the film an inclusive film for the viewer. That's why I give him a pretty good rating - this movie is taking part in it. Bullock is more cute than the tedious he usually does to me, so it's my highest rated film.
