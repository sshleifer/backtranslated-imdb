Relative to seeing only now Hector Babenco's "Pixotet" (1981, Brazil, pronounced "pi-shot"), having seen quite a few movies dealing with street children, juvenile offenders, children in difficulty (Truffaut "The 400 Blows", Bunueli "Los Olvidados", De Sica "Shoeshine", Nairi "Salaam, Bombay!", Bresson's "Mouchette", Nugroho "Pillow Leaf", etc.), may be afraid that the childhood situation depicted in the film may no longer be influenced by being synthesized after when we passed the emotional roller track run by the previously quoted films. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, this is not the case. Because Babenco tells his film in a factual way ("artless" when one filmmaker puts it in a positive light) and that his central child artist is Fernando Ramos da Silva (at that time 13 years old and the street boy himself), gives such young, wounded presentations, raw simplicity (that toughened face, those lonely and longing eyes) that one is hard to put in, in any way piercing. (Such a feeling can achieve such elevated realism when one learns that the child had lived only for a short life, after participating in the crime of the movie and later murdered in the street.) <br /> <br /> About the first half of the film, Pixote and his companions spend children and criminals take time in a repressive state reform school, where brutality and humiliation, rape and murder are the norm and culture where they are forced to admit their "crimes", which is a weak understanding that under Brazilian law minors are not "punishable" for their crimes . For these children, the suspicious freedom on the streets is preferable to the harsh rehabilitation of their alleged welfare authorities. In the walls of this supposed defensive body, these young souls will soon discover that love and care from the numbers of parents is not anywhere, if not to some extent. The only form of escape comes from drilling grass and sniffing glue, smuggled into smuggling within the reorganization.) <br /> <br /> If the children shattered themselves with a small rebellion to finally express and then fulfill their collective desire to return to the outside world - their "home" - The intensity and form are such that one cannot avoid thinking about school boys' rebellion in the influential "Zero for Conduct" of Jean Vigo. It's just that "Pixote" has a "uprising" on the gutter. <br /> <br /> When Pixote and his small group are back in the streets (the other side of the movie), they are involved in robbery, pimping and drug dealing to take care of what they can meet with Suel. Sueli is happy to accommodate four lost souls, allowing her to rob her clients and offering more than just taking care of her mother (for at least one child). <br /> <br /> One would have thought that street children have finally found one person who can provide them with the love and warmth they have had in their lives. But as doubtful as the freedom that these children believe in the streets, this new found mother figure cannot remain forever. Jealousy, looting, differences and murder are just about anything - and good. And at the time of the event that Pixote caused it, not only the Sueli arrogant American client, but also his fellow Ditto (more than a shop for Suel), can be fired, he literally goes back to "infancy" as he sucks the better breasts of a failed woman, from there and then realizes its longing desire for parental affection, the picture itself is both sad and amazing. <br /> <br /> It is likely that Sueli will probably return to his "senses", regrettably pushing back Pixot from his "nourishing" position and rejecting him for good. So, Pixote, quietly sinking, with his younger face and their eye-catching eyes (not completely different, though in a different context, the young boy's mother, Elem Klimov, harassing "Come and see") gets himself up, puts his coat on and takes his gun ( yeah, gun!) and goes somewhere, walking along the train path and the morning light that is about to show up. In this scene, Babenco can just be respected (among the many other films to be honored!) In Truffaut's "The 400 Blows" iconic final scene. <br /> <br /> But when we learned what has become Antoine Doinel three years later in the short film "Antoine et Colette" (and also in three other feature films in the coming years), we remain blind to Pixote after she finally disappears from the last frame that is the last time we see this real street child (regardless of what fate actually deals with him). <br /> <br /> "Pixote" may not be nearly as close to "The 400 Blows" or hallucinatory as "Los Olvidados", but it stands out for its similar theme and texture due to its simple, raw power.
