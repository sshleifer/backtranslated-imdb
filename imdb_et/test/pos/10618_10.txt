This movie is absolutely amazing. There are no mistakes in the Hekkert, Girardot and Magimel performances towards Hanek's scenario and direction. The film can put some people on their sexual theme and its slower pace, but it's really a masterful cinema ... so don't let it get you out of challenging ways! <br /> <br /> Powerful and worthy of every award won in Cannes!
