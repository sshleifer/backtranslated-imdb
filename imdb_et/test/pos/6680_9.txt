at least for me. and rather an unexpected topic. a movie that makes you question your beliefs, your life, your approach to everything. that will help you see the world, we live through the lens - or a lot of lenses ... a moving, surprising and haunting movie. Kevin Spacey. Jeff Bridges very well. there is no false message in this thong. this is the perfect dance. perfect ‚Äùto the end. <br /> <br /> What's the end of? well ... everything you want it to be ... <br /> <br /> The movie you want to see again. maybe not right now. maybe after a few days. months. year. but it is something to go - or come back.
