<br /> <br /> Giorgino is a strange, dark, obsessive object; casting is impressive, the plot is powerful, reminded me of Edgar Poe's stories. Probably not a masterpiece, but it leaves us in memory of strong images, fine music, fear, sadness, confusion and sentence that says everything: wolves are coming. GIORGINO is now completely forgotten, and when it was released, no one would appreciate it. It is a pity. If you can see it, well ... try.
