I found this movie on DVD just by chance through the rental of Blockbuster. Riding on the planet is a great BBC 2-hour documentary / drama solar system's future "grand tour". Having struggled to follow the current knowledge of planets and space flight and the credible extrapolations of existing technology, this film tells the story of astronauts on the journey of Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Pluto. <br /> <br /> Special effects are great for a TV show. I found that the actors are believers in astronauts. The situations to be presented are mostly believable and you will learn a lot about the science of planets and space flight! Only two small complaints: I sometimes found some situations and dialogue. In addition, I'm not sure if one team and a ship will be sent to one mission to see all these destinations at once. Moreover, visits to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, etc. are likely to be separate tasks. <br /> <br /> They did not catch this example with product-value rags. The Venus and Mars scenes were filmed in the northern deserts of Chile - the driest region on earth and the dead circle of Mars. Non-weighted sequences were filmed by diving in the Russian transport direction. Manufacturers would have read some of them using the studios and CGI, but chose the real thing instead. <br /> <br /> I would especially like to mention the wonderful music created for this movie. The fascinating theme of Don Davis is the first thing that grabs you at the beginning of the movie, because Pegasus's great hit passes through the screen and David Suchet's inton "it's human destiny to study stars ...". <br /> <br /> Watching this small TV screen is a regret. What a thrill to see in the cinema or even in a better IMAX presentation!
