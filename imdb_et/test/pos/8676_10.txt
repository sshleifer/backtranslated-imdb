I heard an interview with the main actor who said the film was not a horror film, but it would describe it as a mental horror. I strongly agree with that. <br /> <br /> It is not clear why he is traveling to this place, but everything is monotonous, not vivid colors, honest smiles, anything personal. Everything is ordered and everyone seems to be happy with this life. Our "hero", though from the beginning, seems to be wrong and feels himself. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so important and good is that today, in many large cities or even in countries, there is a significant resemblance to life. You have to act, you should not let your colleague know your weaknesses, show your wealth, cars, etc., and most of all you have no real love for the love children have. Of course, this film does not see children or old people - they simply do not fit into the society of strong workers. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone - and make sure this utopia doesn't come true!
