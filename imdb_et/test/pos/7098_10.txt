Despite all the comparisons in the Frankenstein House, this film is from its predecessor and is one of the most amazing monster movies in the Universal Monsters series and unfortunately the latter. Okay. so it doesn't exactly match the Frankens bride like the classic, which is respected by all the movies, but Dracula, Wolf Man and Frankenstein (What's not to help but enjoy this schlock fest! And unlike Frankenstein's house, there are many more monsters in this movie. The film also offers a unique story for both Dracula and Wolf Man, both of whom go to Dr. Adleman to cure their suffering. When Wolf Man actually cures, Dracula injects his blood into a doctor and then begins a real fun! I recommend this movie to fans of classic horror films. Remember, I've never said it was good, just fun.
