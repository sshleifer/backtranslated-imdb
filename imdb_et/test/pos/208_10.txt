If you are looking for a typical warfare, this is not the case so that all of the testosterone-pumped warfare warlords do not deserve. Although the film is about Russian characters of World War II, it does not expect you to see Nazis, cannons, blood, gore, etc. This is not a film about people who cause war or war. This is a movie about the ordinary people with whom the war happens, and the choices they make in dealing with it. <br /> <br /> Action, Cinematography, Writing: Everything here is a perfect 10 year old. You will certainly appreciate it if you are Russian, but even if you don't, you probably love it. If you don't speak Russian, look for the RUSCICO (Russian Cinema Council) DVD version. It has subtitles in about 14 different languages, but copying English to what I would say is just as good. Of course, this is not as good as the original Russian story (some things disappear), but as good as English subtitles. So look at it, especially if you are studying any aspect of the movie.
