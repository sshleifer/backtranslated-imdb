An excellent Hitchcock thriller with Robert Cummings, which proves once again that it really responds to the storm. <br /> <br /> This time he is a defense worker who has hit a terrible plot when his best friend is killed in the factory. <br /> <br /> Priscilla Lane is a girl who is unexpectedly interested in Cummings because of thickening of the plot and being continued in California, NY. columnists destroy inside. Hitchcock knew he was playing social interventions related to the chaos of his long career director. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the film imitates itself at the end. When we see what happens to the Cummings friend's killing, we don't see what happens to the rest of the gang, many of whom represent the upper crust of society.
