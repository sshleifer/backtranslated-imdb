Before I saw this movie, I have heard a lot of praise about it and quite a lot of exclamation about how this "terrible" was. Not taking away any credit for this movie, I think it wasn't so terrible or even shocking. It's just a movie about people living on the dark side of the city. And a good point to portray this point. <br /> <br /> Here are some great things to do and a well thought out handbook. Paavo Westerberg is a well-known writer in the Finnish film scene and is best at describing contemporary Finnish culture (although he is not the only writer of this film, but I dare say that he is the main writer. Correct me if I am wrong). <br /> <br /> Casting is great, except for Jasper Pääkkönen (a pseudo head who I think should have been on the soap opera scene) and the sets, cuts and sounds are also very well done and give this film a great atmosphere. <br /> <br /> This movie is a story of loosely connected sad fates that are a well-known song of the famous Finnish band (Eppu Normaali's "Thousands of Fragments of Songs", which have been translated to a great extent into "Evil Earth" throughout Finnish society) lead to a sad, blind ending with rhinitis, loneliness, and bad choices, and this is the side of everyday life in Finland, with about 80% of the population not aware of such films.
