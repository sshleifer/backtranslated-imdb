First I started to look back at The Outer Limits at the age of 95 when I was 10 years old, and it just blew every week with every episode, every episode was twisted, and every week I couldn't wait for the following. The way writers managed to do each episode so well and distinguish it within a 7-year period is beyond me. This exhibition can teach us about life, robotics, foreigners and people's meetings, and understanding of paranormal and how it affects people. What really makes this a good show is the characters of each episode, they really show emotions and are really good actors. You will also notice the actor / actress you know each week from a previous indication that is quite clean in its own way. <br /> <br /> If you want to calm down and sit back in a Sci-Fi show, Outer Limits is for you
