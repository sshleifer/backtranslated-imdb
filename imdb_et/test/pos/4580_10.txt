I stumbled upon this film at random. I mean, how else could I find out? It wasn't mortgaged at the studio at all, nor did I hear it release from my usual friends. After spending my money on so many bad movies this year, I would like to see it in theaters, not DVDs. Mike judge is hiding tasty smart humor with a low eyebrow pack. Look at "Hill of the Hill" for a while ... this is seemingly red humor, but it is a very fine yacht in rednecks, at the same time very sympathetic. I read the tag of this movie and immediately ordered it off the internet. I really do not understand where these negative reviews come from, except perhaps from Carl Jr. This movie is not only fun but also balanced. The momentary visual disturbances are among the relaxing sightings and jabs between our current superstar / corporate culture. Of course there are some nice humor, but it's just there to laugh. The premise is only half-believable, but since it was important? I don't see people who despise Futurama because the assumption is very similar. Just look at this movie. If you don't laugh, something is really wrong with you. Maybe your dad works with Gatorade or something, and he was really offended by the movie. Maybe you are an idiot. Probably the last one.
