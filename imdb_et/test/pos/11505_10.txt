"The Angels of the Universe" is a pure masterpiece and it proves once again that you can make a great film with a small budget, such as American Beauty and the Blair Witch Project. Director Fridrik Th√≥r Fridriksson gives a new life on the white screen to Englar alheimsins. The film is a breakthrough in Icelandic films, as it is the largest and biggest film in Iceland. <br /> <br /> The music played by Sigurdo is very symbolic for the film. is absolutely brilliant. I recommend that anyone who is capable of thinking about going and watching this movie as soon as possible will not be disappointed. Will I invest in this film to win the best foreign film award next year? all over the world!
