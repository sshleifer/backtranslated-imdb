When I first saw this example, I was 9 years old and immediately tried to draw attention when Stewie tried to call Lois on the hotel phone. I laughed and watched. When the episode was over, I wrote the comic word name and watched it regularly. It separates itself from Simpsons and other exhibitions, such as Cartoon Network, because jokes are more mature, not too much, but that's the reason for TV-14. Fast movie cutting after every hit line and cute, funny movement and character behavior make it special. Talented Seth Macfarlene is the creator and voice of the exhibition. A good theme and a crazy family, which is always something funny, makes it my favorite film Sealab 2021 and Aqua Teen's hunger. Check if it's funny.
