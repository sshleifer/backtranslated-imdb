This movie is very long but it's worth sharing over several nights. It's all starred and if you are a fan of Patrick Swayze, it will give you a warm heart! :-) My mother is a civil war buffer and a history teacher, and every summer we would watch this movie (we had recorded it on TV) for several nights until we got through. We had every movie recorded in line, lol. Pop some popcorns, sit back and enjoy activities and romance. It's a great movie for those who want to act, war, blood and courage, but also for those who have a soft and romantic side. The clothes the women wore were GORGEO! Sometimes I think I was born in the wrong era, lol.
