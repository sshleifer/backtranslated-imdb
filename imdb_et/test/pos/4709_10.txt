Surely it is beyond doubt that Patricia Arquette is what she has promoted: ACTRESS! This is undoubtedly her best moment of action and she certainly deserves the credit for her work. He has never been completely believable and authentic in any other film except the Holy Marriage. <br /> <br /> Plot: A young woman finds himself in Southeast Asia and unexpectedly is thrown into political confusion in rural areas. He knows the massacre and totalitarianism and flees. <br /> <br /> This is one movie you need to see or you haven't seen all the best of Hollywood. I put it in 58 top 100 best films. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Bob
