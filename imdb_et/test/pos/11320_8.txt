This is pretty good when it comes to "what if" a TV set. What if the terrorists exploded in a dirty bomb in a big city, in this case London. Many poking people who say we're all set in the emergency show that they're not telling the whole story. And is anyone ready for that? You can't predict. It shows the material that is smuggled into the country of bombs, the making of bombs, the secrecy and the double life that the people behind it put, etc. It also shows public servants (eg firefighters) who give everyone their salvation when they are they do not get any help if the government does not want to send someone else to the affected area. It also shows how unnecessarily inadequate "preparations" are such a case, because the government speaks everything, but then there is the mouth that opens when the tragedy opens. And can this happen in a good old USA? Well, if you haven't lived in the caves for the past 20 years, there is already some way and no prediction that someone would be ready for that kind of thing. It is quite realistic and yes, even scary. It's worth seeing, but I hope nothing like this happens. 8 out of 10.
