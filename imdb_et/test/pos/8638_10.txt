With an open segment that imitates Todd Haynes's safe music and cinematography (1995), David Lynch uses dreams, myths, and distorted concepts of reality to talk about a broken story about an unsuccessful bit of Hollywood actor / speaker, Diane Selwyn's fame, and his own demons and obsession with Camilla Rhodes who is a hotshot associated with director Adam Kesher. <br /> <br /> Film works effectively with Diane's drug-fed head; we are witnessing his crazy distortions, his desires, regret, obsession and fears. Using a dream story that represents a conflict between two concepts of reality, Lynch does not make it easier to contrast reality and fantasy, but actively mixes them. The last 45 minutes are as dreamlike as before; and the alarming air is still, under contradictory ambiguity, still overwhelmingly breaking the seemingly secure distinction between reality and dream that we expect to see in nightmare and dream movies. <br /> <br /> Lynch's film lends many films, old and new, but ultimately, unlike others, the film is the only one missing the director's own lost road and Blue Velvet. It constantly exposes the viewer to an interpretation that is visible, not only intuitively, but intellectually. However, it is not as pretentious as it could have been imagined, because Lynch, despite her murderous acts, is a compassionate player - an element that was missing from all other films except Straight Story. He does this by presenting Diane's dream alter-ego, Betty, as a whole Canadian famous peasant girl. Lynch also presents us with an intriguing story that affirms and denies equally. Do Camilla and Diane love or just friends? Who is the blue lady? What does he mean? Who is behind Winkies? What is the Importance of a Decayed Body in Sierra Bonital? Does Aunt Ruth really exist? Is silencio an abstraction of hell, or maybe, in itself, a fictional film? Lynch is not ready to answer any of his questions, rather than presenting his "love story in a dream city" as a set of abstract and motifs linked together. <br /> <br /> The actor is top-notch, especially Naomi Watts, who is Diane Selwyn / Betty, who still overshadows this result. Laura Harring requires Hayworthesque allure like Camilla / Rita, while Adam Theroux as Adam brings his hands free arrogant and sublimates paranoid aggression. It was an amazing and serious injustice that none of them were even candidates for the Academy Award. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that needs to be closely monitored and analyzed. The secret in the heart of the film lies with Lynch, but half of the fun is to find consistent ideas from the maze of seemingly contradictory contradictions. Closer observation has a common sense of mystery, perhaps an incomplete mosaic that closes us, but denies the imaginative perfection of narrative cohesion. Ultimately, this is Lynch's main film.
