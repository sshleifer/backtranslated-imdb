Since many of today's movies are guilty, the plot is not exactly accurate, the film doesn't move anyone, and certainly it doesn't guarantee any prize (outside Blockbusters) ... but then again who really cares. <br /> <br /> The team of Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro produce a very funny, sometimes fun movie that I really enjoyed. Russo and Shatner also played their small parts well. I hope that in the future my wife will be both old and Miss Renee. <br /> <br /> Easy movement, this "friend" cop creates a great laugh within a reasonable time. The movie is enjoyable to avoid waiting for the video / dvd release and instead to go ahead and control it. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy is in her usual top shape and is completely enjoyable to watch. De Niro has perfectly shaped this type of role. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie and I think a real movie fan who needs a good movie or just laughs really enjoys Showtime. > <br /> Top Performance: Murphy. Fun. That's enough. Getting a Job: Nice. The nice action scenes that Murphy and De Niro used together as a charm gave Russo a nice supportive work. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 out of 10. It doesn't move you or anything ... but it's a very enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> This is Showtime ... was a great success.
