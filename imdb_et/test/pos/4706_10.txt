First I knew about this movie when I saw a preview of another movie. I was intrigued, but it couldn't be seen until it was short-lived in theaters. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to shoot several times. There is a lot of violence against unarmed civilians. Here are the lessons. One of Patricia's Arquette lines is going together. "For Americans, if it didn't happen on television, it just didn't happen." There is a lot of truth to this. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that at one point he thinks he's just saying he's an American citizen who's taking part and let him go. It doesn't work that way. <br /> <br /> The landscape is beautiful. Action is all decent. PROFESSOR is especially good. Mainly though I care about these signs. Francis McDormand and Spaulding Gray are good, but their appearance is short so they don't matter. Patricia has guts. It could have been very bad for a smaller actor. Since the film is love or hatred, you should still go out with the idea that there are still military dictatorships in the world over the course of this century, and until one of us hurts, we ignore their oppression. <br /> <br /> Aung San Suu Kyi is the female political leader of the film. In real life, he won the Nobel Peace Prize. He was only recently released from house arrest. The Bush administration, from the time I wrote it, is trying to put pressure on the military government to start talks with him and restore the government. The Burmize government was under the control of the name of the country as the Maynamar Republic. The US government has not yet recognized the new name. <br /> <br /> If you don't want to watch a message in the movie, you won't see it. If you don't have a little entertainment, then that's good.
