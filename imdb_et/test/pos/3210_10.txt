This show is really great. It's smart. It's funny. It's great action and writing. This show is really the fastest show I've ever seen. Dialogues are really funny and well-functioning. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bled have great chemistry. You really believe they're a mother and a daughter. Indeed, this exhibition proved that the mother's affairs do not really have to be a mother and a daughter; Just look at this exhibition, which I highly recommend. Season 7 stars Tuesday, September 26, 2006, 8 / 7c on New CW
