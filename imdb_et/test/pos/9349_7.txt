I've seen this movie more than once. It's not the biggest scifi flick I've seen, but it's not a bad movie. Action is good and the characters are "real" rather than low budget sci fi. (At least it's not full of funny bimbos, like many other low budget scifi.) I especially like Elizabeth Pena. She's a good actor and she's not worried about her single mother or any other. <br /> <br /> Don't let them tell you they will tell you. See it for yourself and rate it yourself.
