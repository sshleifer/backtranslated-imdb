First, let me review the movie. This movie overwhelms me and I don't even believe in foreigners! But the film has its drawbacks. <br /> <br /> There are three actions in this movie. The first is perfect. It creates a movie and really builds a slip factor. I have to say that the score is great! Everything is created and created perfectly. <br /> <br /> The Two Act begins when Jillian, who plays Sherry Burton, is shrinking. They hypnotize him and recall the robbery. Law Two foreigners appear when they destroy the film. "Screaming Mad George" made an impact on foreigners. I have to say that they did a good job, except to portray their "gray" aliens. Not offended, but Grays looked like inflatable door prizes. <br /> <br /> I liked how they did the hypnosis of one and two acts. If you pay attention, you would notice that the husband had two different memories. In the man's version of events, they are shining with blue light and his wife says, "Someone here" or something like that. That's logical. The man is worried about his wife. "Someone" can hurt him. This is his question. But in his version of events he says, "Help me!" He's not saying someone is here. This is also worthwhile. Aliens are after him. She wants her husband to help and save her. Now back to the movie. <br /> <br /> The Third Law turns the movie into a gore festival. It starts with a "strange" ultrasound procedure. It's a typical gore fest, but it has a surprise. I will not destroy it, because it is actually an interesting development. <br /> <br /> DVDs and comments take too seriously, but if you think Wilford Brimley says "Horsesh **" is funny, you might want to check it out in the interview section. Now to Jillian McWhirter's praise. <br /> <br /> I can only hope Jillian reads it. I've never seen her before, but wow what a show! Let me tell you the rest of it. First, it should be a serious film. The details I am describing now may seem comic and fun, such as "Humanoids Of The Deep" (1980), but it is not really. I understood? Okay. <br /> <br /> Jillian is hot, naturally good looking. He's naked in a lot of movie, a good thing. Unfortunately, it is usually very bad to be attacked, terrorized and raped. But he has to act a lot in this movie naked. He gets points to overcome it. He must act happy, sad, horny, afraid and physically hurt after a few moments. Emotional appeal is amazing! She must rejoice when she learns she is pregnant. He must scare the fear when foreigners take out their intestines. He must act very angry when his wife suggests that the child is not his. He must act like he denies, saying that his child is not wrong when his wife says otherwise. I have to note that the foreigners who control him are forced to force him. I'm talking here with an Oscar caliber, <br /> <br /> Then there's rape. It's annoying, but because it's just some rubber alien, it's not too bad. In this scene, the alien is not a "gray" alien, so I describe it. Aliens have tentacles and it's like a table. Jillian is in a table-shaped section that is kept by tentacles. His head is the head of an alien. The alien's head is long and slips down so its head is now above Jillian's feet. Then an alien's fallen nose comes out of his forehead. This is the forehead! Looks pretty comby, right? Well, Jillian plays it right and she pulls it off! He must act like an alien who has his own forehead-nano-nano, rapes him and pulls it away! It's a very intense scene, but it doesn't. You see, this scene has been made in setbacks. What makes the scene a Jillian result that resembles these events. He is just lying in the hospital bed under hypnosis, recalling the kidnapping of an alien, but his action here is more intense than the actual rape! How many participants can be shot off the stage, which describes rape that is more intense than rape? Not much! But Jillian does that. <br /> <br /> I can go on and on. Jillian, if you ever read it, I want you to know that I, named MegamanX-1, believe you are the best actor ever. You're the best actor ever! I can only hope you read it and always take it with you. <br /> <br /> For all others, "Successful" (1999) is a very good movie. I would recommend it.
