I just had the chance to see 'Nuovomondot' (known as the 'Golden Door' in the US) and impressed by the dreamy and occasionally surreal story of a family that immigrates from Sicially to the United States in the early days of the century. He also worked (obediently) as a middle finger, stuck in an internal security eyeball (preferably up to a triangle), depicting the abuse of aliens who just want a better life when they got their original motherland. (Mostly) Italian cast, with some exceptions, works well. This is a quiet, undervalued film that is good to look at (casual but tasteful use of surrealism is always a joy), while the manuscript is well written. This is a movie for those who are sick and tired of Hollywood's pointless escapism that earns little more than selling popcorn (not having any burning issues with popcorn, remember! --- I really love things). You would do wisely to look for Nuovomondo / The Golden Door (or whatever it is in your area).
