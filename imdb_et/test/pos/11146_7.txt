There is no point that those filmmakers who have complained that this film has no credibility or who have problems with building are. It's a wonderful camp romance with lots of Play, Gypsies! Dance, Gypsies! music that sends exotic love stories and celebrates them. Buttoned-up Ray Milland makes a fun foil with black hair, faded scarves and tons of jewelry. The eagerness of the character to feed the Milland and take care of him is better suited to German good hausfrau. Censorship is in force, it is clear that they only share caravans under platonic conditions, Milland struggles with Dietrich's progress, judging by the remarkable heterosexual bachelor who can kill every day. His only excuse is that he smells, maybe maybe beaten, powerful Englishman. <br /> <br /> The small role of Milland's young companion in his secret mission adds Bruce Lester to the camp. We are told at first that he hated the Milland and indeed he was rather. When he has met Milland after segregation, which has now turned into a brown leather black shirt that is open to the waist, his incandescent pricing shows that not only Dietrich is romanticly attracted to Milland. In spite of the wonderfully unlikely characters and sequence of events, Milland's growing love for Dietrich and his acceptance of non-rational areas of life are quite relevant. And if he says that each of them now includes half of you before his flight, two of them have become and then the darkness will fall, I think we can assume that the censor decided to break them! One goof - at first, Milland, who should be English, refers to the lieutenant using American pronunciation. (According to English "leftenant".) Since Milland was British, he must say so because American filmmakers feared that British style was confusing and confusing to the American audience.
