Mr. Rowan Atkinson, Mr. Bean is present with Laurel & Hardy, Buster Keaton, Marx Brothers and other comedy. I have never seen people laugh out loud so frankly and literally out of their chairs as when I introduced them to Bean through my videos and now DVDs. I'll never forget the first time my brother saw him. He was on a visit and I asked him if he would ever have seen Mr Beani? "Who?" he said. So I got my video out and showed her where Mr. Bean is in the church and is starting to kick off. My brother laughed so hard that he fell out of the chair and kept his stomach laughing so hard. He became a direct fan of Mr. Beani. We all know how fun these episodes are, but it's fun to share them with others. I've seen so many people laughing! Favorite episodes are: queen visiting, staying in a hotel room, late appointment to the dentist, Christmas episode (classic ... plus kids love it!) And New Year's party. Rowan Atkinson is a comic genius!
