I found this flick to enjoy and watch, and I'm surprised that it's so low. Actually, I understand why it is; I imagine it is fans of Eric Roberts and Alyssa Milano who have given the majority in 1s and 2s because if you put a tape on a machine that expects you to enjoy something that both are both starring you may be quite disappointed. Eric appears about half an hour at the end of the movie and Alyssa is on the other side of about 5 scenes and those he says little and cares less (though never naked, if that's what you're looking for, stick to embrace a vampire). Although they are always happy, it is unfortunate that he or Eric doesn't get much screen time, but I will give it another 8. <br /> <br />
