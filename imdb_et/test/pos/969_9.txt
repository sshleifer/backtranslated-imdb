BIG FAT LIAR is, in my opinion, a completely fun movie with moral. When Jason (Frankie Muniz - "MALCOLM IN MIDDLE") and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes - "ALL THAT") played these tricks with Martyl (Paul Giamatti - DOCTOR DOLITTLE), I smiled and felt good. That's what I liked most about this movie. In fact, everything that happened after Jason's essay got into Marty's hands was fun. I especially loved Jale White's home. When I first saw her, I couldn't be sure, but when I asked her if it was, she said, "Of course!" Before I seal it, I would like to say, "As I said earlier, this story is moral and this morality is always the truth." Finally, if you are a fan of Frankie Muniz, Amanda Bynes or Paul Giamatti, I recommend this very fun movie that has moral.
