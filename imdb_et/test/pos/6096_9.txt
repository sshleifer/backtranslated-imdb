It must be one of the most fun Danish films ever made. Ulrich Thomsen and Thomas Bo Larsen are fun when traveling across Sweden. I do not know how Ulrich Thomsen does it, but he can somehow crazy to play mad. But if you don't understand Danish (I'm not referring to my pastries here), don't waste your time with it? I don't think it works with subtitles.
