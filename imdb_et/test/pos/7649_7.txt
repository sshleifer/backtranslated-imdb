Without listening to this movie, it was a surprise when it was recently shown in the cable. Gary Ellis, the talented "Tough Luck" director, admires the game shown on Bill Boatman and Todd King. The film engages the viewer from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Archie, who is at the heart of this story, has been involved in all kinds of small crimes. In fact, we are seeing a confrontation right from the start, putting it out of New Orleans as soon as possible. He arrives at a carnival run by a mysterious Ike. Archie falls to Davina, a woman she should have been wise. The result proves that Archie has a deadly decision, which then becomes the object of relocation. <br /> <br /> The director should recognize Norman Reed's casting, which the camera probably loves. Despite her being, she knows her because we know her heart is in the right place. The beautiful Dagmara Dominczyk is the perfect exotic dancer of Divana, who, despite Ike's lover, attracts Archie with her fallen heels. Armand Assante is barely understandable when the first part of the film speaks. <br /> <br /> "Tough Luck" shows the new director Gary Ellis, showing that she's doing bigger and better things because she knows what she's doing.
