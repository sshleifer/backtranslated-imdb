This is one of my favorite films from my childhood. Siberia in the distant desert, at the turn of the century, is a little community mixed up when the extremely cold winter forces two tigers to go down the mountains, looking for food, getting away from the periphery. In this atmosphere, we introduce an open-air, private cage trap that lives in the wild when it arrives at the village to sell its annual catch to Boris, his close friend, and quite a friend in the village who runs the record. At the request of Boris, Avakum accompanied his friend's arrogant son, Ivan, with the threat of tigers. Personalities crash and tempt burning because the older, more experienced Avakum criticizes Ivan's amateur methods, as seen by other hunting members. On the second day, the hunters see their harvest and chase. In the case of thick wood, Ivan wounds one tiger that then attacks an unhappy man. Opumum saw that Ivan slipped with a raging beast, fires but accidentally hit Ivan. He kills the tiger when he escapes. Other hunters reach the scene, doubt. <br /> <br /> A doctor goes back to the village to save the wounded Ivan. Avakum tries to leave the village, but faces Ivan's friends. Trapper brushes them down and accelerates with his dog-drawn sled. The young villagers swear by him that they will come to him if Ivan dies, what he will do later, but before explaining his death to his father, that this is an accident. Old Boris, straightening his loved one's village from the village, stretches out the "lynch mob" and goes out after Avakum to find him and set things right. So the main story begins. <br /> <br /> A simple film that enhances the conflict between man and civilization with nature, mainly with the Avakum struggle to live alone in the desert. The winter landscape is very well filmed. Perhaps the strongest feature of the film is Jimmie Haskell's soundtrack. Very sentimental and memorable, the main theme that resembles Albinoni Adagia. Other movements reflect both Russian styles and a few folk music types. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie is not known to me, which is a shame. Almost twenty years ago, a TV that I shot from my TV is slowly getting worse. This film must be visible to those who appreciate it when they find it. 8/10
