DAYS DAYS <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> Alarm Crashes when LA-boy (Wes Ramsey) falls in love with a nice Mormon missionary (Steve Sandvoss). <br /> <br /> Great hit in the festival area and limited theater releases, this pleasant movie - scriptwriter C. Jay Cox (debut of SWEET HOME ALABAMA) debut - is an exercise in "attracting opposites" where Ramsey's low-profile character has changed forever after heavy vulnerable the beauty of Sandvoss's fall, limited by the dictations of his religious beliefs. Here is the path of true love paved with difficulties, at least of which the reaction of Sandvoss's co-mormons to his new sexuality, resulting in his fall from the church and the anger of his indignant parents (Mary Kay Place has a small but devastating comb as a boy's outraged mother). But the Cox script focuses mainly on Ramsey's redemption path, because his hedonistic lifestyle is being cast as a result of Sandvoss's power and responsibility as a result of his evolving maturity: He participates as a volunteer, delivering food to AIDS patients at home, resulting in unexpected friendship with former party boy Erik Palladino TV "er", whose illness gives Ramsey a vital alarm. <br /> <br /> The Cox script is gently closed with one liner and various wisdom pearls (Mormonism: "Your Church doesn't like alcohol or homosexual? Well, I'm definitely not joined - I can't imagine heaven without both!") and the characters are surprisingly complex and well drawn. Ramsey has a more apparent and sexy role (he saw something rude first!), But it's Sandvoss, who has become a homosexual icon, with a sensitive imagination of a sweet innocent whose journey from darkness to light leads to an astonishing revelation of his place in the world around him. He and Ramsey are well-matched, and their inevitable sex scene (short but memorable) is followed by a convincing order where Ramsey describes the childhood trauma that has defined her life so far. <br /> <br /> The filmed hi-def video and over 35mm theater show, the film's limited budget limits the scope and size of Cox's ambitions, though characters and situations are small enough to survive this small flaw. Jacqueline Bisset shines in the world restaurant restaurant Ramsey waits for a lifestyle, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt ("The Third Sun in the Sun") steals every thunderstorm from Sandvoss's man against Mormon. religious principle ... but only in principle. Although there was a bit of film at times, this is a romantic longing and deserves honesty and compassion. Best vision with like-minded viewers, preferably with the one you love.
