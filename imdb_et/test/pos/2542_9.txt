Gray can jump English hard, like no other. He talks about several events related to writing a manuscript ("Monster"), some sad, somewhat funny, all in his characteristic, sarcastic sense. If you liked "Swimming in Cambodia" then you will love it. I thought it was a little more interesting and better to say "Swimming to Cambodia". A real masterpiece.
