So far this episode is the best of the series. The story was excellent. I especially liked how writers were in Desmond's episode; it was his best result to date and he certainly earned Emmy for his performance. <br /> <br /> We had some of our questions answered in this episode, but because the exhibition is called losing, we know that more questions have been raised. First, they replied: Walt is back with his father Michael, secondly, Michael's betrayal is open to Jack, Sawyer, Kate and Hurly, and because of his betrayal, others have been taken by Kate, Jack and Sawyer. It was a great opportunity to finish the show. <br /> <br /> On the other side of the island, we see Locke with a mental break. This leads to another answer to the question of how the plane really went. However, there are some unanswered questions: first, what happened to Locke, Eco and Desmond when Desmond turned to the failed key, and what was the agreement with the Arctic scientists who were looking for electromagnetic nodes. We think we'll find out next season, but a good ending to the end of the best TV show.
