My first review at IMDB after a couple of years of continuous use of this site ... <br /> <br /> Again, I saw it on the second evening, loved it. It is in terms of dangerous thoughts or substitutes, but much better. For a moment, it was certain that Rex was awake at Speedy Levitch, but after checking it didn't seem like that. <br /> <br /> I see why many have problems with this plot and poetry, but I also think these people are close. True, the end was not exactly what I was hoping for, but in general it was so unique and worked well, I can't complain. I wouldn't call this cheese, as one appraiser did, pulled the scene better than most movies in the 80's. And they refused to play 80's music. <br /> <br /> I don't remember everything that I saw when I saw it, but basically it showed realistic people who were mediocre and whether I share Rex beliefs, I love the initial attempts to describe the meaning of life . And, in my opinion, the theory of his mutants is original. He rambled a lot, but they showed how confused he was at times and why he might have some psychological problems. And then, at the moments of clarity, he was a philosopher extraordinaire, a person who noticed little details in life and tried to express them. <br /> <br /> John Savage was also very impressed with his teacher. Participants usually do not participate in this role. He excelled it perfectly. <br /> <br /> If you liked Waking Life, I'll tell you this movie if you have the chance. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10 <br /> <br />
