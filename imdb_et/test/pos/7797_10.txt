This movie is an amazing comedy. The script is too funny .. if u look at it more than once, you will enjoy it more. Although comedy is sometimes silly, but it makes u laugh! Salman Khan and Aamir Khan have given rights to their roles. After 1994, I haven't met any Hindi movie that was as funny as it was.
