This movie is George C. Scott's best, Bernard Hughes his best and Diana Rigg's most pithy and of course Paddy Chaevsky's writing "masterpiece" thread! There are also very short extracts of future biggies like Susan Sarandon, Stockard Channing, etc., who has one scene line that you may not see until the fifth or sixth time. Nancy Marchand is a young and middle-aged sister instructor also excellent, as well as practically every 1970's Hollywood face. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few movies that will improve, the more times you see it. See the "surprise" scene area "Wait until dark"! This is one of the few movies I've ever bought on DVD. That's great.
