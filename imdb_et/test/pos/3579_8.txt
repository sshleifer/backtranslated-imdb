Blue Planet ... Wow ... Where do I start? Years of hard work was paid off, which is undoubtedly one of the best documentaries ever created. <br /> <br /> The sights and sounds of Blue Planet, like most documentaries with the Attenborough seal, are rare and most people haven't even experienced it. This alone should be a good reason to buy this series, especially if you are a curious guy who "wants to know". <br /> <br /> The blue planet, however, is not the perfect documentary. After the 3rd episode, it will start a bit more. How many options are there for different sea animals to swim, kill, hang, companion and lay and do all these possibilities really need to be explored? But if you have a deep interest in marine life, this repetition should not be a problem at all.
