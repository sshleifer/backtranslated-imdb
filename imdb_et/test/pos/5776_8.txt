I saw this movie when it first came out. Patty didn't want to separate his brothers. However, the juvenile justice system does not care. When Patty got acquainted with the file, the judge sent him to a juvenile detention facility. He claimed that he had violated privacy rules by viewing a private file. He just wanted his family together. I couldn't blame him. The parents didn't even fit the parents. One of the smaller children had to be a toilet. Father stopped and let them go. He drove away and left the children at the service station. Patty had to protect them because he was the oldest. They were placed in nursing homes. The good part is that the social worker got them back as a family. The head of the social worker told him to interrupt him and not to mix. He was a powerful crazy. He was the one who was placed by Patty in a juvenile facility. Why didn't they go after the Father who was released from prison? But the kids are caught in the middle and make themselves insecure.
