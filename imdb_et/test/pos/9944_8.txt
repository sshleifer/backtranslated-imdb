I've noticed that many people take Opera to do the task as Betty reacts to the murders. I think they support these complaints about how they represent a "normal" person. The thing is ... Betty is not a "normal" person because of traumatic events in childhood. She has problems so that before the movie ever started ... and finally Opera ... in my opinion ... she is completely confused. <br /> <br /> ------- -------------- SPOILERS -------------------- --------------- ---- You must remember that when he was a very small child, he saw that his mother's lover had committed at least one brutal murder while his Saddle-Bag Mom had been watching it. <br /> <br /> She has grown up A woman who achieves sexual liberation is tied to the viewing, leaning and death of the girls. It doesn't make a healthy life. I think it's quite easy to conclude that her mother would have used any emotional manipulation and negative reinforcement to make sure her daughter never got into her. It is also likely that at his impressive age Betty would have what she saw. Is it just something adults do, etc. <br /> <br /> Betty probably looks to her mother ... I mean ... she's become an opera singer like her. If a mother likes it, it can't be bad, can ... Mommy can't be bad, can she? He could not tell the police to his mother or to the mysterious companion to his mother who he associates with his mother. <br /> <br /> Betty has many deep emotional problems. His mind has been trying for many years to stop the memory of what he saw when he made his mother ... but it keeps up on the surface, showing himself as horrible nightmares, skull-like migraines, relaxation techniques, and sexual freezing. . Betty, who has interfered with murder / sex, and the part that believes these things are wrong is an internal struggle. <br /> <br /> After he saw his boyfriend being a murdered hooded man ... he calls the police but doesn't want to give his name. His part, which thinks the murder is wrong, forces him to call, but the part that is ambiguous does not allow him to allow personal involvement. His ambivalent part is control before he can go all the way. So he walks away from the phone ... and when he's taken by the driver, he acts surprisingly calm, not as irritated as you think a "normal" person would be ... because his part has been blocking things because he was a child, it is trying to fuck her to block the horror she just showed. <br /> <br /> The situation in his life contributes to the deadlock of Betty's psyche. His singing career begins to bear fruit ... he will be a great opera singer like his mother. But does he get in any way like his mother? In the darkest ways? Or is he able to do his way? Add it to the reappearance of every hooded man around him. <br /> <br /> Only when the hooded person kills Daria Nicolod's character, Betty really struggles against the killer. Here is someone who loves Betty, who has fully supported her during her new career, which is actually the mother's shape in Betty's life because her mother is dead. Imagine how terrible it would be to lose your true mother and then see a woman who is the closest thing to her mother to get an eyeball. <br /> <br /> I could go ... but I didn't. The main point of what I say is that Betty's character is much more complicated than most of the reviewers here who agree to admit it. <br /> <br /> Opera is one of Argento's best ... and not just for visual images (although they're really great) and not just invented murders (though they are). There is a deep depth ... and attention needs to be paid.
