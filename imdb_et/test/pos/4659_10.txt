I have no idea what the budget of this movie was, but whatever it was, it worked! I've seen movies that spend 100 times the amount (Pearl Harbor someone?) And wondered 200 times worse. This movie has it all. David "Makin" This "Naughton is a leading role in Adam, an average college student who arrives at a game called" Big AllNighter "headed by Leon! This guy tends to" genius "having nothing better to do than to come with a complex game to play a lot of people but he does not just choose his friends, he has jocks, nerds, fatties, middle kids and of course the flounder team who are "bad guys." This film has no black and white color. Gray has many shades: Adam is not an altruistic hero with no mistakes, and he treats Alex P. as a mess. Jocks plays dirty, but so everyone else! This movie tends to! Scene PBR factory? Classic! "Johnny's obese male?" Can you write a better idea? the stuff is golden from the second generation of Jerry! GOLD! but I love movies that seem far removed but still have roots. It never happened ... but it can be. Easter Bunny Oh, and see that young Paul Rubens is still working on it Pee wee character. PS This Devra Clinger was / is hot! He must be one bad actor who no longer worked in Hollywood. Watch this movie!
