The first of five St Trinian films (although the latter is usually downgraded) is based on the characters of the artist Ronald Searle's schoolgirls and has a wonderful Alastair Sim, such as Millicent Fritton, director, and her own brother. Much of humor is dated, but curiously touching and outrageous in today's computer world - girls drink, play, smoke and later sell rich Arabs, but always be held accountable by bureaucrats, police, judges and other agency data they harass in England. Perhaps because movies are so regularly seen on television, St Trinians still inspire fancy dresses and club nights. The films have recurring characters that include PC Ruby Gates (Joyce Grenfell) and Flash Harry (George Cole). The predecessor of the entire series is the charming film "Your Happy Days of Your Life" (1950).
