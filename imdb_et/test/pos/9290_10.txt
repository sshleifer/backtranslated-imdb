This exhibition is endless fun. The first joke makes the pants wet. And this is probably the weakest joke of all of them. I started to look at it when the second half of the second season started ventilation. and right now. I'm hooked. only 2 weeks after starting viewing. I've downloaded episodes and bought DVDs. Recurring clips such as Ad Road Test and current affairs are quiet fun. Then there is the ad they take "Use Emo. Use your tears for more effective use" It is also funny in politics. There's nothing wrong with them. it's funny. All Australians who can't find it funny. Don't talk and don't look at it. ALL Australia TUNE IN Wednesday AT 9 ON ABC
