I start with responsibility: this movie is not recommended for anyone who has no interest or never played before FF7. The film builds on the audience's knowledge of the nature of each game to convey story to plot elements. And it does it very delicately. Do your homework before watching this wonderful CG movie and I promise it will be so much better. <br /> <br /> With this in mind, this film has some of the most prominent CG sequences I've ever seen. The entire experience seemed to be a very long FMV sequence for steroids. Yes, yes. The attention to detail in each scene, especially in the case of heavy activities, is so impeccable that I left with awe. <br /> <br /> I believe that the audio track is simplified to help the audience focus on animation more than music. Again, for those who know the story and background of the FF7, music should not surprise anyone (although the timing and layout of each soundtrack consists of the point of each scene and mood where music simply increases animation). <br /> <br /> Once again, I played only through FF7, enjoying this topic thoroughly from Square Enix. And it feels in most scenes, choreographed and organized. Like dance. <br /> <br /> In short, if you enjoyed music or Final Fantasy 7, this movie will get you out of the water. If you are unlucky in the majority of those who are not experienced in the Playstation or PC, known as FF7, it will exponentially increase the experience before watching a movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, I just want to mark the quality of animation of this movie. The characters move smoothly. The background of each scene lives and speaks its story. For those who criticize the story's airiness and addiction, I invite you to review the animation. Facial reactions, subtle hints that lead to a story above the usual method of storing the plot for entertainment. <br /> <br /> Square Enix and Big Tetsuya Nomura have created a new bar for high quality animation and storytelling. Advent Children have begun CG animations with the new era, allowing each character to hide the jokes in volume as well as inside. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Square Enix. Waiting was worth it.
