Amazing comedy-drama about friendship powers. Despite being the same title as the 1939 film, it is likely to be compared to sex and the city. I do not compare it completely. The story begins with Mary (Meg Ryan), who seems to be the envy of most women, she is happily married, has a good daughter, big friends and a big home. But Mary's perfect life is not what she feels when she discovers that her husband is deceiving her with Zach's crystal (Eve Mendes). Mary is puzzled and doesn't know what to do. But his four good friends, Sylvia (Annette Bening), Edie (Debra Messing) and Alex (Jada Pickett Smith) are trying to be there in any case there. I don't want to give up anymore. But I found it enjoyable and I'm a man. Meg Ryan is great, it's nice to see him on the screen again after the flop. And the rest is excellent, including Eve Mendes as a crystal. Just an enjoyable light comedy.
