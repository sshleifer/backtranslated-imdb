I saw the movie in 1972 and like the other people who commented on it ... I went back many times to see it again and again ... I think 9 times in total. Just how wonderful I would describe it ... I took the soundtrack, beautiful panoramas in the south of France, the lifestyle the kids started themselves. The ideal way to live is what they had created ... of course, the powers that must intervene, but if I forget that part, I think I want to be in the movie and live like that! So good it is now available on DVD ... it wasn't for years! <br /> <br /> TLW
