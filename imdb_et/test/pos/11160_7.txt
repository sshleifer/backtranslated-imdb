It is not hard to imagine what the main problem of the scriptwriter is who wants 18 equally well written characters about the same amount of screen time in a movie that takes about 90 minutes. It is almost impossible not to fall back on stereotypes, as does the writer-director Ralf Westhoff. Very few characters can be recognized as people you and I know in real life, many of them are simply characterized by two or three attributes and remain vague. I am aware of this, but I think that "Shoppen" is a success, namely that it will achieve exactly what it wants. It is a very well-written dialogue with the film, a very good example and a movie that very often made me laugh. I don't think this film would like to do a thorough analysis of loneliness in our modern society, or that it wants to be a quick acquaintance with moral commentary. It is a film about what exists and people and their motivation to use it. Funny and fun.
