In the last ten minutes of this extraordinary television I was like an idiot. I must say that the idea of ​​sitting for 90 minutes, which was supposed to be a frustrating material on Sunday, was not welcome. The thought of one more, worthy, winning opportunity for BAFTA did not comfort me ...... But the end result knocked me 6. This is some of the best TVs I've seen in age. I had the impression that all the originality had left the BBC's drama department for years. Our friends in Northern Estonia were the last product that really blew me and it was 10 years ago. But faith is restored and honor is satisfied. David Tenant was incredible! So many of the actors I think would have gone to the city in this part, but I never saw Tenant as an actor or a doctor, but I saw Alan Hamilton. I have not taken this heart off as much as Daniel Craigs did these Geordie Peacock all these years ago. The Sarah parish was also incredible and I hope that this role will play a role in the future. All the cast was big, but special attention should be paid to the director who really put us in Alan's head. In particular, the toaster made the scene feel harsh.
