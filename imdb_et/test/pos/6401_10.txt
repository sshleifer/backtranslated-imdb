We all seem to agree. It was a magnificent exhibition and gave death before time is up. I've decided that if I really enjoy the show, it's often a kiss of death. I love peculiar, ensemble cast exhibitions and a great setting always helps. I really expected to see a lot of these stars in other television productions, but the short Mariska Hagartay, who played Fisher Stephen's crazy girlfriend, I haven't seen many of them except at home. Shame. <br /> <br /> Key West, North Exposition, Gilmore Girls, and Veronica Mars ... all great exhibitions, all gone sadly before their time. <br /> <br /> Listen, loud and clear, we want Key West on DVD ..... please.
