I watched the movie about 13 years ago, living in Airlie Beach Qld Australia. I had found a small store on the shelves behind it, most of which didn't bother to browse. <br /> <br /> I think I found it and looked at it with one day of ownership and status. in my collection. I don't have it yet, but one day. <br /> <br /> I like the concept of poetry and fantasy. Half of the abandoned street scenes, with a busy city of knowledge in the background, were added to the visual effect. <br /> <br /> I've repeatedly mentioned this movie to people who enjoy this genre, but not just praise. That's my mind and long time. <br /> <br /> I fully recommend this movie, but only for those of this type. <br /> <br /> This comment and LA, CA can help you watch this movie. Comments may be negative, but I found them to be positive when you look at the tendency.
