Even if you do not usually want to enjoy documentaries, the probability is that this one is interesting. Not only does it contain a well-mapped plot that is easily traceable but contains interesting detours; it also has a very strong emotional resonance, not one based on a simple, specific tone. Instead, the emotions here are as deep and worrying as the seas. <br /> <br /> By saying this, if you don't know anything about Donald Crowhurst and the 1968 single-player boat game around the world ... as it was for me ... please stop reading and rent / watch this movie. <br /> <br /> FOLLOWING SPOILERS <br /> <br /> My friend Brian suggested this at the same time that my aunt sent me a clip that connects this movie with Antonion's work. Antonion's movies are still there! To connect this movie to Antonion, I think it's a bit of a stretch, which is most likely to be featured in one of Michaelangelo's Francoise Moitessier de Cazalet. It's funny on the IMDb's main page, it's not even in the "self" list, which is probably the function of its longer name, not its self-realization / abandonment. As Moitessier goes out of the race, it could be considered a bit like L'Avventura Anna. Pretty big minor character. <br /> <br /> Although there is a lot of love for this movie, the actual frame of time, the stoic best friend, the screaming forty's power, walked with a simple connection. Man, really at sea. There have been times in my life when I don't know how I got to such a point, between dreams and reality, feeling as if I was a stranger on my skin. It may be that I read this documentary too much and that the directors read Crowhurst too much, but I found it binding in the sense of other secrets kept in this film. <br /> <br A strange opportunity that Crowhurst's husband (who seemed to have a remarkable study with reasonably contradictory records) and his children (both young people who found the recorded material and still young at this late date in their pain and pride as their father), am sure there are comments here and the film itself is not capable of the man your father was. But when he dies, he has given the world a glimpse of the lost myth, he is a pre-GPS Odyssey. Never does his body find the air of insecure immortality, not the growth of the cosmic nature he had written. <br /> <br /> This movie sticks with you after watching as you expect another twist in deep waters. Or at least you expect the Moitessier sequel. <br /> <br /> Thurston's Hunger 8/10
