The ABC version of the late Pope's life: They just put it just over the CBS version, and it may have suffered, but the program itself was great. It was moving fast because it was only two hours (including the time with ads) to cover this long man's long life, but Thomas Kretschmann was excellently challenged. He did a remarkable job of conveying emotions and conflicts that John-Paul, unlike CBS, had a biological role from young to old age and managed to seem "realistic" at both ends of the scale. His credibility has never deteriorated. It has an amazing choice and depth. It is a shame that the program could not be longer and more detailed, but working for the time they had, I think they did a great job of bringing it to a small screen.
