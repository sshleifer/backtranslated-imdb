Clint Eastwood plays a wounded Union soldier, found by a girl from Confederate Internship, and has been taken back to health and looked after the Confederate soldiers. It seems that there are female folk motives in this place. Geraldine Paige, Director, justifies her not being a confederate and even her cousin. Of course, if a man can get to know him better, he becomes a pretty woman's husband and does a lot of rounds, but when he breaks, he gets really spoiled, actually so bad that he is breaking his leg, but that is, of course, for himself, not punishment. Things go a little further, although some women don't get what they want. I have not seen it for years and still have some certainty that according to today's standards it is still rather strange. Not typical of Eastwood. If you haven't seen it, it's worth seeing. 8 out of 10.
