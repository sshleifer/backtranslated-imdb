Ignore before my comment. The exhibition is a comic genius, the least undervalued show ever. 3 reasons. Cause 1, setbacks are fun for those who care if they don't have a story in any way, they make me laugh so hard that it's painful and isn't it a good comedy program idea? Humans who think it's not funny are not having a sense of humor. Who cares if they are random, its a.v. Show, you can do whatever you like and people say it is not realistic, nor is it a cartoon, its animated. Reason 2, jokes are simply generally fun, Seth McFarlane and other writers are funny funny, all from Star Wars references to celebrities, I love them all. And the reason 3, the story is just brilliant and funny, they made all the jokes with their madness and resentment, even more fun. <br /> <br /> I got this one late night at BBC2 and has never gone back, I have all 7 seasons, plus the movie thing (Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story), I have several t-shirts, a poster and my The collection is still growing. I've never got any set of TV shows, but it was so funny that I just had to get everything. Just look for the 3rd season and trust me to live the life, more fun show ever created, and I hope it never stops!
