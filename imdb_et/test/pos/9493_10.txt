I watched a few episodes of this series with very bad VHS tapes that I recorded in the series. I'm glad I did it. <br /> <br /> Ramona is based on Beverly Cleary's children's books and follows an eight-year title (Sarah Polley). He's having fun with friends and family and gets into trouble like many eight-year-olds. All ten episodes are pretty good. "Mystery Meal" attributes me to vegan, but it's funny when parents try to eat their kids cow language! And any episode that mentions Godzilla Versus Smog Monster twice cannot all be bad. I also like "Ramona's bad day". Although it is uncomfortable that Ramona looks through a harsh day, she depicts herself as a revenge against her friend Howie's Uncle (pre-Psi Factor Barclay Hope) who always tempts her. "Perfect Day" is also good. <br /> <br /> Lori Chodos is playing with Beez, Ramona's sister. I swear I saw something else, but IMDb doesn't show anything except this show. Unfortunately, this is not a series of DVDs. Why is every funny show on these days made on DVDs, except for something I really want to buy? Injustice once there was!
