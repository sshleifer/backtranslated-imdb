Maverick's director Seijun Suzuki was finally able to film his dream project "Princess Raccoon" and so happy that she didn't try it in the 1960s. Special effects and computer graphics made this production easier to achieve than old film mats. <br /> <br /> Some movies about Japanese history and theater traditions are helpful to enjoy this movie. Knowing Shakespeare's "Tempest" would help Peter Greenaway's dense "Prospero books". These two films have some in common, though "Princess Raccoon" is much more colorful and easier to see for someone without a background to fully understand it. <br /> <br /> Although art design, acting, and direction are fine for most movies, this viewer seems to end up in the last third of the movie. Most of the interesting kits have already been introduced and the camera seems to want to go back to the more filmed performance. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a unique movie experience and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in movie shows. It is not really meant for children, though nothing will disturb them. If the last third were better, I would have given him nine stars.
