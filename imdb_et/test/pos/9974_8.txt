"Venetian merchant" is one of Shakespeare's best-known exhibitions and is still done regularly in the theater. Incredibly, this film seems to be the first English version of cinema rather than television. In the UK or America, several versions were made at the beginning of the cinema, but they were all silent. <br /> <br /> The cause of negligence in this game may be related to the sensitivity to the alleged antisemitism of the game, an issue that has been even more sensitive to Nazi power in 1933. (This may explain why all earlier versions were made during the silent era; in 1908 or 1922 it would have been easier to portray Shylock as a direct frog if it were today). But in my opinion the film is not anti-Semitic at all. It should be remembered that during the lifetime of Shakespeare there was no permanent Jewish community in England; The Jews were expelled by Edward I at the end of the 13th century and were not allowed to return until Cromwell, about forty years after the death of Shakespeare. We know that Shakespeare never traveled abroad, so it seems quite possible that he did not personally know any Jews or experienced the effects of anti-Semitism. The game is not just a Jewish issue, but is also an analysis of the corrosive effects of religious prejudices. In fact, it may be a coded study of the mutual antipathy of Catholics and Protestants in Tudor England (which Shakespeare would certainly have had for the first time) and a desire for greater tolerance between them. <br /> <br Then, as traditional, traditional anti-Semitic stereotypes were always Jewish, but Shylock's main sin is not greed; if that were the case, he would certainly have agreed to Bassanio's offer to pay him six thousand ducks, twice the amount borrowed by Antonio. Rather, Shylock's innocent hatred and the root of his anger are the way he and his compatriots are treated with the Christians of Venice. Not only are Jews generally regarded as second-class citizens, but Jewish monetary matters such as Shylock are particularly targets of abuse, even if the services they provide are necessary for the Venetian economy. The game shows the damaging effects of prejudices. Not only do these types of views corrupt the Christians who hold them, but they can also corrupt abusive Jews. Shylock's honesty is totally disproportionate to the lies he has been given. Targeting him and calling him a dog, Antonio behaves like a hungry bigot, but nervousness and hopelessness are not generally regarded as crimes worthy of death. What's more, Shylock is trying to avenge Antonio not only for the undoubted lies that Antonio has done for him, but also for all the false and imaginary lies he has suffered in the Christian community, such as his daughter's marriage. Lorenzole. <br /> <br /> The film director Michael Radford and his star Al Pacino have the credit to understand all these issues. At first, Pacino Shylock has some angry human dignity towards him, who gradually gives way to honest rage and finally, after his humiliation in the trial of Portia's reasoning for sin. We clearly see that he has been a tool for his own destruction, but we can still put him in compassion. In my opinion, none of Pacino's performances I've seen have ever equalized what he gave in the first two "godfather" films (not the "woman smell" for which he won the Oscar, and certainly not "godfather"), but " The Venetian merchant is the one closest to these criteria. In another performance that seemed to be eye-catching, Lynn Collins was luminous by Portia, speaking her lines very clearly and simply, pointing out intelligence and ingenuity that makes her character more than just a romantic heroine. I was less impressed by Jeremy Ironi Antonio, who seemed too passive. Antonio is a complex character; part of a loyal friend, part of a melancholic contemplative, partly religious metropolis and partial entrepreneurial capitalist. Although the irons pulled the first two of these aspects, it was hard to imagine that his Antonio wouldn't spit on another religion or threaten everyone in his risky ventures. <br /> <br /> Radford's interpretation of the game was attacked by the Daily Telegraph film critic, who, despite Pacino's presentation, disliked the setting of the period and claimed that Shakespeare should be placed in a modern environment if it is "relevant" to the modern audience, citing a recent performance that brought Weimar to Germany. I do not fully agree with this approach. Theater and cinema are quite different media, and although there have been some striking modernist approaches to Shakespeare in the cinema (remembering Trevor Nun's twelfth night), the traditional approach is often the best. (For example, I preferred Zeffirelli 'Romeo and Julia' Baz Luhrmann). The idea that we can only appreciate Shakespeare's contemporary design is purely intellectual laziness; we are not prepared to make efforts to see our greatest writer in the context of Elizabeth's society that made him, but rather prefers him as a man of the twentieth century in ersatz. <br /> <br /> Radford's traditional approach not only allows us to understand that bigotria and honesty are old, universal issues, but also a visually striking film. In the game, the scenes in Venice are characterized by turbulent action; those in Portia's country house in Belmont are happier and more peaceful. In the film, the images of Venice's external images were photographed in a blurry, winter-gray sky, similar to the look "Don't look now". In a candlelight d√©cor, illuminated by dark backgrounds, Caravaggio reminiscent of the effect of chiaroscuro; I suspect it was quite deliberate because Caravaggio was a modern Shakespeare. In contrast to the dark or foggy Venice, the Belmont scenes (fascinated by the Palladia villa on the lake island) were characterized by sunshine or a peaceful moonlight. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Shakespeare adjustments of recent years; an intelligent and visually attractive look for a challenging game. 8/10 <br /> <br /> Few bugs. There is a black swan in the water in front of Portia House. These birds are Australian indigenous peoples and were not brought to Europe until 1596 when the film was designated. Portia's portrait is also painted in a pencil-styled Florentine Botticelli style, active for about a century before that date. Lynn Collins may recall the beauty of Botticelli, but it seems unlikely that a late 16th-century Venetian lady would have painted at the end of the 15th century in Florence.
