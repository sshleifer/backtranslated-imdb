It can't be very well appreciated because I can't say I liked it. But this is the story that disturbed me, not the realization of the film. Functional, leading, atmospheric, music were all good. It's just that after you see a lot of people doing things you can't really relate to, the movie ends. It is educative in that it shows the horror of war that you see at home and how you don't need to feel the feelings at all and still be strong, but that's it. <br /> <br /> The plot's duration is a few years, when the poet Dylan Thomas is under the roof of a former former girlfriend. He is married, brings his wife and later the child, while ex (Knightley) marries another man. But there are tensions, Dylan himself is obsessed with the jerk and the new husband comes back from the war with PTSD. Add some pretty temperate characters and you have your hands full. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: You have to be in a movie like mood. The difficult part is to define this mood. I don't think I've been there yet. Never. So it's probably better for adults to watch strange complicated human behavior and perhaps curiosity about Dylan Thomas.
