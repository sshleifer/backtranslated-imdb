"Comanche Moon" had done all this. For starters, Simon Wincer is a man named after a high-quality television west. Unfortunately, "Moon" problems are something that the most talented director could not solve: a bad script based on an uneven novel. <br /> <br /> Forget about historical accuracy - as every novelist says, "Moon" is the biggest traverse of the novel, not even in line with the original "Loneome Dove" masterpiece information. So many wonderful, rich moments in ministries, and even more so in the book "Moonis" are completely lost. Given that most of the "moon" viewers are likely to have at least some "Dove" background, the lack of character and emotional backlog is completely painful. <br /> <br /> This means that "Moon" is one example where a customized version would have been and should have been changed to make it more suitable for the screen. For example, the novel "Moon" focuses heavily on Comanches. Credit card minicomputers are serviced by Comanzsi, but in the end they give them enough that the viewer will just feel they have left a significant part of the story. Similarly, Val Kilmer Scull also loses here - the role should have been expanded so that Kilmer (and Rachel Griffiths, in this matter) actually had something to do, or the roles should have been reduced to smaller, supportive parts. Instead, Kilmer gets the most bill for that character that just leaves you scratching your head after it is completely odd in the final act. <br /> <br /> The movie has strange moments that just don't understand those who haven't read the book (killer parrot? What?) - there is no scene to show us that speech and McCrae are some wonderful Texas travelers, whom they claim to be. None of their expeditions in Moon (or "Dead Man's Walk") will end successfully, and Call and McCrae will simply stand out through one meaningless mission after another. <br /> <br /> Frankly, Larry McMurtry should never give a script writing job and this was only thanks to this other cowboy movie, Brokeback Mountain. McMurtry can write good novels (although there is some discrepancy over the consistency of this statement), but he has never created a scriptwriter. This production would have benefited not only from the return of director Wincer, but from the original screenwriter Bill Wittcliff to adjust the novel to the screen. Witcliff does not have the material material to write on his screen, but no one can deny that he did a fantastic job under the original "Loneome Dove". All of this said, "Comanche Moon" is an almost brilliant production, assisted by a terrible amount, which, unfortunately, is simply not given enough to do. Steve Zahn's image of Gus McCraest - or rather his depiction of Robert Duval as Gus McCrae - is dead. And while some have criticized Karl Urban as Woodrow's speech, saying that his presentation does not mimic the silent, stoic original Woodrow, I can say that McMurtry is guilty because McMurtry is the one - both "Moon" novels and now mini devices - Woodrow changed the socially incorrect, uncomfortable but natural guide to some emotional character whose lines are only dull and whose character motivation is only clear if you have seen them "follow". <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is the "moon" light that remained from the minisites with the same melancholic feeling that I felt I was watching the original "Loneome Dove" - ​​this time because I realized that this was probably the last time we see that these characters will appear on the screen for a long, long time - and quite frankly, it would be cast in such a well-maintained, full-fledged online TV series. All in all, the wasted opportunity that has been cast is bi The most difficult thing is that the original Loneome Dove novel contained so much rich background information for those characters who would have been very exciting in translating the screen. Unfortunately, all that McMurtry is annoying, inconsistent, and ultimately irrelevant is prequel neglected.
