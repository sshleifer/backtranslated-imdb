Having seen most of Coen Brothers' previous films, I waited for something else and to a small extent from the center. OBWAT is definitely these things, but it also has the same heart as ... being as big as Mississippi. This is one of the most enjoyable films that have come out in recent times, intelligent, well-designed, smart and excellently. <br /> <br /> Characters are featured by a host of great actors. George Clooney completely won me the look and character of Clark Gable. Having only seen him in three kings and his thin red line, I am now a fan. For more comedy please George. <br /> <br /> John Tuturro and Tim Blake Nelson ably assist, especially Nelson. Once the "The Simpsons" have been made for the film, it must be natural to play Cletus, a jaw jaw. I don't think there is great performance in the whole performance. My special favorite is Stephen Root as a blind radio station person. <br /> <br /> Great old-fashioned music, Clooney's jig dance that I try to learn, and a sense of depression in the South. Sepia-like photography makes it the best film I've seen in this century. The only drawback to this movie is that it has almost broken me into buying a soundtrack, DVD and DVD player to play ... it's good! <br /> <br />
