"Pixote: Lei do Mais Fraco" deals with what is probably the greatest of all Brazilian themes: poverty. And with poverty, other unnatural feelings and activities that it brings; prostitution, violence, crime, rape and murders. Brazil is a paradox state and its social problems are everywhere. The difference between the rich and the poor; beautiful and ugly; happiness and deepest human degradation. <br /> <br /> "Pixote" is one of the films that dares to touch and open up such painful wounds, and does it without the slightest shine of hope, in the imagination. a country that, like Pixote itself, has already disappeared.
