I remember the time when the only thing that was there with clubs, drug pubs and parties. This movie came out a few years after I started the club game. If I had never discovered that this film was reasonable for me. That night, when I first looked at it, I was completely blown up with a companion. I had never watched a movie that would be so close to the reality where I was at that time in my life. Almost everything I could touch in some way. There was never one character that would be wholly or partly related to all of them. My companions, where there is no difference and I remember all of us, saying that they where we are or where we are. We had all done this weekend exactly what the team did in HT. We're coming down when we looked and when the movie came down, I remember I came a little further. it was pretty frustrating at the low points in our room. It's so good about human traffic. it really concerns the whole situation. <br /> <br /> This unique film in the way it is not drawn, but then it is not entirely characteristic, although the characters are important. it seemed always based on situations. Situations as a group and as individuals. Every character loses their lives for their own reasons. but each of them responds to the disappearance in the same way. work with any work to make money for the weekend and get away. give them their holiday. But the reality is if you really can't. Another situation they all face. <br /> <br /> I and my companions who are no different from these men. We all had our own things. People's traffic helped us explain what we didn't understand about ourselves. It does this in a way that doesn't tell you. It made us feel that we were not the only ones who were there with us and that the lessons that many others, all over the world, had gone through. only when my lifestyle changed from a party popper to a career, would I fully understand this film. these days i look at HT now and then (as i am just) and remember old days. No other film can do it. I was a peter popper, I was a jip travolta, I ever went to my chosen family land. i would have $ 200 for my back burner and i wax a lot! Do not worry!
