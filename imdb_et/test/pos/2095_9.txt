The third film I could watch at the film's film festival was the wonderful Japanese drama. After leaving prison, the nine escaped convicts intend to find the "key of the universe" spoken by the ten convicts who did not leave. Along the way we all know these men quite well. Each has its own dreams. Most of the film seems to be mostly comedy, but there is a change that the film comes to a tragedy. All actors give great performances. I can't say much more without breaking a movie, but it's enough to say that you feel like some of these people. After 2 hours, this movie is long and long, but still good. I have no penalties to suggest that he has violent violence in his conscience. At that time, Toshiaki Toyoda hit home and it makes me want to search for my previous movies and look forward to seeing my future movies. <br /> <br /> My degree: A
