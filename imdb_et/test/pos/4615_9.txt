In September, I saw the Toronto International Film Festival 2:37 and it was blown away! The Panic Scene opens this film at 12:37, which is located in Adelaide High School. This scene is left unresolved when we return to the beginning of the day and introduce the teenagers to the school. The public becomes intimate with every major character and examines the topical issues of teenagers, including drugs, intolerance, gays, bullying and violence. Each scene is played over and over again from a variety of teenagers' point of view and resembles the elephant of Gus Van Sant. This is a remarkable first time film director Murali K. Thalluri. It was done with non-professional students and was developed through an unprecedented 76 draft script. It includes a number of student actors, especially in the role of Teresa Palmer Melody. This birthday movie is as intimate as the thought-provoking and disturbing end.
