How do you know if the movie is good or not? This is an effect for you that will change it. "Dead Man Walking" bothered me a lot. I looked at it twice. I don't know if I'm strong enough to look at it again. No, I didn't know it at all, but the film was as successful as it was. <br /> <br /> Robbins did an excellent job of engaging in all aspects of this controversial topic. He refrained from arguing, which could easily be seen as biased or subjective. I hope many people see "Dead Man Walking". I believe that anyone who supports or is so keen on the death penalty should see the film. <br /> <br /> I don't know what else could be done to convince everyone that this era of relics is no longer a place in today's society. <br /> <br /> The film itself does not provide an argument against or against the death penalty. It describes reality. Reality is the best argument against the death penalty. <br /> <br /> 10/10 for great performances, good movie making and the most important film of the years <br /> <br /> Thank you, Tim Robbins! <br /> <br />
