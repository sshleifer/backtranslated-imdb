Henri-Georges Clouzot's film is a silent example of a French cinema. A film between the realism and the magic of post-war cinema and the symbolism of the nouvelle. With some places in American classic films (but not imitating), the director tells us the story of love, crime and the importance of points of view. We also find great actors (Suzy Delair is impeccable). <br /> <br /> It is also interesting how we can find aspects of today's movie. The legacy of Quai des Orf√®res is known in the Woody Allen tradition. Bringing the crime to a scenic environment. The naive ending is also typical of Steven Spielberg's good films. Finally, I would like to point out that the dance flow is felt during photography between Jenny Lamouri (Suzy Delair) and Dora Monier (Simone Renant), where the first admits that she thinks her husband is unfaithful and exactly with a woman who takes pictures of her. This scene is exactly the same as Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts (Mike Nichols, 2004).
