It's awesome! Ill and twisted story of coincidence and fraud. <br /> <br /> The story has been carefully and inventively built. It's really a perfect blend: it's all from tension to humor, and the story is told a lot about originality ... The movie is built like a puzzle that is put together in pieces and solves the story ... there are many surprises to the end of the viewer !! I also had a little impression that the director was inspired by some of Hitchcock's work. I've already seen movies where you see the same event from different perspectives, but this movie goes beyond that. In this film, everything is built on what happens to the body that appears and disappears and appears again in another place. Every actor in the story has a secret and we can realize it in a way that helps to put together the puzzle .... I loved the dark dark humor scenes ... that smiled at the whole theater .... This movie must be visible to everyone!
