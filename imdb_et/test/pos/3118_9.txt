I first saw this movie on television in 1959 when I was eight years old. I didn't know anything about it from the West, but I recognized Ben Johnson's movie "Mighty Joe Young". What attracted me to "The Carnage Artist" were the great songs of "Pioneer Sons". Merian C. Cooper, who produced the film, was the first to order original music for a particular scene and to create contemporary movie music. Cooper hired Max Steiner to create the mood of his classic King King. Later, Steiner won an Oscar for the topic "Came from the Wind". Cooper was also a "Mighty Joe Young" producer. When you remember, the music was important to a monkey who responded only to Stephan Foster's "Beautiful Dreamer". "Wagon Master". Of all Ford's famous West, it's my favorite, which includes my brother Francist and sullen Janes Arnes.
