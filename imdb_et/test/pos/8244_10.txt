I have to say that I know Mister Ã–rnn's documentary and I knew I was making a very good documentary film. I was not disappointed. History nerdina - I saw hundreds of documentaries and liked the different approach of this work. <br /> <br /> The director and his 17 consultants (historians, veteran families) sought access to the reality of gallipol through the soldering stars of both sides. So, British, Australian and Turkish soldiers follow the history. <br /> <br /> Wonder that Jeremy Irons and Sam Neill are this document - so the intensity and emotionality of this documentary is enhanced by its great voice. > <br /> I saw this movie in Dolby Surround Italian cinema. I bought a DVD last year and look forward to 3-7 years for this talented director's next work and his very good documentaries. <br /> <br /> Summary: Well done. Strong. History with emotions - a great documentary in the documentary of war
