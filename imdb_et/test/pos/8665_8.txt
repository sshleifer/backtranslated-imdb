It seems that we should recognize the Scandinavian cinema more than just the movement of Dogma 1995, which Denmark has cooked all these years ago. Den Brysomme Mannen or an English worshiper is a surreal and deeply thoughtful film that is deeply fun and meaningful both on and under the surface. As a film alone, it is a scary comedy about society and attitudes in the postmodern world in which we live; The world that decides by both people has reached Norwegian regions and so on. But with this black comedy, it seems that the film looks a little deeper and at least gives me the questions of metaphorical religious spaces and our human instinct that we would want to discover the truth about so many materials in our world that maybe it seems strange to us. <br /> <br /> It was really a fantastic introduction to today's Norwegian cinema. The film falls into this category of European art cannons surrounded by very deep themes and ambiguity, while maintaining an open finale and not so much a narrative as a process of events that can mean one thing or another. So many times we have seen movies using The Bothersome Man, and so many times it has become a close predictable routine that revolves around a detective story or a chase story, or something like that, but this movie allows it to be set and a situation where his main character Andreas (Fausa Aurvaag) examines who he is; where he is and what are the secrets behind this location. <br /> <br /> The device I am talking about means that the hero arrives in advance to remember or what happened before. I'm going to jump and say it's in my opinion dead and sent to some sort of purgatory like all the townspeople. All the townspeople with whom Andreas mixes are of the same age; the same way of thinking and the same attitude that tells me that most of them are victims of suicide and have been sent to a treatment plant that has no emotion, feeling, color or, most importantly, pain. <br /> <br /> When we first see Andreas, he will get out of the bus, which he will discover later in his abilities, and approach the petrol station somewhere in the countryside. She's dirty and she's got a big beard, but she's going to be in the opposite direction, with sport and tie. a clean shaved face and her own home with a new job where the film makes one of the best changes between the countryside and the city I've ever seen. But the new job and the new city are restless; you can take breaks if you want; bosses are unusually cool and there just seems to be no emotion or reaction to anything. These ideas are best suited for cinema, when Andreas, who is still a relative of the city, is crying and is clearly affected by the film that is being shown, but everyone else is facing the rock. It is also a prime example of a man jumping out of a window and lying on some studs, but everyone walks without noise. <br /> <br /> Backing up your idea to anyone who is already dying and the city is acting as a clean-up, death, and harm in general is impossible. Especially the nasty scene is related to the electronic paper guillotine and someone's thumb, but everyone's reaction to the event is in front of the stone and it grows back within an hour. Similarly, suicide attempts on trains will not come later, and instead we will get a point of view on how to drag on your side of the pipeline. The city is a barrier, a painless society where a masochistic need for self-harm is impossible; a place where sexual relations can develop and break equally, but under both emotional and passionate circumstances; a place where people can try suicide, but it's actually impossible to die. The city accepts these powers because the damage has already been done in real life, and so the movie says you can't kill yourself twice, indeed, you can't feel the pain or emotion in the cleaning stations. <br /> <br /> But the best part of the movie is what strikes you. Judging by the side-opening of the film for five minutes and the music coming from another man's house, it seems that the space that the film dictates in "sky" and "hell" is a good line. We only see these spaces very, very briefly? so briefly that they consist of one picture. "Heaven" is a colorful kitchen where music and children are played: it offers life, hope, emotion and happiness, while hell is snowy somewhere that haunts you through its hopeless structure and fear. Introducing these two spaces at the end of the film suddenly tells you the reality of Andreas and co. Faced with: Cleansing and all that was involved wasn't Andreas ready for life and his free-spirited, adventurous mind? and see where the thinkers come.
