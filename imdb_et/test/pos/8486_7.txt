I saw Ray when he first came out. Why? Partly because of advertising advertising, secondly because I just loved the hell of Ray Charles music. But if it wasn't around when his biggest stuff in music and his life happened, I wanted to know more about the life of the person. And in this movie I did. His addiction to drugs was something I didn't know, and the film tells us. <br /> <br /> But here it is, even though it was a decent autobiographical film ... I can't say it's a "big" movie. I've seen "Malcolm X" and blown away. The same goes for "What Loves To Do" and "Bird". The performances of all these films were outstanding. I was not limited to the main characters of films that made incredible jobs, but also around them. This will help me take the picture. <br /> <br /> I felt that the emotional appeal of some of this movie was low and difficult. And yes, I admit to the movie in some parts almost asleep. And the movie was too long. And the film missed several important details of Ray Charles's life that would have made the film better. The film got me nervous in certain parts. And the film seemed to be fun, not a bang - certain parts, including the end I played as a "Lifetime" cable network movie. I'm looking forward to more cinema. <br /> <br /> So - where's my ambivalence? Jamie Foxx's performance. Generally he did - okay. Not Denzel Washington's Malcolm X or Angela Bassett's Tina Turner remarkable, but ... okay. and in others - thanks to the magnificent corners and lighting of the camera - he saw Ray Charles. But I paid attention ... to action. The actor must believe you are the character he is playing. Don't create a cartoon character. Did I believe Jamie Foxx was Ray on the screen? Sometimes yes - sometimes not. <br /> <br /> Does Jamie Foxx Deserve Golden Globe? You betcha. Does he deserve an Oscar ...? Depends on who he is. He has some big competitors there and he can just point them out. But then again ... maybe not. If Jamie Foxx does not win, I will not stand or say "he was abducted". I especially feel that he had been. <br /> <br /> It was a decent movie with decent performances and a decent story. "Big" autobiographical film about late Ray Charles? No. Somewhere out there, I feel there is a big movie just waiting for Ray Charles, and an actor who is completely beating you out.
