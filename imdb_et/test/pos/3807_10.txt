I loved this movie, I saw it when I was about 8 years old and almost seven years later, tonight I saw it again. I really thought it was an interesting idea, they were just the one that disturbed me, the end I felt was a cop. 'Round here is hard to find this movie and I was lucky enough to see it in BRAVO. I thought I'd see Drew Barrymore here again!
