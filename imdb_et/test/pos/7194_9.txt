I watched Asterix and Obelix in Operation Cleopatra, which was my first contact with the classic comic strip live version. Like the comic, the whole movie is full of jokes based on the bangs, anachronistic jokes and scents that rarely fall flat. <br /> <br /> Asterix and Obelix are Gauls who use the powerful Potion to fight Roman legions in their native language. Gaul. Here they arrive in Egypt, helping a friend build a Cesar Palace (yes, it's bad) in three months to prove that the Egyptians are as good as the Romans. The reason for this was Monica Belluci's Cleopatra. He's good, but the role is a bit more than a man. But although he is rarely in the film, he doesn't care that it was so clever and so funny that I was hysterical. I love it. I loved it so much that I don't understand why movies have never been published in the United States. <br /> <br /> The Import DVD has a movie in English, which is quite good, especially if you think that if you look at it in a longer French version, the stoppers (and therefore the jokes) are not always obvious because they are phonetic , so if you read the names wrong, the jokes are gone. Most of the jokes between the French version and the shorter English language seem to be exactly the same, although some are sometimes better and sometimes worse. Personally, I stick with the dub when I look at it again, because it's easier to take fun and enjoy humor. <br /> <br /> You really want to see it when you love punch and low eyebrows, but smart humor is a great comedy
