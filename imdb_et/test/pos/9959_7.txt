William Shakespeare's games are categorized by comedy, tragedy or history. Some of his most memorable - and most often read - creations offer us a wretched sense of humor, delicate poetry and a fun stroke. Some of them will survive as unforgettable considerations with compelling depth and gravity. Regardless of this, he was able to write an unparalleled skill and ingenuity, contributing significantly to our young language. What category is the merchant of Venice? I was surprised that this is one of Shakespeare's comedies. I've never read or seen it before, but after watching this latest version of the movie, I've decided it's not and it's both. This is one of the many questions that the viewer has to try to answer when an agreement is reached that is clearly an amazing and deeply disturbing moral tragedy. <br /> <br /> Players are quickly and easily introduced. One of them is Venice itself; director Michael Radford filmed Venice scenes in the real city, creating an impressively vivid and exciting backdrop for the game. The younger Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) enters this landscape and returned to Venice to see an old friend of his old Antonio (Jeremy Irons). It seems that poor Bassanio has heard of a princess whose father is dead and has left a lottery for all kinds of judges. Waiting for a fair lady on the island's property, there are three small strains of which only one contains "princess pictures". Who can guess right, using only dark intuition and mysterious teasers written to them, will be given to the father for a great happiness. Oh, and his daughter and his eternal love for marriage, I forgot to mention. Here, Shakespeare's light comedy film. This fictional plot element drives the story and also fills a large part of the movie's screen time, as the island is filled with painfully enthusiastic opportunists who are humorously competing and unable to earn a very wealthy hand in marriage. But before Bassanio is able to do it calmly, he will oblige Antonio to lend him three thousand ducks to pay for the long journey he has to take to get his prize. <br /> <br /> Antonio, who has almost failed, must reluctantly embrace humility by seeking financial support from Shylock (Al Pacino). city ​​eagerly Christian majority. So they live under the foot of society and here two borrowers have to go. Shylock does not hesitate to remind two men of a case where Antonio insults and puts him in the city market, and he proudly kidnaps the man who, frankly, asked for help. But help him at Shylock. He even deletes any loan interest rate, probably feeling that he has no reason to worry if Antonio can repay him within three months. However, Shylock's contractual demand is the weight of Antonio's chicken if he would give up his consent. This is certainly a worrying application for Antonio and Bassanio as well as for us. But it seems that, despite his legitimate pride, Shylock does not actually see such terrible action. So there is a dramatic basis here. And while the film goes out to explore its more lenient side with the love lottery and the mistaken identity, the gloomy prospect of the loan still worships. Finally, what about this malicious agreement? At the same time, we have been taking turns to explore the true central character of Shylock. Al Pacino has great weights here, and he does it with a convincing blade and passion. There are times when he is given room for the theater we expect from such a colorful actor. But his most impressive scenes are those where he internalizes this energy, showing a contradictory personality: honest, sincere, and proud, but rather despicable, revenge and utterly regrettable. This is one of Pacino's most cordial performances. And while the rest plays its role reliably and convincingly, Pacino is actually the owner of the movie - especially at the end when Shakespeare brings this seemingly romantic comedy to the third act on the wall. <br /> <br /> I don't reveal much here; All I can say is that it includes an initial loan - a powerful shoe that is expected sooner or later. And will never do it. Finally, Shakespeare has raised a number of dilemmas for his audience: seeing unresolved issues of faith, morality, law, and mercy thrown into us through the latest scenes, and while close to the curtain, the playwright's view may seem clear to some, completely contradictory. There are winners and losers in it, but have the winners earned their reasons for a good reason, or have they lost more of their cause? Has the virtue been rewarded or just corrupted? Is justice fair at this time? At the end of the game, some fates are painfully clear and unambiguously closed. But the audience must be the ones who really decide on all those involved. And for some, the judgment is also in play. Comedy or tragedy? The author has gently reflected the intense finale of the courtroom, which has ended with a sense of light and romantic romantic resolutions. Does he say that everything is well, what ends well, or is it his final, ironic condemnation? The humor of the game helps us set up beautifully for such a difficult accident. And while it is, unfortunately, also keeping the Venetian Merchant out of the reach of so many other Shakespeare works, it is still pointless, fun and thought-provoking.
