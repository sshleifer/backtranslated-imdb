Cesar (Alain Chabat) challenges Kleopatra (delicious Monica Bellucci): to prove that the Egyptians are better than the Romans, he allows Cesar to build a castle in three months without any delays. He calls one-handed architect Numerob (Jamel Debbuzi) and gives him two options: to be covered with gold when he performs his mission, or to become a crocodile if he fails. In Numerobi, Panoramix (Claude Rich), Asterix (Christian Clavier), and Obelix (Geraard Depardieu) (with Ideiafix) are asking for help. This movie is very funny, specially for the parts where Obelix and Pirates are involved, led by Red Beard. However, the scriptwriter and director should note that French is not a universal language because English is. So jokes with words (for example, in Austin Power's movies) don't work well for strange people in French. French people and French-speaking people like these jokes definitely like, but they have no idea for me that doesn't speak French. My voice is seven.
