I saw this movie for the first time with my groom several years after it came out. I thought I hated it, but it is so nice to be surprised that it is great. We have spent several hours recreating parts of the movie ("Sylvia ?! Yes, Mickey?" Or "I'm sorry you had to see this baby. Sometimes we see things in this world we don't want."). I finance the cracks every time I imitate the Neils. Music is also classic and fun to sing together, especially on the journey. Of course I don't recognize it for my male friends. It's like innocent pleasure. I'm serious about Dirty Dancing once a month or more and it's always the same good. Jennifer Gray is also so cute in this movie. His too bad his career has never really gone.
