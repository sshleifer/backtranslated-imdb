I know this film has a rather tough journey from critics, but I have to say that I enjoyed it thoroughly. The real star here is the fantastic Dylan Moran. She will never be so fun and convincing in all her diverse disguises. He also succeeds in rushing to a sweet charm that prevents his outrageous training. Particular attention should also be paid to Michael Gambon, who is playing a laugh with the accent of an accurate and yet comic city in Dublin. The only weak link is Caine, who obviously has a big laugh, who grabs it badly. It's probably not good abroad, but it's just as well worth it.
