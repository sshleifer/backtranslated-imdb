I saw the Messiah: - the first killings and I thought it was one of the best programs I've ever seen. It was one of those programs you think oh, no, I can't watch the rest, but you are forced to watch it to see who did it. Jamie Draven was an absolutely amazing actor in this to be able to exchange two completely different characters, one of which was evil, a nasty person who did it, and another person, Jez Clifton, a cop. To do this, I would certainly not have been able to do this, but not without breaking. I love and care about Jamie Draven's whole heart and I always, until the end of time, think Jamie is the world's cutest, sweetest and sexiest man. I also love Jamie's Ultimate Force because he sees god fucking in black black. I like Jamie Love Paula Draven <br /> <br /> -X-
