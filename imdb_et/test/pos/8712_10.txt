Sparkling wine. BB is admiration. He's weird. He's a feminist. He's still in love. <br /> <br /> The film has been in Paris since the 1950s. It's nice to look at places, cars (DS!) And Orly. <br /> <br /> A simple but very enjoyable romantic comedy. Music is terrible. It's almost devastating. On the other hand, it's fun. But this is probably the only thing that is wrong, at least looking at the eyes of the 21st century. <br /> <br /> The film commented on the French way of infidelity. It's a modern feeling. The film like and elefant se trompe enormenent did it in the 80s. But the main assumption remains the same. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the players who offered this opportunity to BB.
