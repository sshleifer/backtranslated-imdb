Hey there, Army Sgt. Sorry, dude, but as a military constitution in the army and national military guards, you won't make a comment on a qualified sea view. You are not seafaring, and just because you wear uniform does not mean you can be connected to the sea. We are just the best, we have the hardest workout, yes, we have great leaders about ourselves, but hey, if you're the best, you want to raise your stuff. I was in the Iraqi invasion and Fallujah. I fought next to the soldiers. You are not "qualified" for "marine environment". I hate to be the one that starts the whole "which branch is better", but you have no right to say that you are qualified to evaluate the sea view. Oh yes ...... we are drilling trainers ....... not drilling SGTs. It's the biggest clue that you have no idea what you're talking about. Yeah, we're not "more of a passion" for recruiters. Tell me, how's someone going to make them better by the sea? How do I hit someone on the sea for a better sea? Yes, this is the childhood camp that I went through. But we are dealing with different times and people. We train people who are wiser than our generations of recruits. We want the brightest recruits, not the cunning ones. And anyone who signs the sea first is committed to being the best that his country offers. We don't have to confirm it at Bootcamp. Marines come to Bootcamp who want to kill. We don't have to teach them to demoralize, swear and beat them. At least so I feel. And yes, I'm "qualified" to say it. I've been on the battlefield many times and have trained navy and recruiters who finally ended up on the battlefield. But then again, what I know. I was right there, I did, got a t-shirt. Army SGT ....... get a hint!
