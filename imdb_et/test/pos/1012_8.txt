Despite some true scenic locations and Franco Micalizzi's somewhat randomly energetic music, this film does not reach Joe D'Amato's level of similar effort while being almost the same. Emmanuelle Arsan, the author of the original book "Emmanuelle: The Joy of a Woman", directed and played a small role in this film, which mostly pornographic presents very young Annie Belle when she gets into various sexual situations. His boyfriend, played by ZOMBIE's Al Cliver, actually praises his sleeping and even persuades him to continue working after two of them are married! Orso Maria Guerrini falls as a professor who is so so married at the same time with two women, one of whom is Arsan's own. Despite the beginning of the promise and some fun dialogue, like, "Do you see me with the naked eye?" ... "I see you better naked!" The film goes blindly to less than a remarkable finale. Like D'Amato EMANUELLE and LATEST CHANNELS, the main characters have been looking for some lost tribes but do not get their hopes, there is no violence at all in this film, and not because it is very sexual. Just a lot of nudity and stupid dialogue. I couldn't find that little movie, but just for the full cornball logic of the movie.
