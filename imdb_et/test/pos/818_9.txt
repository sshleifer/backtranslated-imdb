This film essentially contains all the elements of the 70's major exploitation film, except what was done in the late 1980s directly on the video market. <br /> <br /> You are in love with a young couple, but the whole world is bound up with either cracking or gang violence. When the boy goes to jail, all the criminals who are all in this movie, except the police, get to the girlfriend. First he gets cracked by a dealer and then, as he owes money to Jim Brown's money, he becomes Brown's property. Then he is basically enslaved in a military-style cracking house whose film is named. <br /> <br /> As it is not enough reason to see this movie, you also have Anthony Geary, who seems to be a seemingly conservative headmaster, but he is really a big crack dealer. In an exciting but fun scene, he requires the sexual favor of the heroine because he has no money to repair. In the earlier scene it turned out that he was his advisor. This scene and the other where Jim Brown forces him to heat because he stinks is hysterical. The main actor Cheryl Kay was very good in this movie. Tarantino, bring him back. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising to me that someone mentioned in another review that Tarantino is its main fan. It is just the right mix of comedy, action, sex, romance and yes central message away from drugs. Jim Brown's terrifying regime deserves mention in the same breath as the other 80's B-villain, Vice President Wings Hauser. Sometimes I think there should be b-Oscars where such performances could be recognized. In the meantime, we hope that a modern straight DVD filmmaker learns to use the same type of cheek humor.
