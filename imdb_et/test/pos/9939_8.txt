I finally got a copy of Dario Argento's opera and I'll tell you it's time! It was the last Argento movie I saw, and I'm the fan of most of his work. I think most of his work is extremely important to the horror genre, but some of his films tend to be disappointed (like phenomena). But Opera's idea was always on me and it turned out I was right !! I liked every shot made in the operation, and I was fascinated by the film the first minute until the last moment. Of all Argento's films, Opera went to the first place and I hope I can encourage as many people as possible to see it. <br /> <br /> Opera's scenario and plot idea are quite simple. Especially in comparison to the phenomena of Argento's previous film, which had too many ideas, and ended up in confusion. Opera's plot is creepy and chilling, but at the same time it is a great satirical comment - almost fraudulent - against opponents of explicit violence. *** SPOILERS *** A young opera singer (proud Cristina Marsillach) is embedded with a terribly sadistic murderer. During each massacre, he forces Betty to look at his actions with his eyes. Needles are attached to the eyelids and when they close, they break. *** END SPOILERS ***. With this simple - yet effective - idea, Argento adds a lot of terrible elements such as cucumbers, MacBeth's classic piece (and curse) and the entire opera and music atmosphere. Especially the existence and added value of creepy trains. Ancient masters like Edgar Allen Poe already knew that these black birds have a lot of mystery, and Dario Argento knows it too. <br /> <br /> Violence and gore are very well presented in Opera and this makes it a true Argento image. I think his best is near Profondo Rosso. I certainly hope to recommend this movie to many people among you. Especially for fans of (Italy) fearfulness this is an absolute duty! Favorite "rewind" - arg: Argento shows his visual talent in the best scene where Betty's friend is on the lookout for the door.
