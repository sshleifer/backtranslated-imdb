What a shame this film was never released. (It is playing the cable now.) I set my high respect for the stars and got the prize, seeing the movie much better than the ones I've seen in theaters recently. I like to be surprised. So often movies are marketed as "offbeat", but they are actually the same old recycled. This movie is really different, with a warm-hearted message. Jonathan Pryce sings like an angel. Even if, according to the plot, he is obliged to sing some of the suicidal sentimental songs he has ever written, he does them so well that he doesn't mind. Cathy Bates and Rupert Everett are well-run and great, but as Cathy Bates's daughter-in-in role, the new player steals every scene she has. Give this movie a chance.
