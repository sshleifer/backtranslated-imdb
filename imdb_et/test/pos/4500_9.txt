It's a movie that left me breathtaking ........ wanted to learn more about Afghanistan's history and traditions. In today's "evil maker" the mantra hides reality, was inspiring to experience the beauty of people and their beliefs. <br /> <br /> Casting was impeccable, the terrain was just wonderful. Action was first-rate and the fact that the Academy did not take it into account (except music) is unforgivable. <br /> <br /> The script is an excellent and kind and emotional journey. From this observer, "ugly crying" is provoked. <br /> <br /> A movie worth watching for the second and third time.
