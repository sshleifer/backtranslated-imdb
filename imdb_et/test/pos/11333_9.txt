How do you describe perfection? Mood-For-Love! Maggie Cheung and Tony Leong dance practically on the screen and give the stars performances that remain after you leave the theater. All the scenes in the movie resonate between superb cinematography and frame selection, excellence in action and sensual sound. Nat King Cole, who sings in French, sets the tone of the film. Maggie and Tony look admirable, Maggie slipped into some really famous cheongsams, and Tony is always looking for a dapper. I've seen this movie many times and I always see that I have something new. Love it!
