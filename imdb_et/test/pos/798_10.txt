I like Traci Lords. He may not be the world's biggest actor, but he's pretty good at it. He plays a controversial, conservative, reporter for "T". This is a very small thriller that will keep you in good shape. Jeff Fahey is also a good Trac boss. I think Trac could be a decent break. He's definitely not worse than some of today's leading women.
