This is a great family sitcom. Rowan Atkinson has appeared in other great sitcoms: Thin Blue Line (better than this) and Blackadder (not better). <br /> <br /> Mr. Bean is not talking about a human disaster. He goes to places and gets into absolute chaos, chaos involves: climbing to the top of diving counseling and being too scared to jump, in about 20 minutes, until some kids finally throw, ending the washing machine and driving their car while sitting on the roof. Bean controls the Mini and has teddy. <br /> <br /> It was quite similar to Baldy Man, a series that looks very little at Gregor Fisher, but gets himself into chaos. Best Episode: Do It Yourself Bean, Episode 9: Bean organizes a New Year's Eve party, some things will decorate your apartment, but it has too many things and needs to drive its car on the roof.
