Seeing Gary Busey with a movie called G was first and nice. I don't know much about the director, but he probably knows how to spend a few dollars and get the most out of them. Where did Jillian Clare come from? My kids love her! The only thing I remember about Christopher Atkins was the blue lagoon. Disney must watch this movie and put it to work. She thinks she is very cute. I liked what he did with his character. He seemed so real. Most of all, the message that this movie sends is the one I like. Greed sucks and wins faith, love and family! This is the first low budget DVD we bought with so many things. Manufacturers did it for kids and the kids loved it. They liked music and all the DVDs. Probably the director would not stick to family films, but I hope he does it because he really knows how to use children, animals and stars like Gary Busey. The dog was great and saw Gary Busey behaving like a dog was even more fun. I didn't like that much. It's hard to find a family movie without all the raw material humor and Quigley was a wonderful surprise.
