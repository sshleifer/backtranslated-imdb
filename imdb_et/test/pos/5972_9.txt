Fantastic Russian WWII movie. Like most Russian WWII movies, the rise is incredibly harassing. It is also symbolic tight. The story is followed by two partisans, Sotnikov and Rybak (Boris Plotnikov and Vladimir Gostyukhin) who are on a mission to look for food. During the trip, they are noticed with German soldiers who are wounding Sotnikov. Sotnikov, in turn, kills one of the Germans, which leads to the trouble of two partisans and everyone else who later came. The greatest success of the film is its alertness. Russia is frozen and snowy, and it is hard not to feel that the cold goes directly to your bones. Shepitko keeps his strokes close to the characters by examining every face. This was probably not an option, but the film is framed by 1.33: 1, which gives the film a sense of claustrophobia. Although the whole film is quite an achievement, I felt that the first half was stronger than the other. My main complaint about the film is that it will become the ultimate inconvenient Christian alliance. I just don't think that the insignia adds much to the procedure, especially if I was already interested in a discussion between two partisans. It's not quite fair. I considered the pros and cons of these arguments. I started to look at a certain character's point of view, and then the driver opens and tells me he is Judas! Despite some heavy hands, it is still unseen.
