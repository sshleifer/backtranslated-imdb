I'm not telling anyone what's going on, but it's not compatible with the film. The rest of the Imaginary Heroes, however, represented a realistic family that went through realistic issues such as death, drugs, relationships, and high school. I could have sworn they were my own family, not a joke. <br /> <br /> Emile Hirsch was absolutely plausible when I made a fight against her brother's suicide, and Sigourney Weaver plays with her mother trying to keep her remnants (a little) dysfunctional family together. <br /> <br /> Although this family can take their questions to the extreme, everyone can be related to what they are going through, whether it be a graduation, a fulfillment of expectations or a parent.
