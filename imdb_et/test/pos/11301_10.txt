I just want to comment on the above woman to use the movie for Beethoven begging. At first they show it. Thank you. I think it's an amazing movie. They chose the right music for the mood of the movie, the animation is wonderful, and they chose the stars very well. It teaches children to never give up and always hope. Princess Annika does not give up, and it shows the children that they can do the same. The film also has humor for all ages, parents and children to laugh. The colors of this film are great and children can feel very well when they watch it. I watched this movie for the first time, now I'm a big fan and I'm sure your child is too. Walmart sells a ton of Barbie and Pegasus magic so your child can enjoy the movie even if they don't watch it. Thanks!
