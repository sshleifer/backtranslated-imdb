This film is not exactly fresh for film farmers, and it is a shameful shame. The adaptation of this funny scenario should have been made by Oscar candidates with great scriptwriter I.A.L. Diamond's adaptation and Ingrid Bergman's flawless performance. Goldie Hawn's honor has been so young to work with Bergman, looking more than ten years younger than 54 years - fifty-four! When it is on the screen, it blinks positively. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that can appear from the beginning, but it really made me want to be around the 1960s. Hawn's fashions are so sticky as Bergman is chic. (This is one little mistake - is his character not too little because he still lives with his sister? A nightclub called sliding plate? <br /> <br /> The best compliments I pay for this movie are that it made me somehow nostalgic for a decade that I never saw, and that it left me more of a wish. Speaking of wanting more, I mean what a sexy supportive actor Rick Lenz? (He recalls in this movie Griffin Dunne ' It was a debut of his movie, and I can't see other important roles in my filmography. As for Goldie Hawn, he has done so much that it's not easy to impress, but I can't imagine any other role in that role. <br /> <br /> Since the film is based on the game, the delivery of the line may seem a bit of a step-y, but it did not stop my pleasure at all. In fact, I am surprised at how funny it is after more than thirty-five years. own that is, the past era, it has unfairly slipped from the consciousness of filmmakers. It is more related to the films of this era that were before. But don't let it stop you from enjoying the pleasures you have. Rating: A
