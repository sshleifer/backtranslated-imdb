Beguiled was one of the few early Eastwood movies I didn't see until I gave the DVD a spin today. And I was completely astonished by the impact of the sepia on the top of the macabre. Too many filmmakers are replacing special effects, fast editing and dazzling camera work these days instead of character-based stories, but director Don Siegel knew how to get the maximum effect from this relatively simple plot and the characters are credible and compelling <br /> <br /> The story concerns women who to finish schools that are at different adventures during the American Civil War. South-supporting women find a badly wounded Union soldier (Clint Eastwood); when he returns to health, he starts manipulating sexually disappointed women with his ends. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page is a secret leader, and her descent into madness has been delicately transmitted. The film, which is practically in one place, never loses its visual interest. There is even a chance that a normal status quo that has long been abandoned when Eastwood's machinations are uncovered can come back; but lovers and pupils are getting a darker path ... <br /> <br /> This is a completely different style from the same director Dirty Harry, made in the same year, but they are both equally great. Eastwood plays perfectly against his usual stoic hero, but his character also includes some mysterious quality. We never know much about him before he is imprisoned and the viewer is free to decide on his well-shaded personality. Pest or victim? Whatever you think, I can say that I enjoyed it thoroughly.
