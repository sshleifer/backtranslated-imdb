<br /> <br /> As cats have nine lives, I will give you nine reasons to watch this movie: <br /> <br /> * Kittens Berlioz and Toulouse play the piano together (so incredibly cute!) * Napoleon and the car persecution dogs Lafayette * Toulouse jumped like electrified every time she wants to be like a tough alley cat * Marie comfortably romanticizes while alley cat O'Malley attracts her mother * Scat Cat and her jazz band, singing "ev" everyone wants to be a cat "* Stupid, but true and nice English geese Amelia and Abigail, who make cats walk like geese * O'Malley get a "magic carpet" that makes Cheshire cat a shame * Roquefort's brave mouse journey to ask for cat cats * Edgar's lizard chase scenes and transition from a nice man to a mad cat hate because the cat is gone.
