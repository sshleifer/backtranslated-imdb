The documentary's son has filmed his older family for years, as he claims "descendants". Three months after his mother's death, his father resumed his long-term secretary.

A husband who sometimes found himself bitterly lonely and unloved, and a husband who was hatching in his work. He and his intellectual heart, he is a much easier person who seems to have found most of his joys in a quiet solitude. They are obviously wrong to each other, it is clear.
