I just saw the sight of Black Snake Moan. I had read the comments for a while ... most seemed to be focused on the obvious ... "black-white girl chained to the black man's radiator" ... I hate "critics" leaving the movie point. Now I think it helps to live in Memphis ... and I've lived a few times in Mississippi. It can also help Clarksda's former director of the Delta Blues Museum, but I get this movie. Brewer's simple redemption plan is easy to follow and he would have had different topics to tell the story ... but I believe it's a very "blues". I hope people don't read all the leaps ... and / or different comments ... and really missed a good movie. Go along a variety of things like skinny girls in white panties ... pass by Justin Timberlake, accept his character in Ronn (what he plays very well) ... get away with "Snakes on the plane" and see how Mercuricul Samuel L. Jackson is. .. when he has become a very credible Central South blues. If you know a little about South-South culture, much of what is happening can catch up with some comics, but you agree that Craig Brewer knows how to paint canvas and let the actor talk the story and enjoy this movie. No one who says the end ... so watch this movie ... and yes, I agree with one thing the critics got right ... the music is wonderful!
