This picture is interesting about the saga of pioneers, led by Daniel Boone Cumberland Gap in the desert, while threatened by hostile Indians. Fraudulent Frenchman is the cause of the problems between all settlers and red men, while Boone tries to convince Indians that pioneers only want to build homes and live in peace. The film has a certain complaint because it is not polished production, but has good activities, though somewhat violent. B-actors are cast, but they're all good, especially Lon Chaney as Indian leader. Bruce Bennett is good at Boone, but is a bit too clean and soft to be a credible borderman. The dialogue is quite subtle, but the landscape fits the realism of Kentucky backwoods.
