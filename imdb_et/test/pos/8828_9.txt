I strongly urge everyone who loves good plots, good actors (even if it's not well known), often (that's just better), science and / or science fiction, intelligently presented on (small) screen, good special effects even then if they didn't have billions of dollars to produce it ... <br /> <br /> much better than any war on the stars ... <br /> <br /> there was only one comment that was not needed: talking about a comedian , says the commentator, that LIFE was perhaps brought to earth through comets ... it's fun, there must always be a chance to be magical? This is what is great for LIFE, can come everywhere, for external power
