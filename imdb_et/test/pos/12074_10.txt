Ann-Margret did the best work she had ever done in her film history. I felt like she was Mrs Frey. There may be one or two films by Ann-Margret, which I haven't seen since his film debuted with "Pocket full of Miracles" with Betty Davis in 1961. I feel he is fully appreciated in the industry. Although he was named Emmy for his role in "Who Loves My Children", he was ignored. As he was nominated for the Academy Award for his roles in "Carnal Knowledge" and "Tommy", he was nervous. All in all, I think everyone did a great show, including all the kids "Who Love My Children". Yes, this is a sad film (as true stories can be), but it's worth it. Thank you.
