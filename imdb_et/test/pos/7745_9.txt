I've been renting this gem several times! This is a small but somewhat sprawling masterpiece that leads the viewer to the beauty of the Greek islands of Manhattan. John Cassavets has his real husband Gena Rowland on the screen of married rocks. He thinks that the meaning of athletics is Susan Sarandon, whom he finds in Greece, when their daughter, who played in her early film role pubescent Molly Ringwald, falls on the son of a Greek shipping company who meets her mother in a yacht that travels in neighboring waters. Meanwhile, Raul Julia, a gifted talent in the cave with his Sony Trinitron, plays enormously. He has a "Hots" for the character of Molly Ringwald until John Cassavetes is facing. Ultimately, everyone comes to the classic closure where everything is agreed. Rats Julia, narrow, is dancing with her goat. This movie is full of mystery, beauty, young and old love, humor, sexuality, and more. Look at this!
