Happy 25th birthday to Valley Girl! Great sound, plausible story, great performances ... captures the spirit of the 80s; mainstream slang and emigrants. Delivering a superb high school life and a "thin city" across the Union. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack includes songs from Modern English, Felony, Josie Cotton, Sparks, Payola $, Josie Cotton, The Plimsouls, The Psychedelic Furs, Men at Work, Flirt and Bananarama. <br /> <br /> This movie is really Rome and Juliet (minus double suicide), introduced in 1980 in Los Angeles. Julie's father, played by Frederic Forrest (Sonny Bono, anyone?) Is a hysterical, idealist father of hippie, wondering how he pulled such materialistic offspring. But he doesn't understand, ya dig?
