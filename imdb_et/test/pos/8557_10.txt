We don't know why this extraordinary film was never officially made available on DVD ... Anthony Quinn alone shows it. There are relatively few films where the actor identifies his character, a phenomenon that is always unique to us, but also the powerful imagination of Quinn in the innocent Romanian language, literally his own home and everyday life, which he cannot understand. part of what makes this movie big. The script is based on a book published in Paris by a Romanian priest who escaped his country's communist takeover, and succeeds in going deep into the area of ​​a little known Eastern European history. The fate of Kafka-esquire one after another was said that Johann Moritz's malformations (publicly and honestly, without Hollywood's current political correctness) are actually the eulogy of the innocence of the Romanian people. it is ironically irony that this horror is signed by a French director who works with an American producer of American money and watches for the international light of an exceptional Mexican-born male. <br /> <br /> We saw the VCDs of this movie mentioned in various Asian online stores and I had succeeded in the digital recording of this movie, which was broadcast in the British version of TCM. But it is a shame that "25th Hour" is not an MGM studio on a future DVD card.
