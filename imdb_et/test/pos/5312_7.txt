The title stems from the correction made by the prisoner in the adolescent prison, which is the book of the school's government book entitled "United States". he adds "(his name)." <br /> <br /> Many of the features of this movie work well - scenes between Leland (Ryan Gosling) and Becky (Jena Malone), Pearl (Don Cheadle) and father Fitzgerald (Spacey), and Leland, Becky and Sister Julie ( Michelle Williams, among many others. <br /> <br /> But the central thread of this movie - the backbone to which everyone hangs - is Leland's character and motives. He is somewhat shy, passive, a nice high school student who boldly introduces himself to Becky, whom (we find) is going to go to an alternative school because he is a drug problem before. In Becky's family she has a sister, Julie, who has graduated from high school and is preparing to go to college; Julie's boyfriend Julie's age (and whose parents were recently dead) lives with them. <br /> <br /> Leland lives with her mother; his father (Kevin Spacey) and his mother have long been divorced and his father is a famous writer. Leland is very perceptive. The young boy "In the Sixth Sense" saw dead people; Leland sees teenage lovers and admits that years later they divorce that pain follows the happiness of many people today. IF, for reasons that have never been explicitly stated, it seems that his early gift sometimes works for some people, for some relationships, not for others. <br /> <br /> Some of the film looks a bit like a derivative - "American Beauty", "Sixth Sense", "Graduate", and maybe some others that I didn't recognize. It wouldn't be bad if only Leland's character had worked. <br /> <br /> I think Gosling did a great job playing Leland, but the script and story set limits. Would such a attentive, meditative young man ever kill? Even for altruistic reasons? Nothing in this movie causes it. I'm a retired therapist with lots of experience with families and teens; although many of the reactions in the film work - this part, this most important element is certainly not. <br /> <br /> And at least one other element that, in my experience, is not suitable for real life, although it is not so critical. The reason for the differences between nurses, Becky and Julie, has never been hinted, but that's okay. When two onions begin to capture different roles (one good girl, another worrying), the roles themselves can guide each other to more extreme situations. For Becky, it's worried, "What do I have to do to be loved here - give up on me and get Julie?" And the pressure to live to be all-good, a child pleasing to a parent is not less intense than Julie. So why would he break his long-time boyfriend and his parents so obviously approve of it? <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle was a good Leland teacher; all others were good in their parts. 98% of the scenes were good. It was not that it is important to understand human nature. <br /> <br /> Good functioning; faulty story and psychology; worth seeing; not complete loss.
