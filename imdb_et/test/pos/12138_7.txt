By pulling 2.6 million viewers, you have to think about the opinions of everyone on the story / plot. <br /> <br /> When you were read through life, I thought it would be a thriller for your seat for about one mother accused and ultimately charged. Unfortunately I was wrong. Although the main piece is interesting enough - a single mother runs off the road one evening, it talks to the same guy, the reason behind the stalking was a very bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> Laura Leighton is a victim, and she does it well. Whether it was all these years at Melrose Place or not, he does the movie well, playing with a mother who does something to protect his son from harm, and he looks too good these days. <br /> <br /> Leighton is really the only good in this movie. I think many people recognize the main character, after discovering why the stalker has pursued it, it's just a look-around movie.
