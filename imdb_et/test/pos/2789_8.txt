L'Auberge Espagnole is full of energy and is honest, realistic and refreshing. Not a comedy or a drama, but rather a part of the lifestyle of this very interesting but still ordinary youth who is sharing a Barcelona apartment for one year. Beautifully captured with a nice soundtrack. When you're older, this movie should return the flood of good memories. If you're young, learn from this example.
