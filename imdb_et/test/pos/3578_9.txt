I didn't know what to expect. I watched it only on a leaning TV on a rainy Sunday afternoon. From the beginning he pulled me in. Music and settings and characters were great. I didn't hear any of the actors, but everything was outstanding. Great thriller. <br /> <br /> Now that ive read other reviews of this movie that refer to earlier versions and books, I'll try to learn more about this great movie
