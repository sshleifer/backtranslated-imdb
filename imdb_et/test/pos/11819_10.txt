Back in 1996, one of the pilots I worked on earlier gave me a copy of this movie. He told me that it would make me cry. I never believed him and even made bets. After seeing the movie ... I screamed the bucket! Even after seeing the film, I found myself crying in the bath. It was actually the most relevant film I've ever seen. I like the part where Dexter's mother, Eric's mother, was faced when the line went ... "The best friend of your sons just died today ... and it's not easy ... if you ever put her hands on her again ..." The last part where Dexter took Eric's shoe was a scene that didn't leave my mind so far. Honestly, I just thought it would make my eyes tear. The story of what is true friendship. My girlfriend loved it too. .. He hated me to see the movie, I called the bucket, he cried to the river.
