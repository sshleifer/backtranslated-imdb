If you take Huxtable's parents and mix them with Kyle's parents, you will get the perfect blend of top and edge education you will want for your family's upbringing skills. The best part of every show is that the parents do not come out as it is a pompous independent upper class, but knows that they are not stereotypical minors educated by parents whose children are constantly grabbing. My children are 20, 16, and 6; Almost the same age as Kyle's children and I see so many of my situations, reflecting my experience with my family. The contempt they only promise shows that if you have love in your family, you don't have to take yourself too seriously to keep your household together and have fun with your children.
