The original three films had something that made them so special and delightful - probably their length. Unfortunately, it's not a charm, but it's still a fun movie. <br /> <br /> The bright, bright side is that our favorite plasticine numbers are still working well, using good plastic-animation, being silly, but well-structured and entertaining, an exciting, fun adventure, good plot idea (was rabbit and gigantic competition) and good new characters! <br /> <br /> In addition to the original lack of charm, the only other somewhat grim side is that the film's humor, though good, is somewhat superfluous, especially when compared to the original films. <br /> <br /> The popular Giant Vedgetable competition is close by and Wallace and Gromit help rabbits eat all kinds of fluids, now they are Anti Pesto. They do a good job, but there will soon be a danger. Close by was a rabbit ... <br /> <br /> Recommended for all Wallace and Gromid fans and people who like plastic films, enjoy Wallace and Gromiti: Wererabbit Curse! :-)
