Hysterical Hardware Wars is finally on DVD. HW has earned its niche among parody classics and is not only a striking little 20-minute short, but also low-budget film production, which is the origin and residence of many of the film's cult states. With DVD, we not only get the chance to look back at the original parody (4Q2, Cinnamon-Bun Head, Ballistic Toast, etc.) that Ernie F. did in 1978, but there are many additional materials to introduce to Fosseius. Ancient Sideshow is a dead parody that is very funny, but at the same time it brings together the ignorance and greed. The director's comment is also hysterical, as is the creature function, whose parodies take out a film in the speech-show circle, and are actually based on a chain of exhibitions on the HW display, although a public access loop. I would love to see Ern, Michael Wiese and the team on some other modern, overcrowded and budgeted targets for the parody - like almost all the movies on Hollywood days in the $ 100 million pop - not so insidious movies like Spider Man or Men In Black (actually parodies themselves! ), but any number of overcrowded, overheated, overloaded and overpriced functions. <br /> <br />
