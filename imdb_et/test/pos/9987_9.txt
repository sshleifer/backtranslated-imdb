LARGE GAME EVER PLAYED (TGGEP, 2005) is an amazingly uplifting, infectious sub-movie that is never (actually) sappiness or heavyhandedness. Yes, it takes a number of freedoms, like most Hollywood movies, but these freedoms are forgiven because they actually add to the enjoyment of the movie, not for it. In fact, it has many real moments. You can really say it's a "Rocky" movie from the beginning of the movie, but who cares? Head no one other than Bill Paxton (I know right!!), It's expertly made and tremendously traceable! <br /> <br /> TGGEP speaks about Francis Ouimet (played with confidence, in class and in superstar-to-be Shia LaBeouf), an Irish-French immigrant family of amateur golfers living in Brookline. MA, early 1900s. Ouimet is able to play the Open Open in 1913. His contest includes the legendary Harry Vardon (played by Stephen Dillane's enormous class, dignity and wildness). Ironically, Vardon is the second sub-dog of this flick! The film begins in the 1870s in Scotland, where landscapers say to young people that they are building a golf course in their home and that golf is a game that doesn't like it. In the early 1900s, Francis went through the same prejudices with a Brookline boy. There are stories open in 1932. <br /> <br /> What is ironic is that, even as an adult and multiple winner, Vardon in British society is still growing due to his upbringing. Francis learned a lot about golf to read books about Vardon and Vardon is his idol that is growing. Not familiar with Vardon, they met in Boston in 1900 after Vardon, who won this year's Open, was on a tour when Francis was only 7. <br /> <br /> In addition to Francis and Vardon, the 1913 open participants also Vardon's friend and master Brit Ted Ray (fabulous Stephen Marcus) and classy, ​​chest double defensive champion John McDermott (Michael Weaver). The film really does a good job, showing the different personalities of these men. <br /> <br /> Redheaded Marnie McPhail is anxiously calm and stunning when Francis's Irish mother and veteran at Elias Kotea give a stern, reserved, silent performance like her French father. Additionally, young Josh Flitter (like Francis '10-year-old caddy Eddie) steals a procedure with almost one hand. <br /> <br /> Paxton throws a lot of modern details, such as zooming in special effects in frames, to show the positioning of players and the CGI scoreboard for many golf shots to keep the movie exciting and fast, so that the movie won't become too long. But the film still convinces us of a specific time and place. <br /> <br /> What's interesting is that although Rocky-like, it's all based on a true story! So the end is so satisfactory on so many levels. An entertaining movie about golf in the early 1900s ... Wow!
