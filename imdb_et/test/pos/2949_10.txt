Watching this movie caused a rather emotional response. That's what documentaries today are. It is refreshing to look at something so personal, honest and real. These days, Mr Block's thoughts, opinions and publicity are rarely seen and are very well displayed here. This is a good line between personal truth and exploitation. This film goes very carefully and quite successfully. On the contrary: it made me feel good. I feel I know more about marriage now ... about women. <br /> <br /> Be sure to check this out to make you think - exactly what a good documentary should do.
