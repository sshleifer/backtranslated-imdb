Holden and Jones SIZZLE in this movie, but not in the way we shined today - it's very subtle and under the surface - still sensitive. Especially Jennifer Jones is so hot in this film (much more than a caricature like Monroe EVER) because she creates a real woman - all aspects of a woman: she is intelligent, intuitive, graceful. He wants and wants. <br /> <br /> This famous hill has a scene where he is lying in the grass, looking at Holden and the expression in the eyes is X-rated, but in the context of the scene and character, it is quite reasonable. You don't need to have it all in the dialogue - it's exactly like most modern movies. It's all in her eyes - sexy but elegant. What was a stunning, undervalued actor. (I saw her for the first time in MADAME BOVARY and it was blown equally.) I take her over to Bergman, Davis or two Hepburns every day.
