Oh, don't look at this thinking that it will be a relaxing circus night! It keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way. The circus has never been more colorful, more exciting and breathtaking! The whole concept is truly amazing. You have been taken to the world of Cirque Du Soleil and leave a thousand minds on leaving. There's just one thing to do: get a CD and / or DVD and live it again and again. Get addicted! It's worth it! Must be the most beautiful on earth and one of Cirque Du Soleil's best programs.
