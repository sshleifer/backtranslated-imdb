My father took me to watch this movie when it appeared in 1976. I was just a child, and it frightened me. So much so I had to leave the theater especially during the scene of the claustrophobic tunnel, because it was too intense for me !!! I went to the safety of my family. I saw the movie all the time I got older and enjoyed it. Shame about the monster college men. If you forget the cheapness of production and get worse, you will find Cushing's excellent performance, stunning opening point, some nice photography and ever more reliable Mr.Douglas McClure, my childhood hero! end! Titty bang bang cave woman! Exciting monsters! Monster participants fit with the wires! That is all! Great.
