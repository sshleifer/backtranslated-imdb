Lemuel Gulliver (Ted Danson) is a physician who is lost at sea, leaving the pregnant woman Mary (Mary Steenburgen). Eight years later, he turned terribly and seemingly crazy - beating his adventures on small flowerpots, giant Brobdingnags, the intellectual Laputa Island, and Houyhnhnm, in a competition for intelligent, talking horses to deal with Yahoos - the best human race - with many other adventures. Not so good dr. Bates (James Fox), who has designs for Lemuel's wife, is imprisoned by the Gulliver spiritual institution and Lemuel, Mary and son Thomas (Tom Sturridge) have to find a way to prove their peace of mind. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Swift's great adaptation of satirical novel, this movie is a great adaptation on so many levels: story, satire, characters, visuals, brilliant cast. It's just petting to watch, and it's almost amazing, because it's a TV movie. <br /> <br /> The film does an excellent job of capturing Swift's infamous satire. era in society but still resonates. Smart Brobdingnags and Houyhnhnms are almost perfect individuals who have virtually impossible to understand why Gulliver speaks with his pride in his society. The scenes where Gulliver fights to prove himself are probably the best, describing the satire biting, as they choose their leaders ("they seem to choose the worst ... who regulates until they find someone worse") "We ate only for a very good reason - as they are weaker than us, or we want our whole country") and so on. Scarlet-related scenes are also effective - intellectuals are so special in their fields that they don't have time for anything else and really have little reason. Adding shelter lines will greatly increase the story - Dr Bates is really a disgusting person and when he talks about investigating Gulliver's alleged affairs, it is quite clear that he describes his mistakes. <br /> <br /> The film uses beautiful and quite convincing CGI effects that depict the very different settings of the novel with great effect. The contrast of sizes is done with great skill and all the worlds of the story are convincing in their own way. Cinematography (especially about asylum) and costumes are great. The current editing of Lemuel's memories is a device that can be uncomfortable but works very well. <br /> <br /> Cast is truly wonderful; real who is British and American talent. Ted Danson gives an excellent, multilayered performance as a Gulliver, effectively showing his transformation from the embarrassment of his strange surroundings to the deliberate state he was when he reappears at the end of his rational, intellectual personality. Danson is best showing his work on sit-com, showing that he is more than just Sam Malone with this great serio-comic performance. Mary Steenburgen is her husband effective and James Fox is absolutely repulsive as Bates. The rest is mostly made of canes, Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Warwick Davis, Kristin Scott Thomas, Geraldine Chaplin, Alfre Woodward, Edward Fox and Sir John Gielgud are the most memorable - but even the smallest parts are very well played. <br /> <br /> Although "Gulliver's Travels" is 100% faithful to the book, it is a story and a picture. It must not be forgotten. <br /> <br /> 9/10
