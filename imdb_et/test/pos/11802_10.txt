Cure is one of the few films I rated in 10 out of 10. That means it's perfect for me in this movie. I saw it almost a year ago, but I still remember many scenes, especially the scene about the last credit. <br /> <br /> The two boys' actresses clearly gave everything they could, and it greatly contributes to a great story that makes the film ideal. <br /> <br /> The message is clear - friendship and it is displayed all over the place. <br /> <br /> There's nothing to say here. Simplicity is one of those movies that I love so much. And, of course, it's fun and moving at the same time, matching people of all ages. <br /> <br /> 10/10, well done!
