After NAKED CITY and NIGHT AND CITY (which is still my favorite Dassin), I was more than happy to see her "Masterpiece" (O-Word criterion) RIFIFI. <br /> <br /> Now I'm a little disappointed with the story. <br /> <br /> So I think at least these five questions: <br /> <br /> 1. In the final Countdown, Louis Grutter left the main character of Tony le St√©phanoise inside the house. He didn't know if he was still alive or not, but he didn't care about it and ran right after the house (with money) to reach his car. So, of course, Tony wasn't dead and shot him. BIG QUESTIONMARK. <br /> <br /> 2. In another important scene, Cesar's specialist in safes immediately after abducting the current diamond ring (which was part of the robbery) was working at Louis Grutter at night. Stupid, because before that character it wasn't stupid. Of course, Louis knew straight away that Tony was planning a junk robbery. SMALL QUESTIONNAIRE. <br /> <br /> 3.After Louis Grutter's murdering gangster, Mario Ferrati and his wife Tony, and his best friend Joe, were planning a revenge against Louis Gang. At the same time, they do not care about the safety of Joe's wife and her five-year-old child. Of course Louis Gang's son was kidnapped. CHEAP and SIMPLE. <br /> <br /> 4. Perfect Throw: Of course, it's best for 30 minutes. a long-term scene across the plot without talking for the whole word, but was it the perfect ghost? Compared to other films that deal with this topic, I can only smile if, for example, Tony was a fire extinguisher to disable the alarm. Also too simple. <br /> <br /> 5. The Grutter Gang went to Mario's house because they knew (but ...) that the jewelery was there. Then they kill Mario and his wife. And then? They're not looking for it! NO. They ran straight out of the apartment. And more. They do not follow the apartment after that, so Tony can go in for a while (that was the same day) inside to take jewelry. BIG QUESTIONMARK. <br /> <br /> Everything: it's a good movie. Thanks to an excellent 30-minute quiet hiss scene. Because of a very good passage (the end car scene in Paris is stunning). Very good actor named Jean Servais. Because of this Black / White fever, you get it while you watch. For other reasons, another user wrote, but please do not say it is a stunning story.
