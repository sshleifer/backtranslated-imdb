Nostalgia is not always the best reason to watch a movie. More often than not, your kids love movies to disappoint you as adults. Although there are exceptions to this rule, it is difficult to justify having Krull's DVD, no matter how much insightful the director's comment is. But leave the sharp Gen X / Y'ers, because dozens of disappointments that dominate your journey on the memory route can prevent you from stumbling over. <br /> <br /> One of the surprising films, which is another look, is Joel Schumacher Flatliners, a supernatural thriller who plays the heavy trucks of 80's popcorn, Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Julia Roberts and Billy Baldwin. You think that the stew, consisting of such a sauce, the amazing elegant Schumacher and the sliding eye of the operator Jan De Bonti would bring about something poor but calories ... Flatliners are not half bad. Although its product development is inexplicably uplifting and photography is painlessly over-styled (full of neon-absorbed streets that incite endless steam drinks), Flatlins still manages to be a dark and delightful thriller. If there is an explanation of why Flatliners were forgotten, this may be because a second, much better, supernatural thriller was discovered in 1990: the Jacob ladder. <br /> <br /> If Flatliners was released one year or two years after Jacob's ladder, it would probably be Schumacher's thrilling thriller left behind as it was commercialized by Adrian Lyne's spooky masterpiece. But when these films were released in the same year, Flatlins had a different destiny, tripling the JL ticket office, despite being a soaked version of a similar assumption. The passage of time is not so kind to Flatlins that it has disappeared from the 80s Brat Pack drums, while JL has confirmed its reputation as a timeless classic. Fate sets aside, JL is smoothly frightening and manages to keep viewers away until the last shot, while Flatliners is the victim of over-simplification and Hollywood convenience, dragging the final act into predictable order. Comparison of the two films is unfair and finally Flatliners' ability to represent the 80's best is ignored. At the end of the ten-year-long excess of liberation, Flatliners is always dated according to its hair and clothing styles, but fairly, it must be remembered (or at least close to it) as a well-executed film on its own pile. dreck. Deliberately and purposefully, it is an entertaining foot memory.
