I was 13 years old when this mini-series (and its sequel to North and South, Book II) was first broadcast. I was already excited about the stories of personal interests in our American civil war and what I am interested in watching this television program. <br /> <br /> I loved it. And now I'm 29 years old and I love it more. It is full of history, beautiful costumes, real characters who are in the life of fictional characters and woven from it, all you care about deeply. There is intrigue, love, loyalty, betrayal, family, long-lasting family, lust, battles, victory, win and reconstruction. <br /> <br /> Even though I had all the episodes on the tapes, I saved it initially from Columbia House a few years ago, both N&S II and N&S II when they became available. Once every few years I take the whole weekend and look back at all the contributions - and I'm sad when the last episode ends, because I think I want to continue the story of their characters. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this mini-series any more.
