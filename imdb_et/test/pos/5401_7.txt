The NYT Review states that the character of Sigourney Weaver is tense and frustrated, and later he may be a normal nation of the nature of MTM. Say what? Not possible. This lady was unique from the start. Nothing like MTM ordinary people. Sorry. Mrs Weaver must dance to jig. I believe he was 55 years old at Imaginary Heroes. He was born in 1949. <br /> <br /> NYT perception corrects aside, it was a pretty good movie because it was so young. Probably Sigourney Weaver was thinking like Jeff Daniels. The young man playing the girl was outstanding. <br /> <br /> Some critical comments I can make about the script. It's not that I really did not know why Sandy Travis passed away from his son. His peculiarly blown behavior was probably due to his death, but such behavior lasted Â¾ through the film that I was more involved in with his stagnation, his relationship with Tim, and where he really came, and other unresolved issues than his mourning for his elder son. Ben's grief was much clearer. <br /> <br /> So Matt Travis was a asshole. Did her mother think so? However, a very observable film. It is not clearer and clearer that women of certain ages do not have any roles, but that it is a director, such as being so clearly in love with an older woman (Mrs Weaver) and almost finished her film is her respect. Sorting by Woody Allen.
