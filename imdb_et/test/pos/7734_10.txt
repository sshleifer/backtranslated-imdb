I just can't believe the low results of this movie. The probable cause is related to the low number of votes, which means that few people have seen it. It's just a fantastic movie! There are so many stories that are interconnected, but it's not complicated. Each character grows with the film and we experience them with the changes in life. The scenery is just amazing and the final credits are the best in any movie I've seen (like the Shakespeare game). Yes, it's a bit dated (filmed in 1982), but the characters are very topical. It could have been filmed in 2002 without changing the story. Raul Julia is amazing, the best role ever in film - it's his signature. Young Molly Ringwald is great when she matures from a girl to a young woman. Susan Sarandon is perfect as a young carefree woman, and John Cassavets is the power that puts it all together. Do it yourself, find this movie, watch it and enjoy it. Come back to IMDb and score this movie at the beginning of all time 250, to which it really belongs.
