I liked the best feeling it gives in the early 1940s in this 1941 full-length animated film. It's the songs, clothes, cars, buildings, etc. of the day. You feel you've stepped back from time. <br /> <br /> From reading some reviews here, I see that it was a heavy luck movie released a few days before the Pearl Harbor attack. Oh, no one would be interested in movies of event-related comics during these eventful and shocking days, I'm sure. Too bad because people were left with some pleasant animation that would have really impressed almost 70 years ago. The colors are nice, the drawings are good and the story is when we drink "Hoppity" and his beautiful girl "Honey" guided by mistakes to make it happily forever and harmful. All of them are also told that they find the grasslands they can live in and are not worried about those who kill them. <br /> <br /> Although there is a nasty frog - "C. Bagley Beetle" - and two of his handbags. These helpers ("Swat, The Fly" and "Smack, the Mosquito") are comedians who have their own Brooklyn item accent! The story is familiar, where the disgusting old man wants to get a sweet young man to marry and use reckless means to force his hand. In the meantime, a good guy is beaten against him, but ultimately it dominates. <br /> <br /> My favorite thing - it sounds worse than what it was - was like a good guy. Hoppity was temporarily shocked and danced in black and white. It was a fantastic animation! <br /> <br /> You know, it's good that I didn't see it very little as a child; I would have been afraid to play outdoors and squash all those nice bug people! You never know what (or who) is in the grass under your feet!
