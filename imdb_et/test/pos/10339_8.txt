This is a movie that starts with the number of video rentals ..... just to discover an undervalued entertainment and enjoyable movie !! Opening order of police arriving in a dark and rainy house, where a "woman" has committed a murder ....... or is it ... and the rest of the film is trying to get rid of what really happened. ... OK ... the movie is a little "campy" ... but it has good editing and dialogue ..... professional acting ..... often humorous ...... and the last scene with facial expression is one best of its kind ...... definitely worth a look ..... worth at least 7 or 8!
