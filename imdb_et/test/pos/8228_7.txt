Whether the title search for Randolph Scott and TRAIL STREET is what you haven't seen from the list. One of the four films Scott made at RKO during his main (1947) is always easy to get along with. Liberal, Kansas is west of Dodge City, and it is a powder bar that explodes between the riders who drive in the mountains to Trail Street, the city's main street, and rotters who eat our belly. It takes a strong person like Bat Masterson to step in between two groups and bring the city to order. No more I say, except that Scott usually has only one beautiful girl and has three. RANDOLPH SCOTT always played with men who might have been looking for their sense of respect, courage, balance and willingness to do the right thing. Fifty years ago, parents could send their children to Scott to learn positive values. ROBERT RYAN plays stars in this movie, playing a good man for change. In real life, RYAN was one of the many world championships in American movies. When sad what we get these days. George Clooney teaches our young people that we should give sympathy to suicide attacks, while Steven Spielberg teaches that there is no moral difference between the 1972 Olympians killed in Munich and their killed Palestinian terrorists. Hollywood 2005 brings too much of its moral compass to cocaine and too much commitment to the strange left. I don't know how to do it all through Liberali, Kansas. After all, the liberal was not a dirty word 150 years ago when the city was named.
