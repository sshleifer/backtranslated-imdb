Recently, I posted this series to IMDb, giving the BBD commercial branch a snail mail address where a complaint was posted. I wrote this address mentioning Sam Waterson and his popularity. I just got the following answer: <br /> <br /> From: emilyfussell@hotmail.com Subject: Oppenheimer Date: May 14, 2006 1:44:00 MDT To: kk2840@earthlink.net <br /> > Dear Kate, <br /> <br /> I work for BBFC, a British that meets MPAA, and we classify DVDs and videos and movies in that country. Anyway, I am currently presenting the 1980 Oppenheimer certificate for miniatures. While studying IMDb's work, I noticed your post and thought you might know that the job is ready to release (so a certificate is needed). <br /> <br /> I don't know which company distributes it, but keeps your eyes clear! <br /> <br /> With respect, <br /> <br /> Emily +++++++++++++++++ <br /> <br /> hooray! <br /> <br /> I also want to contact Netflix to buy it. <br /> <br /> Kate Killebrew <br /> <br /> kk2840@earthlink.net Recently I posted to the BBC whether their terrible series of Oppenheimer has ever appeared on video or DVD. I couldn't find it. I received the following answer. When you write the BBC, be sure to mention that Sam Waterston is very popular in the US. You can also enter "Oppenheimer (1980)" at amazon.com and find a box to check if the owner (BBC) is requesting this release and report the release. <br /> <br /> Kate Killebrew kk2840@earthlink.net <br /> <br /> Here is the BBC response: <br /> <br /> Dear Kate <br /> <br /> Thank you for your -post about Oppenheimer. <br /> <br /> I was interested in wanting a copy of the program you enjoyed. I've checked the BBC store and online retailers and don't find any data on it. We do not currently know about plans to release this program on DVD. If you want to make a suggestion, can I recommend that you put it in writing to the BBC Commercial Arm: <br /> <br /> BBC Worldwide Ltd Order Woodlands 80 Wood Lane London W12 0TT <br /> I thank you again for contacting the BBC. <br /> <br /> BBC info from Elaine Hunter ______________________________________ <br /> <br /> - ---- Original message ----- <br /> <br /> {Comments:} I'm trying to find a copy of the horrible From the BBC production "Oppenheimer", which is the book / script by Peter Prince of the Seven Series Sam Waterston in 1980, I looked at those parts from the American Playhouse of PBS, but can't find it anywhere on the video. <br /> <br /> http://www.bbc.co.uk/
