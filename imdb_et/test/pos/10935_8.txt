Unusual, revolutionary Western, deserves to be viewed. Despite the slow start, does the film build? barely dialogue and subtitles? ever more inclusive and intense, almost existential portrait of life in the harsh environment of the western desert. Lead character growth is worth waiting for, and strong central casting brings true despair to combat all important horses. How interesting it was for a British director. I hope he now smiles: I have the impression that the modern ones largely ignore the film; but time is running in the usual alchemy, and the hidden gold looks like it inevitably has to. One comment for me: Revision is only so far. Sam Waterston as India? - He contributed to the real emotions and intensity, but really did one American Indian actor fail to do this job? But his scenes with Caroline Langrishe are close, which is amazingly surrounded by their enormous landscape. <br /> <br /> Forget the great, bankrupt Hollywood versions of the past, men with big jaws and rotating music; it is the forefront of the struggle between the protagonists who do not understand all the traps of "normal" life, what is worth fighting for. Impressive.
