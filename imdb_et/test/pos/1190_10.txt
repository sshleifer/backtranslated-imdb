Treat Williams got some certainty about this movie and really did it. Don't be guilty of misguided film choices. This movie really looks like. "Hair" is a music that really deals with the attitudes of the 60s and probably more with a person. There are many remarkable music that has been made in a remarkable way. Unlike the music videos of the 70s, 80s and 90s, the video flashes with a music object. In other words, it makes sense for the video to match with the songs so you know it's never done on MTV. The subject is about drugs and hippies, but it is mainly a movie about Vietnam's meaningless tragedies. One main character is the boy of Oklahoma, who is going to make a difference, believing that all the patriotic laptop is fed with a spoon, and he will be in New York, who is more or less glorified at the slums; Their characters are very unique and probably they wouldn't make sense today, but this bunch of band together burning their draft cards. What makes some remarkable landscapes and enchanting scenes that include not only three lines, but also other 3 gang members, as well as newcomers with a small child, whose entrance is easily one of the cinema's ten biggest entrances, partly because he sings one of the greatest songs of this generation. Despite their mistakes, you come to love these people, cinematic triumph with a sense of heart and a great final.
