LIFEFORCE is an extremely schizophrenic film based on Colin Wilson's The Space Vampires novel, which the script ignores most of the novel concepts and structures (indeed, it is more of a QUATERMASS series than a novel), but the scenes it leaves in the novel are almost identical to the film. Speaking of a script, it must be one of the most unequal in cinema history, although it is written in chapters by several different people. Take Carlson, for example, he disappears after the early scenes that led me to believe he was dead, then he turns the movie again to explain the plot to the victims, and this is the lack of screenwriters breaking the film. And there are many other clumsy scripts, like heroes returning to London from a helicopter, who have not understood that they have been driven by zombies until they fly. <br /> <br /> I could go on these surfaces for a long length but LIFEFORCE is really enjoyable to watch if you don't use your brain. It is good to see the sci-fi horror of the time when foreigners were depicted as a lovely creature hidden by their children in their bedrooms, so that the nasty adult adults could not get them. Special effects and pyrotechnics are very good, there are many activities and tricks, and LIFEFORCE contains one of the most memorable aliens as a space girl. When we mention LIFEFORCE in a conversation with men, there is always a competition to say "Seeing an alien in LIFEFORCE? She can breastfeed vitality at any time" Hardly surprisingly watching the demographics that this film is more popular with men than women <br /> <br> /> "Don't worry. Naked girl can't get out of here" Can't she? Damage <br /> <br />
