Bergman's usual Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann played Jan and Eva Rosenberg as a village couple. The story started with a normal couple who is fighting and compensating. Jan was a sensitive person, but an escalator who isolated himself from the world. Eva is a practical woman who is tired of her husband's lack of ambition. Because Jan pushed ahead with his radio determination, they are threatening an impending war. Of course, the war came and the film was a fascinating study of their transformation into each other and of each other, as the enemy and its government treated them badly. <br /> <br /> A musical result for the film, but the soundtrack was a war noise. In one scene there was an amazing pulsating gun, an explosion and an airplane flight. Now and then, Bergman increased his facial expression because different events took place. When something violent happened, he increased viewers seeing violence, not seeing it close. Very well made film.
