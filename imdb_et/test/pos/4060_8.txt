SHOWTIME is a mess, but it's a fun mess. The plot is forgotten, satire is light and the sequences, though well-staged, are not so exciting. But I laughed. Much. Credit goes to De Niro and Murphy's inspired bonding. They have great chemistry. Murphy supplies one liner, De Niro breaks us with a view or birth. This film receives a reception from critics like RUSH HOUR. Don't listen to them. If you're a fan of De Niro or Murphy, you'll enjoy this movie.
