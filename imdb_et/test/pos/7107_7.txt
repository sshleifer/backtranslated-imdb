The "Drakula House" is not so bad for the film and sometimes quite decent. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Arriving at dr. Franz's home on Edelmann (Onslow Stevens) at his seaside home, Count Dracula, (John Carradine) is discreetly seeking vampire treatment. He begins work on a possible treatment for blood transfusion, Wolf Man, Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.). Working with two patients, he discovers the possible treatment of a form near the laboratory, and after searching for the area he finds a Franken monster (Glenn Strange) buried. Arriving with this revival, Dr Edelmann has ignored Dracula's and Larry's requests, and after demanding that they work in Monster instead of their treatment, they turn to each other on a climatic showdown. <br /> <br /> Good news: it was a pretty decent movie. There is one major idea that is quite creative and imaginative. This is the first film that openly opens up the vampire as an idea of ​​a blood disorder and can be transmitted from person to person through the exchange of physical fluid, which later later works in the genre, but rarely as directly as it does. There's even a parasitic microscope slider that is believed to be responsible for the disease. It works somewhat nicely with the ideas that are used and is a pretty nice idea, even if there is little hidden performance. The fact that every creature has at least one standout scene is a nicely made idea. Wolf Man has a wonderful scene where he makes search parties in the prison chamber into suspicious members and gets crazy. The first appearance of Dracula as a bat and a flying figure that sleeps and then appears in human form is really impressive. Monster's rampage begins well and causes a sufficient amount of destruction. The big bat that Dracula redesigns always looks decent and quite realistic. This is a thoroughly decent thing. <br /> <br /> Bad news: There are many things that were not so big about it. The fact that the film combines so many potentially intriguing plots and ideas that it does not really know what to do with them. There are a number of different background results that need to be mixed together and that should be clear enough to blend together and feel united. There's really nothing about it. The plot is rather weak and does not really give any star priority and instead focuses on one, then the other, and then all three ends. Monsters seems to be related to each other only because of the smallest possible cause, which makes it a big mess. Finally, there is once a lot of subjugation and it seems completely similar to the last change. There are a few other small things that were not all that spectacular, and it has been a great contributor to it. <br /> <br /> Final Decision: It's a pretty decent movie and you can get through the fun of the times. It is still not nice close to the classic status of any debut feature of monsters, but it is nice enough to watch fans of monsters and universal films. <br /> <br /> Today's Rating-PG: Violence
