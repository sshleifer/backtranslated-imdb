The lovely movie knows a good movie that I've never heard about this movie, but ran for rent. I had great hopes that this film was based solely on Flex in this movie. I've never seen him. True, to form this movie for me. I enjoyed this story. The film is full of great actors and actors. Fun Tasha Smith, Essence Atkins and of course Tangi Miller. I liked this movie very much. I didn't give him five letters because it didn't discuss some of the issues I thought the film should be detailed. The question was obviously resolved, but I would have thought of a debate that would solve the problems. I liked this movie so much that I buy a movie after I rented it and watched it.
