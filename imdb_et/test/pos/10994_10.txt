We went to see Manna from heaven, my husband, two friends and me and we all enjoyed the movie. The characters are funny, the story is amusing and as much as real life. I think this is what I liked the most, but I saw something plausible, no murder, no sci-fi, just good, clean fun. This is something you could take for your children or elderly parents and not worry. How many of them are more about!
