I've never seen such a movie before, or funny. I laughed at my fucking ass and looked at it repeatedly. Actually, I'm looking at it right now. Chad from CKY is too hot. Anyway, if you never liked it, blow your ass, you have no taste. In the film, Ry (Ryan Dunn), who has just broken up with his girlfriend, turns to Valo (Bam Margera) and Falcone (Brandon DiCamillo) to find out exactly what he did with "Hellboy" (Rake Yohn) and with the help of Raab (Chris). Raab / Raab Himself) will do so. <br /> <br /> Fender's bender scene and scene with cactus in Record Bin were fun.
