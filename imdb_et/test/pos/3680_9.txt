This movie is the most moving and funny movie I've seen for a long time. Housewife ("homemade") and fan (Rupert) found it reasonable. Anyone who misinterprets Dirk's anger is wrong. Kathy Bates is not really an actor I know, but she is perfect, the whole cast is perfect for these roles. Julie Andrews had to sew me. I'll look at it after reading Rupert's auto-biography, so his involvement was even more fun. It is sometimes terribly touching. I am not really a fan of film-type music, but you can pull a novel and find that you are singing songs on days. This film deserves wider availability. The scene includes Dirki and a gun and his pants, look at it and see!
