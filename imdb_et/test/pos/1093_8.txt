This is the ultimate ultimate film of the police forces I've seen. Although not directed by Ram Gopal Varma, it has all the elements of the RGV movie. Dead straight dialogues, subtle care of the subject, brilliant direction and great performances (even those with little work in the movie). Nana and Don Chemistry, even if they are professional competitors, are amazing. And so are the small events like an insider who doesn't give information to Imtiaz even when he's dressed but only Nana when he's out. Changes in working conditions through the change of parents are treated well. The first party holds one absolutely absolutely guilty, moving like a documentary, which Nana acts as a Jatini mentor, explaining the complexity and philosophy of her work. <br /> <br /> Generally one of India's brilliant films. cinema. You must not miss it.
