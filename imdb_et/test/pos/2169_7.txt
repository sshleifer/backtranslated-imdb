This movie is not considered an Academy Award, but if you enjoy a movie that doesn't take itself seriously and want the viewer to enjoy ninety minutes, it's not disappointing. You'll enjoy sending Darth Vader to the scarecrow (breath), the female Batman heroine (but with a lot less costume) and a running joke involving cigarettes and a police captain, which is very funny. There is no great cinematographic achievement in any way. But if you enjoy the fun fun, it was worth watching. God helps me, I liked it.
