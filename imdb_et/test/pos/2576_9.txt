I was surprised how big Black Snake Moan turned out to be obvious. Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson fan are id-id id to try it.If it was over, I was just surprised how big this movie really was I mean, everything was very dead for this thing and very accurate. This movie shows how big director and writer Craig Brewer (who made Hustle & Flow another great movie) can just take something even that seems ludacras and does it is a good time, as is the movie that just changes it in their own way well. I also love the fact that it does not show great southern steroids and how it is portrayed as the most repulsive place, but not the film, which makes it very accurate and very reconstructive. This cover was just phenomenal, especially Christina Ricci (who deserves the Oscar for this role), always great Samuel L. Jackson, and even Justin Timberlake did an excellent job everything is great about it and although this non-every kind of movie is definitely worth it to see it for anyone who can enjoy the time. Three cheers for black snake Moan !!!! <br /> <br /> 9.3 out of 10 stars
