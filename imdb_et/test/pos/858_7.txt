When I saw this movie, the first thing that jumped on me was the act of Kelly Overton's young (and op and future star) actor, which I saw for the first time. I really look forward to seeing what the future will bring .... <br /> <br /> The film he was on was good in the sense that it allowed Kelly Overton to do things and win the race ... not much new tho i had the feeling that i had seen it all before .. but with a good experience :) i would recommend this movie ... if only see Kelly Overton .. this stage actress takes the screen storm .. i will give this movie voice is 7. .. 5 for the show and 2 for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> And on the last remark .. sorry for my bad English. sa: P plz ignore me ...
