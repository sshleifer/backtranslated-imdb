"The Trip" is a very good movie. This film, which was produced in the spring of 1958 in Vienna and appeared in 1959, was quite popular in its early years. Despite the political problems that affected the film's success (as the story goes on during the Hungarian Revolution, during the Cold War), The Journey is a very good film, but not well known. I think it should be released immediately on DVD because most people who have seen it so far want it at home. One of the most important features of the film is the exceptional chemistry between Deborah Kerri and Yul Brynner, their intense relationship. All of their scenes are very important, but they also show strong feelings, great passion and love between characters (major Surov and Diana Ashmore). Another quality is a script that is very well written. It was even published as a novel on George Tabor's screen. The film keeps its tension from start to finish. At first we didn't know if Diana and other travelers could leave Hungary because the Communist major sees Diana's friend Paul Kedes as a Hungarian and he can't leave the country. Major is deeply in love with Diana and this is actually the real reason she doesn't want to go. But when she receives her and gives her one of the most memorable kisses she saw on the screen and she can do it, she lets go. And at the end of the movie, there is one of the most dramatic endings ever filmed - Major and Diana say, "Goodbye!", Arriving at the border of all travelers, including Paul, while some Hungarians die in Surov several times so he dies. Yul Brynner is very, very beautiful and Deborah Kerr is very beautiful, charming, refined, like an English lady. Yul and Deborah are perfect together. They are one of Golden Hollywood's biggest couples. The real moviegoer should watch this movie. "The Journey" is all that a good movie should have - a great, fascinating story, interesting signs, a wonderful direction (Anatole Litvak is the best in my opinion). Finally, I want to send a message to Warner Bros. Studio or those who restore and release classic movies: please release "The Journey" on DVD as soon as possible.
