This is probably one of the best Portuguese movies I've ever seen ... I enjoyed the plot because the way the story evolves could get more involved in how their world was really upside down ... just one part that doesn't look like a movie that's girls strip, fits ... It doesn't add anything important to the story, it looks like it's just for men's entertaining purpose. The end is a bit unexpected, though at the same time somewhat expected. If you don't understand it, follow me: After so many strange events, the viewer is so strange that ending a movie with totally unexpected relationships (like Mimoso and Susana) sounds completely natural after the rest of the movie. But most importantly, Sorte Nula is a film that makes you think, trying to solve mysterious events, laugh your miserable life and confusion with your understanding of what can happen in just a few minutes when you return something like that ... I appreciate it 8/10
