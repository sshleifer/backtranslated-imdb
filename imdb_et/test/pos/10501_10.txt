I've been watching this movie yet and still consider it quite good. Chloe is one of the few hard stars that can really work. He occasionally appears with a soft heart like "Body of Love" and "Lady Chatterly's Stories" at Showtime. I thought Nicole Hilbig did a nice body and a charming accent. Too bad he's no longer in the movies.
