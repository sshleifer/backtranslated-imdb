This is an excellent Anderson product, which is worth comparing to the best episodes of the UFO or SPACE 1999 (first series). Of course, this is not an extravagant SFX or a Star Wars pseudo-mystical tripe fest, but a subtle film with a slow pace, but it brings with it the creepy atmosphere of the best Anderson creations: "brain" for lovers. sci-fi. The voice of Lynn Loring is completely intelligent. SFX is good for such a product and its performance is good. Two astronauts are visiting the planet on the opposite side of the sun, but crash home ... or do they? Ah, videophones! Every time and then, the next "gadget for everyone over the next decade", but still 40 years later. Also on Earth's second planetary device on the other side of the sun also returns to Gamera or Dance form in Giron (1969), so who copied someone?
