One of my absolute favorite children's films. Chipmunk's adventure is packing incredibly fun young and old. The animation is lively and colorful, and the movie also has some of the best songs ever animated. Who could forget about the dynamic "Rock n 'role boys / girls", exciting "Diamond Dolls" and cordial "my mothers"? <br /> <br /> It should be considered a nostalgic classic animated pearl in the eighties. It's too bad that they don't make them any longer. Most animated movies today use violence, raw humor or sentimental music ... except of course Pixar people. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: An amazing and unforgettable adventure for all ages.
