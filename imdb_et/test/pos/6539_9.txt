When Monte Hellman's legendary "Two-Lane Blacktop" masterpiece from the early 1970s is made of more than a tough, striking, furiously tense and straightforward mood, adorned with obviously thoughtless, rough and harsh, raw and filthy macho Australian mentality With abundant, desperate, no-hop-no-end-punk-nihilism, it would undoubtedly be much like its dirty evil and atmospheric dropping. br /> <br /> A nice boy factory worker Mike (tempting little Terry Serio) runs a frightening, shady fascist car racing champ Fox (totally hate Richard Moir) when he steals Fox's pulling model girlfriend Julie (lovely Deborah Conway). Mike and Fox will compete in increasingly deadly competitions, where bets will become higher and higher with each successive race, eventually culminating in a particularly pulsating, all-or-non-race where only one true winner is allowed. Mike, assisted by his troubling but loyal Italian mechanic Pony Tony (Vourelis Mourikis's perfectly smooth passage) and guided by the blind, ultra-pure 50's style rebel insurgents (Max Cullen's maximum cool essayes), deliberately puts his life in the line of his reputation, his old lady, money and, most importantly, affection, thrown away by the possibility of resurrection. Under the leadership of John Clark, Barry Tomblim, laconically for better perfection by Peter Crosbie and David Gribble's hidden synthesizer score. The concept of racing cars is not only a funky alternative lifestyle, but also a comprehensive obsession and the cause of life (the only thing most movie characters are very passionate about), a remarkably clever and dazzling eye. Complete with an imminent end and endless central message about the price of a trap he pays for an upper dog, this riveting represents the deadlock rate as an extraordinary cinematic achievement.
