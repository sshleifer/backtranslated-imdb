Like the first film in this series (SLAUGHTER, 1972), I think it would be a mistake to label this "blaxsploitation film". Of course, killing is harsh, armed, black man, but it is rather an action game, regardless of the color of the leading person or bad sons - and a very good way of doing things. <br /> <br /> Jim Brown plays the second and last time title character. The film begins with one of the most sparse scenes I remember in the film. Like Slaughter and his friends enjoying an outdoor party, come along on a two-way ticket and start spraying with a group of firearms! No, killing is not so harsh that he is your .357! But the killing is labeled and no one is sure why this hit - but the killing goes to its bottom! Well, it turns out that the last movie was trying to catch it. In this, Slaughter kills the Mafia and strikes a lot of backs in Mexico. Now, in a frightening and clumsy attempt, the men on the plane are killing quite a few people, but they can't kill them. And because the job was so badly mixed, a mob boss (Ed MacMahon !!) orders a pilot and a gunman whose murderous assassin (Don Stroud - a very typical role for him) killed him. Stroud is great - scary and nasty to the core, but Ed MacMahon as a boss?! Wow, it's an interesting twist! Slaughter is now stumped. He thought who the two men were on the plane, but by the time they got to them, they were dead. So, Brock Peters (who plays the police officer) tells him who is required to hit and killed him to help him sell his private sector to get help with illegal secret work. So, Slaughter and his pimp friend penetrate the mobster mansion and steal the charge of the main government agencies and police officers. Of course, this process has a lot of shooting and bloodshed. <br /> <br /> Stroud will not let Slaughter abandon it and abduct Slaughter's girlfriend. Now it is separate - Slaughter has a list, but if she doesn't, she's dead. Being a harsh but galant person, you can just guess what will happen next. <br /> <br /> The action is very good in the movie and Jim Brown is intimidating and harsh. The only downside I noticed was that while playing MacMahon, he plays this nasty boss, finally he just folded - and too fast. When Slaughter catches him, MacMahon becomes a wimp and the entire previous nastiness disappears - and it's too big a clich√© and controversial. Nonetheless, despite this small turn, it is an interesting film that is NOT for children because of all violence and breasts.
