The Scarlet coat is about worshiping her with an Arnold, but she's not too much in the film, the main focus is on the big Boulton (cornell wilde) and the big Andrei (micheal wilding). Wilding also steals the film as an officer and as a gentleman to Boulton. Boulton is trying to uncover who is a man of gusts who leaks about a British brand. Wilde has to deal with a British suspicious Dr o 'dell (George Sanders) who follows his every move and loves interest Anne Francis is a very enjoyable movie
