A fantastic sci-fi channel made for a movie that goes beyond the much poorer efforts they've made. Bruce Campbell is in great shape as a potential investor who adheres to the strange experiment led by cheerful Professor Stacey Keach, and his half-hearted help, Ted Raimi. The movie is pure b movie gold and its great to see Keach and ramit Bruce, and the fact that many movies work purely on Bruce's comic slapstick is what makes it fun and asks me why isn't that dude more subscribed to their scripts ?, this is really a sick world. Definitely worth a look.
