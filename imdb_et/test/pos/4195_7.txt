You really need to remember Monkeys and have a clear understanding of where and how they were fit for the second half of the 1960s to fully understand this film. <br /> <br /> There is no line. Basically, it's a crazy, mixed mix of different, independent sequences. But it is interesting AND entertaining in its own way when you get to the wavelength. In short, it was a classic, cleverly designed and well-designed example of the experimental cinema of the late 60s. It contains some good songs, some very cinematic and many other valuable ideas on film technology. <br /> <br /> I give him 7 out of 10 for several reasons. Firstly, it took a great deal of courage to make such an unusual film in the commercial mainstream, where both its stars and producers were firmly established at that time. If there is a film in the feature film, the consequences may be terrible for all concerned. Secondly, it was largely a creative success. Finally, as has already been mentioned, it is undoubtedly a classic of the genre and now it is historically important. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the "Good" Monkees career came too late. But again, they wouldn't be allowed to do it before, because it was very fine and cynical about the satire of their picture. It is clear that the members of the group knew only too well that the whole Monkees juggernaut had almost their competition when they started working on this project. In a sense, it was supposed to be their swan song and they decided to let it catch all the breath. They were tired of being treated just like pawnid in a high-power business game where they had been manipulated and exploited in recent years. In short, they "wanted" and they were going to say a few things before they left. <br /> <br /> History, however, has justified the band. Let the critics fucking. Monkees, who missed the best, polished and successful pop documents of the decade. Yes, they had a lot of help. But at the end of the day, they stood in front of the studio mike, they were in front of film and television cameras, and they made concerts. They were fun and just a little crazy. But unlike some of their associates, they never threatened. You may be the victim of your elderly aunt. <br /> <br /> "Head" borrows the Beatles "Hard Day Night" a little too much, but it is still worth looking for those who were at the same time or for younger retrofiles who have the ability to assess its importance. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
