I've probably watched the movie 4 or 5 times. Every time I get more and more impression how far the desire of the young heart and the strength of Kai and Gertha can fight for what they believe. <br /> <br /> And the whole story is presented in this way, you just get on the plot and before you know it, you're there. you see ... yes, there is Kai ... on the mirror ... jump a little .... there is Gertha, fighting for his love ..... and there is a snow queen ... <br <br /> <br /> It's great love, adventure, tension. <br /> <br /> It's great in 10 out of 10
