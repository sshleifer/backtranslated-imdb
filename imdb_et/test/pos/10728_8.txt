I thought this movie was pretty good and quite entertaining to the emotional film. I agree with what the other user wrote when the script makes sense for the three main characters. I think that's what made the movie good. It wasn't like Mr and Mrs Kramer's condemnation, and it was refreshing, I think two people would basically see the work on their own and finally make the best for Billy. And although it was somewhat strange, I liked the music of this movie. For some reason, the music seemed suitable for the trip that the three main characters started. This movie ran quite well and did not doodle, as some emotionally heavy films tend to do. It dealt with a serious situation but did not take it too seriously. It just talked straight ahead and worked quite well.
