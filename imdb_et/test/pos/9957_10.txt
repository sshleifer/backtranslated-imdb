Shakespeare's "Venetian Merchant" was at least half a dozen silent film versions and there have been several TV shows. But no one has ever played a big budget theater function. . . until now. Given the character of the game / most memorable character, Shylock Nasty is a Jew, it is a good idea that the little inconvenience that appeared in Europe in the late 1930s and 1940s could weaken the enthusiasm of filmmakers. Of course, the main motivation for Michael Radford's new film is to offer Al Pacino the chance to shout, scare, shout, mutate and torture - all he's doing is very good. Like Richard III, Shylock's role is the landscape chewer's dream. It's ridiculous to call Shakespeare an anti-Semitic because he never met a Jew. The Jews were banned from England for 300 years before his time up to decades after his death; and it is unlikely she ever traveled abroad. At some level, the Jews could also be mythological races. But although Shakespeare may not be anti-Semitic, his game is definitely. Pacino gives Shylock a strange accent that is likely to be the smallest hint of Yiddish. Unfortunately, the result is a 16th-century money worker with fuzzy deafness and cadence from Fozzie Bea. The Radford version begins with an indexing of the Jewish wretched terat, and then mark Antonio (Jeremy Irons) to Shylock (Pacino), who is really just about holding his business. Be sure to buy it out of DVD! Sarge Booker
