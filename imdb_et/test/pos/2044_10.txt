I love this movie ...! I've seen it on 1000 x DVD and I can't say enough about it. It's all, comedy, awesome action and incredible stunts / fx. Samuel Jackson steals the exhibition here for a long time. I don't think it is at the moment that she is not funny! "Everyone knows that if you make a assumption, you will do you and feed your ass!" F / x is great! The bridge / truck explosion is incredible, though the sound is not so great! When Samuel goes out of the truck, this is a bit of a sound and what he says is invaluable !!! For those who own this on DVD, put the sound in French !!! It's halarious !!! Even the emotional moments are great, as the bad boy discovers that Sami / Charlie's daughter is her, it's great ... It's a great movie that can't be done without a fan of action ... I also recommend Cutthroat Iceland ... negative disclosure, it hits !!!!
