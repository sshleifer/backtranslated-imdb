My kids loved this movie. we looked at it whenever we could. It was a fun movie. we looked at it as a family and all of us enjoyed it. it was a film that can be viewed without the inconvenient spots you should explain to the younger ones. my boys loved this movie and they would like to see it again. even after all these years they remember it. jw.org en Amy Jo Johnson was a very cute girl. all my boys broke him. they loved her as a pink power source, so we looked at it at the beginning of the movie. (as you can say I hit a little to fill the lines LOL). but seriously this is a fun movie and worth it. Disney let us DVD or replay!
