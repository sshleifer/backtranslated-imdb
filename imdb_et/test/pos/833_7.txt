After seeing Undisputed 2, I knew what to expect from Isaac Florentine. <br /> <br /> Shepherd Dog: The Border Guard is a decent flick (not Van Damme's best, but definitely not his worst). VD support cast, but it makes sense. <br /> <br /> The story and the graph are all done before, so it's not new. I mean, it's Van Damme. We're not really expecting a great amazing plot? So let's talk about what we all want to watch this movie: fight. <br /> <br /> I didn't think of anything, I was thinking about how the movies fought and shot well as the better VD in recent movies, such as Second in Command, where the whole final fight is HORRIBLE. The Florentine behind the camera and when you have seen Undisputed 2, it seems that she knows how to fight and enjoy photos. Some struggles for sheep dogs reminded me of VD's older things we all want to see. The fighting was good and I said "hah, awesome" a few times loud. But I hoped for a little more, considering how good I thought Undisputed 2 was. <br /> <br /> Something I found intriguing was VD's daughter in the movie, I thought "wow she's hot". her Bianca Van Varenberg, JC's true daughter. I've never seen her before so it was a nice treat. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is not half bad. Yes, this story has been done before, but at least JC tried to make a good movie. Next time, add more hands to fight! I think he still has something he needs to make another big budget movie ... his behavior has improved because he's made DTVs and he's really in good shape. those who think that most of his DTVs are really good, except Derailed. All he needs is to get back the "bleeding" shape and make a martial arts movie ... and I think people would respond well, even though he's not jet Li. This movie is definitely worth renting. =)
