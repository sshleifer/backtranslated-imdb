Sad and nostalgic pass through the late Chrysanthemums, the Japanese author Mikio Narus's 1954 film, which is now going through his long inaccessible film thanks to James Quandtile Cinematheque Ontario and The Japan Foundation. Based on three readings by Fumiko Hayashi, the late Chrysanthemums speak of four retired people, who are now middle-aged and whose life is full of disappointment and regret. The performances are equally prominent, especially Haruko Sugimura, who played Ozu in late spring, in the movies of floats and Tokyo. Sugimura depicts Kin, a former Geisha, who has no children and only lives with his younger servant who can't speak. <br /> <br /> He has become cynical towards men and has paid attention to money, especially to real estate speculation, and by lending to his friends Nobu (Sadako Sawamura), Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa) and Tom (Yuko Mochizuki), all former geishads. Kin's friends live in a few situations and complain about how Kin is greedy and Tom is spending a lot of time with gambling to agree. Both Tom and Tamae lose their children. Tamae's son leaves to work at coal mines in Hokkaido and Tom's daughter has decided to marry an older man. Both are in conflict with the change of their situation, but will inevitably come against it. <br /> <br /> Two male friends Kin, Seki, a former mistress with whom she once weighed double suicide, and Tabe (Ken Uehara), another lover who she waits for years later. His mood is good, but soon he gets angry when he discovers that two men are only interested in borrowing money. Naruto cuts between two extended sequences smoothly when Kin stops between Tabe and Tom and Tamae due to the loss of their children. Dialogue is extremely natural and the characters are violent women, who, although their future does not seem to be bright, refuse themselves only as victims. The late Chrysanthemum has the simplicity, humor, and stoic acceptance of life in Ozu films, and it is a bitterset reminder of the slow passage of time and comfort that memory and companion can bring along.
