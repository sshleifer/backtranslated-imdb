The first time I saw this movie, I wanted it for so many reasons, but I just didn't. It seemed a bit boring. But there was a small question I had something I saw at the beginning of the movie, so I looked at it again? and finally it clicked for me. For the first time, I watched a movie that knew the "end of surprise", and although I would definitely not recommend you to finish it, I have thoroughly enjoyed most of the film and discovered many seemingly insignificant events that all show a very embarrassing pattern. <br /> <br /> I don't think everyone loves this movie or even like it. If you like any actor, you like this movie because the actors are pretty strong and they all have a lot of screen time. If you like mysteries (namely, Hitchcock), this movie likes it. If you like an independent or psychological movie, this movie likes it. It really worked for me at all these levels. If you do not like actors, mysterious plots or psychological elements, you may not like such a movie. But that's your loss. Personally, the only thing that shook me a little was the accents. Good to try, Alan Rickman, for the American dialect, but it wasn't much better at Die Hard. (The amazing voice is a strange accent.) The number of accents in the film was a bit odd, but it was not so disturbing that it became difficult or particularly irritating. The change of the scene from the scene to the scene was obvious and could disturb some people, but I think it adds scenes (or the scene? I can only really remember one scene where the change was very different but it worked). <br /> <br /> If you see this movie, watch it at least twice. The second time you see it, I hope you understand how complicated the plot is. Every time I watch this movie (it's less than an hour and a half so many views aren't complicated), I seem to notice something else and think, "Why was that just?" or "Was it deliberate?" I like movies that make me think. It does. So just look at it. Twice.
