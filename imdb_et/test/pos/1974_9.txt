yes i have noticed that there are still 347 other comments, i think this is a good sign for the movie, even if some of them are negative. I've seen this movie 2 and a half times. I adore it and look at it again. it is very smart, but I understand why some people hate it. they don't get this complaint. Yes, I have a strange taste in movies, but it's a great movie. some lines are just as fast as the whole Chinese restaurant. I started to laugh. it and when he was on the assembly line, he spoke to the contact. The Jude Law was excellent, although it was humorous, he tried to cover his wonderful accent. anyway, i don't consider myself a movie goddess as some critics of this movie and if you have nothing better to do than write pseudo-intellectual movie comments about the movies you hate online, I feel sorry for you. why don't you write about nice movies like me. I just love how everything ties together, it keeps you away, though you think wrong. the end was interesting and not superfluous. it was pure wise. I do not compare it with the matrix because I think people will get the wrong idea. I went to this movie, waiting for something except the Jude Law and Sci-fi. I was blown. I have no other kronenburg movies but I love it on my own. another wise thing was hidden from the dog. be sure to check out this movie.
