I just looked at Jean Renoir's wonderful film, French Can Can. It is visual pleasure and great entertainment. Compared to the recently produced Moulin Rouge. I did not get the praise of the last film. Now, more than ever, I am convinced that my rating was right after I saw a masterpiece like Jean Renoir's story. He managed to get big performances all his pain and the great French actress Jean Gabin was in a rare form. The dance series near the end was one of the most exciting things I've ever seen. It was long, but I didn't want to finish it. This film deserves more recognition than it is.
