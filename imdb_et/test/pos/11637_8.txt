(*** Small spoilers ***) <br /> <br /> If there is anything in the world of silent clowns, it is that Charley Chase could never get his well-earned "break" in movies. Oh, maybe it's not as strange as it is ever full-length. But when I think about it, this explanation makes it more mysterious - why didn't Chase Chase have any bids to play the lead? One explanation is that his character, no matter how much fun, was just too realistic to fit a longer story; without the burlesque elements that Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, Langdon and other comedians had, it can be assumed that the comedy he did and that worked so well for twenty minutes would become repetitive with another roll. However, I don't buy it because Chase's gag design is great and could, I believe, best keep the interests of viewers longer; at least I am tempted to think about it when MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE launches the show. <br /> <br /> Mr. Deer is not beautiful and Mrs Moose is hardly a "classic beauty"; he has the really biggest teeth of the planet, and he has a very big nose. Both take plastic surgery without knowing the other, and when they meet randomly a little later, he doesn't recognize his wife and he doesn't know his man. Several fun misunderstandings start with many smart paws. I don't think I'd discover anything else to make your viewing more enjoyable. Because if you are a fan of quiet comedies or even if you are not, MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE offers so many memorable moments in such a short space of time that I would look at it as a shame not to see it; fool really, but no less extreme.
