Many things in this futuristic satire are theoretically more fun than actually funny (though it has some ridiculous moments), but there is a lot that the studio seems to be better cut, idiots are mocking. Many situations must not evolve, obviously over-displaying the display material and the worst narrator explains everything (most of which need no explanation), probably because some previews did not understand what was going on. In other words, the film that talks down is ... you guessed it. <br /> <br /> One of the hopes that a longer and better version of this comedy will end up on DVD and it will become a cult animal it deserves, but even in this distorted and somewhat comic spirit, this year is one of the most memorable films that is disgusting against our culture and all the ways that have become stupid, stupid and stupid. a nice name for yahoos. I looked at it right after the dead land, George Romero's last milking one idea that consumers = zombies, which is basically the same point the judge does; moreover, when Romero's counter-culture perspective (now zombies = sub-class that has to attack the rich) seems hopelessly outdated, the judge is fresh, dead and much more annoying. Just listen to your movie in public with yahoos who look like this president for Camacho Land, as well as their screen colleagues, and you know we're all doomed.
