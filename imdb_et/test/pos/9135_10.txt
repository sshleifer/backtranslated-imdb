Jean-Pierre Melville is the director I have just introduced (I need to see Bob le Flambeuri and Le Samourai to fully understand them), but looking at Le Cercle Rouge (the red ring allegedly based on a speech) Buddhism) Today I realized I was looking at both a skilful and a criminal as I saw for some time. Though his film has a dialogue, it is mainly the running of the film scene with the plot. What warned me, even in seemingly expressive scenes / sequences, was the emphasis on the movement of characters or behavioral patterns. Melville has a story and she is careful to take her time to say it (it may seem boring to some, but it seems to work because she puts a little more emphasis on the weight of characters / environments). <br /> <br /> However, look at each of the four main players: Alain Deleonit Coreyna (just released prison, which is a new hero), Gian Maria Volonte Vogelina (escape and demolition with hand-cuffs in custody), Corey meets happiness ), Yves Montand Jansenina (old man with many years of experience in weapons, Vogel's friend) and Andre Bourvil as Matte (an experienced researcher looking at Vogel and his toe affairs). All of these actors play their parts accurately, sepa- rately, and all have their own moments that show the audience what their personalities might be like criminals and policemen. The order of the hosts, for example, gives little clues, such as how the Vogel police-a-knows a woman's way down the hall, or how Jansen takes the piston out and has only the content (and what dream of this man) creates). Even the Corey movement, which involves a woman's photo, is of interest. <br /> <br /> Because the story is absorbed and cool, and the skills were so great (Henri Decae, editor and musical result of editing by Eric Demarsan), it is on the screen. what is enchanting, how they remain against their nature and ideals. Not only is it 140 minutes to encourage Melville's atmosphere, the French new wave enthusiasts and the movies of today's criminals may not be a memorable film. A lively cinema that is still one of my favorites of all time.
