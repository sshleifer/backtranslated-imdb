Although this film does not have the darkness of books, I think it is an excellent film. It's a fun fun fun with beautiful Stuart Townsend as Lestat. She may not have light hair and blue eyes, which are so vividly described in the book, but it is fair that she does not look good with blonde hair and Lestat is definitely good. He moves like a predator I always imagined Lestat would have. <br /> <br /> Visual effects are pretty good and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing. It's not an interview with a vampire, so don't try to compare them. The interview is the story of Louis. This is a Lestat cut and pasted version. In any case, I recommend.
