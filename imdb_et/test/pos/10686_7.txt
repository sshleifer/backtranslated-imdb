In this film, astronauts sent to discover a newly discovered planet have to deal with several dilemmas and they do it wisely. The film approaches the theme of its main plot in a unique way and opens it gradually, although it can be anticipated. <br /> <br /> Actress is very good, though sometimes stiff, as some of the 60's may be. It can also be somewhat verbal and even melodramatic, especially after the plot theme appears. Visually, this scene is reminiscent of last year's "2001: A Space Odyssey" and which tends to keep the movie going. Some actors have noticed the "UFO" in the 1970s, which is a delightful camp and is worth watching on DVD. <br /> <br /> Despite these small points, space flight itself is realistic and weighed in 1969, the scenes inside the spacecraft were also realistic. (See also the use of video technology from the 1990s / 2000s!) One thing: I suspect that the scene of love has been cut, but I can't prove it! Anyway, it would have been annoying. <br /> <br /> Unlike most Sci-Fi movies, this movie thinks about thinking and it's worth watching. I'm glad this movie is in my video library.
