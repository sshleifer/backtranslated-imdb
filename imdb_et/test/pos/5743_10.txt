Forget Samara / Sadako and Jason ... <br /> <br /> Horror has a new name: GRANNY. The plot is simple but effective. The actors are good (two "Michelle" and the murderer fingers) and the dialogues are quite clever. From the beginning to the end, the action leaves you breathless, you just can't get out of it ... There is blood, terrible murders, funny moments and a feeling of perversion that goes beyond any rule. "Deja vu"? Certainly NO: "Granny" is not yet another slash, it is really a classic ... It deserves the success it had, and its reopening is even more successful. Congratulations!
