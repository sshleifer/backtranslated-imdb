I've often heard people express disappointment that Mazursky's "Tempest" has little to do with the original Shakespeare. In my opinion, this is both true and false, but above all it is a bad starting point for criticism. The artwork should never be criticized for what it is not, but for what it is. "Tempest" is not something like the faithful transfer of games, but I believe it is faithful to Shakespeare's spirit. So what is "Tempest", perhaps the most successful experimental films of all time. No, not experimental as in a handheld camera and mumbled in a dialogue, but experimental when you look at the convolutions of the story without overestimating office revenue. The Mazurski Temple is an epic, sad, realistic, cheerful, full of life, but above all it is imaginative. The portrayal of Philips / Prospero Cassavets is worthy of itself is 10/10, and if you add Gena Rowland, Susan Sarandon, the wonderfully deep Molly Ringwald, Raul Julia, dialogue, music and a subtle hint of scattered throughout the picture I'm talking about my case. One of the best films of the 80s. Don't miss it.
