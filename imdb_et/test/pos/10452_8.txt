This is one of the best and lowest rated teen movies ever made. <br /> <br /> I saw it grow up and it was and is one of my favorites, maybe not as popular as "Quick Times", but just this movie has a serious side, as other reviewers mentioned it starts between comedy and morphide in the drama about halfway through. This is the beauty of it and what distinguishes it. You get it all. Humor (as opposed to "fast time"), drama and great soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think every child entering high school should see it, it would give an idea of ​​the trip they're going to go. What kind of child does it look like in SONEONE? The fact that it is getting so seriously halfway though is cool and just brilliantly done. You don't even see it coming. There are certainly many surprises. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS: DO NOT READ HOW YOU ARE NOT KNOWLEDGE. <br /> <br /> Excellent knee-lifting humor. Between Gary and Camilla?). I can still hear it: "Oh my strong strong burrito !!" Invalid Price <br /> <br /> Some scenes between Gary and Karin are difficult to track (especially the coarse end scene). There are so many women like Karen who would have made the exact choice that she did. Think about it - how many women do jerky men with golden hearts (like Gary)? I know I've done it and so many women I know. This film inspires the debate and, despite the many times I've seen it, I still admire the filmmakers and performers. Everyone finds someone who is involved in this film or is more likely to be more than one person. <br /> <br /> Finally, the used music is just great (lots of cars, u2, lots of obscure (now) songs) of the 80's 80's purists.) <br /> <br /> But don't make a mistake It's not the movie that makes this movie unique, it's the story itself, plain and simple. One of the best about it and I make the movie classic.
