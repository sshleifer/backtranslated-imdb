Perhaps many viewers who are disappointed with this film live their lives without thinking deeply about themselves. At this point I would like to point out that "distant" is not just a film in the art house, but one of the best art films. Of all the films of the works of art that have been seen, "distant" is what really appears to be a striking gold. It is even fair to say that portraying cinematography and human emotions in this film outstrips Tarkovsky's nostalgia. One commentator got it right that this sex, the funny, common appearance of foreign films, is surprisingly lacking in "distant" and good ways. Most remarkable is that the "distant" is that it takes into account the details of life that we usually ignore, and the rich nature of our existence, which is often buried under the din and visual extravagance of our commercial world. Fortunately, "far" is not enough to save the audience, and what we see on the screen is a bare portrait of people.
