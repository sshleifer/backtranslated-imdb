This film represents the soul of today's "elite" food culture, although the film is 17 years old. The basic principle of the film is: food is more than just a nutritious substance. It is also a powerful symbol and culture itself. The main characters broke the best wine and food, inspired by idealistic thoughts and culture when they were released from their purity and passionate board games. The short-sighted Karen Blixens uses the difference between northern Europe and southern Europe, emphasizing essentially different approaches to food. Because the strict and rather dull Scandinavians get the infusion of "Eros" in the south, the party goes. What are you waiting for? Go see it ..... again!
