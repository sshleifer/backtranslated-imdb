Hi, I have to say that here is the wrong information. The main author was Richard Carpenter, he created this series. Later there were other authors, but they did just a few episodes. <br /> <br /> The first director who made most of the series (I think the complete series 1) was Ian Sharp, who created Robin's special look Sherwood. <br /> <br /> Clannad really saw some material and read the scripts. I know it for sure, because last year Richard Carpenter spoke to England from Con Inglis. <br /> <br /> I think it's a masterpiece of Television-Entertainment because it has great characters and cast, good costumes and a great story line. I still have one of the best TV series!
