PLOT SPOILERS !!!! Dr. Boch (George C. Scott) is the Chief Medical Officer of the main NYC hospital. She left her husband, her children have abandoned her, she is impotent, drinks a lot and weighs suicide. There is also a migrant killer. Then he meets very strange Barbara (Diana Rigg) and falls in love. He wants him to flee with him - but can he completely give up his old life and start a new one? <br /> <br /> A very strange film Oscar has won in Paddy Chayefsky's script. It is the main character of suicide and shows us a hospital full of overworked nurses and doctors who work inappropriately. It succeeds (somehow) that it seems pretty funny. It's not a laugh out of humor - it's a very black humor. The actor is also right - Scott is big here (and Oscar nominee). You will see him trying to keep his peace of mind in a totally bad situation. The character of Riggs is more than a bit strange, but his actual act works and he is also incredibly beautiful. The script is strong and brutal - but never too much. I think it will hit the ball at the end of a situation that is moving too high - but it's still worth it. If it had been taken seriously, it would probably be impossible to do so. Also look at Katherine Helmond in small quantities and Stockard Channing and Christopher Guest in unpaid bits. It was difficult for me personally to take it seriously. What I've heard from hospitals is bad in the 1970s, but not anymore. See it for actors and scripts. I'll give her 7.
