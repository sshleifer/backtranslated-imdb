It was a great movie that was just 67 minutes long. In this movie, there was a film movie aspect and I'm glad Nolan chose it in black and white. The plot is simple but entertaining that keeps you at work. Even the dialogue was good with the example. It reminded me of what came to Mementos if not in chronological order. I liked how the protagonist tried to use what Cobb taught him, for example, saying "everyone has a box" that he put on his personal stuff. There was also a Batman logo on the writer's door, which seemed ironic because Christopher Nolan later directed Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, two more big films. After all, there is a big twist that I don't intend to spoil for anyone who hasn't seen it, even though I thought what would happen if Cobb gave a young man's D Lloyds credit card. I also liked how the writer was a copy of Plato's favorite philosophical books of the Republic. This is definitely a movie that you need to look at more than once to get its full side plus it's just an hour long. There's also a circular aspect, ending where it started, what I thought was pretty brilliant.
