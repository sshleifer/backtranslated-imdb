I admit that this movie was terrible, cheesy, sexist, poorly dubbed and poorly edited, but I still loved it. I saw this movie for the first time when I was 14 years old and it has stayed with me ever since. FYI, it's very close to pornography as I remember. Certainly my juices got flowing. This flick gives Swedish eroticism a whole new meaning. This is a humorous sexuality seen by hot Randy female aliens who think they are looking for just a few sperm for their dead race.
