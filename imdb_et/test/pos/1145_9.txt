Wind and lion are a wonderful film. It is a monument to what film once was, but no longer. <br /> <br /> Connery, despite the thick Scottish brooch, plays Raisulas very well. He inspires the viewer in a way that many badges can't. <br /> <br /> Candice Bergen, in one of her early roles, is admirable as a kidnapped social lady in Pedacar, showing courage in the face of accidents (and many). with humor). Excellent movie, rent or buy and you won't be disappointed.
