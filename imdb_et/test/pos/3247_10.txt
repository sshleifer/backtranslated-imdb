Before I start my review here, the Australian slang has a quick lesson that can help you to watch the movie and understand some other Australian and foreign comments. <br /> <br /> The Australian slang "straps" is a pair of rubber sandals (which must not be confused with the same American word regarding the exposure of substrates), "stubbies" are a short Australian trademark, "stubby" is a small bottle of beer and "stubby owner". is a foam insulator for a small beer bottle. <br /> <br /> If you like black comedies about small criminals, you will love this movie, uncomfortably many people in IMDB who have weak stomachs and do not know dark humor you have reviewed this movie, which unfortunately changes this movie more central than what it is. Many reviewers have compared it to Lock / Stock and Pulp Fiction, while it is the same genre, it is a completely different and original style. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers are also using this movie using Heath Ledger's characters with a dead brother to open and direct the narrative of this movie, despite the film's attention enough to realize that his brother was killed by the same villain who wants to kill a harsh character, explained in the middle of the movie, but not clearly enough to make the most of them understand. <br /> <br /> This film also resembles Lock / Stock and Reservoir dogs, as it is the debut function of the director / writers and the debut feature appreciates it and these two films Actually Lock / Stock and Reservoir Dogs appreciate this film director / writer's debut 10 / 10, unfortunately, unlike Tarantino and Ritchie Jordan do not fulfill the expectations of their next films such as Ned Kelly. br /> <br /> This movie is definitely what you sho uld add to your DVD collection and is one that keeps many views quite easy.
