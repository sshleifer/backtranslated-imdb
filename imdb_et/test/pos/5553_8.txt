It's a great off-the-wall romantic comedy about love, work, public taste and the average crisis. The main character is a talented film director who decides to make a silly PG-13 movie to get out of hockey with IRS. It is a great cast, with a large amount of humor (from death to a table) and fine writing. It's also a tough film industry. The meta-comment contains a number of great cuts between reality and the film made, and in some places the film differs from strict realism. The result is a multi-dimensional masterpiece with nervous spiritual humor.
