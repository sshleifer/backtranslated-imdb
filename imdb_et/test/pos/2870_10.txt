Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight, he lives in a burnt old hotel where eight serving convicts go for cleaning. Most of them die except 3 of them. In my case, this was neither the best writing nor the best. I still thought the slaughter scenes were really well done. Like when a girl eats hungry dogs. The best thing to do was pull the mobile phone out of the Blonde Girl's mouth. Kane was a serious horror movie actress, she was serious about watching the whole movie and it would never change. It was his only appearance for the whole film. Great action and killing, I don't think I can give 10 full of 10, but 6 looks good.
