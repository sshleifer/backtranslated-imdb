This is one of those Tweety and Sylvester cartoons that made this legendary pair the only popularity of Bugs Bunnyle looney Tunes. <br /> <br /> In addition to all the duo stocks (Sylvester feeds the garbage) jars, "I tawt I twet the kit tat" line, etc.), Tweety's SOS also stands for Granny, one of the supporting characters they Warner Bros.'s classics were rich for their color and taste. The time the cat and the bird are on the ocean liner is the creative and lively gags extracted from this situation. <br /> <br /> What day was comic book history when Friz Freleng decided to tie his left-wing Robert Clampett's little yellow bird to his Sylvester.
