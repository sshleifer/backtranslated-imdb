This film started production before World War II, but it was not published until it was well underway. While there was significant fascist sympathy in the US and Chaplin was suspected of communist compassion, the great dictator was a very bold endeavor. Such threats in film-making - in thinly hidden political statements - would be almost unthinkable today. Imagine if someone were to make the same satirical film that criticized US foreign policy? <br /> <br /> This movie is fun, embarrassing and tragic. The tragedy is that Chaplin is claiming madness, but it's late - for him and for us. You must see if you have any interest in history, filmmaking, politics or sattire as an art form.
