The disgraceful descent into psychological and physical oblivion, which undoubtedly burns with the brutality and suffering of the war in its cortex, just like many other films. In fact, there is not just another warfare like it would be. <br /> <br /> Director Kon Ichikawa saw Hiroshima's unthinkable horror for the first time only 10 days after the bomb had fallen. He has said that from this day on, his task is always to express the meaningless, empty violence that people cause to each other and to themselves. <br /> <br /> Mr. Ichikawa tells us that there are no winners in the war, because the way to victory and defeat has been paved by the same soldiers marching down on the road, which only have death and destruction at their end. <br /> <br /> Mr. Ichikawa will be able to bring his message to the world through this ghostly cinema.
