"Flipper" The Universal Studios version (1996) is a good heart-warming film for the whole family with good values ​​and sentimentality. This is the story of Sandy Ricks, a teenager from Chicago who spends her vacation with her uncle Porter Ricks in the Bahamas. It will eventually change the life of teenagers and it will grow in the process. He learns to appreciate nature and respect the environment. I grew up in the 1960s and the NBC TV show "Flipper" was my favorite childhood. Elijah Wood is perfectly cast in the 1990s Sandy Ricks and delivers excellent performance. As I liked the NBC TV show and MGM theatrical films with Luke Halpin as Sandy in the 1960s, I liked this feature the best! I feel Elijah Wood is the best Sandy Ricks. As for Luke Halpin, I feel Elijah Wood has more ability and emotion to act as an actor who makes his performance excellent and credible. I think Elijah Wood is the best young actor who works in movies today. The scenario was also written by the director Alan Shapiro, who has done the excellent work of both the film and the writer and director. Paul Hogan gives a comic and pleasing performance like Sandy's Uncle Porter Ricks. Hogan's performance is an excellent compensation for Elijah's role in Sandy. I'm a big fan of underwater movies. This film was beautifully captured in the Bahamas, such as "Thunderball" (1965 UA). Photographer was Bill Butler A.S.C. "Jaws" in 1975. Mr. Butler is a very talented operator. The underwater leader of photography was Pete Romano. He did an excellent job with underwater cinematography. I enjoyed Joel McNeely's movie score. The result of this good film was Crosby, Stills and Nash among other talented artists. This movie was filmed in Panavision like "Thunderball" in the 2.35: 1 Try, if possible, to see this movie as the original version originally designed and seen by Alan Shapiro and Bill Butler. Another very nice thing is that Mr. Shapiro gave a small part of this original "original" to Sandy Ricks (Luke Halpin). He portrayed in Bounty Fisherman # 3. It was a very kind gesture from Mr. Shapiro! As you can say, I'm the true fan of the movie. Unfortunately, most movie critics met this beautiful film with harsh words. I originally saw this movie on my birthday, May 31, 1996 in the cinema. That meant a lot to me. I have it in many video versions. VHS versions are "pan and scan". The laser risk version is "letterboxed" 2.35: 1! I even have VCD 2.35: 1 from Hong Kong, which is "letterboxed". But my most precious possession is the "original" 16mm theatrical print, which I treasure for all my life! Thank you, Shapiro, Elijah Wood, Paul Hogan and all the people involved for making this memorable film! <br /> <br /> P.S. I have to add that the quality of Universal DVD is great! It's the best DVD I've ever seen. Color and resolution are remarkable. The soundtrack is great. I think Universal must use the same transfer to the DVD they made for the laser disc version. The 35mm print is a "mint" and Alan's film really looks great. Great respect for the great movie! DVD resolution is even better than a laser disc! It's just remarkable! Thanks for the excellent quality control and transfer of Universal Home Video. Many thank you for doing a great job with this wonderful family movie. Many also thank you Alan for all your great goodness !!! It's a real honor for you to know! (Revision revised / updated on 27 June 2005)
