When this exhibition first appeared in the air, I saw it one or two times and thought it was another "fat boy, skinny woman" that seemed to be in the net. It was just "okay" during the initial viewing and I didn't look at it again; but when I got the syndicate, I got several episodes (just because it was twice a day), and I tell you the more you look at this example, the more funny it is. When you see how all the great support characters are connected, this exhibition will make you laugh out loud. Every new episode I look at is more creative than before - people who watch it a few times don't notice it. The writing and story lines are much more complex than they appear at first (not far from Jim). First, Kevin James is a hysterical, incredibly charming and talented comedy actor, as well as supportive cast. Leah Remin has a great timing and Patton Oswalti Spence is one of the funniest characters. And of course, Jerry Stiller is great as Arthur. I was shocked to read the comments that he was the worst part of the show - he is a huge part of why this show is so big - his ridiculous schemes (rounding the character of a mad father) are fun. And shouting - the best episode is when they show him "Lemon Icee!" This episode, during which Carrie leads him to the therapist, wants to treat him (to less stress on Doug), guest William Hurt decides that Arthur screams because he is never validated. The last episode of the episode, where Doug captures his childhood beyond the therapy session, is one of the most creative scenes I've seen on sitcom. I feel the strange need to protect this example, because it is seriously underestimated - although "Friends" were sometimes fun and "Raymond" has some great episodes and characters, both lacked the creative touch that "Queen of the Queen" has. In an age where most sitcome has been conserving jokes and who is at noon, "King Queens" continues the pressure of the sitcom envelope and shows a true comic genius. The critics of this exhibition obviously cannot - or have not looked at the example enough to give it an opportunity, because anyone with a real comic and creative sensitivity must laugh at the time of viewing. This is definitely the ridiculous tone of my two other favorites, "Seinfeld" and "Office". It's Arthurs, Kramers, and Michael Scotts on TV that keeps us watching and laughing out loud.
