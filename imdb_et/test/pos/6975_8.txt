I have a letter from Mrs Knight who went to college with her older sister. He talks about the difficulties in making a film. He himself was a pregnant - an interesting link to a film plot - and the beginner's director was uncertain, quite green and had great difficulties with all decisions, logistics, etc. It was very hard to shoot. <br /> <br /> The film, which has a strong debut for James Caan, is still effective and influential. This is a great show for the talents that Mrs Knight has shown throughout her career - on television, in movies and on stage, where she won Tony "Kennedy for Children". <br /> <br /> This movie is outdated.
