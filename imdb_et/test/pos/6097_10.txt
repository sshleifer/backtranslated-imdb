This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It is about true love and friendship. Switching your life and doing something else. Thomas Bo Larsen can play the same role he has performed in so many other films, but lately we have seen him in other roles, which he does very well. But what if he plays the same role he has done in other films? it is ideal for this role. Ulrich Thomsen is doing a good job. These two criminal "little lives" are the best friends ever. They share everything and do everything for each other, no matter what the cost. When they discover that Peter's daughter is being abused, they are all stuck (things that you can't hold on if you don't have to commit crimes yet) and take her to the right place. They do the best they can? these two men are not heads, but they have their own heart in the right place. Can I say that Peter and Carsten are my greatest heroes?
