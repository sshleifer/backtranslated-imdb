When I entered this movie, I knew two things about it. I knew it was a real extreme flick, and I knew it was somewhat artsy. Both turn to me by themselves, but when they come together, it can be truly unique. And it was a fucking right, no doubt unique. As I said before, this is an artistic film. The way they used some intense sound reminded me a lot about Aronofsky's movie. Visually, I haven't seen anything like that. Cinematography and lighting took place very well. The film uses the visuals seriously and sounds better than anything I've seen for a while. Especially when you consider the experience of these young filmmakers (20-year-old couples), you really have to take your hat off them. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to describe or even discuss a movie. There is no real story. You could say that it turns right and left on the brain and how they control their lives? It has four segments, or four ideas that have been implemented through visual and audible extremes. There are some talk about hearing and there, but this is mostly a non-talking film. <br /> <br /> The first segment is the shortest and rotates bare body and eyeball. Try and guess what happens? The second segment is my favorite. It includes a brother and sister (who looks like Sarah Silverman, but with bigger breasts). The brother is crazy and the sister is a little whore. I would say that it is the most extreme and best done in all segments. The gore effects in it were great. The third segment revolves around bare people having sex with their motherland. This bundle is probably considered to be the weakest, but it is still smart and well done. The fourth segment is probably the strongest film and I say the deepest. I myself have to look at it a few times to understand what is actually being said. I know it deals with Christianity in the way that most likely makes your mother tired or throw? Try it. <br /> <br /> Unconscious cruelty was recommended to me and I'm proud to say it's now in my movie collection. It is an extreme, violent, gory, very sexual and surprisingly pretty way of thinking. The next line I say is used in almost every reading of this movie. "This movie is not for everyone." It's not the truth now. If you are in extreme movies and / or are just a movie lover who wants to see something different? 8 1/2 outta 10
