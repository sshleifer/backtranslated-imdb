My friends and I saw the film AGLIFF (film festival) in Austin last night. This movie was one of the best I saw this year. It was a great comedy - very original and cordial - and FUNNY AS HELL! Everyone in the audience was laughing throughout the film. Texas is a big country - with many small towns - and of course a lot of young people who grew up as "fat girls". I know many people are involved with this film on a personal level. Ashley Fink and Robin de Jesus were fantastic - they were so big in these rolls, it was like the script was written to them. Speaking of the script, it was very well written (very plausible), and Ash is a great actor (his facial expressions helped me just strangle). It's an independent film - but don't let it fool you ... It's good! Seeing someone so young is a caliber of this work, it's really inspiring.
