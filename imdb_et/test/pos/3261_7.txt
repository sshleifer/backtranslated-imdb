"Two Hands" is an entertaining, funny story about the Australian lowland. The scenario contradicts the world of fast money and deadly action from the inexplicable fate and circumstances. In a subtle way, we are asked to think about the concept that the great events of our lives are sometimes created without being fully aware of the root causes. Fate and power take Jimmy, the main character, for situations that lead to the realization of his low dreams and ultimately to a personally more promising world. The unimportant sense of Heath Ledger, imagined by absolute Jimmy, is a boy who grew up without a chance. The world of high-solvency crime offers the greatest appeal to its blunt senses. Friends' love and help guide him to a higher level. <br /> <br /> The film is well-managed and well-functioning. The band of criminals gets into a pleasant and despicable way, keeping us interested in their crazy masters throughout the film.
