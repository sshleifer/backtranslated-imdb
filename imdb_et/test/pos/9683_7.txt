Despite the obvious structural similarity with the Simpsons - a loud-fat father, housewife mother, 3 children, a pet, a typical suburban home, the Family Guy is actually functionally and stylistically opposite to the Simpsons. Its tempting use (and sometimes too much) has been the main stay since the first season. While some hit the nail (Rhea Perlman and Danny Devito are a bit of a backbone in the 5th season), others are less successful, coming over as they have. And they can be annoying, especially if they don't promote the story. (The bits of Jesus are completely uneven and offensive) <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Stewie and Brian Griffin is perfect for pure comedy so much that Chris and Meg can only fulfill the role of mandatory teenagers in your typical dysfunctional family. <br /> <br /> Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story is MINDNUMBINGLY awful. Thanks to his goodness he went straight to the DVD. <br /> <br /> Unlike many years of Simpsons, Seth Macfarlane's attitude to the Family Guy is really very different - it is much politically wrong and amazingly coarse. <br /> <br /> The creator of Ren and Stimpy, John Kricfalus, exclaimed Family Guy for having "extremely low" graphics standards from a cartoonist point of view. I don't think it seems so bad that the details and accuracy of some spoofs are quite successful. ranchikastmes and ass jokes.
