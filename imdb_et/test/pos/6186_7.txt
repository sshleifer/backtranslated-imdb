Years before the pre-wedding arrangements became a regular thing, Ernest Lubitsch made a comedy on the screen on which they were based. Bluebeard's eighth wife includes Gary Cooper, who lives on the French Riviera, who has been married seven times and now marries Claudette Colbert eighth. But with Cooper's good sport, he always lives with his former women for $ 50,000 a year under a contract they sign before they get married. Sounds like what we now call a pre-wedding arrangement. <br /> <br /> Of course, Claudette wants more and she finds that Cooper takes a very similar approach to marriage. He would like a real deal and is ready to go to get it. <br /> <br /> Bluebeard's eighth wife has some really funny moments, the initial meeting of Cooper and Colbert at the men's shop, where Cooper insists she wants only a pajama cup and Colbert's only looking north. And of course, my favorite is Colbert, who strikes down and blackmail Detective Cooper sends him to spy. Herman Bing has the best supporting role in the film because it is a self-evident, dirty detective. <br /> <br /> I have often wondered how to get so many people back in the Hollywood Day who are not in French. such a movie. Of course, Cooper America and Colbert are cast in the only French background. Although David Niven is as charming as ever, being French is ridiculous, he is so British that the Finn is. </Amend> in the old days.
