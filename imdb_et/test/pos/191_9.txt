Director Mikhail Kalatozov's film "Cranes Flying" (Letyat zhuravli) is a brilliant cinema. Based on Viktor Rozov's scenario, Kalatozov, on the basis of his game, shows us a vision of the heroism of war and the suffering of the people at home. Surrounded by countless warfare films that show us the front lines and carnage, the subject is tedious and avoidable. But this Russian pearl shows how the story of the difficulties can be said differently; telling us about the soldier's mouth, how all the war hates, that they hope that those who died did so to allow the end of peace and struggle, we see a new WWII vision. We have young men voluntarily to fight for peace, keep their families and loved ones safe at home, not fighting in the battle they don't believe. So much hatred of our present situation in the Middle East and how people are dying for some reason, their will, it is nice to see a film showing how these soldiers are self-defeating and heroic, as well as those who are waiting for their return. <br /> <br /> Communist Russia shows how everyone was involved in the war. Although Boris could voluntarily go to the forefront, his father was in the hospital of the main hospital to help injured soldiers and his sister help him and his girlfriend Veronika, doing everything he can to keep his mind. the fact that no letter has come from his love. The whole city comes out to send the boys out during the holidays. Even in the factory where Boris and his friend Stepan work, the representatives send with gratitude. Whether it's all a glorious look at Russia at the beginning of World War II or not, I don't know. The protests and resentments of these boys do not endanger their lives for their country, it is all praise and thanks. Some in America could learn from this because either you agree with the war or not, protest and destroy the destruction of that name only by those men and women sacrificing every day and every day. <br /> <br /> action is top-notch, but some deserve to be excreted. I really enjoyed Antonina Bogdanova's small role as Grandmother of Boris. He is one of the family members he can trust and his sadness on leaving is his face and his body language. Vasili Merkuryev, as Patriarch Fyodor Ivanovich, brings the best result. As was finally said, when dads need to reject hidden tears, Mercuryev imitates these feelings. He puts on the harsh outside, especially the bursting jokes and riding his son hard when he discovers his volunteer activity only an hour before he has to leave. But when Boris leaves for a meeting point, we see the man's real pain, sitting at the table in sorrow. She loves her son dearly and, although she can't show her, she publishes all the film's activities to the audience. Aleksey Batalov is effective as a happy young man and an idealist who does what he believes is Boris, and Alexander Shvorin is good as a terrifying Mark who will stay home or perhaps just steal his cousin's love because of his talented piano skills. This love of Tatyana Samojlova attracts the audience with its grief, fraud and sheer shine of hope. The real star of the movie, he has to go through a lot of emotions on the way, where he loses his way, needs to get back to the course, hoping he did so fast to return to Boris. <br /> <br /> In addition to the realism of hope, but also not afraid to use the tragedy to get over the subject, I also loved the visual style of the film. Sergei Urusevsky's cinematography is amazing, especially when the movie was screened in full screen. One thing is to create stunning compositions on a widescreen panorama; it is completely different to do it in a square frame. Right from the start, we wrap the beautiful static picture along the sidewalk along the water, the bridge on the top, as our two lovers miss their way up. There are a number of cases where the camera is behind barriers that still allow you to see the action, creating a unique spatial depth and interest at any time. Sharp angles are used, as well as careful blocking to allow the combination of frames and exaggerated characters. <br /> <br /> True punches are these long strikes. Finally, Veronika was tracked by the mass of returning soldiers, it was great earlier when he drove through those who say goodbye to his loved ones when he was looking for Bor, his own goodbye to say. Planning this shooting must be extensive, because when it comes in and out of people, the camera focuses on couples' kisses, people shouting at each other, and everyone else that is specifically in moments when the camera moves. Everyone needed to capture their brand precisely and it brought a brilliant cinema. This is just one part of the overall masterpiece of tone and style; Cranes on Flying shows how successful placement and mise en sc√®ne can be to show the audience what it needs in the simplest way possible. The composition and professionalism of the actors and the team can work wonders by adding something that huge sets and special effects can never do.
