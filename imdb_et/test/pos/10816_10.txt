Bon Voyage is fun for the audience, because it combines the necessary foolishness of comedy with just enough beauty to keep the audience active and invested in the results. Most importantly, the film is also historically instructive; it includes the tension of the "fake war" and later the flight of the French aristocracy in Paris before the German attack. But Bon Voyage is not a "war movie". It is a comedy about the lives of a handful of people who are placed in the background of extraordinary times. Bon Voyage conveys a broad spectrum of responses to the nation's nation and to the new French political solutions on the brink of chaos, confusion and emotional confusion. This film is an audience, an entertaining romance that skilfully uses many clich√©s and tale of a handful of people whose people are falling over them.
