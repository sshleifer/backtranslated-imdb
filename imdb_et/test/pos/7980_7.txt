With the "Batman Returns", Tim Burton went to the top of the American cinema: another hit. Three years after the year's most successful film "Batman" (1989), the hero of Gotham City again comes to the pleasure of many spectators. Like its predecessor, Batman Returns was a huge commercial success. Tim Burton once again returned to Batman because he believes that the latter won his enemy Joker little to improve Gotham City's reputation. Indeed, violence and corruption still exist, and here is another word for Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and penguin (Danny De Vito). The two cheaters who want to drive Gotham City make Batman's life difficult. His task is harder to show up with Catwoman ... <br /> <br /> Tim Burton has done a lot of work on the terrain and seems to have been trying to fix the first film. This means that the director gave the opportunity to fight sequences that are better managed than the first Batman. But he did not forget the psychology of this major figure. When in 1989, Burton focused on Bruce Wayne / Batman's psychology, here is the penguin who is interested in him. The director attempted to do it, and De Vito's vague character worked very well. On the one hand, he is full of bad intentions (previously quoted), but on the other hand he is looking for his past and wants to be considered a true man. <br /> <br /> Batman Returns also appears as its predecessor, especially cast. I mean Mich√®le Pfeiffer, who offers bold and powerful results as Catwoman. Besides, while writing this review, I remember that the new Catwoman version is now in the cinema. Considering the bad comments (three out of ten IMDb!), It is certain that his performer, Halle Berry, will be defeated by Pfeiffer. it allows the development of Tim Burton's uniqueness. We still find weird and gothic. As for Batman's other screen adjustments, you can skip them. "Batman Forever" (1995) and "Batman and Robin" (1997) are not good. I heard Christopher Nolan shot the beginning of Batman's story and it was to be released next year. Does it fit with Tim Burton's work?
