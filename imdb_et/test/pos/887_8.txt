I saw the movie in my North American premiere (July 14, 2004) at the Fantasia Festival. I was a little disappointed because I had been waiting for more epic, ensemble-cast film by Musa Warrior. Instead, the movie only gathered a much smaller number of characters. The film, however, was solid, thoughtful and visually intriguing. The dark and realistic shades of intriguing and realistic tones, intrigue and blood became a slightly lighter tone compared to lighter, milder martial arts sequences. It almost seemed that the filmmakers could not think about whether the film should be a "flick" or a historical epic of martial arts. The story obviously concerns the need for loyalty and the need to adapt to new situations. Is it really worth your life and your friends' loyalty to your master, or is it time for you to face the winds of change? Maybe there is greater courage in leaving old ways to new ones? How do you decide? These questions are raised in this movie and ironically, there is a suggestion that this answer can actually be wrong!
