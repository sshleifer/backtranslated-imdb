I saw this mini-series when I was in high school. I remember that it is absolutely brilliant and convincing. At that time I didn't know any British actresses but since then she has learned that some of today's stars, including Sean Connery (original James Bond among many other roles), are Judi Dench (Queen Elizabeth in "Shakespeare's Love" among many other roles) and Eilene Atkins (apparently best known for "upstairs" or "lower floors", but also for many acting roles). Like another commentator, I would like to see it again. I'm sure the production will remain timeless and I hope it will be released on VHS or DVD. If you have the opportunity to see it, don't forget it.
