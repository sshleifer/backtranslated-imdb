STMD! is one of the most fun and enjoyable low budget movies I've seen for some time. Director Jeff Smith (who was also co-author, operator and editor) will definitely show his love for 80's horror movies with this film! Anyone who loves the 80s horror movies, twists and turns, mad and stereotypical characters will definitely love this very language-in-cheek respect for the past. <br /> <br /> STMD! definitely lives on a poster and then some. It has all the "excessive violence" and "free nudity" that resembles those who entertain 80 horror films. I watched STMD! From the 80's equipment, stereotypical characters carry blood-blowing silly, which I just couldn't!
