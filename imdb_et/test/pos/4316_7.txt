Indeed, Cynthia Watros is in this movie as she talks to Elizabeth Desmond. Although I just mean how he became a "rehab patient" (?), Where Hurley also tries to reduce his weight (as seen in previous episodes). <br /> <br /> The last episode is really stopped. The end is not so clear. I think the writer was waiting for the audience to arrive for the season 3. <br /> <br /> I hope that the next season will shed light on the more unclear / hanging events that took place. <br /> <br /> Just can't wait for the 3rd season.
