In the original French version, Numérobis jokes (big, funny voice - Jamel Debbrouze) are very funny. <br /> <br /> But in the translated versions (I saw the German and English versions) it is not half-good as the original: <br /> <br /> But: special special effects, almost complete comic (with differences like Lügnix's drawing ( The German name) is placed in another comic book. <br /> <br /> Of course, the Asterix comic book is a cult, but when you look at animated cartoons from 1968 to 1998, you will see much better jokes, a better story and the old "charme" of the cult stories and " elegance ". <br /> <br /> For French-speaking people, I recommend that you look at it in the original version, with or without subtitles, if available in different languages.
