A good story that worked with unexpected signs, eg. cruel murderer gangster Bryan Brown taught his son macrame. Although it succeeds as an active drama where you expect a good boy (Ledger) and his girlfriend to succeed, he also has some fun ironic black humor, eg. bank robbers who become radio winners and their reaction, busker revenge, and so on.
