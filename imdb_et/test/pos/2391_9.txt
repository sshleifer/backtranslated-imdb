I found the movie very interesting. I really enjoyed the movie where the actors were great. It was entertainment. Benny's uncle was wonderful. The end was great. I suggest you see it. The girlfriend of Eddie Mores reminded me of a bit of sandra, which she was sharp on the nails. I also like the little girls in the movie who were very convincing. Benny reminded me of my friend who really lives his life, growing in Brooklyn. I loved this scene where she tasted a pot in a pot because that's how most people feed. I watched the movie 2 times and learned a second time more.
