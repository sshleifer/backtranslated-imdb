I've never read Sarah Water's book. Although I haven't read the book, the 3-hour movie is very interesting. It starts with a twisted end with an interesting tune. I have to say these two actors are amazing. Sally Hawkins has successfully portrayed a lover's beloved love and love. Their romance is slowly flourishing as they spend more and more time together. The scene of love is very gentle and emotional, well-functioning. The end is quite intriguing and the two ended eventually after the blessings. In general, this is a great movie that is a very interesting plot with great performances.
