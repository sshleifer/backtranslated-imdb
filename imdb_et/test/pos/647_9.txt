This film is a kind of social commentary on how our lives were pulled out of control in the 1970s. This film plays more of something that Mr Schlesinger threw in after a bad day on the road. Mish mash extracts about the nuts emerged along the highway in Florida, and along the way of life, the cast is mostly wasted and probably ended up cutting the room floor. The problem is that what DIDN'T didn't get to the floor of the cutting room should probably be! Now available on DVD, it's fun to see comedy that would cost $ 100 million to produce if it was done in 2004. It's rolling and it's not too hard to sit, and oddly enough, in 2004 we're still pretty much <br /> <br /> jumping in our cars and moving faster and faster.
