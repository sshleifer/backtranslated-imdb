I'm not saying anything about music because this topic can be so profound that it can become one big separate review, so we focus on a movie that is brilliant ... Undoubtedly, Forman is one of the best works. > <br /> A simple story of love, friendship, freedom and ideals ... oh yes, the ideals for which even pacifists are ready to go to war ... <br /> <br /> No fake words, single fake character , a story of a fake feeling, because love, freedom and friendship are not complicated for movie characters. These things are not something "everyone can look at from different angles" These are not things that need a lot of thinking ... their love is simple, their friendship is easy, their ideals are simple as the word "simple" themselves and that's the reason why these characters are so deep. <br /> <br /> Berger, a gentle leader, plays Treat Williams, a man who lives to live and this is his greatest happiness ... he has his ass - (as he sings in a movie scene) and this is enough to satisfy her property ... <br /> <br /> Berger never accepts that nothing can be done ... and his right ... If he wants to go to his dirty old clothes and big hairs at some rich party, he does it ... if he wants to go to another country to just see his friend, he does it ... he never thinks twice ... he just does it. <br /> <br /> How? why is he so powerful? the answer is simple: because he is FREE. <br /> <br /> Just look at how the wind makes this movie's hair and you understand it, maybe you're free.
