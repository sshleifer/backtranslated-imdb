Dennis Spooner's "Department S" was a shiny thriller showing an attack on Interpol in Geneva, designed to solve the incomprehensible secrets the police could not handle. When a plane landed at Heathrow on a board when a man was found in a moving space in London, when a Rolls Royce passenger suddenly turned into a skeleton, when a train that pulled the pipeline up, died of commuters, you called 'S' to sort things out. <br /> <br /> Peter Wyngarde played "Jason King", a terribly dressed criminals' literature whose fruitful imagination helped many strange cases to break. The king hit the fiction of the public and later became a spin-off show. He was helped by American "Stuart Sullivan" (Joel Fabiani) and the pleasant Annabelle Hurst (Rosemary Nicols). At the exhibition of the 1960s, the black man, Sir Curtis Seretse (Dennis Alaba Peters), was in charge of the department, and when the show seemed to be like the "Avengers", it was hardly surprising. It shared many of the same writers and directors! Colored headlines were designed by Chambers & Partners and are worth it alone. Like so many I.T.C. series by Edwin Astley. His theme "S Department" has become ranked as one of the best television themes of all time. <br /> <br /> It is expected that this show will be a little sexist and dated, but don't let it convince you. Imagine the hybrid of 'Jonathan Creek' and 'Austin Powers' movies and you have 'Department S'! <br /> <br /> Trivia Note: The episode "Small Nerve War" features the young Sir Anthony Hopkins in a big role!
