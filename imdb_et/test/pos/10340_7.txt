The plot of this movie is just as stupid as a hair bag. Jimmy Smit plays a character that could have been a story of ridicule. He's bad and a woman. It's as far away from your NYPD and LA Law roles as you could get. <br /> <br /> If you think he has a look and actor to play a really bad guy role, he will be there for you. <br /> <br /> But !!!!!!!! Mary Louis Parker wears black mini pants and small black mini pants throughout the film. <br /> <br /> He has always been one of the biggest feet in film history. This makes the film worthy of the admirer of its feet. <br /> <br /> That's why I buy this DVD only when it was available.
