The American film by Chris Smith is an in-depth study of the American dream. The film focuses on Wisconsin's independent filmmaker Mark Borchard. Mark has dreamed that he was a teenager, a great writer and director and had a special hi8 camera. The film follows Mark's attempt to make his dream movie Northwestern. The movie has a number of fun scenes because Mark goes through Northwestern pre-production and later his short film Coven (pronounced co-ven, proper pronunciation, Mark says, "Sounds too much like an oven,") that he is going to use to raise money to supplement Northwestern. The review and humor of this movie is Roger and Me, Michael Moore's big film. First I looked at it at the chaotic Sundance film festival, which brought out the spirit of the film - a giant air channel fell at the beginning of the ceiling at the beginning of the film, hit seven people and caused a 25-minute delay; On the side of the film, the sound began to glow and the projector had to stop and the projector stopped and the film burned in the last 20 minutes. Despite the delays, the audience missed the film and gave him a standing stand. At the end of the festival, American Movie also won a jury award for documentary. I recommend this fine film that is worth sitting through a hellish screening.
