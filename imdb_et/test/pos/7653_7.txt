I stopped liking this movie, but it wasn't the easiest to review. What makes the movie big is music and landscape. The songs are beautiful and the musicians are talented. Great work was done to show the different settings of the Roma people. <br /> <br /> But the viewer was not well-run. The deeper history of the Roma people would have been nice. Only a fraction of the words spoken were given to English subtitles. In addition, there would be more explanation of the settings and who their and some of their challenges were. It would have helped if the narrator explained the customs, dress and music.
