12/17/01 All I can do with this film is to impress the impressions. I wasn't given "changes", I don't know "scores" and I'm not trained in the genre. I always had problems after the chord changes (trumpet player, y'know), so I was pretty well limited to basically "remembering" and communicating about it. What struck me with this incredibly fashionable piece of black and white blues was the knot that gave me the head and heart trying to figure out whether to go with the band or choose a path along the tune. went to normal setup; I got lost - too deep, extensive, over head, probably. However, gas was trying to keep pace. I admire the actors to play the theme and story. I didn't see things or other things that others seem like: I didn't feel that the light skin gal was "trying to go through" as much as it was unquestionably about color problems or trying to ignore it - at first: later he came back. The young man (his trumpet noodling mas ridiculous) was ambiguous, ambivalent and - perhaps his best feature - far away. What did I think, after this provocative piece, the closed shadow curtain is the basis for it? Is this the way to find "reality" by creating a stage, reflecting expressive characters, and giving a melody and theme? Is it more real or more real than a well-written script - without editing and editing? Is the hero of improvisation "artier"? Where is the truth more or clearer: in retrospective art / craft or production and reformation? Well, I'm still missing on this issue. I loved the movie; it lost me in a cool blue foggy night where I just had to go home and go out of the horn. Guess? I broke out with the twelve bar riff that was tried and true - I couldn't mislead myself. The reality is just too scary. jaime tells them 7 and more. I'm in a break.
