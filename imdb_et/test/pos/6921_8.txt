tell you what it was great. Dylan Moran is just the funniest actor on the screen (and on stage) and Micheal Cain, if your partner is not so bad that both are big to watch a really funny movie. True, not all gags come out, but it is worth sticking to those who do it, but come to Micheal Caine in this dress (the whole entrance fee is worth it) and every time Dylan Moran is on the screen more like Bernard's black films. The story is two actors (Moran and Caine) who decide to steal money from a group of gangsters by acting on different personalities to fool them all, but that's a different thing. basically "actors" is a great British comedy that many had missed by many, seriously than your Moran fan (or want to see Micheal Caine's dress) be sure to see it
