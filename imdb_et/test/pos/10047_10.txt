I saw this movie at Christmas and what a great movie it was! It talks about Custer (played by Errol Flynn) during Westpoint's end and after. Although I've heard that the film is not historically accurate (Hollywood never), I still enjoyed it because I knew little about the real events anyway. has since become my favorite actor! Working alongside Olivia De Havilland was great and the end was fantastic! It brought me close to tears because he and Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy) drove their death with a small horn. , and I grew up watching her movies as a child. But only when I watched this movie, I realized how big he really was. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie out of 10 out of 10!
