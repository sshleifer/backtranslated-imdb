When I get rid of the modeling sector (as a model), I look at this example slightly differently than most of them. Although I admit that the ANTM can be a fun and entertaining play, it seems that during the seasons it continues from any reality. <br /> <br /> The show seems to be almost pure disclosure to its competitors. none of the winners (or co-competitors) of the exhibition have shown their name under their name. Perhaps because the truth is that every girl who has a real potential to be a high fashion model should not have too much difficulty submitting to the agencies (this can be done by email or snail if the distance prevents you from attending an open call to the agency) , signing to the agency and starting a modeling career. Yes, the process does not guarantee success, but it is probably not ANTM. Participating in a reality exhibition seems to show less momentum in the modeling company than signing to a top or decent agency (which only one competitor in each cycle is guaranteed in any case). <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the show can't hurt, it may be fun and it has some sort of magic that works especially for teenage girls. Although I have to add, the ANTM can become cumbersome and boring after watching several cycles as it has changed for me. And in addition to some unrealistic situations (every time the latter is outrageous), the only other irritation is "Tyra, Tyra, Tyra!" Tyra seems to really want to manage these girls successfully, but is it necessary that the temporary digging of each model be covered with Tyra images; almost every panel and challenge to add to the story or scenario that "Tyra" experienced and won? I don't think so. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, take the little Tyra, put it back into reality and ANTM could be a 10-star show instead of 7.
