What often threatens to become a nervous and soft-headed drama about misunderstood middle-class young people, John Frankenheimer comes up with a surprisingly shaded and weakened film (his first, though he had started on television, directing, among other things, his earlier version). <br /> <br /> We are still in the semi-mythical 50s when teenagers were driving shoes and jeans were still dungars. James MacArthur (playwright Charles and actress Helen Hayes, later Hawaii's 5-0 Danno pop culture) enters a small incident in the cinema that extends to the leader (Whit Bissell). police station. His father (James Daly), a keyfob producer, calls, doesn't listen to his son's story, and pulls the strings out to get him off. MacArthur, however, wears his shoulder, which even his sympathetic mother (Kim Hunter) cannot fall off. Things get worse on the Coldwater Canyon farm until MacArthur tries to prove himself, the stage of the original mid-term print .... <br /> <br /> Film does not hold attitudes alone? and Clich√©s? since then, but gives them a remarkable nuance: every character gets audible; every aspect has its own advantages (and the response to the film depends on what the viewers bring to it). There are mistakes (the word "crummy", the usual rebel euphemism of the era, used about 30 times too often), but the strengths surpass them. The film has strong support (the most important among them is the excellent character actor James Gregory, a police detective) and a decisively unhelpful way to tell his story. From the point of view of the new millennium, it can be seen that the hot water MacArthur gets a little gentle, but Young Stranger remains honest and respectful. <br /> <br />
