I absolutely hate the idea of ​​television films. For me, TVMs usually involve Jane Seymour or Jaclyn Smith as the mother of a sick child who dies of a ill-treatable disease, all done in such a way that the audience needs the necessary tissue for insulin. So when DEADLY VOYAGE a made a TV movie BBC and HBO based on a real story, I remembered a couple of years ago, which was on TV, I sat unexpectedly meaningless. I was surprised. <br /> <br /> No last hit, I wasn't surprised I was shocked. Here's a TVM that grabs you more than a big white shark, in fact, DEADLY VOYAGE doesn't deserve it to be timed on TV, what should have been done and distributed by top Hollywood film company thanks to an absolutely terrible situation and what it is more - unlike PAPILLON and SLEEPERS - totally true <br /> <br /> For those who don't know the story !!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILERS TO USE !!!!! sometime in the early 1990s, a number of Africans were deployed there to place a French freighter there. Of course, this was an attempt against illegal immigration, but the merchant ship had already been fined for allowing illegal immigrants to board their ship from a previous trip and no longer wanted to get into the sea and immigration authorities when the team murdered Africans after they discovered they hide in the repository. Everything but one of Africa, Kingsley Ofus, who manages to get out of the burning game, but who have to try to survive on board, but the problem is that the team hunts him and France is still traveling for several days. <br /> <br /> Remembering the goodness of DEADLY VOYAGE above. What a remarkable story, and again - unlike many stories that claim to be - is absolutely true. It's very well written, guided and acted, especially by Sean Pertwee (Why isn't this a big name star?), And above all it's a tight claustrophobic disturbing thriller that I remember for six years after seeing it one and only time. Look forward to seeing you again. <br /> <br /> But you have to ask yourself how can TVM be better than most Hollywood blockers who came out at the same time? Wait, I just had a worrying idea about Jerry Bruickhiemer, which makes Tony Scott's lead and Denzil's Washington play with Kingsley, Brad Pitt, who plays the role of Pertwee, a massive artistic license, etc. VOYAGE superlative TVM, not bad blocking
