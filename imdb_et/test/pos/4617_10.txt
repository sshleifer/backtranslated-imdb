I have to admit that I found myself in a cynical trap to believe that Australians can't do drama if it doesn't mean much crying, and I'm from Australia. Sad, isn't it? Although this film does not include crying, its not dramatic crying, its honest emotion shines through. <br /> <br /> This movie is also funny. I knew what the end result was when I looked at it, so I tried to guess who did it. I missed a mile. <br /> <br /> I was stunned when I found the manager, Mural Thulluri was only 21 when he made this movie. I'd like to shake my hand. He knows how to make a movie. I hope he is more coming. <br /> <br /> All the characters we encounter before heading credits (about 12 minutes) are an anti-hero. They all worried in their own way and they were all selfish as the following. Even if they are sympathetic. <br /> <br /> The saddest scene in the movie and some that are hard to see are the last scene where we officially introduce the real main character and we've told our nephew. This scene made me cry. <br /> <br /> My belief in the Australian drama has been restored. We are masters in comedy, but I was bored with comedy. <br /> <br /> Mural, when you checked it, touched my soul and that's why I can only thank you.
