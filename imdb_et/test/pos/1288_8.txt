The emergence, which was blinded by one of the lighter stars of modern noir, is sure if it is limited, in play and obsession. Nolan, who was filmed for zero bucks, was unable to choose a better topic than London's sloppy and delicate bottom due to lack of funds. This short (67 min) is best played with the audience and the protagonist's expectations of who is scamming, although the initial design rings some alarm signals in the Trust Department. Mud cinematography (which he often used for natural lighting due to the budget) can mostly be screwed up for stylist-styling, although the constraints show from time to time. <br /> <br /> These efforts can easily see the Nolan style; In MULJO and INSOMNIA, many of the same blurred identities and expectations are repeated. Not a masterpiece, but a good one and definitely worth looking at modern noir and Nolan fans.
