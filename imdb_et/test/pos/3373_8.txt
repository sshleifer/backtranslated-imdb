Forget about Donnie Darko. I open it up because it seems that a good part of the reading I've read from The Box is a simple but weak argument that he doesn't have a Darkole candle. It's not that I don't necessarily agree with it, I just feel that this movie is a completely different animal and deserves my analysis. There are certainly comparative points, but these are peripheral problems if you think the heart of each film is different. In Darkos, the driving force of narrative is existential. In The Box, the driving force behind narrative is due to moral dilemma. Believe me when I say that I understand the tendency to compare innovative filmmakers by looking for trends and patterns, but for me it is more important to approach each new film as an independent entity and then expand my gaze later. <br /> <br /> The box is one of those films you get mixed feelings because it seems to be in some sort of identity crisis. It's not always sure what he wants to be. Rotations are numerous, but easily traceable, if not predictable. James Marsden and Cameron Diaz are playing relatively unbelievable pairs of newborns in financial power. The key containing the "unit" button reaches their door and is reported to a terribly burned person that when pressed, the button causes one person to die, whom they do not know, and they get one million dollars. One of the things that the box achieves is to create this invisible fear that there will be moral consequences for our actions somewhere. Before pressing the button, it is terrible and seductive, tempting, but bad. When it is pushed, events start to turn these two causes into question their morals and deeply regret their fate. <br /> <br /> The idea that the box is an experiment is interesting because it gives me a paradox for the film. If there are external beings who develop a "altruism coefficient" based on pushing the buttons and not pushing the collected data, when the conspiracy does not speak, we notice that ultimately it is forced altruism: be innocent or the species is destroyed. I think couples do not know the consequences of their actions when they are faced with making a decision, but they have no reason to suspect that the box can do something, why would they choose altruistically? Is altruism devalued by the fact that we care about it only when we present a problem in our own lives? <br /> <br /> The psychological barriers of this movie are everywhere. Press the button or no, it's probably somebody confused with you. Get money or not, no one gives anything for free. Finding the truth, the answers you find, slowly show your death. <br /> <br /> I suggest that the box is ironic because it offers the wrong choice of free will, revealing that we are trapped in many metaphorical boxes. You can choose to be free at the expense of another life, is it freedom? No, this is just one box, because then you will stick to the consequences of your morale. We have no escape because we live on earth and this is the second box. That is why the ultimate creatures in the film are finally antagonists. They demand that we meet the moral standards that rob us of our freedom. We did it to Mars and we burned it and turned the sick into slaves. <br /> <br /> Links to Jean Paul Sartre illustrate this point quite well. "You can only enter the final chamber for free or for free." Of course, but whatever form we enter the chamber, it is still a chamber. <br /> <br /> Trevor Nemeth
