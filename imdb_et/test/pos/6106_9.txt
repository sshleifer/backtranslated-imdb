Margaret Colin is the main figure in this story; when I watched it, I remembered a bit of Adrian Lynes's "Unfamiliar" as Diane Lane's neighbor in the neighborhood of tony NY. <br /> <br /> This movie was surprisingly good and Diane Stillman deserves a credit for the exact depiction of the class, crimes and misdeeds that actually occur in high-quality neighborhoods (condemnation !!!), it is real but not too dramatic; the audience lives through his accident, the pain he caused; it is more than just a question of a good person, as Colin talks to his wife .... is a character of one character; and should they be condemned for ever because of their actions? Questions are relevant; It is also fun to see several cinematic references to Martha Stewart (i.e., sly, embarrassing mother), Colin is proud of her friends that she is "the perfect hostess with perfect genes" .... (gag); and the scene where the police are facing Colin ("friends" betray him later) .... <br /> <br /> The denial of American society and facades are directed; (Oh, murder does not occur here, similar to the theme "Ã„ Season in Purgatory," by Dominick Dunne, Martha Moxley for a real murder, Greenwich, Connecticut); Colin is aware of his crime; but knowingly finds himself on the facade until he finally breaks down, rent or buy the movie; he is an undervalued actor, who is doing quite well in these roles.
