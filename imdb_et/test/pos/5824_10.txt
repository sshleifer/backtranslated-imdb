HBO created this exhibition to see the most realistic view of the prison and they did the job. Oz was created by the creators of killing who wanted to show the prison version. This exhibition is the one that launched the idea of ​​other HBO original programs such as Sopranos, Sex and the City, Wire, Arliss, Deadwood and Six. Oz is the nickname of Oswald State Penetentiary, a fictitious prison in some US countries. The main prison unit looked at the exhibition Emerald City, a seemingly ideal prison unit with more privileges than others thought by the liberal unit leader Tim McManus. In general, this exhibition shows us what is really pleasing when it comes to living in prison. <br /> <br /> Oz has about 10 gangs. First of all, we have Muslims, a group of blacks who want to destroy the injustice of the criminal justice system and help to improve black living conditions everywhere. They are headed by Kareem Said, a black military minister who wants to destroy all racist ones against the judiciary. They are not as white as a group, but rather against injustice. Our second group of blacks is Homeboys, who is essentially street blacks who want to keep all bad ghetto behavior and drive drug trafficking. Their management varies mainly because they always lose members due to violence. In this group, one of the most frightening characters is Simon Adebisi. Adebisi is an African prisoner who is essentially the most frightening nature of evil. This gang as a whole gets occasional help from Irish and is always in conflict with Latin and Sicilian for drug distribution. Being mostly Oz, Homeboys has the most soldiers in any gang. In Sicily, the most important word is how illegal activities are conducted in Oz. Latinos know their presence so that they can at least roll well if they are not under control. Unlike Homeboys, however, such gangs do not have as much internal power struggle and are usually more stable in drug use. The Irish people mentioned above are the smaller gang led by manipulative and snakelic Ryan O'Reily. O'Reil always manages to reach out to good grace with drugs and manages to manipulate things whenever he wants. They are not under illegal control, but they are at least in good condition with all of them. <br /> <br /> Among whiter prisoners we have cyclists and treasures. Cyclists are just a number of tattooed drug addicts who help the Aryans most of the time. Aries are the most angry and hate gang for most Oz viewers. They are led by Vern Schillinger, one of the most racist, worst and sadistic characters. Both gangs do not control anything illegal but simply let darker inmates see that they are a serious threat to anyone who thinks all white prisoners are soft. We also have others. Others are a group of strangers who may not be a problem for any other prisoner. In this group, we see Tobias Beecher, an attorney who accidentally killed a young man whose life has been changed forever in prison. We also see Mount Augustus, a black wheelchair man who kills a policeman who tells the exhibition and introduces the audience to every prisoner. Character crimes are shown at their introduction and Augustus tells us how long they are in prison. Finally, there are Christians and gays among the gangs. Christians simply remain religious in order to keep the spirit and ghosts of many traveling traffickers who are often raped by other prisoners. <br /> <br /> This exhibition will thoroughly cover many criminal matters. As the language is unchangeable, here we have more racial epithets and cuss words than any other TV show. Augustus Hill's comment gives us a good opportunity to truly understand each Oz problem. This exhibition is as good as it is not light to medium heart. It clearly shows the use and distribution of drugs in any way, the rape of a prison, the murder, the lethal cleft, and the general gore that someone else has seen. In my opinion, this is the most influential and greatest exhibition ever created, but at the same time I see why other people are disturbing this example. If you are interested in exhibitions and movies from prison, Oz must see it.
