Samuel Fuller knows war and is one of the only leaders in American film history who could accurately portray its terrible experiences in the form of a film. His pessimism and idealism, if it sounds a little strange, mix up, works for him as a storyteller, and at the same time he always tells the truth, though it is brutal (or put into melodramatic constructs). However, Verboten is dealing with post-war experience because we only get open scenes with a large number of soldiers. Opening is like a big exclamation mark that seems to continue in the rest of the scenes: a dead soldier on the ground, the camera is put up, we see another soldier who has shot down in a war-torn landscape. Simple, direct language. Subsequently, Fuller picks up something interesting for the intensity: the title song played on the open credit is both irony and sincerity and then Beethoven's music between the Americans and the Nazis. Sgt David Brent (James Best) is shot, the battle goes on and then he goes over to treat his wounds. <br /> <br /> It may be that this is somewhat common in the WW2 flick (somewhat in the fact that Beethoven and later to some extent Wagner cannot be found in these pictures), but that is not the case. Instead, Fuller does this "Coming Home" -type movie, though not at all in the sense that "this soldier is injured and so on and so forth". Instead of really going home, Brent stays in Germany because he has fallen from head to head Helga (Susan Cummings, pretty good at drawing a German accent) and wants to work to a lesser extent in the army to marry him. She doesn't understand that a) she wants her more money to get her and her brother's food, but it gets complicated emotionally at the point of a little naïve but affectionate Brent, and b) there is an underground Hitler youth sect called werewolves who want choose as soon as Hitler ended up small, despite the group's claim - attacking the government that has now been turned on in Germany to give them, as Brent describes, a "blood transfusion." "With the addition of the Nuremberg trials, and (as Mr Fuller himself has said, the fast and smooth history of Nazi war crimes), we get a wide-ranging view of society in the narrow area of ​​the immediate post-war environment, although the year Zero went to Rossell in Germany. : First of all, there is a love story or a tragic fall in a man who does not see a thing of the past that he thinks it is reasonable for his wife and child in such a way that he cannot leave until he reveals that he is (partially) disappointed. and Cummings with Harold Day, Helga's young, confused brother, are the most emotional, they are not very simple parts of the B-film, even though they could have done it, then there is another layer of political, societal struggle, and the mentality that Fuller is doing Nazi general non-gray area sensational.: They are evil, especially if they cancel the cause with their ends <br /> <br /> Finally, the style layer that strangely sucks. This is probably one of Fuller's 'talc' movies, which is not a bad thing, given that it is one of his best written scripts, because the characters do not speak easily or in too many tiles (except for a small scene where two characters talk about Hitler's young minors) as criminals, which, in fact, according to Fuller's autobiography, are probably another layer to consider in the subtext and the 50's film period). And Fuller strikes it in almost real European style if he does not intend to fight scenes or battles, because editing is not always very fast and sometimes there is no cut for a whole minute or longer. This has created a strange tension, especially when there is something that is characterized by something that gives one another a wild or suspicious one; Fuller can easily go to a large family, but there is more to the bad and cold quality that two people would not move in a conversation without a simple over-shoulder transaction. But if this is required, such as the massive robbery outside an American military office or the Nuremberg film material that is linked to Franz's memories of werewolves, Fuller can be as stunning as ever. <br /> <br /> Very hard to find but worthy of being a director or fan of WW2 movies in Germany or just history-buff- Verboten! is an intellectual experience and a strong emotional experience, the casting of which is better than expected of B-film and the attitude of "another", which is equally exhausting and thought-provoking.
