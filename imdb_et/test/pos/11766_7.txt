Not your usual movie, but good. Billy Bob is very funny in this movie about how he speaks, etc. I was a surprise when I saw it, because I thought it was a normal comedy, but it was more. It had a very good story, great characters and a good balance. <br /> <br /> Favorite part: probably when Billy Bob runs around with his clothes rippers
