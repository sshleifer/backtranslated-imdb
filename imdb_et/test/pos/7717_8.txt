How exactly do gay Asians in such a culture lead, which generally refuses to recognize the concept of homosexuality? Millions of gay Hindus and Muslims seem to have little hope of ever leading a life that is accepted and confirmed by very close knitwear. This is the main point studied at Chicken Tikka Masala - probably named after the Western spicy dish, which contains delicate pieces of chicken fillet! Jimmy is a typical young Asian who has grown up in the UK by traditional parents with common narrow and selfish views of marriage and grandchildren. Like millions of others, he is led by an organized marriage that seems inevitable, although he is probably completely gay and deeply involved with the very attractive young man he lives with. He knows the truth must be said, but he is afraid of the consequences, especially if his father seems to be ill. And so he gets a scam network that expands and expands when the plot develops. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully sensitive and not at all decisive or patronized by any of the depicted groups. Action is generally excellent, although at times it may seem a bit of a ham, as the director tries to look for humor rather than have it bloom on flowers. There are no prizes for photography or scripts, but the film makes a completely endless mood, expressed at the end - a mood that all fathers would learn well all over the world.
