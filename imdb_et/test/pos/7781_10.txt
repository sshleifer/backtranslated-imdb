This is my favorite love story with all the elements that a good love story should have. Poetry, jazz, friendship with the ups and downs. Finally, a film showing the positive aspects of the black community. Larenz Tate was great, I can't imagine anyone else playing Darius. He read this poem as he himself wrote it and meant every word. I own this movie and if I had time to look at it every day, it always makes me better and what a good movie should do. Nor could Savon be better at dealing with the subject of marriage. We all would like to find Darius there, but most of us just live to watch this movie. My voice is 10/10
