This film seems to have been overlooked. Someone should release it to VHS and DVD. This is a great movie and much better than Brooke Shields, which was terrible. <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons deserves more credit than he does now. It would be nice if all of his films were on VHS or DVD. Jean Simmons was and is still a very good actor. He was definitely a beauty. In fact, it is still beauty. He has done a great job in T.V. He is so much better than many acting actors today.
