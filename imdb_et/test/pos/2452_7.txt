Not for those adrenaline mania, etc. This is a good film, looking after the war, a psychological problem, from another perspective. <br /> <br /> Emilio Estevez is a great young man haunted by the demons of the Vietnam War, causing problems in the family. <br /> <br /> Marin Sheen is also a good conservative father. <br /> <br /> It's all a problem to deal with the past, with whom <br /> <br /> the character of Emilion Estevez does not seem to be dealt with, and Martin Sheen does not want to deal with it. <br /> <br /> The defending mother looks at this problem with a warm and open heart, but her reason is closed for obvious reasons.
