The film begins with a terrible housewife (Norma Shearer) who discovered that her husband (Rod La Rocque) had deceived her. Three years passed and apparently they had been divorced during these years because of infidelity. Strangely enough, during that time La Rocque did not see Shearer or his two children because Shearer took them to Paris. <br /> <br /> Marie Dressler is a rich lady of society and has invited a new and improved Norma to her house over the weekend - apparently to help Marie break the romance between her daughter and La Rocque! Apparently, Norma is now a super-vamp, and with her magical sex appeal she can break romance - and no one seems to understand that she and La Rocque were married. Several others are on the weekend and Norma has hit her gay, carefree sexy ways - and almost all men (including La Rocque) are fascinated by her. Nor does anyone say they were married but it is obvious that he wants a new and improved Norma! This film is a comedy comedy experienced by the top load, which in some ways resembles the rules of the Jean Renoir game. Strangely enough, despite the seriousness of the depression, such pretty rich movies were quite popular, although many today find them undoubtedly in places that are too patchy. Fortunately, LET US BE GAY has many cute and funny moments (especially until the end of Marie Dressler's real colors). Although not a great movie, it is definitely a good and more than just a passerby. My only real regret is that I didn't love that end. You have to see it yourself - maybe you agree to the end, maybe you don't, but I'm pretty sure you enjoy this crazy movie.
