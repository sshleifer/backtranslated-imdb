Zeke Rippy (Mic) is great, you fully believe in his character. And it's scary, I spent half of the film covering my eyes, the other half on the edge of my seat. It's cool to see something frothy and scary that isn't all blood and courage, but it gave me bad dreams. <br /> <br /> It's basically a great movie - look at it first.
