Some time ago I saw when HBO showed it and what I saw was a good movie. so I'm blockbuster today and I see it there with DVDs and I decide what the fuck is. So I rent it. After I finished it, I was in shock how good it was. <br /> <br /> This film touched my heart. All of this was so amazing. Stories, actors, dark humor, music !!! Oh, I'm not gonna start with this movie music. PT Andderson is one of the biggest. Certainly the best thing is if Quentin Tarantino (god). <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in movies should watch this movie if they don't already have one. Anderson is probably a movie lover. In the film, he hangs so many other directors. For example, a pool scene where the camera monitors the girl through water. Obviously, "I am Cuba". But I have no such beef. The film is very understandable in terms of ripoff.
