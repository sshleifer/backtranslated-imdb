Casting this Rigoletto output is great. Edita Gruberova sings Gilda excellently and passionately. Luciano Pavarotti also sings great. Vergara is a good Maddalena; Fedora Barbieri is a famous older singer who sings maid, Giovanna. Weikl Sings Marullo; Wixell sings both Rigoletto and Monterone. Like Rigoletto, Wixell is probably the most convincing acting singer in this challenging ensemble of amazing singers. Kathleen Kuhlmann Contessa. All principals are known and world class. <br /> <br /> Rigoletto is both visually and musically interesting. <br /> <br /> I have it on both laser and DVD. You should do it too!
