Music videos are often overlooked in film discussions, with most people seeing them as a less artistic form. While the vast majority are simply flashy clips to advertise a popular performer's last nickname, few will really rise to the rest, becoming art works by themselves {something Spike Jonze or Michel Gondry's guided value is always worth}. Although "art" is not a word that I would use to describe Michael Jackson 'Thriller (1983), it is an intensely pleasing hybrid of shock horror and music, and an outrageous-campy short film that remains very conspicuous almost 25 years later. A 13-minute music video that was both the longest and the most expensive at the time of its release, was directed by John Landis, a filmmaker I am not very familiar with, although "The Blues Brothers" (1980) is classic, and I hear "American Werewolf London (1981) "is an amazingly fun horror / comedy. <br /> <br /> Whether Thriller qualifies for music videos is definitely a discussion, given its lengthy length (although Jackson improved this effort with the 1997 Ghosts, 38 minutes) and the title song contains less than half of total working time. The video opens in a short film-movie, because Michael, in a quiet and brightly lit night, shows to his girlfriend (Ola Ray) that he is "different" from other men, turning into an outrageous werewolf in the night clouds shows a full moon. If he is likely to hurt the bad hero, we will meet Michael and his girls who are actually watching this drama in a fright. When the girl scares, they both leave the cinema and go home when Michael begins to sing the lines that will open her last song "Thriller". However, when bleeding zombies appear in the local cemetery (their entrance from ghoulishly, which Vincent Price told), the situation becomes interesting. Thriller is considered one of the biggest music videos. Can't just be that song itself is a lot of fun and Michael Jackson? even though he has since been keen on all the comedians for his special personality and deeds? there is no doubt that he is an excellent singer and performer. Perhaps a decent explanation of the popularity of the film is the amazing amount of work that has to go along with it; Nothing like this has ever been seen, and it is still strange in the world of music videos. The cheerful monster make-up effects were designed by Rick Baker and are surprisingly graphic for the music clip, although it's all made fun. Several moments make really exciting tension, successfully capturing the atmosphere of the films he parodies (though always with the usual formula). Simply put, you never look at a zombie movie again!
