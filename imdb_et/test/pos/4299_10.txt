Nigel Balchin's Labyrinth-like novel "Way the the Wood" has been adapted by Julian Fellowes, who also leads this "awfully British" room. It is a film whose influence depends on the portrayal of benign / malignant characters, and here the management options of Fellowes are excellent. The story is linear, easy to follow, but the film's beauty is the metamorphosis of every player, because one case blames the minefield of disasters. <br /> <br /> James Manning (Tom Wilkinson) is a successful business obsession lawyer in London, married to Anne (Emily Watson), who needs more in her life: a couple is childless, lives in a beautiful country house assisted by their long-term " cleaner "Maggie (Linda Bassett). They participate in social events and meet, among others, William Bule (Rupert Everett), passively lazy rich neighbor. Anne decides that they should entertain their neighbors and confront James's protest. Anne continues to plan: "Don't take part in business". At night, an accident has hit and ran, where Maggie's husband is accidentally killed by the Range Rover (he noted). When James returns home, he sees William's Range Rover from scratch and suspects William as a criminal. Anne encourages James to turn to the police, what if it is good, but destroys Bill's life as a member of society and as a father and son who is an important scream? First, the virus spreads: James grabs Bill, who talks about going to the police in James, Anne admits that he led Bill's Rover and is responsible, James persuades Anne to keep silent because it would destroy his reputation, Anne admits he has a thing Bill, and three of them agree that they will be against the greater lie for greater prosperity. Anne ends up with the guilt that she has not told her beloved Maggie that she is responsible and Maggie, who has been guilty of the previous theft of life saved by Anne's mercy, still hires her, is the agent who draws the story to a surprising conclusion. Lies are born of lies that have lied, etc. The main effect of this intrigue is the way in which an isolated tragedy affects everybody involved. Every change is dramatic. Tome Wilkinson gives the best results in a career with a great performance: he can say more to his postures and facial expressions than any actor today. The gifted Emily Watson also gives her repertoire a subtle role, as does the surprisingly fragrant Rupert Everett, who, despite being another wealthy British gentleman, gives us both spirit dry and ultimately poor people. And always the subtle Linda Bassett plays a small role and gives her character quietly central to the wrong lie on the web. <br /> <br /> Tony Pierce-Roberts's cinematic work and the musical result of Stanislas Syrewicz make the story of many atmospheres immeasurably exposed. This is an ensemble that plays its best, which always means that the director (Julian Fellowes) is a piece of fine. The interplay of these good people makes the annoying story very well. Grady Harp
