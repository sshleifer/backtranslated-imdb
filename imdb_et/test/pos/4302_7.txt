This is a well-managed Columbo episode, which also has a good character, but the story just doesn't interest enough and doesn't appear in layers or built as was often the case with the Columbo movie. This also applies to the killer plot to kill his uncle. It is quite simple and does not look so thoughtful. Perhaps this movie wasn't really serious enough, because the film's atmosphere is usually light. At least compared to different Columbo movies. <br /> <br /> For example, the film has a rather comical relief that has mostly come from Columbo's character. This makes the movie enjoyable, but it also gives you the feeling that these are superfluous times, mostly because it doesn't match most of Columbo's movies. <br /> <br /> The characters are good and this helps Martin Landau play a double role. It is always funny to see how much he still differs from a young man, but if, for example, a person like Peter Falk has barely changed over the years, he only got gray. The film also includes Julie Newmar, who is the best who plays Catwoman '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' It's funny how he still moves into this movie like Catwoman. Deliberate or is it just his way to act? <br /> <br /> It's enjoyable and good to watch a Columbo movie, but it also gives you the feeling that everyone could have thought of a better thought script. <br /> <br /> 7/10
