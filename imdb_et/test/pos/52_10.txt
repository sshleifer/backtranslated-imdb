This is a must-see movie. You laugh, you cry, and if it's over, you want more. Well-written and convincing, this movie will catch you and hold on. The casting was perfect, the characters were meaningful and outstanding performances. "Nanny" is a standard that all women should adhere to: strong, forgiving, defensive and never decisive. "Nanny" is for me a display of what a Christian mother and woman should be: a true community pillar. When I was half a woman in Nanny, I can do myself well. I would be devastated if "Nanny" had died at some point in the movie, but as he wouldn't come out on DVD for sure. I can only hope that this story will continue and that Ruben will go back to Lackawan to try to build up the city, cut and personal.
