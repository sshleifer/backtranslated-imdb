The New York Mobile Photo Museum has recently published a thorough retrospective of Jacques Rivette's films. Having fallen in love with my "Paris Nous Appartienti", I decided that it should not be missed. Aeschylus "Seven Against" and "Prometheus". In addition, we have shown an indivisible daily life of an individual, united by two companies: a working group woman named Frederique, who finds creative ways for men to raise their money, and a young man Colin, who visits local cafes as deaf mute and gently play harmony for patrons until they pay go to him. The first four hours are devoted to the creation of characters and their patterns, before the somewhat loose, the charming end of the plot is the decoding of conspiracy and secret secret stars. <br /> <br /> Film is largely about life on the edge of society. Theatrical companies are a desperate affair, using their complex, emotionally run-out exercises (which really are something to look at) to repel the fact that their actions are probably never staged or even seen. Colin and Frederique both have very few friends who, after touching the conspiracy, find only a little bit of excitement or purpose, because they are encouraged to learn more about it. The film contemplates the consequences of the rejection of a normal society in a number of memorable sequences, including Colin's long shooting, when he travels through the streets of France, crying to himself. As such, the film has been portrayed as a counter-culture analysis of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> There is no movie frame that will break the energy and vitality. The fact that much of the dialogue and movement is improvised makes the characters much more spontaneous, much more immediate. The camera becomes an important feature in this regard; During the whole movie, shadows are visible here and there, or other similar mistakes, but they seem natural and fit with the flow of action because the camera is so important in this game. <br /> <br /> More than anything, the film seems to be a great example of another way to make movies, a movie spot outside the usual pattern. For me, this was an open experience, even more than the "Paris Nous Appartient", although the latter carries a lot of theme and structure. Black-visible someone who thinks about the nature of art.
