Great work, especially for an actor who played wife Gerda (Claire Price), of course, like David Suchet. I really thought it was, but it's next to the point. The end I will not publish (someone will describe it in the board in response to someone else's question if you are interested). I really found it sad. Despite Agatha Christie's reputation for writing carton characters, I thought they were big and big. <br /> <br /> The pace of this story was good and I liked to see Sarah Miles like Lucy and Edward Hardwicke (Cedric's son I Watson.)) as her husband.
