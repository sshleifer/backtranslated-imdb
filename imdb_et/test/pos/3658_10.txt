In a word ... magical. And so incredibly real. Vijay Raaz is so incredibly raw, so incredibly vulnerable that you want her characters to succeed, whatever she does. And he plays Hari Om impeccably - his absolutely perfect "Bollywood e-shtyle" up to his uncomfortable, shy and first kiss. He is a truly talented actor and I do not hesitate to see him because he brings it all into life and gives it a breath. Camille Natta is absolutely proud. It took me some time to warm up with him - maybe because he plays the role of an unknown but also fascinated tourist. His transition became him and he played his role very well. Even the person you love to hate, his boyfriend Benoit, was wonderful, even though you never like him, he plays, Jean-Marie Lamour creates the perfect frame. Script - so real. I found that I would turn to my friend repeatedly during the film to say, "It's happening in India! They laughed at it!" Very real, very raw. ATTENTION, but you will definitely miss the theater. Nitin Sawhney's music is great and fits perfectly with ever-changing moods. But Vijay Raaz ... I find myself constantly back because she's making this movie. He is a hero, the most charming, armed runner you will ever meet - he is magical. Lovely, real, lovely, incredibly talented actor I can't wait to see in shine and success in Bollywood, Hollywood or anywhere!
