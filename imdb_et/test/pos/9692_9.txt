First of all, I want to say that most people who give it a bad overview do not like this comedy, this movie is great if you have an open mind and are not afraid to laugh at some fools. > <br /> This movie is recorded as a TV show with lots of short video clips made for one long movie. Some scenes don't even have a dialogue that someone just comes out and does something unexpected and it's funny !! The only downside was that I felt that I was wasting money on my popcorn and ice, there was no way to eat or drink something that I kept smiling. I was honestly nervous about drinking some Icee and saw something that made me laugh and shoot it everywhere. and viva la bam, then watch your movie. <br /> <br /> And if you don't like the first movie or TV show. Don't look at it and if you see that this is not a bad overview of it. Hardcore Christians who see it don't seem to me right.
