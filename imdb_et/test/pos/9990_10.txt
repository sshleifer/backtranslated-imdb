Oh my God, what a story! This movie is very good and it was supposed to be God who did it! You did a great job. It was really good if you chose the right actors. This movie is so good that I am really glad you did it because if you never knew that story, because I'm not a big golf fan and I think it's kind of so thankful. I really enjoyed it and that's why I gave the movie 10 10. I also liked Shia Labouf, who was the perfect Frans on Quimet's roll. I hope most of the things you set up in were also true. Oh and some parts were funny and others were just very happy.
