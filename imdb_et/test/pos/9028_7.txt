It is not a serious film and does not pretend it is, but it is not as bad as some of its reviews, title and first ten minutes lead you to wait. <br /> <br /> The plot is very silly, but it adds to the joy and enthusiasm of the movie. Characters are played sympathetically and, although they deal with a typical teenage angel, they usually avoid the sick sentimentality that is commonly found in the film genre. <br /> <br /> An unusually London-based, geeks-friendly, it's worth looking at when it happens; if you want some language-in-cheek stupidity and don't forget to stop your unbelief.
