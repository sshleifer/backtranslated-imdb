This movie is a great movie. The movie shows so many topics in one amazing movie. Driving lessons focus on Ben (Rupert Grint), an aging 17-year-old shy. The film talks about how Ben is sick of his dominant mother and how he just wants to be himself. Ben then meets Evie, with whom he makes a very special bond. Two take the journey and in the process Ben finds himself and what relationship he and Evie share. This is a movie that you or someone else is watching. Whatever you feel, you all know what Ben is going through in the film. This is a very warm-hearted film that just makes you think about whether your driving lessons were ever as emotional as it was a trip to Ben's lessons.
