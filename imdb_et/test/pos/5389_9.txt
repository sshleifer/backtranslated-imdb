If you like Gary Cooper, this is one of his best roles. Her gentle intensity for making a lie has been her career. "Blayde Hollister" arrives at Dallas to revenge against Will and Brian Malowe, who burned his Georgian farm and killed his family. Inept Marshall is on the way to Hollister, trying to arrest him when he interrupted the street race between Hollister and Wild Bill Hickock. A shootout is organized to enact Hollister laws, and he takes "back East" Marshall under his wing to keep him alive in Texas as they exchange identity. <br /> <br /> It was a great start and the picture stays full. Today's standards can be somewhat slow, but this is one of my 10 best favorite films.
