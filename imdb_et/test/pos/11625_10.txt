The adventure game mini series is as good as it gets. I looked at it when it was originally shown in HBO. Sigrid is completely believable in Philadelphia's role and the whole production was first-class! See all 400 minutes when you can. I highly recommend this mini-series. Amazingly, I can't gauge it officially, but I'll let you know to your readers / users that this is a solid 10!
