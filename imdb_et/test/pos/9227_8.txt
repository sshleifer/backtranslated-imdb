Rainbow Brite and Star Stealer are not for people born before 1980 or after 1989. Most of these people do not understand the 80s cartoons. The fact that Rainbow Brite has been made for film is a joy to many of us who remember watching a TV show as a child. Most of the dialogue is quite fun and silly, and the plot is not meaningless, but it is still a cool movie.
