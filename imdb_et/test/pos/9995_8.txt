As you know, "The biggest game ever played" is golf. I practiced a dramatic headline, but on the big visual screen that was credited to director Bill Paxton (better known for his acting in Twister and fun supporting roles for foreigners and real things), we find that it has much more meaning than though the film is about golf, it seems that sport is just a framework for what is really happening. What is actually happening is the story of people who are told that they cannot fulfill their dreams, be it age or social status. The contradiction between the boy's wishes and his father's demands. An English golf game that wants to bring the title home with the soul that breathes its neck. <br /> <br /> Shia LaBeouf (even Stevens) plays Francis Ouimet, a talent with God who could never play golf first. Despite the outrage of the upper-class "gentlemen", it was indisputable that Francis was a gift. Threatened by the fear of a father playing in Elias Kotea (Sugartime, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) who thought that playing a game alone would never improve their poor living conditions. With his mother's continued support, Francis finally reaches his idol, a golf game, with Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane). It proved that storytelling is successful through pure cinema. The whole movie can be said without dialogue. There are scenes in the movie that create a strong and strong emotion only with pictures. In one particular scene, Francis Ouim praises and the entire crowd turns his head to look at the distance of the ball, all except Harry Vardon's face, who is intensely looking at Ouimet without flinch. Opportunities for golfers to visualize the course offer greater aesthetic enjoyment. <br /> <br /> Pleasant supportive pain relief complements the plan. The Peyton List plays the interests of love and waits for worthwhile gaming, and Josh Flitter plays the loving caddy who keeps the Ouimet focused when the pressure puts him down. A golf fan or not, you appreciate the movie for this beauty and a reminder that cinema can be a great tool to talk about any story.
