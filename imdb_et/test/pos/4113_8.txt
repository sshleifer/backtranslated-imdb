Although songs and dance numbers are generally not as strong as many would be, the movie's story and message are still there and sound loudly over simple 70's style musical numbers. Bearing in mind that this film was made after Hollywood's music was almost extinct (with few exceptions being rock musicals), the viewers who saw it did not realize the new evaluation that it was a bold attempt to do something that has not been done so far . Viewers who see it today tend to rate it against today's films and musicals, and maybe also with huge letters from the past. But to make this movie, or any other subject on it, unfair for the film itself. <br /> <br /> The movie has some good musical moments. The first is Bobby Van. Mr. Van took the role of Harry Lovett just after he graduated from the 2-year-old Tony (best actor) with Broadway Revival, "No, No, Nanette". He is a singing and dancing man from the back and, frankly, the only one who gave the music truly talented and experienced. He never leaves his "Question to me answer" and rightly ... he was completely at home like Harry. Olivia Hussey makes new pleasant numbers when she welcomes new visitors, and while the songs are weak, James Shigeta shows her strong voice in "Family", as well as beautifully made full length. <br /> <br /> Watch a movie about what it is ... a fantasy about a place where you never get old, hidden in the ice and snow covered in the mountains of Tibet, found by a series of unsuspecting people today who are put together the contradiction of modern culture. Take it and compare it to reality and get a movie that doesn't match the goal. But ... take this film for the message of love and peace, peace and fraternal love, and get a warm and refreshing message and positive about it. <br /> <br /> In some cases, this film can be bright while others are welcome to release the hectic temptation of reality. Try not to understand the first and just enjoy the message. Secondly, you have discovered the secret of Shangri-La!
