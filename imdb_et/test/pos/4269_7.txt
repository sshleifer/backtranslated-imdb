where are we going from here? this is the overriding question of this film. And don't make a mistake, "mainly ETC," the efforts of Director of the Year John Jansen, asking a lot more questions than it does, but not as hard or powerful as it is. <br /> <br /> A big part of this movie plays like you and your college drinking chat between friends, and I'm sure many of the issues raised by the main characters will recognize their evenings drunk. But one of the most beautiful of this movie is that we rarely have an answer. Questions have been raised? everything from everyday to deep ?? but jansen is able to study his audience partially and answer these questions himself, there is little help for the characters. <br /> <br /> The 1st half opens with increasingly complex and beautifully organized non-linear segments to introduce us to the main characters. Will we meet them in the morning of 8 April 1994? day when deaf cobain committed suicide. And this is Cobain's death and journey two days later in Seattle, which is the film's background. In exploring Cobain's life, music, and death, characters are striving for success - to understand and understand their lives. <br /> <br /> The film has some aspects of what you can expect from a low budget indie film: performances ranging decisively from mediocre to outstanding, the strongest performances of jessica scott (holly) and noel wood (daniel); some of the dialogue is a bit stiff but never uneven; and there are some minor sound problems, especially when we get on the road, which sometimes makes it difficult to follow the action on the screen. <br /> <br /> But despite its shortcomings, "mainly ETC". is a strong, deeply influential cinema. In the moments of Christmas, worshiping humor, and intimate instability, jansen combines all character threads and illuminates their struggles while making them accessible and interesting to us. and since we see our vision in one or more of these symbols, we can identify the issues and issues they are fighting with, and we can look back and remember where we were on the same day in 1994, when many people changed the world. <br /> <br /> While Jansen takes credit for writing, editing, and directing a film, he must also wear his photography. With an astonishing eye and amazing ability to capture and pull us into every character's world, Janssen managed to shoot after shooting, which stayed with me for a long time after the credit. <br /> <br /> This movie would be complete without an amazing sound recording. the music of this film is used as an amazing effect; sometimes the activity is somewhat emphasized at other times than in the middle of the stage, but never does the road or the chip in the music video. The soundtrack plays like the ultimate greatest hits, although I suspect that the label probably won't fit well with the director. <br /> <br /> The new double DVD archive includes some deleted scenes, trailers, music videos, and a cobain documentary. Deleted scenes offer some insight into making a movie through alternative opening and closing schemes, and it's definitely a treatment to get a rare and beautiful Raining Kind video. The cobain documentary is good if wear is a little worse and there are certainly more documentaries available for larger fans. strikingly missing is the director's comment and I can't help but know if jansen is going to release it for a while with this delicious tidbit. <br /> <br /> It's enough to say that next time you look for a strong job from a talented filmmaker, I suggest you come on board.
