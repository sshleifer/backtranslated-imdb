This film was a masterpiece of human emotions and experiences. I think many people get into the obvious mental hospital of Leland as a story, but I was drawn into the relationship between many characters and what they show about the power of human emotions. Much of the film's message is that we never know good without bad clich√©, but what makes this movie so good and so original is that it depicts the destructive and devastating power that can be bad, can you see Bad everywhere, like Leland, or you experience a failed love or relationship that just doesn't work no matter how bad you want to do it. This movie records how helpless relationships and emotions can make you feel better than anything I've seen, and it's both film and frustrating.
