This exhibition was not only a great human drama, but was a raw, too viable racism in that country. If one exhibition can be so witty and entertaining, but at the same time so striking and educational, it is television in its highest form. Operation was phenomenal. Writing was exceptional. The exhibition did not only show racial relationships in a simple way that seems to be incomparable to any other TV series, but its ability to portray this issue as it existed in the 1960s with the way it existed at the beginning of the 21st century, the ways we have changed, and unfortunately, many more opportunities, we are not.
