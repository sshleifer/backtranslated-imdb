This interesting lost film (written by Terence Malick) marks Stacy Keach and Frederic Forrest as two unpleasant southern brothers to open a seafood restaurant. Margot Kidder was never more beautiful and Forrest should have applied. Originally entitled "Dion Brothers", this violent relaxation with a violent ending is pure pleasure! <br /> <br /> Where is this movie? I've been looking for it for 30 years. Keach was still big and I'm surprised that it has no more cult (maybe). These guys are more ambitious than the brain but totally love the ladies! 7 out of 10 If you can complain about it anywhere, you have fun.
