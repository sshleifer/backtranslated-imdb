A quick look at the assumption of this film seems to refer to just another 80's inbred / backwood slash; the type where sex equals death and participants are all the annoying stereotypes you really want to die for. But "JBD" gives you much more. <br /> <br /> Instead of focusing on bare flesh and gore (though there is no sex at all), the flick focuses on providing the upcoming fear / installation force. Beautiful scenic background. These feelings are further exacerbated by the casting of realistically pleasing signs and antagonists, which are rather immoral than the definitions of bad cardboard. Oh yes-George Kennedy is here too and when is it not good? <br /> <br /> If you liked the "wrong move", check it out to see where much of this methodology came from.
