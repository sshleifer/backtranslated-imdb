I remember this movie that he got a lot of news when it was new. Letterman and Leno had objections. Letterman called this (paraphrasing) the biggest waste of film he'd ever seen, and Leno challenged his simple images. But Letterman had a guest John John Higgins at his show, so he seems to have taken nothing too personally. The reuse of DVDs, where there are opinions and such actors, may be interesting, although I suspect that the people who fought in the late-night wars have disappeared and will not return soon. <br /> <br /> I preferred to let Letterman speak to Leno, but he could never buy it. They never rose above the cartoon and I just didn't take them as actors. For comparison, Paul Sorvino as Kissinger's Oliver Stone's "Nixon" recalls that this is an impersonalization that may seem ridiculous in the first moments, but which seemed at least plausible after the first entertaining moments. <br /> <br /> Highlighting the exhibition for me was Treat Williams Michael Ovitz. Williams' speech to Letterman was not as big as that reminiscent of Alec Baldwin's entrance (and quick exit) as Blaket's Glengerry Glen Ross. <br /> <br /> They could have done anything with Johnny's role. I know he wasn't involved in most of the events depicted in this movie, and most of the audience knows their reputation so Johnny Carson doesn't need to be introduced. But the more context why Dave and Jay and all the comedians would have given Johnny would have given the flick a substance he doesn't have, because it is a rumor. <br /> <br /> I think I should read the book ... Rich Little imitating Johnny Carson, unfortunately, was just over Rich Little imitating Johnny Carson. <br /> <br /> I tell you, watching this film after watching either Letterman's or Leno's show, all I want to do is open my Johnny Carson DVDs and the real thing.
