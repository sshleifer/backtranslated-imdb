I definitely agree with my previous commentator in describing it as a riveting, exciting and certainly beautiful film. Not all episodes need to be seen because the first ones are the best, the latter are a bit tiring, but everyone who loves German and their good-natured ways is worth all the episodes. Fashion, values ​​are constantly being questioned, even if it is a nazi past in recent episodes, rich dialogues are particularly interesting. These episodes are recommended for anyone living or traveling in Germany, preferably in the original language !! <br /> <br />
