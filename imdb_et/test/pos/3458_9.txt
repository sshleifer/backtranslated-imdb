A stunning movie that opened so many trees that people were afraid. This showed how less than willing bodies can grasp the senses and how difficult it is to recognize the things that happen to others who want a disabled person. <br /> <br /> Love, friendship, fear, disappointment, joy, humor and so many other things were so well caught. Two leading actors played very well with 2 powerful actors and invited you to laugh, tears, worry, joy and resentment. <br /> <br /> I approached this movie with interesting and worrying clutter that worried it might be too much to play sympathy or only to live in negative. But it was a beautifully designed story of 2 friends. <br /> <br /> I loved it.
