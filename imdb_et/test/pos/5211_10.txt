For the main criticism of the film ... The Love Story: It was not a love story. These were two people who tortured that they were trying to find humanity in ANYone. The same happened to the soldiers and the Russian boy. He added a feminine touch, but come to see American movies ... where there is no love story. There was no storyline: is there a story of war? I think it's a silly criticism. The style is this. They start with 400 men and the film narrowed down to show about 10 men's lives and how everyone did and died. Death is the end of any story. Just because there was no happy ending does not mean that he has no story. <br /> <br /> This movie was a terrible truth. I would not necessarily call it "anti-war". Of course, it had a political statement, but the film was not politics. In fact, except for a few cases when the captain? it turned out that Nazi Germany never had air. They were far from the reach of the main Nazi party. Fat cats did not go to Russia! <br /> <br /> Maybe it's not exactly accurate and not a Hollywood hit, but it shows a good soldier (I say just about every citizenship and war) and what they have to go through. It was a losing battle, of course, the film is frustrating. And for the person who said it was gutsy (and foolish) to even imagine the Germans as victims: in every war all parties are victims (any true soldier tells you this.) <br /> <br /> This movie is a good balance between movie and documentaries. There are only a few problems with this, but it will make the best of both worlds. Look at it like that. Beware, however, because it's hard to watch a movie, if not graphically, emotionally. <br /> <br /> I expect them to make a movie about Iraq. Probably it has many of the same topics and it is very controversial, I want to see who is essentially doing it. (Jarhead doesn't read)
