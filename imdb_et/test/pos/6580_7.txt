The problem I have in Finnish is that most of the participants in this movie are in every Finnish movie. I feel that Finland has only five participants. I think if you are not from Finland, this movie likes refreshing novelty. <br /> <br /> This movie is a terrible chain of events that affects some people quite harshly. Alcoholism, cold climate and darkness can all be clich√©s, but in today's Finnish society they are still very real. Many people in Finland are depressed, especially in winter. <br /> <br /> The film's tone is very melancholic. I enjoyed it and Louhimes's leadership was very strong again. I liked this movie a lot, but the negative thing is that you see the same faces you've seen again and again.
