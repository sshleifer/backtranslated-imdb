I don't understand where these bad comments come from. You had a movie on the edge of your seat and made you a little afraid to go in the car at night. <br /> <br /> The part that gives you is that it can all happen. Not as much as the film is perceived, but the whole idea is reality. This film took this reality and turned it into a Dee Snider nightmare. <br /> <br /> Three thumbs up (the third is the dead body of my freezer).
