And the perfect movie to watch while on holiday when the winter / Xmas atmosphere that Burton creates for Gotham City is so cool. It's strange that Warner decided to release it in the summer as a movie. But that doesn't fit. <br /> <br /> But even taking into account the content of the movie, it is even that it was aimed at families. The top-class family throws its mutant baby into the sewer, the socio-phobic billionaire dresses in leather like a flying rodent, the lonely secretary dresses in leather like cats, and the freak runs to a political post. And S&M and serfdom are presented in a very perverse way. But Burton left with it. His visual style in this film is the best. <br /> <br /> This and Batman: Dead End are the only true living action incarnations in the comic book. True, the animated series was the closest to the source material, but compared to Batman Forever and after that, Batman's return is the best of four. <br /> <br /> Dark and more violent than the First Film, the Gothic pathos come to a new high. I was quite interested in Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne (not even for me to start with George Clooney!), He showed the right balance for a strange lonely and cool offender. Michelle Pfieffer is great as Catwoman (much more sexy and "more realistic" like a cat), she wears this leather clothing better than Halle Berry. And Danny DeVito was as convincing as the penguin that his scenes looked at the viewing. And Christopher Walken is brilliant as a spooky Max Shreck (if you think you know Chip Shrek that it's nothing more than a very young Leatherface / Butterfinger). <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman's score is even better than the first round. His powerful and interesting themes are much better than the 2 Schumacher films after the dross. This film is a Batman phenomenon in Zenith. Forget the following sequences and follow the animated series after that. We hope that Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale will be able to retrieve their movie Batman live next year. <br /> <br /> This DVD was one of the first DVDs released by Warner (almost 7 years ago!). !!) and as a result there are no features and the case is a snapper. Pick it up cheap as I did and hope for SE future.
