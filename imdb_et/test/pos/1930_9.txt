It's a pearl. Cinematography as four products - the expected quality was indeed delivered. An excellent style that reminded me of Errol Morris's films, which are well organized and simply gripping. It's been awful for a long time because it's terrible. We know something bad happened (a person cannot interview), but we are forced to see it like a car accident in slow motion. The story goes through the most conceivable aspects and, unlike some documentaries, did not try to show the toughest of the stories, because they were also dealing with the guilt of the people behind Don, who wondered why they didn't stop him in time. It took me a few hours to get out of this melancholy when I saw this very well made documentary.
