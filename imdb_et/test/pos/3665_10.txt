I've looked at my fair bit of Bollywood movies - you know that a typical girl meets a girl, a girl pushes boys, a dakus (bad guys) takes a girl, a boy rescues a girl, kills hundreds of dhaves and they marry happily. style numbers) .. Hari Omi, I was expecting another typical Bollywood-style movie; but in my opinion it was atypical and indeed quite comical. Bharatbala Hari Om is what could be called one of the Indian films such as the increasingly popular South Asian hits such as Monsoon Wedding, East on East or Bend it like Beckham. <br /> <br /> Southern Asia's decent and diverse classical Bollywood films were full of humor and sub-dialogues that could be picked up that reminded me of the fun and charming aspect of Indian culture (such as the different indo-pop numbers that Nitin actually redesigned) built by Soni or used Indian slang). Hari Omi can be enjoyed by all South Asian people, as well as fun for those who do not know Indian humor because characters and plot see everyone. <br /> <br /> The movie driver (also called "quadruple" for those who traveled to India), played by Vija Raaz (Monsoon Wedding), gets himself involved with a seizure and gets a lot of money for him. To avoid selling his four-wheeled "Madhuri", he flees to Madhuri and a very charismatic and lovely woman from France, Father (Camille Natta), who himself escapes from his boyfriend Benoit's boredom (Jean Marie Lamour, who was in the pool). The journey of the film is traveling through the beautiful landscape of Rajasthan? the land of love stories; through humor, you see two main players trying to find out who they really are. <br /> <br /> What made the night the most memorable was director, CEO, editor-in-chief and even pr. Natta is screening. After talking to Bharatbal (who actually has a zoological background), many interesting films were revealed, including: ending the movie just 10 days before the Toronto International Film Festival and only 45 days shooting and only five players in the game (the rest were first real actors). Getting home I realized two things about the film - that there is always a different person, regardless of our differences, and secondly, as the director said, "Every person has a love story". <br /> <br /> It must be visible to everyone!
