First, we call this movie what it is: <br /> <br /> 1. It feels like a good movie message. <br /> <br /> 2. Operation is just okay, the dialogue a little better, the production value is pretty good. <br /> <br /> 3. Rugby Scenes ... just barely. <br /> <br /> But here's the trick: it's not what Hollywood has developed, and it's not trying to be an amazing accurate image of sport. Rather, it is a pretty good representation in real people, in real conditions, and a real story. Of course, they could have done a better job against the sport, but my voice: it does a good job of what it is going to do. <br /> <br /> (And I can't think of many football, baseball, hockey or soccer films that are useful for sport… Do… Bull Durham?) <br /> <br /> I am not rugby player (i was a wrestler) but i finished highland, went to '86 -'90 and from time to time i practiced rugby boys. But in 1976 my brother David was one of the original founders of the Highland Rugby Club. (Her younger brother Billy played next year when she remembered. Rugby site at highlandrugby.net about team history.) <br /> <br /> By the time I was there, the club had existed for about ten years and was already long ago built a reputation for excellence. This is the fact that they focused on "broad" training: dedication, honor, discipline, effort, not tactics. I thought the rugby guys I knew were little on my head, but I think I can just be a little jealous. They were the hard kernels dedicated to the Gelwix-promoted religious system. <br /> <br /> As regards the "cultural mixing" issues that have been raised, it may be interesting to note that although I was there in the 80s, one of the largest schools in the city was shut down - South High School - and its pupils were shared with other three primary schools. SLC School. Frankly, in the 80s, Highland was a pretty white bread ... I have a 1977 (I think) 1977 team that shows * all * white clubs. South High, on the other hand, was a much more racially integrated school before I was able to close: I had one of my South friends who joined the team, one of Tongan, one of the samoan and remembering that there were a number of islanders who joined '88 -'90. I don't think anyone questioned the team's credibility in accepting Maori (or other cultural) traditions: if there was one thing that was obvious to these boys, they walked. <br /> <br /> And as for the strength of the team compared to the world's top universities, yes, it is true that the US-Rugby is generally not well represented in the rest of the world. There are exceptions, but hey - it's a simple fact that Rugby doesn't have the importance or the expense needed to create many traditions in the US that arise in other countries. <br /> <br /> With this word, judge Highland on this utility: <br /> <br /> - * Only * team qualified for US Rugby National Championship every year in this organization's 25-year history. <br /> <br /> - Win 392 wins, 9 losses. Read this again ... winning the most successful in any history of US sport. <br /> <br /> - regular international tours. <br /> <br /> - some convincing victories against some legitimate international teams. <br /> <br /> Are they the best in the world? Maybe a few years, probably no more ... but they're pretty good at all. And it's a disrespectful game to blow them up when the Highland Rugby can be the best sports ambassador in the US.
