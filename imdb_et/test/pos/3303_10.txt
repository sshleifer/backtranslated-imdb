Best of all. What's the best? It is different for everyone, but most of us are that love. But, unfortunately, not everyone knows where to see true love. This story goes on looking for all the love for the gambit. Sometimes all the wrong places and all the wrong reasons are. But as they say, "we are the masters of our own ships" and so it goes to our lives. We are responsible for the choices we make in our lives. When we make these choices, we have to live with them. Looking at this story and seeing these women make choices that are likely to change their lives forever, we don't know if we would make the same choices as these women or would we be wiser? Who knows?
