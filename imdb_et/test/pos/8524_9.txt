This is a great James Bond movie. Although it is not part of the original and more famous series and it is an independent film, it is very well done. Getting to know Sean Connery to get his role back was a genius stroke, like a movie titration, suggesting that he was not going to play Bond again. Connery was as big as his earlier 007 appearance. The script is outstanding as well as photography and performances. This is the film I remember at first with Kim Basinger, who became more famous after this movie; Barbara Carrera was great; and Klaus Maria Brandauer was absolutely perfect as the main villain. Most often, Bond's aging and the changing times and attitudes of the British secret service most often referred to. The 007 gadgets were equal to other Bond movies. The only thing missing was the famous 007 music theme, which of course could not be used by this competitive production. It was quite amazing for me to see two great James Bond films that appeared in the same year, this and Octopussy Roger Moore. An interesting aspect of the film is the emphasis on video games and computer graphics. The beginning of the 80s was the first blossom of such things and their use in this film made it a very modern film. The movie is actually a new version of Thunderball, updated with newer technology. Regardless of the repetitive theme, there are enough differences to make it the most entertaining. I look at it often.
