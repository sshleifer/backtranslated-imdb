When I saw a preview of this movie, I thought, "here's another stupid TV movie written with the thought and complexity of soap opera," but when I saw it, I was surprised. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen stars (and proves that she really has the opportunity to act) as a woman who loves a man and marries a man (now and again Eric Close), but starts losing her when a series of attacks begins in her community. At first he is blinded by his assurances that he is innocent and his love for him, but as time goes by, he is still suspicious of him. <br /> <br /> Although it sounds like another boring melodramatic TV movie, it's really much better because Thiessen and Close are characters well, and the movie script allows them to be much more complex and intelligent than expected; they are not just cartoons or cartoon signs that exist only to move the plot, but to real, three-dimensional people, and we find ourselves really caring for them. And the movie is smart enough to be able to offer the story exciting, engaging the story to the top without using loud scenes, meaningless clichés or cheap melodrama. Instead, we share the main character's internal conflicts and fears and give them a realistic insight into how they can solve them and do it right. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see it, please do so. Production values ​​are not exactly top-notch (it's a TV movie), but if you can watch it, there's a great story.
