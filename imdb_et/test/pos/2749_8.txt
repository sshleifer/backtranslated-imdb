The Central Airport is a story about a slit called Jim (Richard Barthelmess), who has one bad flight over 4000 hours and is forced to give up business flights. She meets a beautiful girl named Jill (Sally Eilers) and two start flying and tricks. Two start a relationship, but when Jim hurts, his brother (Tom Brown) takes over for a while and falls to his brother's girlfriend. From there, things become exciting and terribly sad. <br /> <br /> This movie is a precursor for many reasons. First, Jim and Jill have their relationship without being married and without the intention of being married. Secondly, the Eilers are shown in his underwear and absolutely limited in the scene when the production code is in effect.
