Another Raquel Welch Classic! On 10 November 1969, this picture hit a theater where starring Raquel Welch Michele, James Stacey as Joe and Luke Askew as Alan Morris. Nikki meets her girlfriends with Michel and Jackie. When he is there, he runs to a former spouse who wants a second chance. Nikki away from her goes to the table where she sees Michele and Jackie. Alan is approaching again and he will go away when Alan strikes him. Nikki is taken to the hospital while Michele and Jackie go to the police station. Michele goes to the hospital where she meets Jackie to find Nikki died. Then Alan goes to Jackie who is hit by the car and then tries to drive down to Michele. Michele jumps into his car and drives to Los Angeles. When he gets there, he calls Lloyd to his boss in Las Vegas so he knows he's all right. Lloyd tells him he's going to the club, which is called losers to see Jeri's job. However, there is one problem! The banner has a drug problem and Alan knows that Alan and the barman have little to talk about. In Los Angeles, Michele returns not only as a dancer to Jeri, but also to hooking Jeri's bouncer with Joe. Now some thoughts about this picture! This picture was much better than Raquel's last, and it had a change. Luke Askew did a good job of playing Nikki's wife. He was your typical murder with its appearance. As for Raquel Welch's performance, the only word that comes to me is fantastic. She was fantastic in this movie and her beauty was shining and shining like never before. The equipment he danced on the stage was breathtaking. In fact, all the clothes used in this film were breathtaking. Of course it doesn't matter what Raquel had, because he sees everything or nothing good. I give this movie 10 funny cards for two reasons. Raquel Welch is the first and by far the leading actor and deserves 10 stars. Another reason is that this film was a wall-wall thrill from start to finish.
