William Wellmann, who led one of the most exciting films ever made, Wings (1927), returns to heaven with another hanging bell from boldly damn mirrors. Wellmann was the first world war air ace and no one knew biplanes as he did. Here they are, stunt-flying, crashing, air exploding and everything you think, as well as an exciting look at commercial flights in 1932. And there is a good strong story, which was wonderfully played by Mr Richard Barthelmess (a quiet star who made several films with D. W. Griffith), Sally Eilers and Tom Brown. Eilers is a real sizzler. Such a relief to see a real woman who has a real fire and character, not a photofot instead of a botched mannequin playing in today's Hollywood movies and everyone looks identical. The story is sad, played with a true sin and well managed. At the end of the movie, there are some exceptionally exciting threat and rescue scenes, and what's the most meaningful thing in the dark shot you ever thought was. I dare not give away the brilliant aspects of this episode. The character played by Barthelms is very similar to Wellmann himself, a truly wild hellbreaker in the air. Anyone who likes early aviation would love this movie and it is very useful for anyone who loves good solid entertainment, love, tears and non-stop activities, combined with some delightful Wellman omelette.
