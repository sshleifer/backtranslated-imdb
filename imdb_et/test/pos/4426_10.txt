I just went back to seeing the Academy's award-winning candidate for a doctorate, and I was thoroughly touched and interested in studying the man's works I never heard before. Of course I am someone who has beautiful architecture, so I understand that others don't care. <br /> <br /> We can only imagine if Philadelphia had a few more visuals at the end of the 1960s when Kahn's plans were an opportunity for a wonderful city center. If you don't know if you can see more about the Bangladesh building at the beginning of the movie, be patient because it gives the movie at the end of the climax. <br /> <br /> His son's personal discoveries in making this film are quite interesting, sometimes touching, and even funny. The camera has one of the most comic anti-vision beads. <br /> <br /> Rounding the good points of this document is a touching musical score with some excellent expressive string music. And expressiveness is the main point of Kahn's architecture. The points of the spiritual nature of material by other architects and how Kahn's buildings bring it together combine the general experience of this film.
