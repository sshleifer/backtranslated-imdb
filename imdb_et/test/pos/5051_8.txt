Known Czech actor Vlastimil Brodský, who is mostly known in North America for his leading role in Jacob Jacobi Liar's original German / Czech production (Jakob, der Lügner 1974), gives us the last perfect result as an 80-year-old prankster who refuses to admit that he will die. <br /> <br /> The Jirí Hubac scenario is subtle. Funny, mobile and well developed. It examines well the age of aging as well as the motivation of insecure and weak, happy and dissatisfied characters. <br /> <br /> Frantisek (Vlastimil Brodský) and his best friend Eda (Stanislav Zindulka) are all kinds of shenanigans and make sure to do the best for your dying day. Meanwhile, Frantisek's wife prepares her death, saving money for the funeral and accusing Frantisek of her infinite infancy and irresponsible attitude. Their son takes over his apartment and puts them in an old home, but Frantisek doesn't want to hear about it. She wants to enjoy life and make her laugh. He wants to help and love and give ... but what price? <br /> <br /> Be sure to attract adults of all ages, this gifted filmmaker Vladimír Michálek's exquisite film is as touching as funny. It makes you think about how we live our lives and why we live our lives. This brings to the fore a simple story of a charming stubborn old man and allows us to reflect and feel what life is like. <br /> <br /> After an active career lasting over 40 years, I am somewhat terribly aware that Vlastimil Brodsk died in April 2002, no longer in the grip of terminal cancer. However, it is surprising to think that he had the opportunity to be part of such a moving scenario and to be the catalyst for the joyous age of this ode, which has not even begun to make the waves of the North American repertoire. It is clear after the success of the film "With us in China" (2000) that Czech film has something to offer in the world. This film must be at least visible.
