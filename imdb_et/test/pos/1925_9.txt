This is the story of a trip made by a man who once had a dream and guts. Donald Crowhurst was an English businessman and amateur sailor who competed at the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race, with one hand at a round world yacht competition. <br /> <br /> I was very interested in listening to a radio interview from producer John Smithson, who is also Touching the Void, one of the first documentaries to make commercial success in 2003. I went to the cinema with great hope and not with much historical knowledge, and I'm exempt from letting it go. In 92 minutes, I was carried through a haunting story and came to think a lot. <br /> <br /> Without any reenactation, this movie used the very limited audio and video file they found and made an enchanting story that allowed the audience to understand Crowhurst's personal level. The story discovered itself as people who were directly involved in the events, including his wife and son, and finally the winner, who was the only one who returned 9 competitors, gave Robin Knox-Johnston a record of what happened almost 40 years ago. <br /> <br /> The Crowhurst logs (magazines) he kept at sea for 243 days are so haunting that it was much easier for me to understand what was completely isolated. man. Although Crowhurst's body was not found, another competitor, Nigel Tetley, whose yacht sank only a few weeks before he demanded a prize for the fastest passage, committed suicide three years later after unsuccessful attempts to ride properly. <br /> <br /> Everybody could take their toll, especially the sea. <br /> <br /> Director Louise Osmond was also with John Smithson after the show. I had no idea it was a female director and it just came as a very nice surprise. The film is limited in the UK (a few days in certain cinemas). You can do it at the cinema when you can, unless you have a modern sound system capable of restoring the bashing sound of the South Ocean ... then I'm sure they also have a DVD.
