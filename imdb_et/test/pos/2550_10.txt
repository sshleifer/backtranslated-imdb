Just because I love movies like "Central do Brasil" ("Central Station", 1998), I really love "Chop Shop". There is no sugar coating, no attempt to make these people's lives more tasty or more beautiful. What you see is what you get, and it's often sharp and sometimes heartbreaking. But it makes such a movie as "Chop Shop" so wonderful that the story develops so elegantly and finely. New York is just as good for a young brother and sister who is close to the homelessness, like someone who ever wants to get to work (and live) in a car body repair shop in Queens. Is it good or bad? This is a question that this movie actually puts on the viewer. This movie is really a fantastic piece of life that sometimes seems like a documentary instead of a drama, and it's a great thing because it seems and seems so real. In the middle of it, there are so many films based on the now surreal and often unlikely plots that stumble on the "Chop Shop", like a little pearl.
