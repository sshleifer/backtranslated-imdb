I saw that the film didn't know anything about this, this star, Chris Farley and David Spade, and I have to say that this movie is a comic classic. From time to time it is so stupid that it can only be fun. Farley is brilliant as a bumblebee idiot who takes his father with his right hand (equally excellent Spade) to find money to save the family car parts business. Relax, put your brain in an auto-pilot and have fun. Great supportive cast films like Brian Dennehy (Cocoon), Rob Lowe (Wayne World) and Bo Derek ("10"). Very recommended for a good laugh.
