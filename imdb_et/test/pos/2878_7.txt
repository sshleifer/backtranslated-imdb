I was expecting this movie to suck, but what I got was a pretty good movie / gore movie. Most death scenes are cruel enough. Teenagers are decent, Penny McNamee is definitely the best in the bunch. Rachael Taylor looks like young Christie Brinkley, but doesn't produce much more than a movie. The rabbit was good as a killer and is completely believable as a terrifying juggernaut. I saw the "twists" that come miles away, but I still enjoyed the movie. <br /> <br /> But what really looked out to me was the direction. Gregory Dark may actually be a career in front of a legit movie. Beyond the over-use of the horror movie "Speed ​​Camera" (you know where the boy's face is shaking fast?) There are some good pictures here. The corners and environments of the camera really emphasize the size of Kane, making it even bigger than it really is. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a deep story or characters, this is not the case. But that's not what movies like. If you are looking for some good violence or if you're into passionate movies, look at it!
