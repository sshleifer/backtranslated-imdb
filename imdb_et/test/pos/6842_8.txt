Recently, this movie came to be heard after that. This is a great non-pretentious movie for people who love film noir literature and movies. Not in the "camp", but humorous. <br /> <br /> GREAT SIZES! This film is from Carla Gugino and Emma Thompson to the German superstar Til Schweiger, an eye party. Alan Rickman is a very funny gang antagonist. It would be nice to see this movie and Emma Thompson's spin off, which would solve the cases and arguments between them all the time (like Tracy and Hepburn, etc.). <br /> <br /> Intelligent story, nice turn and scope of photography (don see if it's not scope because the compositions are very rich). <br /> <br /> Sexy sexy sexy and very fun time. believe!) <br /> <br /> ********
