I remember that the college professor commented on how this film disturbs, reflecting the apathy of adolescents (that was before the X). <br /> <br /> In some ways, most of us are products of the same product as consumer culture; these high school children spend their time drinking, at a high level and thinking about what to do with the body on the river. <br /> <br /> What would they do today? Are things different? Some very important questions. Keanu Reeves has some great scenes and an uncertain family with whom he lives; his 11 year old brother went to waste; mother has no idea what she is spending with her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> This movie was a bit ahead of its time because it solves the problems of lower-class American society; these children had no outlet; what is available to them in this dirt-water city? . In summary, there are some interesting social comments and no solutions. 9/10
