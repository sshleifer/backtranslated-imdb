The dark, gloomy New Year's Eve requires a sick sister, his life slowly moving away, to be brought to David Holm at the same time. We don't know yet who is David Holm or why this sister wants to see her, but her only dying desire is to talk to her once more. Holm (Victor Sjöström, who also led) and two drunken companions are waiting for the arrival of a new town on the other side of the city, conveniently in the tombstones of the local cemetery. "Here we can say when to have a new year," Holm exclaims, throwing a finger at the tower of the big clock, worshiping in the dark. However, he knows that he is not alive to welcome it. <br /> <br /> As time goes by, Holm is happy to give you a ghost story. He had once been the name of a friend George, a "cheerful companion" who was "wiser than us." One New Year, several years ago, George has shattered a potentially catastrophic blow, fearing that the last breath before midnight will be killed in order to drive a phantom ship next year, making a death offer and gathering souls for a dead person. "And gentlemen, George died last anniversary!" concludes Holm happily, not interfering with his blazing skepticism with regard to human beliefs. <br /> <br /> Because this fate is, of course, an unexpected violent encounter with Holm's death, just at midnight. When a man's transparent spirit rises harshly on his earthly body, his fear is that it is a far-reaching approach to phantom transport. A driver, a weak hidden figure - a sickle that is tightly gripped, moves and approaches. We are amazed to discover that the driver is no other than George, who is preparing his terrible duty to pass this year on to the offspring. this movie is absolutely great. The film artist Julius Jaenzon used a double exposure photo to create a spooky, ghostly silhouette of a truck and its damaged driver. Even today, the end result is very effective. Particularly impressive scene includes a phantom trolley on the ocean floor to get the soul of a sunken person. The second scene, reminiscent of Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, includes Holm, which breaks down the kitchen door with an ax to reach his fleeing wife and children. <br /> <br /> True evil Victor Sjöström's "Körkarlen" is an amazing cinema that successfully depicts Holm's persistent alcohol drops, his inevitable judgment day, and the ultimate hope of redeeming.
