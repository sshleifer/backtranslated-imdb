All these HALLOWEEN / Friday 13th slasher-style horror films surpassed the 80s, so it's a relief. <br /> <br /> Ten incredibly annoying teenagers (would you like to hang them funny?!) decide to throw a Halloween party at a local former funeral service "Hull House". During the "life of the past", the demon is unintentionally released and every person gets into the hands of others and kills. <br /> <br /> All this sounds very EVIL DEAD / DEMONS-ish, but Tenney lends some director style, there are some good linings, music is great, Steve Johnson's prosthetic makeup FX is scary and Linnea Quigley is pretty fun as a boy-crazy bimbo who puts his eyeballs with his fingers and makes an amazing new thing with a lipstick! <br /> <br /> Great fun no-brainer level! After checking the distribution of votes and other posted comments, I can't figure out how it got from only 4 out of 10 (?!). <br /> <br /> I give it out of 8 out of 10.
