I don't know how anyone could put this movie on. It is based on the actual story. It may not be "Rugby" itself, so that what has posted here must make a "real" rugby movie. It's not another typical sports film where the team sucks, they hire Emilio Estevez and turn around the team and win the championships and give everyone the warmth and fuzz. It focuses on STORY. This shows how someone can improve their lives. Movies that are now a day are related to sex, drugs, partying, etc. It's Hollywood. I am a big fan of films, but I have to say that it was an inspiring film with a great message. If you consider yourself a "tough guy", don't look at the movie, it doesn't meet your standards. If you want to watch a good, inspiring movie, it's good.
