I enjoyed this movie very much. I found it to be a lot of fun for me because I feel it hit the romance of a century-old Irish-American culture. No messages. There is no violence and no public sex, just a healthy 1947 style entertainment and Dennis Morgan had the opportunity to sing really good songs. Really good movie.
