I was fascinated by Niam's debut. I hope we will see more of our work soon. I was lucky enough to shoot my short NYC ride and hit me in the downtown 80s desperately seeking Susan and After Hours, but with a gentle whimsey that made it fresh and fun. A strong band that mostly plays against the type was a joy. And I thought the complex integrated plots were right. Sandra Bernhard puts her best after the comedy king, Peter Stormare is fun and Ling Bai touching. Look at this.
