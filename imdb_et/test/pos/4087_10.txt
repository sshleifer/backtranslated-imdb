Like some people here, love / loved Stingers! In Norway, it got a lot later. This also means we are in the 176th episode. (yes, that's right) I have to say I really love Stinger! It can shout, laugh, smile and so on. I think I'll die the day we arrive at the episode number 192. Stingers can be a series (except Gray anatomy) that I actually watch! The actors are amazing! Especially Jacinta Stapleton! Personally, I think he is one of the best access! I know he's not like SUPER-known, but he's really a big actor! Stingers makes me like to be a cop! I love it! <br /> <br /> P.S: Do you know if you can buy episodes?
