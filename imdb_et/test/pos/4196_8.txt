"I am ... head", said Mike Nesmith. He should be, because the film that many of us have been looting or have been researched and controlled by film professors works on many levels. <br /> <br /> Yes, It is almost as frustrating for many as it is for manufacturers to give you a movie and tempt you: "You see it." <br /> <br /> You probably already know that The Monkees TV show was a runaway marketing that depended on business and not on small public fraud. TV programs are first sold out of the sale of soap and toothpaste, as entertainment. get one thing straight: "The Head" is not the Monkees TV show. <br /> <br /> So we have a "psychedelic documentary" about Western pop culture from a source that has authority on this topic. , which can only come from them, m In 1968, Monkees was a cast and experienced team of experienced and tired people who had seen their part in promise and frustration. The film was a deliberate attempt to relocate the market. So, it did three things: make a movie of how the monkeys saw. Most importantly, the group will reinvent anyone who is not subject to its old bosses, and Yas, the hipper as before. Make a movie that discovers America's attitude to spreading information. <br /> <br /> "Head" is thus the manipulation of the media and its net result: fraud. The media should inform, educate us about events around the world and finally ask us to form opinions about events that can shape thoughts into positive action. So we assume that the information that we embrace is complete and impartial - otherwise, how can a valuable conclusion be drawn about the idea of ​​any book, newspaper or TV show? In a street interview "Head", the man concedes, "I have not been watching the newspaper or TV years." Is he a man smaller or better? Even drug parallels are soft "things are not as they appear". Remember the old joke, "Everything you know is wrong"? The scenario starts with the image produced by The Monkees' public and runs literally through football. Is the football scene a visual example of the whole "Good" idea in the film? Is the film a stream of consciousness? Is the film the culmination of the smoking marathons? There are too many coincidences in the film that suggest otherwise. I think "Head" is the culmination of motives somewhere between planned and involuntary. <br /> <br /> The insiders in charge of "Good" seem to be enjoying the phenomena of the film, but there is anger - the chaos that characterized the late 1960s and the anger in the media, especially on television, changed culture negatively. Drugs and violence were strong negative forces at the end of the 1960s and are still there, but "Good" manufacturers want you to know that bad "information" is a much greater risk. <br /> <br /> Wars are attributed to rogues and lies. What a great way to spread disinformation over TV? The mystical black box is a repeated obstacle to monkeys and seemingly to all of us. In one scene, Peter is sitting in a saloon with a melting cone of ice cream, and that is what my colleague, Mr Monkey, is asking, "What's wrong?" "I bought this ice cream cone and I don't want it." The film recommends that the first goal of the media is not to inform, but to sell it into a dark mass. "Head" goes further: puts some of the ideas on someone's head and happily goes. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers know this and the threat is real. The "head" is either a film that creates itself "when we go by" or is a deliberate statement. Maybe not. Maybe it's just a "Pot corresponds to advertising" as critics in 1968 broke down. The jokes are on Monkees and we. Be careful what you ask, you can get it. <br /> <br /> Greetings: real blame for pleasure. Very funny. Intelligent. Please fans. Find the substance, it's there. Unabashedly weird. Passionate collection of characters. Good setup. Length is suitable. Lots of great liners, including my all-time prophetic favorites: "The tragedy of your times, my young friends, is that you can get exactly what you want." Drugs. No plot. No idea has linear transmission. At least twenty-five stories that come into contact with each other. So, it can be easily distracted. It may seem like some pretentious. People who can't keep up with Monkeys do not have to look at it, although that in itself is not a reason to avoid it. Special psychedelic effects can kill your sick image tube or acid-burned eyes. <br /> <br /> Match, cut.
