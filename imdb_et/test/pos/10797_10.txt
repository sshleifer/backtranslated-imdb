In one of the less observed films of the late 1980s, when Oliver Stone traveled high with Plato and Wall Street (and before his Thursday-born opus), he wrote it to watch the world of radio, especially one in Texas, a radio provider. This man is Barry Champlain, a once-in-a-career Eric Bogosian who wrote the original play and also wrote the script. Barry is like Howard Stern's mix and one of those you hear in radio stations, many of us may turn off. He has received thoughts of his thoughts, opinions and not only is afraid to talk about them, but also to resist phone calls. In fact, the callers are the driving force of the film, as Barry has to fight against frantic, stupid, racist and purely absent people. As it goes on, he must also fight with his boss (Alec Baldwin) and strike or deal with disability to go nationwide, outside the southern boundary of the road, <br /> <br /> film I felt curious to see how it would be on stage done (I imagine it was a man's show because Bogosian has several sides), the film's direction is phenomenal. Stone is almost typologically known as a director who loves fast cuts, unlimited effects of editing and effects on camera work and other little trick styles that give his films a special, almost author-like appearance in the 90's. But in the 1980s, he had the energy and fever quality of the film and it wasn't as bad as the other movies. In order to add Barry Champlain to the studio and the main room, he and DP Robert Richardson have the right intensity that the room seems to be claustrophobic, sharp, insecure and certainly on the edge from time to time. The scenes in the middle of the film, if Barry is not in the studio, are quite common, but the style with the substance in the radio scenes is one of the best I've seen in the Stone / Richardson combination. /> <br /> And Bogosian, who may be unpleasant, insulting, angry, passive, and everything we love and hate in the radio show, cannot be wrongly calculated. There is also a funny, almost disturbing supportive role for Michael Wincott as Kent / Michael / Joe, who is killing him for one night, and the next one can be called in the studio. These scenes are somewhat uncomfortable to the viewer, but the main room of the 80s subculture, which Barry is so interesting as he is critical. Stoner may not get it, but as he tells him "it's your show." Indeed, everything that is going on is difficult to cover and there is a lot. But it's never boring and like Champlain itself, it's not easy to ignore. And when Bogosian goes into his climatic atmosphere, with a constant 360 revolution in the background, it becomes drunk and the reason why freedom of speech is so powerful. <br /> <br /> Stone has been synonymous with a hot-button questions filmmaker, receiving undeniable topics and giving them vitality that isn't always great, but it's all about. Here is not her skills and ambitions on Bogosia's roads - it is amplified, if at all, by making a highly qualified vision of what is essentially a one-man show that is in itself well written.
