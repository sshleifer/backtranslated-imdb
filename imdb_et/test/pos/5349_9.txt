My only problem with the rabbit curse is that the film doesn't take the time to introduce Wallace and Gromit to those who don't know the short films of the park. Strangely, "A Close Shave" can do this much less time saving. Still, I loved seeing boys' activities and loved all the new signs, human and otherwise. I especially loved the voice of Ralph Fiennes as Victor Quartermaine. It is also interesting to see a series on the big screen. Clay-type work is really striking. It's a hoot and big for the whole family! I buy very few DVDs but I have all Wallace and Gromit and I add it happily.
