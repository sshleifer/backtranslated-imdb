Looking at this strange little adventure movie, it is hard to believe that it was led by the same person who brought us such high-quality Giallo classics as Wardh's strange vice president and Scorpion tail case, but it must be said that despite being low-quality production values, Fish Men Island is a fun ride and one that definitely deserves more praise than it is. Like many Italian films from the seventies, it is one of the successes of a successful American film, which was critically produced by Dr. Moreau Island at that time. Sergio Martino's film has ideas such as mutation, greed, and adventure, and is transformed into one of the most influential films that form the burden of intriguing ideas, mostly of unity and logic. The central plot follows a boat that falls on a small island. It quickly turns out that not all of this place is normal, and it soon turns out that half of the population has become "fishermen" - a cross between human and fish, which exists for purely selfish reasons ... about the movie is that it's much more fun than ignoring the trashy production values. Central monsters seem completely ridiculous, and a large part of the film takes place on sets that look like they're paying a few cents - but the film is still well captured. The film is well done because the film is never boring. So the plot is not composed, it's not exactly a genius, but it takes a lot of ideas and I've seen movies that are much less thoughtful about the plots than that. The biggest location of the film is definitely the lost city of Atlantis. To be honest, I'm not a big fan of adventure movies and that's why this lost city doesn't see much - but it's always nice to see it in the movie. The central location of the island is good because it provides the setting for the story and also offers the movie with the right mysteries, because Martino uses the voodoo theme well. Generally, it's not just classic and there's definitely much worse trashy adventure movies than that.
