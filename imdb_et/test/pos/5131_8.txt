I saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good news for kids. A little predictable. The book was better, gave more plot details, an ore environment, and how the kids discovered the conspiracy. I think Hiassen's twisted humor is better in the book than in the movie, but there were many funny moments in the movie. Children under the age of 6 are probably a bit slow. He loved Jimmy Buffet as a science teacher. And these baby owls were divine. I don't know how they managed to shoot them. The movie showed the best of Florida, made it very attractive. Did I imagine it or did Carl Hiassen make a short look?
