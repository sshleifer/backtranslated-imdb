WARNING: SPOILER, SPOILER, SPOILER !!!! <br /> <br /> This is written for filmmakers who may have walked "Mood for Love" to failure and confusion when the main characters in life were choosing. When reading other comments and comments, it seems that many viewers and critics have left some very important details that may prevent them from enjoying this pleasant temptation from the movie. <br /> <br /> We are using so bold SEX in preaching that we forget that there was a time when the filmmakers suggested a "dirty act", simply showing loose-mouthed couples who ride a comb or haystack, but return to the swollen gut of the next scene or fat to toddler who is stuck in hip ...

Next scene: Mrs. Chan is headed to Chow in a taxi and says, "I don't want to go home today." Translation: "Let's Do It" <br /> <br /> Why did the couple just not make a modern thing to dump their spouses, divorce, raise their love for the child and live happily? The answer is that this whole story takes place in Hong Kong during the sixties. Bastard would live in a disgraceful shameful life if he were a child of the adultery, given that a "legitimate" child can live a tragic but noble / honest life when his mother decided to fool him away from his "father" - invisible to Mr. Chan.
