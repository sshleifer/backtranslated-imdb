This is a cute little movie that offers a lot of what it promises - some good entertainment. After all, when the film declares that it has the best SASS shooters, you must show that it is unlikely to be the best Oscar candidate. These guys are shooters, not actors. Your next idea is that the film doesn't celebrate Nicholas Cage or Jennifer Aniston, so you shouldn't wait to see the current hottest names. It was just to be an ordinary old entertainment, and in this respect it is just as good as many of the old "kaers" I've seen over the years. <br /> <br /> SO, what can you get "Hell? You get 100 minutes of good old entertainment. You'll get the chance to see some of the last years of stars who work pretty much like what they're in their main, but slightly older age you see some good SASS shooters in the main roles and some SASS hams in the background.I had a lot of fun when I saw the people I have been visiting, and who are my good friends, do something many people dream about - they are honest, live honestly in gosh film. They do something that many wannabe actors and wannabe shooters never get, and i think it's worth watching for that. <br /> <br /> Not everyone is a member of SASS and so I saw a lot of fun and humor that others might miss, but it's still good, old-fashioned entertainment, and frankly there are a lot of movies in the theater so I don't see nickel, so save money to go, see Brokeback Mountain to get "Hell to Pay" and no needle some real cowboys.
