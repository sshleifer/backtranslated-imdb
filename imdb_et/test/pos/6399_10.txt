The biggest problem facing the Key West TV channel was that it was advertised incorrectly. When you saw the ads you thought it was confusing and very frustrated. It was a much more complicated show. <br /> <br /> I was in Key West just before Hurricane Andrew's hit and I think I found myself drinking or with two rum runners. Of course, it was before the hit. I saw a couple of times the opening race that was opening, and I talked to the man you see in the opening of the coconut. He was a real local. Yes, I'd like to see it on a DVD.
