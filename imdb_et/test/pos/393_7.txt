Very enjoyable 50-west. I have it in my collection and recommend it to Western fans. <br /> <br /> The most Victor Mature movie and I think it's pretty well done. <br /> <br /> He is a trapper who joins a frontier station with a spy. The Red Cloud caught three of them in his country and took his property. They all took part in the loss after the loss. <br /> <br /> Victor has set his eyes on the Colonel's wife and lives in life without touching the rules. <br /> <br /> but not characters of great depth or sensitivity to others. <br /> <br /> 50 in the West are my favorites and it slips easily to satisfaction. Such a west is on the pages of the past, and may never again do much. One to enjoy. Gave 7 ratings to it. Probably 6.8, but such films become more expensive over time. <br /> <br /> Film-Noir for fans ... "The Big Steal" "They live at night" "Side Street" is the most wonderful movies I enjoyed. Purchased and viewed. Similarly to Western countries, Noir seems to be similar. Some long ago and never.
