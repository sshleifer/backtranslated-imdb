I saw SEA OF DUST as part of the NYC screening audience several years ago. I enjoyed the movie at that time, so some of the changes I made were a little confused. Maybe it's my memory, but it seemed like expositions appeared at the Rhode Island film festival. I'm really not sure which version I prefer, but I can honestly say I found something to evaluate both. <br /> <br /> Let me first warn you that this is not a popcorn movie. Although advertised as a tribute to Hammer Films, Van Helsing and Dracula are very disappointed. There is some cleavage, but no nudity (staple fibers of later films from the British production building). And while SEA OF DUST is full of gorgeous eye candies (really like the sixties film) and features Hammer starlet Ingrid Pitt, it doesn't like any image of the company in tones or filling. This movie is very dark, very confusing and (at times) very funny. I don't remember that the earlier version is the same as this one, but it's not a bad thing (especially a show in Black Fores that plays like three Stooges). And some of Mrs Pitt's rants are pretty fun. It's like someone who wounds her and turned her up. <br /> <br /> The uniqueness of this movie is not borrowed with details. That's ideas. As a random Sci Fi Channel viewer, I have constantly taken the network to make a variation of one note (the CGI monster kills, then destroyed). SEA OF DUST is so full of ideas that you will travel after some time. <br /> <br /> But don't get me wrong. I don't complain. When I praise something, I commend these men for taking such an entrepreneurial low budget picture and the courage to pack it with so many concepts. It's not going to be a picnic for people who don't want to think about movies (you know who you are). But for the rest of us, those of us who are tired of the formula of the horror of today's horror, the predictability of the audience, it may be your ticket.
