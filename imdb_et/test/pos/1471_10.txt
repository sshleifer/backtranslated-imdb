Well, I saw yesterday and it was much better than the other VH1 withdrawal, too bad as it is pretty outdated, but you see all the employees who make the South Park, very interesting things. It is also funny when this documentary depicts Trey and Matti as selfish greedy snob-creators who don't work and spend all the time relaxing or relaxing (which is kind of ironic because they work pretty hard at the show). It also shows the whole animation process to make a South Park episode, the voice of the interview actors, and more. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of South Park I recommend it.
