I think this movie was recommended by the shop I earned it! Because once he was a bang! What a great movie! First of all, I was convinced that James McAvoy & Romola Garai were Irish as convincing as their accents were; and half way through the movie I was absolutely convinced that Steven Robertson was a disabled actress and pretty sure James McAvoy was! When I looked at the DVD's peculiarities and saw both participants in their "normal" shade, saying that I was blown would be an underestimation !!! I remember Dustin Hoffmann back in the 80s back to portraying autism in the Rainman - frankly (in my opinion, of course!) Steven Robertson's play / imagination dustin Hoffmann out of the water - and he deserves to be so !! All in all, one of the greatest images of humankind's friendship / love / relationship - and this was done in Britain / Ireland with domestic breeders - leave it in your tube and smoke it in Hollywood!
