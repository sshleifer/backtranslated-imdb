Although I agree that it was a sitcom of the 1950s, it doesn't feel "typical". First, Donna Reed was a STRONG woman, unlike the usual 50s of sitcom mothers. She stood up for the value and equality of women (remember the episode where the television shower says "just a housewife") and Donna stands for all women and represents, especially those who don't work outside the home? And when women broke something against the series, it was nothing trivial ... it was always something to show that women have the right to treat the same respect as men. Remember, Donna Reed married the show manufacturer so she had a lot more to make her powerful sign. <br /> <br /> Children were intelligent but not early. They were ordinary children. And they could act. <br /> <br /> Something else that made the Donna Reed Show stand out was not just the kids when they saw their parents, but you could feel the chemistry between the actors in the real world, which then appeared in the characters. Shelly Fabares and Paul Peterson have often written and noted that they were treated as children of Donna Reed and Carl Betz, and that adults defended the child's actors and treated them accordingly. Don and Alex had some kind of sexual chemistry that wasn't shown by other family events. And the characters can be flawed and in a big way and still accepted errors and errors. They weren't superuniverses who were not mistaken and had no emotional heights or heights. They were normal people who were normal. <br /> <br /> Women's Rights, Drug Abuse, Child Abuse, Singles, Poverty, Children in Need of Good Health Care, But Can't Afford ... It was all shown at this show. Pretty groundbreaking for the era. <br /> <br /> Donna Reed's exhibition will not last for eight years without a reason. And that could have been tolerated if it had not been the separation of Tony Owens and Donna Reed. <br /> <br /> This exhibition is very underestimated and should be shown so that other generations can appreciate quality. <br /> <br In conclusion, I agree with the original poster, which apparently takes care of the show, but I think Donna Reed's show has much more to offer than casual entertainment.
