"Müllers Büro" is a movie that many watch and enjoy, while others stop it in five minutes. This is a detective film parody with all revolutions; the action takes place only at night in the dark corners of the city, similar to Batman's Gotham City (look carefully at the streets, buildings, police car trappers, etc.). It is also a musical parody with really funny characters such as Müller's secretary and Vitasek (an actor who plays Müller's assistant) who do their best to not, though not very successfully. <br /> <br /> characters have their own presence on the film, such as a decadent blue box (a real club in Vienna with the name of a sailor who hits a girl in the background, Müller's flat black-colored walls and a messy kitchen, Müller's office your assistant with a tasty picture, etc. <br /> <br /> The humorous moments of the film are many and contain "flat face" humor, such as Müller's farting on his assistant's face, a prostitute who uploaded Müller's extra orgasm, the ridiculous equipment of Montana's female relatives, and so on. <br /> <br /> 80's legendary film, especially for those interested in Austrian or German-speaking movies.
