This is the last episode of the Goldenboy OVA series. Kentaro finds himself in the work of an animation studio, which is quite interesting if you don't know anything about the way an anime studio works. In addition to episode 3, it was probably the least solution, but it had a nice girl feeling, as well as a surprise reunion from previous episodes. My only complaint about this episode is that it seemed a bit too short, but at the same time it could only be because it was the only original script that was not based on one manga chapter. but it ended well, leaving us with a pleasant feeling that Kentaro is permanently 25, studying. Be sure to follow the rest of the series throughout the journey, buy a whole series like $ 17, watch it in about 2 hours or watch your favorite episode if you have 20 minutes of free time (what I do when I have lunch at school). Good series, look at it.
