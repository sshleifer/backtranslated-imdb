Violence is poured into a theater despite a terrifying title. Jake Gyllenhaal visited Conan O'Brien to advertise the film and explained that Rendition was euphemism to obtain information through torture. From September 11, the 'extraordinary rendition' allowed the government's intelligence agency to undoubtedly issue people without any due process and to use the tools needed to exchange information. <br /> <br /> Gyllenhaal is played by CIA Analyzer Douglas Freeman (Mark Irony) who has been torn by his mission, making him an observer of irregular interrogation proceedings in an underground facility outside the US. Omar Metwally plays suspected terrorist Anwar El-Ibrahim, Egyptian national and green card carrying the American Isabella Fields El-Ibrahim (Reese Witherspoon). Isabella and his son expect Anwar to come home from a scientific conference when he suddenly disappears from the airplane passenger manifesto. She is looking for help from her college friend who works for the government and learns that the intelligence manager, Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep) is behind it. <br /> <br /> The play is directed by Hollywood novice Gavin Hood (who is destined to do X-Men Origins: Wolverine) and asks if such an "extraordinary rendition" is being used in real life. The film was released on the spot by Glorietta's explosion (bombardment / failure?) And the main scene of the movie is when a public explosion bomb explodes, so it must have sent refrigerators to every moving spine. Seeing that there is a single red and yellow mark in the top right corner of the screen with Ayala? Exploding table and silence and slow moving images, increased the effect of the real coincidence of the scene. <br /> <br /> You can learn from this movie and it all comes from personal decisions every day. We all have a choice of what we want to do, and we often do not always want to see how those others influence who may end up as victims of such unfortunate circumstances. What "greater benefit" should not be a forced choice that our leaders must take if we all decide right from the source. Now it's worth utopia.
