If you like exquisite psychological drama / thrillers then this is a movie for you. Those who want to see a normal sexual erotic thriller will certainly not understand this movie, as Colin Firth probably did when he called it "garbage". But Jennifer Rubin is still the real star of the movie. She is such a wonderful and beautiful actor! Together with turning and twisting, which is becoming more and more psychological and makes you think, wonderful management, photography and especially music make this movie a masterpiece. Small parts are also very good, especially Belinda Waymouth is terrible in his little scene. I hope it will be released soon on DVD and the soundtrack album would be a dream!
