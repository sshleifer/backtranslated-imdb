This Christmas gift came from TCM. We've never seen this movie before, although we've seen most of Barbara Stanwyck's movies. This comedy made us so much laugh that sometimes we had to listen to the dialogue. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that should be seen by people suffering from stressful situations, especially about Christmas. Surely this spirits would just lift up. The film would give a perfect gift in the form of a DVD or VHS tape. <br /> <br /> "Christmas in Connecticut" led Peter Godfrey to a great spirit based on the story of Aileen Hamilton. <br /> <br /> The best movie of this era is the two most popular stars: Barbara Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan. Barbara Stanwyck always played strong deliberate women, apparently at a pace. In this movie, but also "Lady Eve", Ms. Stanwyck shows comedy. He and Mr Morgan, who played a lot of music comedies, made a winning combination. Sydney Greenstreet, an actor who has heard of "heavy" gaming, is delighted to see how rich and fat, Alexander Yardley, the man who possessed the media empire and who knew that good when he saw it. Enhanced English actress Reginald Gardiner adds two stars behind the headlines. <br /> <br /> S. Z. Sakall is another source of continuous mind; He plays Hungarian chef Felix, who has a hard version of his English version. Una O'Connor also makes perfect Norah, housekeeper Sloan's perfect Connecticut farm. <br /> <br /> Reading other comments in this forum is a sad fact that some people are not recognizing the glorious black and white cinematography. After all, color was not widely used in the 40s and most classic films have to be viewed in their original format, because what would be their coloring? <br /> <br /> This movie should be a requirement that anyone who wants to spend almost two hours of uninterrupted fun at Christmas is guaranteed full enjoyment. Look at it with an open mind and heart, maybe you want to see "Christmas in Connecticut" every year.
