When gilmore girls started in Germany, I didn't want to watch them because for me it was something that was not unique. it was a series and I didn't even know anyone in it. Later, I realized that Edward Hermann is part of a ship's cast part (film, I absolutely adore). I had to watch it once with a friend and never stopped. it's just fun. You have the feeling that before getting married is sexual, and it's okay to have a coffee junkie and eat unhealthy things all the time. I don't do these things all the time, but when I do these things, I feel a little like a gilmore girl. even my boyfriend started watching them and it says something. from season to season it improved to scripts and to the northwest. they have an open mind and different than all other examples, you want to be similar.
