Meryl Streep can be the biggest actor today. His chameleon images are never surprised; he seems to be the characters he brings to the screen. "One real thing" gives her life to a deceptive, straightforward, deeply complicated woman who does her best to play the hand of her. The survival of cancer is not an easy task, and not only survival, but also the continuation of life is even more difficult - and that is what Kate Gulden (Streep) does. Not only does Renee Zellweger ("Jerry Maguire") keep her in this glorified company, but she looks like a daughter of Streep, who learns to see her parents' lives both new and old. Streep is a violence and earned his Oscar nomination for his work; his "I'll never say it" dialogue with Zellweger leaves you devastating. But Zellweger is a real revelation - his face conveys every emotion, conflict, when he learns a lot of truth about the strengths and weaknesses of his parents. Directed by Carl Franklin ("Devil in a Blue Dress") is a highly sophisticated story about material security and delicacy.
