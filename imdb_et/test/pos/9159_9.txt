NBC put a lot of good products out of this series, but none of them got the viewers. At least according to their managers who wisely canceled good exhibitions like Star Trek & My World & Welcome To It due to low ratings. NBC advertisers received a bargain on NBC's ignorance. <br /> <br /> This exhibition stands out as the only time James Garner couldn't get to viewers. This is ashame, because this exhibition was a great support for Stuart Margolin (later in the Angels Rockford files), to Neva Patterson for Margot Kidder. Garner played a sheriff who did not want to use his violence to perform his duties. It was a small town stuff, but it was great. It wasn't long after Jim Rockford brought success to Garner, but for my money, this exhibition was good enough, it just wasn't on time, in the right place, and didn't give the right opportunity. <br /> <br /> The exhibition was so good that most of the people who worked on it were also working in Rockford.
