Spirit and chaos is the artistic biopsy of the Japanese poet and writer Miyazawa Kenji, which was active in the early 20th century. The film captures and interprets its artistic method ("sketching" poems), its inspiration (the spirit of nature and its fantastic beauty) and its struggles to accept harsh realities before its idealistic imagination. <br /> <br /> The film was beautifully integrated into pieces of Miyazawa poems. His relationship with his students was powerful, especially in one scene where he offers everything he has, to a student who has just been caught to steal materials from the classroom. Miyazawa's selfless sympathy for farmers, siblings and other unhappy people in his village can be a lesson for us all. In addition, Miyazawa's commitment to science is beautifully depicted. At a time when western ideas were still being held against skepticism, especially in provincial cities such as Miyazawa, it understands its usefulness in helping its fellow citizens and is inspired by its elegance. The way the film presented the artist's passion and disappointment in the writer was truly intense and well interpreted. <br /> <br /> I felt that the film-integrated CGI, while innovative, interfered more with organic animation. It may be said that it was deliberate to represent the conflict within the main character, but I found it to be unethical. I would also like the film to discuss the Buddhist influence of Miyazawa, but it worked well without it. <br /> <br /> Although this movie was very well done. I'll give him 9/10, one point being deducted from CGI. Otherwise, all the animations, plots and dialogues were wonderful and cordial. Kawamori Shoji has not seen any other movies, but after seeing it, I give them a chance.
