Un Gatto nel Cervello or Nightmare Concert, as it is more common among an English-speaking audience, begins with a horror film director Lucio Fulci (played by Lucio Fulci himself) who goes to lunch after filming a very gory & violent scene. & is a terrible vision of cannibalism. Grotesque visions, hallucinations and dreams continue and will affect his mental state, Fulci decides to seek help and contacts from Professor Egon Schwarz (Dvid L. Thompson) for psychiatric care. Schwarz argues that Fulci cannot separate fantasies from reality and agrees to help him, but Schwarz has a more embarrassing rear motive because the serum killer is going to kill the prostitutes brutally, and Fulci thinks he may be responsible .... <br /> > This Italian production was written and staged by Lucio Fulci, who is also filming in the movie as a horror film director Lucio Fulci, who does not feel that it has been a lot of trouble. something else and just because I liked it. The manuscript of Fulci, John Fitzsimmons, Giovanni Simonelli and Antonio Tentor is nothing more than an affectionate excuse to edit the footage of many other Italian films. It serves its purpose well enough, and I think there is some magic on the Fulci screen when your fan or his films are familiar, the end is almost as if they were getting money because he just has a policeman tell Fulci that they killed the killer and that's it. The second thing that ended when the two police put the white pages out of the dead killer and then walk away, leaving it without any other police presence, I mean, the Italian police would just leave the dead body in the middle of this field? It moves at a good pace and if you like your gore then you have to see it, though if you don't like gore, you hate it with passion, everything depends on your disposition, so the choice is your choice. <br /> <br /> Director Fulci was never the most artistically adept filmmaker and it shows here, because his film material is happier, flat and looks like it's made on the TV, movies from other films (7 in total) match with Fulci's hit and it is obvious that it is divided into different films. If you are looking for a somewhat jackpot, splitting people with chainsaws, putting meat on grinding machines, melting the face, some pieces, there are some slits, somebody's body is crushed lightly under the car, ruck out under the tongue, somebody's crushed like a wheelchair running over there have loads of stabbings, no one has their intestines removed from the hook, there is a rotting body with maggots, no one's hands are cut off, someone has their head bashed in & their eyes fall out, gory death piano wire because it slices through someone's throat, there are loads Separated from limbs, gallons of blood splashed around and the scene some cats eat in the brain and there is more also. Having said that, some special effects are a bit fake and beautiful. <br /> <br /> The estimated budget of around $ 100,000 indicates that it is rather inexpensive, but has no visual style or artistic merit, but then why would you want them when you see a Nazi orgy wall-to-wall? Working in this is terrible, including Fulci. Un Gatto nel Cervello is the top film when your gore-hound is like me, but if you are looking for something a little more substance or any substance then they are not for you. It's a movie that shares people right in the middle, you love what it does or hates.
