This film is quite possible due to "silly comedy" and Mike Judge "Office Space". If you are a fan of Mike, or enjoy exhibitions like Futurama, then you are making a difficult service, leaving it a little known, limited release. Although the DVD has very few "bonus features", this movie is definitely funny to make up for its lack of value. <br /> <br /> This movie is an army called Joe Bower. (played by Luke Wilson) who is part of a secret military experiment aimed at preserving troops during peacetime so that they can be defeated during the war to fight our country. But things will be interesting if the general responsible for the operation is interrupted in the prostitution cycle and the test is all but forgotten. Bowers and his racket Rita (played by Maya Rudolph) both find themselves awake in 2505, when the natural selection of American people is increasingly stupid. Now Joe and Rita have to find the way to the time machine to get back to 2005 with Frito (played by Dax Shepard). <br /> <br /> What I really enjoyed about this movie was Mike Judge's comedy satire from US history over the past 50 years and how mankind is progressing over the next 500 years. This is evidenced most by advertising in a film that has become the headquarters of American culture. Indicators such as South Park's mainstream media make it easy to understand how to draw conclusions that in the future, contempt has become a marketing tool. It is portrayed in the film with humorous subtle things like "Fudd-Ruckers", which change their name to "Butt-F ### ers", and the billboard showing "If you can't smoke Tarryltons ... F ## # You!" . I can't stop laughing at Carls Jr's role in this future, their slogan "F ### you ... I eat" and their automated kiosks advertise their "Extra Big-A ## Tacos". (more molecules)! This movie contained everything I go to the movies. An excellent, sharp, witty comedy, as well as a tempting piece, make this DVD age. Warn, however. If you are not a fan of Mike, don't care about Beavis and Butthead, and have no sense of humor, this movie is probably not suitable for you. Otherwise I would say that this is probably the most fun movie that comes out in 2506 ... I mean 2006.
