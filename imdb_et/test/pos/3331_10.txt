Come on. Anyone who does not understand its size here has to hit all the panels of the critic. They should not be listened to because they probably have no sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Anyone who doesn't like it here must be an animated animated cartoon directed by Tex Avery, to be chaired and forced to watch "Huckleberry Hound" episodes for 20 years straight! <br /> <br /> In this cartoon, Wolf's twin shots and the best examples of this important comedy from the past have ever been recorded on film. <br /> <br /> Tex Avery should receive this comic for the comics of the Academy Award. That's the best.
