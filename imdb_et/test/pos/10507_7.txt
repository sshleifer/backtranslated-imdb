I was waiting on the DVD for a perversion of the camp from the creators of society and Re-Animator, and I was quite surprised to participate in an authentic stop. The action was top-notch (nice to see Vosloo's winner after a long row of runners), which included and a few revolutions rather surprising. I thought I'd like to quickly get through to the scenes of robbery, but I looked through it, just finished right now. I said earlier that I didn't expect much more than an alien. Of course, if you are looking for some hot alien sex, you will let you down. It was mostly a quick cut exam table that was meaningless with a glimpse of-and-you-miss-this glimpse of an interesting "impregnator" alien.
