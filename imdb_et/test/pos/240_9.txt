In Brooklyn, the nightclub dancer Rusty Hayworth has a simple but happy life dancing in McGuire, owned by her boyfriend Danny (Gene Kelly). Rusty, Danny and Genius (Phil Silvers) are a Friday night ritual: they order oysters at the bar, trying to find a pearl. Rusty's life changes when she participates and wins the front of the Vanity magazine. He has been invited to work at a large theater in Broadway, whose owner offers him. She loses her luck and starts drinking in her new lifestyle, leaving Danny and her old friends in love. "Cover Girl" is a delightful romantic comedy, very naive and with great parts like beauty and talented Rita Hayworth dances, sings and acts; Gene Kelly, especially in two scenes dancing with herself and Rusty and Geniuse on the street; Dance songs and choreography are also remarkable. Danny, the character of Gene Kelly, is almost disgusting with his chauvinistic behavior. Rita Hayworth surprised me with her talent: I found her amazing "Gilda", but she's a stunning "Cover Girl". According to the cover of the VHS, "Cover Girl" was the first musician, where the songs were part of the plot, giving the story continuity rather than just throwing it in the movie. My sixteen-year-old son saw this movie with a friend of the same age at a recent Gene Kelly festival and loved Cover Girl, so I dare say that this classic is recommended for all film lovers and not just the old generations. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Modelos" ("Models")
