For those of you who have thought about what might be an art-house monster movie, you no longer know. The DAIMAJIN trilogy, about 1966, was just such a series. More time on samurai epic than anything else, these three movies just happen to be one of the most (literally) monstrous deux to machinas ever. There are no facets of these gems that are unpolished, from scenario to performances to filmmaker's finishing. Even special effects are handled with above average skill and are integrated (in most cases) almost smoothly into the film (s). If you're a fan of GOJIRA or a fan of samurai movies or one of us who just loves a good movie regardless of genre, I recommend the DAIMAJIN trilogy.
