The recent French criminal film (the original title of "Du Rififi Chez les Hommes"), whose famous 20-minute silent gemstone has now appeared, will be released in the US in a new print called "Criterion Collection" with better subtitles and some extras. Jules Dassin was an American (born Julius Dassin Middletown in Connecticut) who was forced to film in Europe because he was on the blacklist. Rifif was well publicized in the US and he did well in art buildings. Later, Dassin became more famous in the US "once on Sunday" (1960), playing his wife, Greek actress and political activist Melina Mercouri. (Greece was glamorized again and popularized with Americans and others with Anthony Quinn in Mihali Kakogian '1964' 'Zorba Greek' ', which was even a big hit in Cairo.) The new Rifif DVD contains a recent interview with Dassin. I didn't know before that one of the main robbers, Cesar Milanese, was playing Dassin, who stepped in when the original actor wasn't available. He is one of the most memorable characters, a dated Italian cracker who doesn't speak French. <br /> <br /> Although this classic class is all a French movie noir - a black-and-white twilight world of well-lit apartments, glossy black cars, men's suits, nightclub scenes, including dramatically filmed and illuminated song vocals, rocky faces and Gauloise or in the mouth - I don't think it's atmospheric or as distinctive as Melville movies. But there is a mesmerizing robbery that is still on the road today. It goes like a watch mechanism where robbers have good craft and teamwork. Some nervous policemen are working effectively. Things go home quickly when they go home and loot when one player gets sloppy and gives him a one million dollar bracelet. Has there ever been a film that the perps lived happily? <br /> <br /> This is an unspoken queue of queues, which gives it a special place, and American director Dassin, who had an unusually diverse and exotic career, deserves it completely. He made the novel so usual that he rejected it and added some important elements that make it special. In this case he could not pass on the adjustment: he needed the money too much. Jean Servais, who plays the role of leader Tony le Stephano, was an actor rather than a luck. His gloomy face is perfect for the role. Later, he played a leading role in Dassin's He Who Must Die (1957), who used the political story of Greek actors. "Topkapi" is a somewhat disappointing captive film of 1964 (that is, compared to "Rifif"), which also got the spread of the US. It has a good place, but it's wasted, gone all bright and bright and prettified. The most popular choice is Dassini's post-Hollywood's "Never Sunday" with its pleasant theme song and charismatic hero (and won the best movie in Cannesis in 1960); "Who needs to die" political choice; "Rififi" genre selection. His strange piece is his "Phaedra" Mercouri and Tony Perkins (1962). The harsh Hollywood genre workers would leave them and favor Dassin's early films, including prison drama, "Brute Force" (1947), the police club "Naked City" (1948); and two hard cores, Thieves' Highway (1949) and Night and the City (1950). Personally, I tend to like the French noir and the American neo-noir spinoffs better than the original American Noir source material - so my lasting charm is "Rififi". But Dassin is quite unique because he did not only make Hollywood but Paris and produces a memorable example of his Fifties French derivative.
