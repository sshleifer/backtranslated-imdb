This film is in 1979. The almost forgotten pearl of the year, which was essentially a comedy based on one of the UK's largest bankers. In fact, one of the films that this film feels is "caper", which means that it itself shows the type of film. A bunch of lovable fangs who are not violent or psychotic types who evil the biggest job in their lives. To be honest, I really don't know too much about real crime and can't comment if it accurately depicts events that have opened up or involved with the characters. <br /> <br /> Richard Jordan works very well with PINKY Green and is very believable as a little time for an American born crook who seems very comfortable with himself. I have to add that sometimes American actors struggle with English speakers in a British film, chemistry is not always there, but it is not a problem for Jordan who fits his role. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that Jordan itself was probably one of the least underrated actors in the 70s and 80s and never got the recognition he deserved. He seemed to be upholding the roles and B-films, not his fair ability to act. He has played the corrupt police EDDY COYLE, a sadistic killer in MASSAGE. In my SECRET OF JUSTICE, he played a kind of comic character of Gordon Gehco, and he played a good man in the 1980s EQUALIZER TV show. All this shows the versatility of his acting skills, while mixing David Niven, Kurt Russell, Edward Woodward and Robert Mitcham. <br /> <br /> In this movie, he plays his role as a little run-time for the women of the eye, and you take your character and roots right away. You can't like Green, ??? ? you see that he really wanted to go straight, but when it was extruded, it seemed that it was all too big a way to go and finally he was happy about thinking about that money. <br /> <br /> David Niven is a boss and invites shots, the police inspector playing Richard Johnson, who was usually a noisy but thorough London detective who clearly loves his job. Other supporting pains don't say too much, but looking at them, they were all very well-known British character actors, who often found themselves either a villain or a cap (not so ironic). Elkie Sommers, Oliver Tobias, do what they have to do, and it is good to see Gloria Graham as a companion. Bank of all things and come and go if he wants. Not only did he pull the court after the trial, but it was not as far removed as it seemed, in the 1960s and 70s, the security was not as close as it is now. <br /> <br /> The film itself is a couple of interesting observations. In a small amount of time, perseverance draws too much. There are other movies where it is, BRINKS MAT. It is not only the destruction or hiding of looting, but so many people who are involved are careless, begin to blab or simply break. In addition, the authorities are dropping a great deal of local jaundice when such massive robbery is carried out. They also say that there is no honor among the thieves, but Ivan was sure that PINKY got rid of it. When you saw that you could kill, you had only too much gaze in your docks, a glance at full betrayal! How could he care for them all after him? You have to ask yourself why is it that scammers can be so stupid? Did Green really think she could talk about suspicion sweetly the second time? His innocent-looking face and well-designed alibi, the whole whim hanging from the interior, doesn't cheat on the inspector at Watford. In addition, you need to think about why they leave so many clues? A safe numbered notebook, travel brochures for foreign trips, leaving a telescope and unusual behavior on the day of robbery that was out of character. Common sense policing Insp Watford quickly had a green yardstick, picking him up and soon he was like singing a canary. It only shows how, despite thoughtful planning, it can get rid of it very quickly, there is never a pure rest for every body, some of them always get nabbed. Although it is worth noting that a lot of money has never been recovered. <br /> <br /> A fun movie, an interesting story from London and England in the late 70s, a very fast, big ending. I would recommend this especially if you enjoy capers. (Note: I recently purchased this from a DVD, but the transfer was apparently taken from a VHS tape and is of poor quality. Therefore, it doesn't cost too much!)
