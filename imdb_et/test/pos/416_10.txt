"Ahh ... I didn't order any amazing hits" ..... "We have one" Hack is just the biggest TV show ever made. A little bit I died when I did. one Friday night to catch a little Hack and it wasn't. The exhibition digs deeply into the main social issues of our culture. I found that at the end of each episode I watched; I went away, being both entertained and informed. I'm actually a dumber now that Hack has gone. I no longer want needy and less fortunate. As Hack is gone, I see them as an eye-catcher and an unnecessary burden on taxpayers. So for God's love we have to take Hack back!
