BEING Warner Brothers' second historical drama, featuring a civil war and a small-horn battle, General George Armstrong Custer, dead on their boats (Warner Brothers, 1941) was much more accurate in these two; Especially as opposed to SANTA FE TRAIL (Warner Brothers, 1940), which really didn't give the bar very high. <br /> <br /> ALTHOUGH's both photos were starring Errol Flynn's vehicles. part of Custer. Since it was "Dutch", himself, Ronald Reagan, who depicted an astonishing egomanial Cavalryman in an earlier picture, then Mr Flynn played with Virginia and later with Confederate Hero General, J.E.B. (or Jeb) Stuart; Errol took part of Custer with their MESSAGES ON. <br /> <br /> Once again, Warner Brothers has a tendency to use a large number of trusted characters from Warner's repertoire. the film is a kind of authenticity and everything is really in front of our own eyes. The main roles are some of the better-known actors and actors, such as: Elizabeth Bacon / Mrs. Custer (co-star Olivia de Havilland), Ned Sharpe (Arthur Kennedy), Samuel Bacon (Gene Lockhart), Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn), Californy (Charlie Grapwin), Major Taipe (Stanley Ridges), General Phillip Sheridan (John Litel ), Callie (Bacon's servant, Hattie McDaniel). <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is just full of unredeemed but experienced players like Joe Sawyer, Eleanor Parker, Minor Watson, Tod Andrews, Irving Bacon, Roy Barcroft, Lane Chandler, Spencer Charters, Frank Ferguson, Francis Ford , William Forrest, George Eldridge, Russell Hicks, William Hopper, Hoppity Hooper, Eddie Keane, Fred Kelsey, Sam McDaniel, Patrick McVey, Frank Orth, Eddie Parker, Addison Richards, Ray Teal, Jim Thorpe Minerva Urecal, Dick Wessel, Gig Young and many more. <br /> <br /> Film moves very fast, especially early; it will slow down as needed as the story moves to post-civil war, the appointment of Custer as colonel in the 7th cavalry, and the ultimate fate in Little Big Horn, Montana. Under the direction of director Griffith Veteran, Raoul Walsh, the film hits very different emotions; very serious, exciting battle scenes and convincing historical scenes; looking as if they were photographs of Matthew Brady's Civil War. As with most of Mr. Walsh's films, he ends many scenes and speeds up a bit of humor; but not going overboard and risking the film becoming a comedy (actually a farce). <br /> <br /> AS mentioned earlier, it's much more factual than its predecessor, SANTA FE TRAIL (the last time I mention it, aus Schultz, Scouts au!). But this does not mean that it would not be without some "artistic and literary license", as almost all bioplastics have. It would be impossible to do the same movie if indeed all the facts and probably the most erroneous engagement and the most obvious literary call to the business that Custer was occasionally promoted to the Brigadier General did not happen. "Gag" both helped to move the film, while it emphasized the whole light, a carefree feeling that passed through the early part of the film. <br /> <br /> DIRECTOR Walsh and Mr Flynn have collaborated with us which seems to be characteristic of this legendary civil war hero who was very close to the real person, and they did it at the end of the incident, being Lakota Sioux, Cheyenne and Fukowi Massacre Custer and his 7th Cavalry Small Big Horn. At that time, on June 25, 1876, "Custer's latest status" was as big a gap and shock as the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941), or the indignation committed by him. Islamic Fascists on New York's Double Trade Towers and United States Armed Forces Headquarters in Pentagon, Arlington, Virginia on September 11, 2002. <br /> <br /> JUST as many movies from that time on WORLD WAR II (and years immediately before) there were so many incidents there , which were inadvertently made to show the virtues that would be needed during the second global conflict, as we were at the time they were dead. THE INSTALLATION ended their original theatrical announcement. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
