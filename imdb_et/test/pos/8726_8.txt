Goldie Hawn was best known in 1969 for television comedy presentations - especially ROWAN AND MARTIN'S LAUGH IN, where she was a giggly cookie young blonde. He made films before CACTUS FLOWER, the most notable being the Walt Disney feature, ONE, and ONLY GENUINE ORIGINAL FAMILY. But CACTUS FLOWER took its character from LAUGH-IN and (thanks to a good script IAL Diamond - Billy Wilder's second partner - based on the Abe Burrows game), he was able to develop the character of television so that true performance would be specified. As a result, Ms Hawn won the Oscar Best Actress in 1969 and her career went to future hits such as PRIVATE BENJAMIN and FIRST WIVES CLUB. Although the other stars of LAUGH-IN did well on television (Henry Gibson has a repeat role as a judge at BOSTON LEGAL), only Goldie's career was a film. <br /> <br /> LAUGH-Goldie's personality shows naivety that would be embarrassing. Sometimes he understood it and laughed loudly to cover, but sometimes he just couldn't see his mistake (for example: Goldie was introduced to the 1950s show exhibition by Gary Moore and said, "Goldie, this is Mr. Gary Moore." He shakes his hand and says (a lot of his confusion): "I've always wanted to meet Mr. John Gary Moore!"). But like Toni Simmons, it's completely different. He is desperately in love with dr. Julian Winston (Walter Matthau), a successful dentist who can never marry her. Julian told her that her husband (with whom she had two sons and a daughter) would never give her a divorce. So Toni tries to commit suicide in the oven at the beginning of the film. But she is saved by her neighbor, Igor Sullivan (Rick Lenz), a fighting dramatist who breaks into his apartment and turns off the gas. <br /> <br /> Toni has left to live, but has sent Julian to suicide. Igor tries to ignore the comment, but Julian's administrator / sister / assistant, Stephanie Dickinson (Ingrid Bergman) does not stop Julian's schedule to give her a phone when Igor calls. Instead, Julian finds a letter and races at Toni's apartment to find her alive. If Igor supports his story of trying to kill himself, Julian understands the depth of his love and decides that he must marry such a woman. Unfortunately, Toni has swallowed Julia's lies and believes in his wife and children. You see, Julian does not have a woman and children. Because Toni firmly believes that he can't marry a man who would lie to him, Julian is stuck in a weakened tree. <br /> <br /> Julian comes to solve this when she pretends to be Mrs. Stephanie. Winston. At first, Stephanie opposes it, but on her first free Saturday she stands against Toni at the Toni record shop. They speak, and Toni observes all the subtle strengths of Stephanie's character and personality (and since Stephanie has two siblings with her, Toni thinks they are Julian's children). Toni tells Julian they have to see who the man whom Stephanie is supposed to marry is. So the lie starts running for Julian, Stephanie and Toni. Soon, Stephanie will be released as a lover of Julian's friend and freelance patient Harvey Greenfield (Jack Weston). Greenfield is so stupid (Stephanie complains) that Toni feels he is not worthy of Stephanie. <br /> <br /> And so, if one complication (most caused by well intentioned, misinformed by Toni) follows the second until the conclusion. The script is full of first-class situations and one-liner (example: Julian pays Stephanie for her marriage, buys two record albums from Toni's shop. She has given a nose to Tony for Tony, but she decides to send it to Stephanie with a Julian card, Stephanie is very pleased to get a mink, but she does not say the nature of the gift she received - when she thanked Matthau greatly, she says she wants Horowitz - which means Vladomir Horowitz. Stephanie thinks Horowitz is a career name!). <br /> <br /> Bergman must have filming, as several scenes show the reputation of being a trademark of his later films in the 1940s. But it was similar to his 1958 film comedy that hit INDISCREET. There Cary Grant lied to make sure the couple focused on the romance of these things without thinking of marriage. When Granti's lie comes to Bergman, he decides his lie to convince Grant that he's making a cuckold. Here, instead of being a passive mistress who believes Matthau tells the truth, Bergman gently tries to get Matthau's confusing little white lies, only to find one leads another to complicate everyone's life. Bergman is seen as a nice woman who becomes part of the problem, despite trying to be part of the solution. <br /> <br /> All managers, especially Bergman, will first complete their business thoroughly, but will gradually re-use sexuality. Matthau is delighted at how useful a false man is in an obstacle that cannot simply be discarded. A supportive majority, especially Weston, like mooking and sexual slender Harvey, and Vito Scott as the US ambassador who is actually for Bergman. It was a really good way to move forward with a smart comedy and a Goldie Hawn movie career.
