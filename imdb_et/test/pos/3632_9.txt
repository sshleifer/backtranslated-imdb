A very touching film, a big surprise coming from Brazil, a country that usually exports functions from social issues, violence, sex ... Magical realism is a very difficult task and I believe João Falcão has done it perfectly. It looks like he's not really going to make a realistic movie. While many people think that the film has been adapted to the game, he said in his interviews that he actually based the film on the book. Another mistake is to think that Falcão has been influenced by the series "Hoje é Dia De Maria". The TV series produced by Globo were made after the movie, but were filmed before ... Unfortunately, it was a negative point. It looks like he didn't try to understand Falco's idea. The story is exciting and universal, even though it takes place in a small town in Brazil. This can happen anywhere in the world. Great movie, I strongly recommend.
