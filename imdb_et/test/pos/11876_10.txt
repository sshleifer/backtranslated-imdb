Bringing Philip Larkin to life in a way that is worthy of the greatest performances of all time, not just those that are measured by popularity. This shows that Larkins life is the greatest unrecognized poet of his era - just as he would have liked it, as was his contempt for miners and medallions. It dramatically exerts the beauty of the intense sadness of Philips' observations on our relationships with our own mortality and puts it in such a way that it seems that even great philosophers have disappeared. for everyone interested in our relationship to life, love, and death, it is imperative.
