I went to watch this movie with low expectations, because it was the only one that fit my schedule. And amazingly I found it truly original. I've commented on other Colombian films before, and I agree that Colombian films tend to have similar schemes and I always try to refer to average vulgar people, especially trying to make fun of the constant flurry. But to be honest, the language used in this film is not very exaggerated. Unfortunately, it is these people who are talking. Style and temple are brilliant and can be extrapolated to any country in the world. The method was great and the script is one of the best that Colombia's soil has ever produced. I think someone from all over the world can become a good hour and a half entertainment with a beautifully well-managed bluffing black humor comedy. It reminded me of films such as eavesdropping and others. I highly recommend this, and I hope that more people can watch it because Colombian films have started to focus internationally since last year.
