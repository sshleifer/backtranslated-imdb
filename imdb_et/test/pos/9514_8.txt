Last year, in Japanese magazine Japanese SINKS, I was trying to advertise and wondering what the hell was like until I saw the movie trailer. Then I remembered that I saw a translation of the Sakyo Komatsu novel in English a few years ago. I got it and it was pretty good but also cool. It is enough for the reader to scare the news of the earthquakes in Japan. <br /> <br /> Now I have read the book and seen this 2006 film release (first film released in 1973). And you know what? I thought the film was pretty good, even if there are big changes to the film (but it's understandable). The story is simple - a big tectonic shift causes Japan to sink in one year. Massive earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis are attacking the country in such a way that embarrassing efforts are made to evacuate as many people as possible. One scientist has a plan that can stop the country from sinking and rescuing land, but can it be implemented on time? I saw Japan in Otakon in 2007, and although there were a few problems - it takes a bit too long and a couple of character moments was a bit too gentle - but I was blown. The whole concept of the sinking sea was made terribly real and the effects were some of the best I've ever seen competing with what Hollywood has done. The film does not have any favorites with major characters, some do not make this closing credit. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I'm surprised at some negative comments about this movie. I think the difference in opinions. Personally, I enjoyed it. And I've read the original book.
