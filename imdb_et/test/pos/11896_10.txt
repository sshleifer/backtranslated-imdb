I love the movies that lead you. A film that leaves you feeling weak when over it and such a film is rare. <br /> <br /> Damian is so talented and versatile in so many different drawings and characters. This movie has a peak in front of it. For such a low budget, the main stream is. Why is it that a lot of talent and charisma (not to mention sexual complaint beyond most other participants) can do so little money to work ????? These actors really believe in their script and their raw talent as director, writer and actor. I am so pleased to know that such a modern genius is out there, letting the art pass and lead him to the audience. Damian I've heard about you from so many different circles and don't let the jealous people of this world come to you. Martin gets it, Fellini got it and you always get it. The fire and passion in you is what we love to see on the screen. Thank you for being different and having the courage to write like you. You're one particular director, don't listen to empty ships.
