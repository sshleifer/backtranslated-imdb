This is not far from the trash that Bollywood usually does, but it is very good. <br /> <br /> The title song is one of Bollywood's best and is strange. This is one of the films (with Baazigar - you must see a Bollywood movie) that made Shah Rukh Khan and you have to review it. <br /> <br /> Other reviews will tell the story - this is a pretty basic idea - ShaRukh will surely stand out and one of his final expositions at the end gave me the extra star of this movie. <br /> <br /> It's quite fun, but it's definitely worth checking out if you're new to Bollywood! 8/10
