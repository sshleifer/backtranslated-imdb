To answer the question of the previous reviewer who asked the name of the US official named "Lumumba", the name of the badge is "Mr. Carlucci." Frank Carlucci has announced that he was second secretary at the US Secretariat in Congo at that time. He was then appointed as US Ambassador to Portugal, Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Minister of Defense and is now Chairman of the Carlyle Group. It is hardly surprising that Carlucci's biography on his www.carlylegroup.com website does not support his service in the Belgian Congo. If his name was deliberately censored from the Lumumba HBO version, it could have been avoided that HBO would be sued in US courts. However, Carlucci's name is clearly mentioned in the theater "Lumumba", which I recently saw. In case I think he denies any involvement in the murder of Lumumba. Others have commented that the film "Lumumba" treats the parties involved: Lumumba supporters, other Congolese, even Belgians. I think the somewhat more embarrassing view of the BBC documentary "Who Killed Lumumba?" Is based on the book "The Lumumba Assassination" by Belgian historian Ludo de Witte. When these films are carefully studied, they show that the fate of Lumumba and Congo's history is not just a black and white issue. Only Lumumba's murderers believe it.
