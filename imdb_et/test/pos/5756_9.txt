Okay, this may not be the most complicated movie you'll ever see. In fact, this is not a bit of "complexity" *. It's gentle, young, insecure, idiotic ... And totally fun. Richie and Eddie basically run the worst hotel in the UK. Cue some ridiculous hints with the guests when they beat each other, try to get the money from the only resident who is little enough to stay, all the night drinking with the neighbors next to the power station ... And fall with the desire of a beautiful actor to stay Avoid the press. Try to be a fan of Riki and Ade and their work. If you're not ... Don't get a movie. Easy so. <br /> <br /> * I'm not thick, it's the word from another Rik's fab yacht in the movie world ^ _ ^
