The funny team that brought you "CNNNN" and "The Chaser Decides" has returned to ABC with their new series "The Chaser War on Everything". The film, which has been filmed in front of a live audience, makes Chaser's team again what it does with the best political figures, international celebrities and medics. <br /> <br /> Satire is simply invaluable and nothing is sacred. In recent weeks, the Chaser team has traveled beside the queen (during a visit to Australia) to try to reject John Howard and Kim Beazley (Aust. Opposition Leader) is threatening to kneel. <br /> <br /> A very funny segment is "Mr. Ten Questions", which shows an overly enthusiastic reporter approaching celebrities (recently Charlize Theron and The Backstreet Boys) and asks them ten questions like "what is your optimal rice level ? " For this record, Theron ignored him and walked away, and one of the Backstreet Boys was angry and "refused to honor this response." <br /> <br /> The segment that had recently been in my seam was when one team decided to become a "statue busker" to raise extra money. When he realized how hopeless he was, he put a real shape in his place. PERFECT SCAM! He got thirty dollars in thirty minutes! <br /> <br /> Australian society has a great satire. Two thumbs up! <br /> <br /> (By the way, the example is not shown three weeks after Easter, because "although the team is all atheists, they are also hypocrites.")
