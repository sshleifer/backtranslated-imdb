Guiliano Montaldo Tempo Di Uccidere (time to add up) is a bit of a strange film, but it's good in its own way. <br /> <br /> I'm not worried about the plot summary. Most of what I read gives the wrong impression and makes me believe that most of the people who wrote them didn't really understand the movie. And you need to understand it to some level, even if you can't describe what it really is. This movie is a strange way "From time to time in America" ​​- only shorter. <br /> <br /> Many Hollywood stars (whatever it means ...) have played in lesser-known Italian products. It is known that many actors, who have risen in their main or slow, are doing it. Cage was not yet a real star when it was made. I'm not his fan. In some roles, he is very good (raising Arizona, picking the dead) and weak when he plays the hero. I don't really know what to think about it, but it does not reflect the typical character of the hero. This movie could have been done without him, but the fact that he celebrated is the only reason it ever did to DVD. <br /> <br /> Support cast is good. None of them see fake and they act as they really are. Strong support. <br /> <br /> I have seen 3 movies by Montaldo (Marco Polo, Sacco & Vanzetti and this one) and I think he is one of the biggest leaders of that time. Unfortunately, no one knows her. This film was his long (19-year break). I think this movie may have failed in the office, but how it was done, I think for Montaldo it was a personal project he really liked. <br /> <br /> Production is great. This is always enough. Dusty army camps, claustophobic cities and a wonderful landscape play a big role. It's all very real. In some scenes you can almost feel the heat. The sound itself is nothing special, but Ennio Morricone's music is very good. This is not a piece you hinted at when you shower, but it certainly works. <br /> <br /> So this movie looks, sounds and sounds just right. This is not the lesson learned with the Golden Plate, but it can be the biggest difference between Hollywood and Euro Cinema. It may seem strange to give him 8 and not to recommend it to people, but that's me. If you are looking for action; Avoid it! If you are looking for a well-made Apocalypse at a different time and setting, but a bit like a "mental state" (sorry if it sounds, but I don't know what else to call it), you might just enjoy it.
