1891: Stalwart, Morally Vertical Military Doctor Lieutenant Claude de Ross (solid Claudio Cassinelli) and several other survivors of shipwreck on the shore on a remote tropical island led by the ruthless and sadistic Edmund Rackham with an iron fist (perfectly played tastefully slippery) Richard Johnson) who lives on the island with a weak Amanda Martin (a blissful jazzy play by Barbara Bach) and her relaxed rogue biologist, Professor Ernest Martin (Joseph Cotten's wonderfully darkened image). Moreover, de Ross discovers that Professor Martin has control over the dangerous races that Rackham uses as slave labor. Director / co-author Sergio Martino associates a lively and absorbing story with a steady pace, delivers a delicious and lush tropical environment, works professionally to create and maintain a spooky and mysterious atmosphere in the third horror; with significant robbery. Although the central assumption is obviously inspired by "Dr. Moreau Island", the story is still a lot of freshness and intrigue, because Martino's artistic melding of such diverse elements as the voodoo, the lost underwater city of Atlantis, the tormenting mondo destructo climatic volcanic eruption, buried treasure, careless genetic experiments and even some The exciting coarse fists between de Ross and Rackham are an exciting conclusion to a totally dynamic, imaginative and often extremely fun whole. Strong cast sound corresponds to another important advantage: Cassinelli makes a pleasant hero, Johnson's essay in his succulent cable splint with aplomb, Bach rates as a pretty pulling girl, and moreover, the pure supportive contribution of Beryl Cunningham as the sinister voodoo priest Shakira, Franco Iavarone as superstitious Jose and Roberto Posse as a surprising fraudster Peter. Giancarlo Fernando's proud, widescreen cinematography offers a wealth of striking visuals, while Luciano Michelin's tormenting tribe hits the funky spot. Amphibious humanoid fishermen are also gnarly-looking. Very fun flick.
