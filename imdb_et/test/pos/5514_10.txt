Strangeland seems to have love / hate with many viewers. I personally loved the movie and all that. <br /> <br /> Working in certain places may be better, but filming adds to the atmosphere where the actor can't. In some areas, dialogue is a bit creepy and dramatic, but in fact, what do you expect in the late 90s? All in all, Dee did amazing work in writing, which I believe is one of the most frightening thrillers I've ever seen. He plays against the fears of many age groups - adults, parents and children. Every parent fears that their children will participate in too many chat rooms and meet strangers on the Internet. And it happens in * real world. And every child and adult fear is robbed and tortured against their will; it also happens in the real world. What makes this movie a sensitive subject for many. <br /> <br /> My only warning is, if you know * you are sensitive to things like strong violence, visible torture and gore, then you * do not want to see this movie. If you're not sure if this movie attracts you, read as many comments as you can, ask people you know who have seen this movie, and be ready to turn off the disturbed movie anytime.
