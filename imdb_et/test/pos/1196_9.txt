I watched it because my friend said we could try it when my dad asked if we would look at it. I didn't want it because it was such an old movie, how would it be good? I finally looked at this friend and father. my friend and i loved the movie. the songs are great, the actors were cool and we were crazy about it. I think it shows, though it's a father's time that doesn't mean it can't be a good movie. I bought the movie as long as I saw it on television, put it a lot and sang with the songs. I even watched it with my classmates on my birthday. this is a nice, good and sometimes funny movie. <br /> <br /> If you don't try, you can't say it's bad. even if you think no, i'm not going to watch a movie about my father's time. Try the first part of the movie that you can always pause if you don't like it. i really recommend it, it's great !!
