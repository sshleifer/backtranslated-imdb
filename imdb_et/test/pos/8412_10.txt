I didn't read the book "Scarlett" and when I looked at this mini-series, I enjoyed it very much and thought it didn't need to be compared to GWTW. The story may be different from the book, but who takes care of this movie. Even in credits based on the book, it is not a book. The film is obviously appreciated by the fact that other people write, but cannot even write the main characters correctly. Joanne Whalley and Timothy Dalton were great. They took the characters and gave them a touch. Now that other people are going, they will compare them to Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable. Of course, they did fantastic things, but the leaders of this film are completely different people who have their own methods of action and should not be pressured by what people say. If you wanted certain participants to do well, you should have guided the film, I'm sure other participants wouldn't do both these and those chemistry and intelligence. Supporting pain seemed to be the size of the eye, and Jean Smart steals scenes that are his comedy genius. <br /> <br /> The movie locations were very beautiful, and it was just great to see Scarlett all the movie sites that cause problems and other things. The scene where Scarlett speaks to his father's grave was also very dramatic, and I was thinking that there were two great actors who brought Scarlett O'Hara to life. Not only Vivian Leigh, but also Joanne Whalley. <br /> <br /> The film and the book may differ, but you must not leave it to the heart that it is one of the best films ever made, otherwise you think it should be like the Wind and I don't like this movie. But this is a classic classification, which is unlike GWTW's movie. Also remember that "Tomorrow is another day" ...
