In this bid, you only have to look at the current Westminster Kennel Club's annual offer to see the parallels. Amazingly funny and hitting the true nature of the competition. One can only imagine the intelligence of the producers and the amazing ability of the performers. I would also have called this film for the Globe Award and I feel it is one of the most fun I've ever seen.
