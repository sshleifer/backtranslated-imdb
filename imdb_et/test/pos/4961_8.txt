Being D.B. Sweeney fan, I've been researching this movie for some time. I recently rented a video and found it very enjoyable. It had some very fun scenes. The insecure life of some of the characters was amazing, but I think the film also showed that it is possible to keep your life on track or get it back on track if it is off track.
