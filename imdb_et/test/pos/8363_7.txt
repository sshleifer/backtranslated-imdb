Kid Power Hour presented two segments: Hero High and Shazam. Let's start with the hero of the high. <br /> <br /> Hero High was meant to be the new Archies comic, featuring their superhero identities: Pureheart the Powerful (Archie), Captain Hero (Jughead), Superteen (Betty) and Evilheart (Reggie). But Filmation was not entitled to do so, so they changed a little and came out with it. Here's the division of characters: Captain California (Archie), Glorious Gal (Betty), Weatherman (Jughead), Dirty Trixie (Veronica), Rex Ruthless (Reggie), Samson (Mr weatherbee) and Miss Grimm (Miss Grundy). Sketches of live activities and cartoon adventures also participated in the exhibition. Humor was a typical flat movie jokes, but at least it was fun. It was fun enough for kids, though not quite with the previous standards. <br /> <br /> The second segment was Shasam! All the major rogues were present, as well as the entire Marvel family (including Freckles Marvel in at least one episode). Uncle Dudley had the correct voice and shady character of the toilet fields and his "Shazambago". Burr Middleton, a 70's TV veteran, like Fish, expressed great red cheese, while Alan Oppenheimer (Rudy Wells in a $ 6 million episode and Skeletor's voice in a good man) drew Dr. Sivana. > <br /> Marvels had always made sense for them, so little change was needed for these adventures to meet Broadcast Standards and Practices requirements (censors). As such, the stories were very imaginative and inventive. Among the rogues that appeared were: Dr. Sivana, Black Adam, Mr. Atom, Mr. Mind, Aunt Minerva, Ibac and Crocodile Beings. Mr. Tawky Tawny also made his debut on the screen. <br /> <br /> Hero High is released from BCI, but Shazam! is still uncertain as well as live show. Hopefully the proposed movie will get rid of the DVD. It's worth a DVD treatment.
