This is one of those movies that, for some reason, just clicked with me. All this is right. Eric Roberts laconic, nice researcher, narration of his voice, twist line, Dan Hedaya and Denis Lipscomb gave a good role, settings, artist's studio paintings, end credit order, and wonderfully strange music about the film. If I have any doubts, this is Beverly D'Angelo as femme fatale, but she plays her latest scenes beautifully. I think director Matthew Chapman tried to feel a kind of "Chinatown". It didn't work. But when the mystery of murder is his pearl.
