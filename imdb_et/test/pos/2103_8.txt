With the revival of ADV Films, I have had the opportunity to watch the "The Giant Majin" for the first time, without the deep cuts and unpleasant words of Horror Chiller Theaters late in the evening. Guess? This is a pretty fucking good movie! <br /> <br /> Sets are authentic, acting weakly and credibly, and the giant Majin is harsh, powerful and impossible. I loved fine touches of fantasy (fascinated wood, luck of happiness, etc.) and the goddess is a little less than "good". <br /> <br /> This movie comes up for remake in the century!
