Carole and Niles Nelson, a man's and wife's medical team, are making a modest career, but Niles has a gambling problem. His happiness changes when he (unknowingly) saves the life of a gangster from Joe Gurney's mobile and gets a big bonus from the gangleader. Loving a change in his fortune (and trying a new apartment), Niles continues to get paid for other injured members. Unfortunately, his shady transactions appear in a police attack that hangs over his wife's career. <br /> <br /> This is where the plot focuses, as Carole Nelson must have her license suspended before her career. That means more or less justice. <br /> <br /> This is not an image of a hard-wearing gangster, but a plot that could have been in a nice show like MATLOCK or MURDER SHE WROTE. There are some tensions, but the mood is kept by the foolish gangster, who represents himself as "Napoleon of Crime" in a light Bogart-in-cheek performance. His other gang members work more than hoods. And there is a nice cute dialogue between Bogart and Francis, especially when she heals her injuries in hiding. Of course, as in all gangsters, there is also a big shootout end but a humorous twist. This is a good short film that shows that Bogart got up.
