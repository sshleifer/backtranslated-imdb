(Includes spoiler) <br /> <br /> Russia's 13th century. The opening technique shows the relics of the last invasion: molding forms, human skulls and horse skeleton. Prince Alexander Nevsky (Nikolai Cherkasov) shared the Swedish army and impressed the Mongol ruler so that he wanted to pass him to the rank of captain. But Nevsky replies, "Surge in your own country, but don't miss it." He intends to catch fish, build ships and trade. But he warns of a more dangerous enemy: Closer, thoughtless, and the chance to buy yourself out: Germany. Their purpose is Novgorod. They have already arrived in Pskov: mothers and daughters suffer from their parents and sons. The frightening occupation forces share the lotus. Rich merchants want to buy their freedom (always a place for some anti-capitalist pages), but "ordinary people" are ready to fight. They want Alexander to be their leader. Pskov is burned to the ground. Teutonic knights feel invincible and only have a ridiculous smile for Russian women who feel helplessly about how their fathers and sons are polished. Babies are thrown into the fire while the high dignity of the church is seen and left empty. In Novgorod: Olga Danilovna has two admirers: rich and loosely Gavrilo and long and cheerful Vasili. He promises to marry the most powerful. Vasily calls Aleksander Nevski in Pereyalav. The Prince decides not to wait for an attack, but at once. Even women put a chain on the armor ... the invaders want to feed the "Russian bear", but the Nevsky parish is a test: Lake Peipsi is his war zone: His men know the territory, but the heavier, relatives break through the Ice ... <br /> <br / > Open your eyes and see the most impressive battle scenes that have ever been filmed. It is not only many of the extras (who were, in my opinion, pushed into this patriotic exercise), but the masterly leadership of Eisenstein among so many people: it displaces parts such as pieces on chessboard, and almost every shot resembles Rembrandt or Rubens (including horses with fantasy equipment) . In winter, Russia itself seems scary, but Eisenstein's visual imagination is hors concours. The heaps of rooms are dropped into cosmic light on an endless horizon. At night, Olga and other women are looking for torches for survivors. A dedicated apple is sitting on his captain's body, while the crow is waiting for the right moment for the eye to choose. Eisenstein's direction and Prokofiev's score make ALEXANDER NEVSKY "Rolls Royce" among propaganda films. Nevsky is of course the alter ego of Stalin and the Russians are high, beautiful, heroic and have the perfect hairstyle. Germans are bearded savages and see members of Ku-Klux-Klan. An actor who plays Vasili, for the first time gives one or four characters: first, amazing, heroic, youthful lover and comic relief. Cherkasov's main task is to look heroic. Finally, Nevsky-Stalin shows his generosity: He forgives "little soldiers" and wears soap knights. Only the bearded killer and the fraudulent clergy are turned to the mobile. He will not forget the last warning: who comes through the sword will die through the sword ... He kept his promise. 10/10
