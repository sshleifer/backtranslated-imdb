"New York Lights" originally began with the experimental two reel Vitaphone short, which finally snowed down into the first speaker film. Helene Costelle was said to be one of the most beautiful actors in Hollywood and her sister (in my opinion, true beauty) Dolores Costello, who seemed to have had all the breaks. Bad Helene is the best known in this pretty tough movie that bought a revolution for Hollywood !! <br /> <br /> Two main players in Main Street will convince a couple of small town hairdressers to try their luck on Broadway. Hairdressers Eddie (Cullen Landis) and Gene (Eugene Palette) do not understand that their hairdressing salon will soon be an illegal intrusion. Soon they will understand it and regret the day they left their small town. The only thing they keep is the loan that Eddie's mother gave them and desperately want to pay back. Eddie realizes again with Kitty Lewis (Helene Costello), a girl in her hometown who has been good for Broadway. Kitty is worried that "Hawk" Miller (Wheeler Oakman), who is always hanging around her, but Eddie, innocently, thinks she is exaggerated because "Hawk" is already a girlfriend of Molly (Gladys Brockwell), but she gives give him a little pistol to scare unwanted admirers. "Hawk", who has killed a police officer and has "Feds", closes Eddie. Meanwhile, Molly is quite fed up with her "Hawks" treatment and after a showdown where she says she is after a chicken, not an old chicken, where the stage is set - Murder !!! <br /> <br /> The fact is that it is not terribly terrible, except for gangsters and showgirls who speak their best voices and which were still in films in the 1930s. Gladys Brockwell (as a little melodramatic) and Eugene Palette (quite natural) were okay and were the most experienced actors. John and Ethel Barrymore were not visible - Cullen Landis and Helene Costello soon returned to the vagueness they had come from. I also didn't notice a lot of "hidden mike" - where people had to group different objects, ie the phone or sitting on the couch before they could chat. People who saw it in the cinema began to think that all the police were talking in this apartment monotone, as this trend continued in many early talks, ie "Little Caesar" (1930). In any case, they were probably intrigued by the novelty of a completely new talkie - some song and dance films in 1928. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
