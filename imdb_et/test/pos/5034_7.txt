This is another one of John Travolta's films "come back" and when he continues with such symbols and movies as he does, he will come back. <br /> <br /> It's so cute ... sick if you're not romance in comedy. If it is, it is one of the innovative RomCom. Every performance (including the Skippy dog) was beautiful, without much more than the dogmas found in "Dogmas". (Though the movies are going, I loved Dogma!) <br /> <br /> Travolta's performance is almost as tough as the previews give you confidence. He is an angel, and if you consider yourself to read well, you realize that the angels were far from perfect. Because of this movie, you won't offend. Even those who are too sensitive to such things should not insult this work, because Nora went a long way to make sure it was as abrasive as possible. <br /> <br /> I love it and love it more every time I watch it. It is beautiful and sweet, appealing and pleasant. <br /> <br /> It's 7.3 / 10 ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
