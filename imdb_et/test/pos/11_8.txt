I was waiting for The Guardian, but when I walked into the theater, I wasn't in that mood at that time. It's like olives - I like it, but I have to have the right entertainment to enjoy it thoroughly. <br /> <br /> I'm not really sure what my mind is suppressing. Trailers seemed good, but the water theme gave me a bad setback for the latest Kevin Costner film on Waterworld. In addition, despite the promise made by Ashton Kutcher in The Butterfly Effect, I am still not fully sold to him. Something like that man just irritates me. It is probably related to his symbolic qualities. <br /> <br /> Cursed for about two minutes, my fears disappear and my heasitancies slip. The film throws us right into the midst of intense rescue work and was more complicated than Kenny Rogers' orange facial lift. My troubles are briefly due to Kutcher's first appearance because he made too much effort to paint him ridiculously cool and rebellious. Sunglasses, a hard boy toothpick in his mouth and a sport that makes George Clooney proud of? Yes, we get it. I was completely ready to hate. <br /> <br /> But then he had to go and give a fairly strong result and forced me to soften. <br /> <br /> Catch you, monkey man! The Guardian is a tense film that mixes exciting rescue work, drama, humor and strong action, and I dare say that most audiences enjoy. You can imprison your clich√©s, predictability, and rare moments of rare burned sapphires, but none of them take away entertainment. <br /> <br /> I had a bad feeling that the pace slows down by costing too much for young boys, but on the contrary, training can be the most interesting aspect of the film. Beach Guard Rescue Swimmers are heroes whose stories have never been shown on the big screen, so I know the inner picture of what they are going through and how hard it is to make it very informative and a great way to introduce it to the viewer. -specified group. <br /> <br /> Do you have to be a rescue worker? Think about it - you have to go to dangerous missions in cold, dark, rough water, and then you have to fight for disorientation, exhaustion, hypothermia and lack of oxygen, trying to help you stranded, panicked people who depend on you for their survival. And if all that is not bad enough can sometimes save everyone, so you need to make a tough decision about who lives and who dies. <br /> <br /> A man who wants all responsibility? Not me! I had no idea what these men really liked, and who would have thought that I was grateful for the education of Ashton Kutcher / Kevin Costner? <br /> <br /> The Guardian not only does a great job of honoring this rare hero breed, but it is also lucky to make good payment services. <br /> <br /> GIST <br /> <br /> The movements that want an internal gaze look at what the Guardian would like to start with a bold rescue mission in the middle of the ocean. I saw it for free, but if I had paid, I would have felt that it was worth my money.
