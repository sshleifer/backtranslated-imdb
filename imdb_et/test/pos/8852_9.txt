John Carpenter's superbly stopping flick is a great combination of Sci-Fi and horror that takes on the classic body-swap theme and takes it to the extreme. The Howard Hawks' remake is the 1951 original, Carpenter keeps the Cold War theme behind paranoia and trust in alien takeover and impending death and in the isolation of the Antarctic region. Carpenter's direction is always great, as his camera slides through the world of individuals whose inhabited environment has been violated by the original fear of taking over the body. But here and much like David Cronenberg's work, Carpenter does not have to keep an incident, because through some fantastic special effects we are witnessing some surreal times. But he never loses the story with the human side, because in all the shocking events we are facing, we have the confidence and suspicion. <br /> <br /> 9/10
