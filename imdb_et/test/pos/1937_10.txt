This is the forgotten classic of the film, and Harmony Karin lent it a ton of "Gummo". Gummo is good, River's Edge is so, better. It's no secret that Keanu Reeves is not the best actor who walked on earth. No, in fact he's a terrible actor. But he was born for some roles: Ted Preston, Esquire Bill and Ted, and his role in this film. She is perfect as a kind of benevolent, but very apathetic and confused teenager. Then there is Crispin Glover. I think his performance in this movie is his best career. He's phenomenal, like drug outbreaks. Then there is Dennis Hopper, who is also perfect. This movie is just amazing and if you haven't seen it, run out and watch it today. Its great. One of the best contemporary American images I've seen.
