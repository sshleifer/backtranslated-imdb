Perhaps once in a generation it's a perfect movie. For me, "Children of the Railway" is this film - a timeless classic that was directed and performed most beautifully. It represents everything that is useful to mankind and surprises the conquest of love and faith over cruel injustice. Each performance is a pearl, although Bobbie stands out, and like Judy Garland like Dorothy in front of her, makes Jenny Agutter impossible when someone else imagines her role. <br /> <br /> The world is better than this movie, and today's kids would be much better at watching it. <br /> <br /> Of course, like many of my generation's young men, I fell hopelessly in love with Jenny Agutter and her attitude was as strong as I had a few days ago to meet her, was still an amazing smile and a voice like a drip honey to send me to my knees when they first made all those years ago!
