Nurse Betty (2000) makes a well-known indie filmmaker Neil LaBute (in the company of men and friends) with a breakthrough with a big budget (Betty's $ 24 million, unlike the company's peaceful $ 25,000). and yet it is true to its roots. Although his production now consists of A-list Hollywood names (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, and stand-up comedian Chris Rock), his material remains as odd and peculiar as his first two qualities, proving that he may be the next big thing. Nurse Betty is one of the darkest comedies advertised by the mainstream audience over the years, and given her moderate box and critical success, video players may not be as foolish or brainwashed as we were. The story follows (both figuratively and literally) a na√Øve speaker (Zellweger) who is in love with a beautiful soap star (as good as it gets from Greg Kinnear), but is trapped in a love with a married sloppy car dealer (Aaron Eckhart, who made his big screen debut in the company ). When two men (Freeman and Rock) murder his wife, he is sent to shock and pleases Hollywood with his affection - not knowing he is only an actor. When Freeman and Rock discover that the car he took contains 10 kilos of cocaine, they also hit the road and resentment. Fans of previous work by LaBute may find it difficult to understand how it could be the same man who led the People Company - a tragic comedy about two cruel sexist pigs who play practical jokes with deaf associates - but if you think about it, the community is quite clear: not a vulnerable woman aware that she has been ruthlessly exploited. In Bett, a vulnerable housewife is unaware that the man behind him thinks his true adoration is something other than a joke. Some may start wondering if LaBute is really funny - given that his recurring theme includes the fall of innocent women. But personally I think he comes to the protection of a fair sex and deals with much more harshly abusers than his abused. One of the many charms of this film is that absurdity is full: most of the directors leave the scenario like this, treating the story with two hitmen who are behind the dream. But LaBute knows better and is one of the hitmen (Freeman) also Betty for obsessively. It was an interesting role for Freeman because it allowed him to play his own brand of "it's-on-the-last time" (see Unforgiven, Se7en, and the 1998 Stinker Hard Rain); supportive casting also includes the famous Weirdo Crispin Glover (Back to the Future), Allison Janney and "Mad About You's Kathleen Wilhoite." The script, written for the first time by John C. Richards and James Flamberg, is surprisingly surprising (frankly: have you ever seen comedy - or WHAT is a movie where a person is crushed in his dining room?). You can argue that the end is a little too perfect, but it is not really worth it for a movie to have a trivial complaint very good. If a nurse, Betty, is a sign of what LaBute saves for us next, you can bet that I'll pick up what she decides to follow. <br /> <br /> Rating: A-
