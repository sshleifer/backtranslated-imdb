I've been torn because of this exhibition. Although MOST most of all pointed to HILARIOUS, I found that other parts are stupid and just a shock for shocks. Some of the caricatures on the wall parody are excellent, because indeed there are many scenes with children. But I don't think it's wise for little children to say rude things. It's not that I think "oh poor kids, they're being used" - it's just that it's not really smart! This is something that anyone could do, making it as easy and meaningless as making a paper airplane. In order to better show it, they should stay in the natural responses of children, which I think may be more fun than a timed script. <br /> <br /> The most wonderful part of Wonder Showzen is Clarence, the blue doll who admires streets talking and annoying strangers. It's really funny and it's mostly improvised. Looking at the importance of the patience of a long scene, I find it an extremely patient person who was extremely patient. <br /> <br /> You should still watch this show because it's all very funny, even if it's sometimes stupid.
