One of the most unexpected, most astonishing and terrible horror films that come out of the 70's, "Tourist Trap" even under an open, freely settling, conventionally attacking "something goes" standard, which is real strange. However, this is a very strange picture of the picture - a masterfully installed unpleasant atmosphere that is thoughtfully superfluous supernatural, which gets so powerfully ghastly in the get-go and becomes more and more intimidating and scary as the film progresses. Straight, sweet moments of dreamy elegance, ending bitterly ironically, crushing nihilistic wet, which is a haunting ultimate image that is hard to shake - it makes it a unique and exceptionally irritating experience. <br /> <br /> Five teenagers who drive in the desert of California will lose hopelessly. They stumble over the "lost oasis of Slausen", a poor, ruthless roadside dive that is part of a gas station, a three-part broken wax museum and all the parts that rob and predict. A lonely, seemingly friendly and harmless owner, Slausen (a hammy brio infected by Chuck Conners) has proven to be a psychological deadly killer. Slausen brings a selection of dummy-like dummies to a human person, and lives one by one so that he can add them to his ever-growing collection of victims. <br /> <br /> Director David ("Puppermaster") "Arrival") Schmoeller captures the latest tension of the ounce he can exert from a pleasantly vague and open scenario. He wrote with J. Larry Carroll. (The stubborn refusal of this script to give some rational excuses to all the strangers that appear in the whole movie, often criticized as one of the main weaknesses of the film, is actually the main strength of the film, giving the picture scary, everything and everything - Old Case, the general logic-cunning quality of a real nightmare Pino Donaggio is a beautifully cool, undervalued score, Nicholas von Sternberg's covert cinematography, and Robert A. Burns's dirty, narrow production design immensely add to the movie's deeply undisturbed mood. An excellent performance is another remarkable plus, with a very generous Jocelyn Jones (Ellie-Jo Turner's "The Great Texas Dynamite Chase"), which is especially good and friendly as the most enduring and sympathetic of endangered teenagers. Even Tanya Robert's fares are also unhappy with a knife that is distributed with his head. Happy and unusual "Tourist Trap" is worth visiting.
