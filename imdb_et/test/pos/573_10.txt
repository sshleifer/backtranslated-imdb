I absolutely adored this movie. For me, the best reason is to see the sharp contrast between legal dramas like "Boston Legal" or "Ally McBeal" or even "LA Law". It's a reality. The law is not BS, won some closure through an argument or some ridiculous protection that you pull out, such as "Chewbacca's defense" in South Park. "GOOD lawyers work - not a shyster stereotype that uses all of its skills to make it right. It does more to restore your faith in humanity than any Frank Capra movie or KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. And most importantly, I cried. During the movie, at the end of the featurette at the end of the DVD, it's amazing. Wonderful movie; wonderfully done. Thanks to God, the filmmakers did.
