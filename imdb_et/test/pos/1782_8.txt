This is an episode that is probably the most closely associated with his partner law, "You must not kill" because it directly brings out the controversial question: "Why do we kill people who kill people to show that killing is wrong?" This topic is presented in two parts in an episode: before killing, when the film shows a dachotomy between an idealistic and a future lawyer and a thug in the street, that his life is just what he is supposed to be, followed by a period after trial and before execution, if both suffer their they are responsible and therefore share. <br /> <br /> One of the great things about how these episodes work is as small as the story is fully developed, so we understand both the characters and the history we can only spend a little less than an hour. For all of his criminal intentions and mockery, the killer is still very sympathetic, with the most important part of his actions in the history of casual death. The way to kill her is to control death if she really wants to destroy her. The lawyer's idealistic naivety, who does not want to die in a world where he cannot manage it, also shows. Their meeting is really important; they both have to give it, but not to distribute it. <br /> <br /> If you ignore it, it will be interesting to see how much this episode affects Rouge viewing, Kieslowski's later trilogy of Trois Colors. One of Kieslowski's greatest effects seems to be the idea of ​​justice, and whereas Decalogue is a meditation that represents divine justice, it seems almost self-conscious. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
