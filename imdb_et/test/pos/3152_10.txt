I have a little hobby to find there really cool pictures that are pretty much unknown - and then let people know them. This is on my list to get this word this summer. This indie film (and I really mean indie - not Miramax, Fox Searchlight indie) can be neglected in the light cellulose maze, but if you want something completely different - you have to check it out. Basically I thought it was great. I should have known about the cover, the front and the back of the DVD that it was something completely different, but they all say their stuff is different from your hook. Well this is really completely different. It's your face: beautiful and scary and shameless to say you wake up. War, Peace, 9/11, poetry, even a frightening music video set for an old time "patriotic" song and a strange man in RV. Can I say more? Just look at it.
