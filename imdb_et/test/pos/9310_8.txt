Okay, maybe it was because I saw this movie in Yangchun China. Maybe it was because I finally had something on TV that I could understand or at least read the subtitles, or maybe it was just funny. No matter what the film was, it was worth the time. <br /> <br /> I just had my mouth and head massage when they gave me a remote control to watch TV. I would normally turn off the case, but I stumbled upon this crazy movie and got hooked. <br /> <br /> The plot, if you could call it a kind of rotation around the plot and a kind of love story and the food of this movie is a real star. If you like Iron Chef and many other cooking shows that are currently in reality TV mode, you will love scenes with this movie. <br /> <br /> It's fast and the subtitles are so fast to read this speed. But this activity is mostly slapstick, so you don't always have to read the whole subtitle to read the idea. <br /> <br /> The main actor is a cute eye candy and the main actor is not bad to look at. They are both worth watching. Finally, if you have time to kill and want a good laugh, this is not a bad choice. <br /> <br /> I don't speak Chinese, but I could fully understand the cultural humor about this movie. For those who speak Chinese, maybe it is even better. In general, I give it to 8 out of 10, and now I'm even looking to find the copy I have when I go to China, and I hold back when I return home, this is a pleasant reminder of my time in Yangchun and the silly afternoon in the massage parlor watching a stupid movie.
