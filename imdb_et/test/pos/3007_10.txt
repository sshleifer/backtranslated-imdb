I just started watching The Show in July. I found this wrong, I was surfing the channel during the holidays. This is a great show, I just want it not to be so late at night. It's at 12.30. As an employee, it is difficult to look at all the time. <br /> <br /> I read some comments. I did not agree with the late one that did not grow in the 60s and did not believe this stuff could happen. <br /> <br /> I grew up in the 60s. I'm Spaniard and I had a "white" boy and we had black friends in high school. I believe that people get together because of their interests and personalities and they have nothing to do with a particular race or color. <br /> <br /> I can't wait until the display goes to the DVD so I can buy it. So I see it from the beginning.
