It's not a life-changing film; it is neither epic nor anything. But it's fun and fun. This is a movie that the whole family can look at together, and there are now few kids with suitable movies that they don't have a love story! It speaks good stories lightly without trying to dazzle the audience with general special effects, like many movies these days. It works somewhat well and all the music used is pretty good with the content of the movie. The actor is also pretty good, the actors see themselves as comfortable and credible in the surrounding environment, and the most important jokes are actually funny. I recommend it to people of all ages - it certainly made me laugh. :)
