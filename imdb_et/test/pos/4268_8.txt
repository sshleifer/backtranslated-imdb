I especially liked the ending of this movie - I really felt what these characters needed to know, which I think is a sign of good leadership. I talked about how the new store sales came out - there was a great deal of character development, although its "role" is probably considered to be small. <br /> <br /> I also had the impression that the whole film, being free in the dark, was free of nudity, embarrassment and violence. Sadness, sexuality and darkness can first be left unreported (often better), but it seems to be often unique for truly "stylish" films and actors. Knit it to the maker.
