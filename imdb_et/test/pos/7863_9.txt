Within a short period of time between western Clint Eastwood's spaghetti and his Dirty Harry films, he and director Don Siegel made this unusual picture. Eastwood plays the body of the injured army of the Union during the Civil War, which the southern school deals with girls until it recovers. It has been a while since young women (most of whom seem to be teenagers) have been in the room so they don't want to turn to local rebel soldiers. The resulting situations are often humorous, shocking, erotic, or even grotesque, as Eastwood slowly recovers its power and begins to establish over the body. <br /> <br /> The main story sounds almost like a movie. We have a masculine man, suddenly surrounded by young women in the nub. Most of them have attracted him sexually. And he is more than willing to spread love between them. But the material never hit the "tasteless" level. Eastwood, Siegel and operator Bruce Surtees are skilled filmmakers that always keep their dignity. <br /> <br /> Eastwood's John McBurney is like any other character he's ever played. McBurney is immoral, gripping and horny charlatan. She knows that most women, even the youngest, want their body, and she lets more than one of them hit her. McBurney often uses women to attract lure, so she uses her strong look to put them in. He is like a cocktail party for a drunken player who often hits different women even in the same scene! Finally, his lustful actions cause him great embarrassment and loss in the way you must see yourself. This author would not dream of the concrete consequences of his actions, but there is no doubt that he is coming to them. <br /> <br /> Eastwood usually provides excellent performance. He seems to have a role to play until things get really ugly, then he gets middle and ugly. Geraldine Page is a cafe that is a sharp B * tch going to school. We know he wants McBurney to be as much as other girls, but with his square past we are shown in rebounds that it's not all he's! Mae Mercer as a school slave also gives a great result. Obviously, McBurney is a skunk from the start, and she won't let her fool around guard her. This is the sign you want to know more about after the movie ends. He seems to have more knowledge of the world than anyone else in the movie. <br /> <br /> The Beguiled did a bad job in his theatrical release. No one was quite sure what to do, and some of its content undoubtedly raised some eyebrows in 1971. For example, in the early scene, we see Eastwood's romantic 12-year-old girl. Is he just trying to keep his silence when the rebel soldiers go, or does he really enjoy it? Probably both! The fantasy sequence later shows even Clint to get it not just a Page but also his young assistant! Really some interesting events in it. This is a good thing Eastwood got, what he did, or it may have long been forgotten. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 9 stars out of 10. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
