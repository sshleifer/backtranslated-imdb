People seem to have been waiting for Citizen Kane here! The Planet is a B-monster movie and it's so fun and different enough to enjoy it. The director obviously has something to offer - not so sure that some are cast. What is the effect? 8,000 pounds don't have much budget. I would like to have this trip to a sci-fi driver or someone who doesn't take the monster movies too seriously. If so? See 3 colors instead of blue. Like an alien did not hang things. Best Movie? Director. The worst movie? Cast. Perhaps the director has time to move from Glasgow to London and find some talents. Meanwhile - well done. At least you are trying to do something.
