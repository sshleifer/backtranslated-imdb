Barbora Bobulova's idea of ​​Valeria in this story was at the same time fascinating and compelling. It has been a long time since I have seen so much hidden passion and mystery that no actor presented simply by using her facial features and eyes and mouth as Barbora does. He was completely plausible, because Valeria and I wiped it out by characterizing it. The film was real life and fantasy all the time. Clever use of the limited dialogue remained fascinating to me. I was forced to read between the lines and every key person used body language and emotional intent to deliver a strong story. In particular, Barbora stimulated in an almost unusual way and at the same time in a sexy way. This comment can easily relate to any of the many emotions that his performance has highlighted. The dialogue is underestimated but powerful in terms of presence. I have captured this from the actors and tried to look much more for my work.
