I'm a big fan of the spy world and it's one of those movies. The task is based on a real story that is somewhat adorned with a big screen, and it will lead you to a really fun journey. The film has an excellent performance featuring Aidan Quinn, Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley. <br /> <br /> Navy Officer Quinn has been reluctantly employed by Sutherland after meeting with Kingsle who believes Quinn is a famous terrorist with Carlos Jack. As Quinn resembles Carlos, Sutherland stops hiring him because Sutherland is obsessed with the capture or death of terrorists. <br /> <br /> Training sequences are fantastic. Quinnit is really being tested by Kingsley and Sutherland, who have to withstand remote-controlled snowmobile attacks, from eating the same food every day to the hallucinogen. He even has to learn how to love a woman like Carlos. <br /> <br /> The movie has some great scenes with Quinn's eluding allies because they believe he's Carlos and his last mission when he's killing. Throughout the film, Quinn has to fight for the new personality he has achieved compared to his own. Will he remain as cruel and free as Carlos or will he return to the life of a good man and father again? <br /> <br /> If you like the spies genre, it must be visible. The operation is only used to advance this thriller's story; no free explosions or scenes. Rating 10 out of 10 stars.
