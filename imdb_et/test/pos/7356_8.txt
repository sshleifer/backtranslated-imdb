This movie was spoken in Fangoria, where I heard about it, it was interesting to me because it was a direct video, and I felt two shots of stars, James Marsden's disturbing behavior and Christine Taylor The Craft. And to my surprise on Valentine's Day, when I was looking for the aisle of horror to find it on the shelf! I had to grab it right away. I and my brother and our girlfriends looked at it and, to my surprise, it was pretty good, the stories were interesting, and when they were SCARY, unlike other recent movie films. Some of the plot that I don't understand, but when I look at it again, I bet I get it. And even more surprisingly, I also found other letters I know, including one of the girls in my television show My Life and Jacinda from the real world, I'm not sure why this movie was just for direct video, a little advertising this movie could have at least compensated for how much the money was spent to do it. The only problem I have is that because it wasn't published in theaters, I think I can never view it on a widescreen. You should definitely rent and rent this opportunity. <br /> <br />
