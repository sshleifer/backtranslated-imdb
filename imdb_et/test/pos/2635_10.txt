This movie is a great example of 80's entertainment. Oh, don't get me wrong, most of the music then sucks. I only loved the metal strips of the 80s. Bands with some balls. Forget that tiny keyboard crap and all that "life is terrible and want to die". But the 80's movies are the best. They were all crap and just time. This movie shows it! Party! Get naked! Put it down! WOOOOOOHOOOOO!
