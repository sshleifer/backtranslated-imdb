In fact, I went through the mistake of a lifetime channel, just as this movie started and ended up watching it. <br /> <br /> This is certainly a serious problem that is likely to be more common when we realize that such a young man's attack is by an ego-maniac fellow who feels he is above the system, and unfortunately it is often. <br /> <br /> The casting here was plausible and the performances are reliable. Many of these Canadian / lifetime clips are decisively "up." However, this is one that I could label as "top-the-top". <br /> <br /> Although this movie did not seem to be overdone, this movie seemed in some way a recording. slower than proper, it seemed 96 minutes much more, and it looked like a shorter film, a loop over and over, seemingly going on and on and on, and ON - before the inevitable and predictable conclusion nevertheless, the amazing characters and performances did this type of film despite this criticism above average. <br /> <br /> And while these images are often "milk", it could have been a little more detailed and longer.
