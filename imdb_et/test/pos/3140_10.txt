John Ford's film pantheon is a unique place for Wagonmaster, Sergeant Rutledge, and the Sun shines bright. For the three films that did not have the names of the offices, Ford did not have to redesign the film to be a star of John Wayne, Henry Fonda, or anyone else with whom he worked. Not surprisingly, Ford considered them all one or another favorite. <br /> <br /> Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr. a couple of pleasant cowpokes to drive the Mormon wagon train to the territory of Arizona. Along the way, they first connect group players to a drug show and then family members who are in Clegg. Their stories are merged and what happens is the basis of the film's plot. <br /> <br /> If Wagonmaster had been made even 10 years earlier, if Johnson and Carey had two strong performances, both would probably have been big cowboys as a B career. For Johnson, this would have been the art imitating life. Johnson was a true rodeo cowboy and came to Hollywood, where John Ford could use Fort Apache. Ford has hit his presence and the rest is history. <br /> <br /> But the western B-day drew close and Johnson and Carey had a great career as an actor with two fine characters. <br /> <br /> Ward Bond plays the elder leader of the Wiggs Mormon. Bond has recently been converted and has trouble remembering that they are not using the four-letter word. But he is a leader because of his character, not his impeccable LDS theology. He turns out to be a smart and compassionate leader. <br /> <br /> With Cleggs's imagination, Ford had to come to My Darling Clementine only four years ago. They are the gang of Clanton and the reincarnation of pure evil. In fact, when Walter Brennan, who refused to work for Ford after refusing My Darling Clementine, wanted to see him easily as family leader Shiloh Cleggina. As Charles Kemper did a good job, it is probably the most important role. Soon after this movie ended, Kemper was killed in a car accident. He can work very well for Ford in the future. <br /> <br /> Ford makes the pacifists of the Mormons here, and I don't remember pacifism as part of the LDS doctrine. However, it works here, the whole idea is that people who are not weapons are innocent when they deal with evils like Cleggs. Some weapons need to be handled correctly to collect them. I think this second world war film is trying to say that pacifism is not always the best policy. <br /> <br /> The second transfer from My Darling Clementine is Alan Mowbray, who plays the same role he made as head of the drug manager's team there. Part of this troupe is Joanne Dru, who on the second round, as a woman of elastic virtue, does what she did on the Red River. Dru used so many Westerners to miss gingham and some modern fashion. <br /> <br /> Wagonmaster is a great entertainment and I'm ready to rush in Utah, a pretty popular movie.
