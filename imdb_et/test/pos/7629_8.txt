The last dinosaur in the 1970s was one of the films that were "away from somewhere" in the weekly movies that were quite exciting over time, especially for fans of Japanese Tokusatsu films. It was originally designed to release the theater (about when Dino King Kong came out last December) and it was suddenly pulled out and made Friday night to be an ABC film. Rankin Bass, who were not strangers to Japanese co-productions, were the weapons of production that were produced with Tsuburaya Productions in Japan - people who brought us to various forms of Ultraman. Mostly American cast, including late Richard Boone, Joan Van Ark and late Steven Keats, talks about this prehistoric pocket of the era, somewhere frozen in an arctic circle containing dinosaurs. It plays a lot of feel and pace with The Land Unknown (1956) and The Land That Time (1975). Of course, the dinosaurs were in costumes (A Triceratops with the front knee!), But they were filmed so that the music and the score were so well done, and a good job was cast, which wasn't important for many of us. The film has many classes, Nancy Wilson's "The Last Dinosaur" opening up to the "big" feeling of the film - the northern Japanese hot springs were excellent and lush and indisputable feeling of Kaiju Eiga. There are some amazing pieces - the T-Rex's "Bone Clause" and the tracking technique that takes us deep into the jungle to see that T-Rex eats a huge fish from a stream. People from Tsuburaya FX did their work in style here and set aside some of the bad guys' matt-shots, they're doing their job well. This film is considered to be the best Japanese "echo" movie of the 1970s, even over five decades of Godzilla film. Rankin Bass made a number of other cumulative products with Tsuburaya, providing beings or miniatures - The Bermuda Depths (1978) and The Ivory Ape (1980), but not measured until the epic look of this film.
