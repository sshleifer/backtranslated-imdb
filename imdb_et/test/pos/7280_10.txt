The first thing I noticed about this movie was how well everything was created. High quality movie all around. <br /> <br /> I think you could only love this movie for your action, but I liked it more than that. <br /> <br /> This is a pure thriller / horror movie. It offers a more perfect script than most horror films. I thought that at least the US version was excellent and was a great collection. The story was honest and brutal. <br /> <br /> The film has a great, tight script that keeps the action moving, with incredible characters in highly credible situations.
