I didn't expect much due to harsh inspections and as a result I enjoyed the movie a lot. In my opinion, the narrative made it possible to focus on softer colors and less stunning compositions than some of his previous films. Although the religious conflict on the vampire was common, I felt that many other things were not. For example: <br /> <br /> how his powers were often found in communicating with him. <br /> <br /> Very strong and well-functioning love scenes. <br /> <br /> The man they killed to get closer to each other to separate them. <br /> <br /> Their strong difference is what it means to be a "vampire" created by their prior life experience. <br /> <br /> The lack of other vampires appearing through the movie. <br /> <br /> I've heard and read a number of tricks about other movies. Of course. However, I feel that the tricks are used to emphasize what is happening at the event, and I feel he is doing it well. I don't need a driver to use the new tricks. I prefer the used tricks to be used well and appropriately, which I think is the film. <br /> <br /> I recommend it.
