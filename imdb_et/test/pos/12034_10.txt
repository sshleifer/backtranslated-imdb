This film has 4 parts and each about 170 minutes. It is based on Joe Bonanno's biography and it tells how she saw. So at some events we may notice that we heard it differently. With the movie, you can tie yourself to the board until the end, I think it is possible to watch all 4 lines and not notice that I watched 2 in a row and 2 in the next day in a row. Participation in the film is OK in some scenes, but in general it can be a joke, but this movie is not an act or a special effect and glamor, it shows the real thing and the story is the key to this film. So one who is looking for the same magnificent Rambo / Matrix / Titanium movie can skip it. The good thing about the movie is to follow the main story, so you don't have long and boring scenes of love or other interruptions if something is not important for Bonanno's crime.
