First of all, it is a great pleasure to hear that the legend performs such wonderful and timeless music. This movie and soundtrack is a tour de force. Ray Charles is unique and amazing. I really loved the movie because it was inspiring and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx has become one of Hollywood's premiere players, as Ray has clearly shown, and he should become Oscar for this role, it is unprecedented. In fact, everyone who worked on this film should receive recognition. I really liked Kerry Washington, who played an extraordinary wife ... Ray Charles was married well. Regina King is a good actor and extraordinary Sharon Warren who plays a fighting young mother. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I would say that this whole project was organized. The whole cast was a perfect, great scenario and fantastic settings ... great props for director Taylor Hackford and the team who did such a great job of bringing Ray Charles's life screen so flawlessly. This is my year's picture, certainly one of the best biographical films.
