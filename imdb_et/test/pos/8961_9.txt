I'm not exactly sure if the accuracy is in this movie, but I can tell you that this movie was entertainment. The striking character of Phillip Seymour Hoffman's excellent hit was one of the most unique but fun characters of the latest memories. this movie was reported but managed to prevent the audience from being announced. it made me laugh, made me sad, made me feel alive and rejoice to spend time watching the movie. it does not take time to understand what is happening, and takes you to a true, human emotional skater. I thought I knew my history, probably I didn't know it at all! I give it to 10 out of 10 moves and recommend it to all adults and young adults and youngsters at heart, not just to young people. but as soon as they are allowed to see "r" rated movies, make it a priority.
