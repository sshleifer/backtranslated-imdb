Closet Land is an amazing, terrible cinema. It only contains two participants in one set, but never loses your attention. The designed design is imaginative and worrying, the layout of the scenes keeps your attention while adding to your own confusion and fear. Action is outstanding because Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe are required to wear every scene. It didn't play in the theaters where I lived; not surprising given its political content. However, this should be seen. It includes torture and interrogation techniques used by repressive societies to infiltrate fear and obedience to their citizens. The country has never been named, which makes it even more prominent. It can be everywhere; East, West, World 3, World 1. This shows what happens when a small group of people decide what is best for everyone; if the government becomes the ruler of the citizens rather than the servant. <br /> <br /> Madeleine Stowe is a children's author who has been pulled out of bed at night and is subject to terror and torture. He finds himself with Alan Rickman, a seemingly pleasing functional. At first it seems a terrible mistake and he is free to go; but fear causes him to stay and the fear increases. He is increasingly under physical and mental torture. The interviewer uses a sensory deficiency, time manipulation, confusion, audible manipulation, role play and twisted logic to break the author. He is humiliated and frightening, forced to withstand intense body positions, without food and water. <br /> <br /> Through all this, he refuses to give up; do what the questioner asks. He is told that it will end when he signs the confession. A simple little act. He refuses. Through it, it uses protective measures that have evolved since childhood. It slowly turns out that he was a victim of child sexual abuse. To survive, he developed the fantasy worlds and characters that took him away from abuse. These mechanisms allow him to overcome his torture and turn tables into his interrogator. He starts attacking his beliefs and profession, forcing him to study his life and motives. Finally, he is free because he enjoys freedom of thought. The interviewer is the one that has been trapped by the state. This is even more timely in a world where "enemy fighters" are kept and heard in a secret prison, denied legal rights or counsel; where "ethnic cleansing" destroys society as a whole and humanitarian aid is forbidden. This shows that a person can stand against a state or other oppressor by refusing to forgive fear and fear.
