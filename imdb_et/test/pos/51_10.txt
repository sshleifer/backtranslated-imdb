It was absolutely one of the best films I've seen. <br /> <br /> Great performances from the wonderful A list that will take you from smiles to laughs to tears and back. <br /> <br /> I couldn't handle the characters. Mrs Merkerson blows you off, as does the young man playing the young man. <br /> <br /> I also thought the design was top-notch. The viewer is really placed in every era when it is presented. <br /> <br /> Music is also a blast. Nice choices for mood, time and place. The blind blues person is stereotypical but offers great songs. <br /> <br /> This is a great story that remains with many repetitive views. Take the time to watch it!
