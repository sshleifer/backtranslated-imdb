There is no doubt that this version of Tarzan is closest to Burroughs' vision. When he was happy to receive the films he had received in his lifetime, he often made it clear that they were a bit more than the bastards of his stories. The ridiculous obsession with the film studio when the Olympic players were chosen by Tarzan was ridiculous. I think we should make ourselves happy that they didn't set their sights on the blow. Before this movie, the most reliable adjustments were comics and comics. As good as some of them were, we had to wait seven decades for the filmmaker to respect the respect he had created.
