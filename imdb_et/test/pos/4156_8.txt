A few days ago in Rome, a young Romanian man was attacked and tortured by a criminal precedent who was killed in the middle of a woman who came home after her home after buying. A Romanian girl who had seen everything said what happened. <br /> <br /> That's why he started a debate about the over-intensive flow of immigrants from Romania, generalizing them as criminals, everyone, indiscriminately. > <br /> I am only 15 years old, but I thought what kind of idea would give these poor people in Italy? How do they read them to many countries? Last night I finally saw NUOVOMONDO and my question was answered. If you only have a donkey and a few goats, the impression of this is the postcards of propaganda that show the United States as a land of dairy rivers and large vegetables. <br /> <br /> NUOVOMONDO is really a black film. It balances the essential insignia (milk power, eyes, games, hard and rocky mountains, name and character Lucy / Luce) and cruel realism (mass of hopeful people on board, procedures in Ellis Iceland). There's mixed cast, going from angelic Charlotte Gainsbourg to a realistic Vincenzo Amato, up to the bitter and crushing Aurora Quattrocchi as the mother. But was it really so difficult to enter a new world?
