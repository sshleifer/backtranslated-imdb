I blame myself for the "birth of a nation" to start a long tradition of traverse versions of Hollywood history, which can be many more examples. In addition to the correct description of the names of Custer and his 7th cavalry, Crazy Horse and Sioux and President Grant, the right geography and the fact that Custer and his men really wiped the man are simply the hyperbole and the ridiculous bounds of the invention. Throw some astonished scenes of cleaner exposure (try learning Custer and his wife from the fake "Gold Rush" to apologize for the invasion of Sioux Territory, Custer's testimony to Congress for the rights of the Red Indians, and from above, Custer's imprisonment in the President's Office to ask for his post to return) , to be honest, there is much more to it, some of these scenes are almost comedian ... ... and yet, and more, and this is still a very good actor with Flynn as eternal, like DeHavilland like ever when young Anthony Quinn started Crazy Horse and director Walsh as a barn-formatting ever before in depicting images of his crowd and, of course, poisonous sequences of action. Ford taught us in the "Valley of Freedom" to believe the legend before the truth. Here I think we are closer to the legend of the legend, but hey, it's just a movie and a rolling, wonderfully enjoyable classic Hollywood movie!
