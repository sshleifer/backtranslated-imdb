Soap is an interesting film and very skillful. You have to look at it with your strong testimonials and the risks that the plot takes about two people in love. You need to know this story through a number of other reviews so you can talk about what's great about this movie. <br /> <br /> First, the two main characters are both real and interesting personalities. The first is a woman who has chosen a four-year relationship and is angry enough that anyone who comes to her will fall asleep. The other is the man who has always wanted to be a woman whose pain and loneliness are shown so much sensitivity and brilliance. You hate yourself and your heart bleeding for it. <br /> <br /> Another thing in this movie is the concept of the whole loving person whom one has, regardless of gender. So, do you still love your partner if you want to change your sex? The film explores this idea and it is beautiful. <br /> <br /> But there is one place where the film fails. I wish the main character's relationship had improved. That what they feel as love does not come to an end. But look at it and post your thoughts here .......
