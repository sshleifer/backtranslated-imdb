I was watching this movie for the first time on the Sci Fi channel and I have to say that it was just awesome. For those who love the 'never ending story', it would bring back the memories of this film. Although it is a 1996 film, it has a bright setting and look that makes it feel like fantasy. The action was great and the music was a particularly great starting song and final song. For those who haven't seen it yet, look at it! I completely recommended!
