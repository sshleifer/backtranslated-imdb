This film, which appeared in 1951, has the usual elements typical of the Western nations released in the 50s; a cavalry, who must protect the territory from a murderous Indian band, an official who decided to see this task, and men with him of a different nature to join a unit. This little band must refrain from the fortress near the Indian village until the reinforcements arrive. The Indians know that it is good that the little band is underestimated and can be wiped out before the help arrives. One of the main differences between this film "Valiant Only" is that he tries to play a normal story, but at the same time, the message is that the duty is of the utmost importance for everyone to share it, even if they don't want to. t accept this fee. <br /> <br /> Gregory Peck embodies the close captain of troops, who must stop the invasion of Indians. The troops of the forces he takes with a small outpost are the mighty fortresses of the force; they, in turn, have grips or weaknesses that cause them to think whether the captain has not taken them out because they are not at all committed to this cause. Finally, the captain and the small bands stand against the hostile, and at the same time everyone is facing their own mistake. For example, western manors such as Ward Bond, Gig Young, Neville Brand, Lon Chaney, Jr and Warner Anderson are employed. <br /> <br /> The sleeping place of the movie and the western part of the fans of the good genre.
