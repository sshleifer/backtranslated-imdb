David Lynch's ninth full-length feature film Mulholland Drive is a deeply touching story about treachery and jealousy. If anything, it brutally contradicts our ambitions and hopes for the bitter truth. Every film in this film has an importance and connection with other parts and at the same time with itself. Nothing is what it seems to be, and you are left on the real puzzle when you finally try to put together the pieces. This is a film that does not compromise, nor can it completely solve the complex form and language of the camera, as it might have been on a previously lost road. <br /> <br /> While there are clearly recognized classic lynx motifs and movies remain very original, even if it is a Lynch movie. The missing road marked a new way of telling the story; an unusual tool for setting emotions on the screen. With Mulholland Drive, Lynch was not only able to control this technique, but also to a new level to make it more complex and multi-dimensional. In doing so, it creates a framework for different layers of time and human mind. At the 2001 Cannes Film Festival press conference, David Lynch said that striving for the best possible perfection could result if the collection is larger than the sum of the parts. Speaking of such synergies is the impressive Mulholland Dr, where different sequences and many details contribute to the total number; Dreams and Parallels Intertwine to Create a Story. In some art, its beauty is its simplicity. This hasn't been the case with Mulholland Drive and has never been to Lynch. It is the complexity that colors and builds the worlds of Lynch creates, with the same complexity that characterizes the real world. <br /> <br /> It's never forced, as I think, like Memento, using the original way of communicating with viewers. A further comparison of Mulholland Drive with other films shows that it proves that David Lynch is the master he does, and paves the way for art and film making that nobody has ever done. Compared to, for example, Alejandro Jodorowsky or contemporary Matthew Barney, I believe that Lynch is unable to dominate an artist or, more likely, David Lynch understands and performs filmmaking as an art form. <br /> <br /> Understanding a plot is not a small example, but Lynch's way of working with sound, perspective, chronology, and form paints so dark and frightening works of art that it sometimes seems more realistic than real life. Lynch cinema is often and definitely in Mulholland Drive, which is an increase in people's emotions. Working with emotions is a delicate craft that requires understanding and depth. As Lynch puts it, "A little too much and emotion goes away. A little too little and it won't happen." In Mulholland Drive, David Lynch has no problems with this balance. Lynch's portraits are all dimensions and take different directions, creating incredibly realistic characters and situations. Watching Mulholland Drive is a journey through the subconscious. It is a true and naked film with undeniable artistic value. That's why I love Mulholland Drive and what's the best in cinema history. Final movie.
