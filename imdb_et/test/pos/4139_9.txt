What a great movie! I never knew about Buddy Holly, but I knew my lively and fun music. It is a wonderful biography of a person who helped change music in the 1950s. Though I never cared for Gary Bussey, he was fabulous as Buddy Holly! I don't know how accurate the film is, but at least mostly expect accuracy, which makes the movie even more interesting. All the music in the movie adds pizazas to this biography. I don't think I would change anything in this movie, it was all good! What is the difference between the 50's and today's music stars? How can anyone compare Buddy Holly with Justin Timberlake? or any other popular singer of this generation?
