fine romantic comedy. errol flynn shows what comedy was in his possession. talent that probably shows some of his real pinch himself. comic writing this movie is great. Eleanor Parker works beautifully as a former woman of flyn, trying to get her back. Eleanor is also easy for the eyes. kits mislead the glamor and style of the 1940s, if appropriate. <br /> <br /> Flynn's comic timing and mind appear here in full, we look at his double techniques, his ability to verbally hit or behave directly with a man and his complete credibility and sincerity, if necessary, can act on this man ! it is a disgrace that errol did not gain more roles in his career as he was, who was extremely versatile. if you liked "it happened one night" with your husband and Colbert or some comedy of William powell and myrna loyal, you will enjoy it. </p> <p> </p> The movie's lost diamond.
