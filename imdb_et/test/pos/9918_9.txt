If you don't like the Italian horror, this movie doesn't like it. On this note ... <br /> <br /> "In general ... it was a terrible experience ... A lot of things happened. Vanessa Redgrave was going to come to the movie and she pulled out. One actor was broken by car, I was involved in marriage but at the end of the finished picture, my father was dead at the time of shooting ... all sorts of things. "-Dario Argento" Making Opera "<br /> <br /> I was really impressed by Argento and the film he made here - especially against such harassing circumstances . "Macbeth" the whole mystery and its curse for those who are trying to play "add to Opera." <br /> <br /> tricks. The young opera singer Christina has been stolen by a violent psychopath who forces her to see several brutal assassinations. When you killed several sharp blades on Christina's eyelids, the killer makes it impossible to close her eyes, "Take a good look!" <br /> <br /> It is clear that Argento puts the faux "Macbeth" screen on the screen very carefully and its hard work costs away. Include several unforgettably brutal assassinations, an incredibly tight chase and POV genius to portray a certain character (the role Vanessa Redgrave pulled out, thanks to God) and you have one of the best Italian horror films created. <br /> <br /> That said - it's still an Italian horror. Why does Christina seem to tell anyone that this brutal murders are not understandable to anyone. Some scenes may be difficult for some viewers to stomach, but I personally felt more tension with Christina and her eyes than any brutal movies. In the "Tenebrae" finale, my opera "opera" was more than any stomach, but it is probably me. fought to keep it in the movie. Absolutely no one likes me myself, but that's not enough to destroy my other movie for me. It's still one of Argento's best movies. <br /> <br /> 9/10
