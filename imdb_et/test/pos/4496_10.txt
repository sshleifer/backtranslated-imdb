OK, I haven't read the book ???? And maybe this book was better ?? It was fun, not a bit boring, enjoyable, and above all a heartbeat. The friendship between the two children was so pure and innocent. These children worked so well, especially the servant's son. Oh my God, it's like a god form on earth. ARGHHHH he steals our heart so easily. ********* Spoilers ************* Another friend of the rich man is a child and his confusion and frustration can be understood. But when I was angry when he abandoned and ignored his friend while he was comforting. Anyway, he was just a child and a bit stubborn. I want the film to show the older version of the poorer child. Arghh it hurts just to think about the end. This movie is sad. I felt terribly sad at the end. Tears fell off my eyes. Yes, the background points are fantastic, the scenes are WOW. Kite scenes are fascinating. And it goes in the middle of a little adventure. Wonderfully acted and perfectly cast. The children were doing so well. Great direction. don't know why this movie wasn't successful for WOOO critics. But it was definitely WOO me. 10/10 Must-See ??????
