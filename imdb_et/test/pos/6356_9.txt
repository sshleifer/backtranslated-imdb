This movie is a great example of what can be an independent film. The director works very well between emotional and physical violence. Finally, he recalls that so many Indie films forget - he is telling a good story. Watching this movie, I was reminded of how clumsy and everyday Hollywood films with the greatest budget have changed. <br /> <br /> It is especially remarkable that the film's director - Jorge Cordova - is exceptionally strong. As a criminal (drives to the top of the crime ball), Cordova plays conjunctive, brutal, intentional, devious, and sleazy S.O.B. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that these guys were part of a new wave of Los Angeles filmmakers - La Nueva Obra or something like that. Either way, this movie will change your mind more with your work. <br /> <br />
