Dolemite is one of the best films that depicts the hero of the hero who takes the man off while at the same time combining all the best women who have to offer the ghetto. Remember, these women know karate and are fine women. <br /> <br /> SPOILER - The End Fighting Scene is pretty crazy, Dolemite is hanging out of Willy Green's heart. Make sure your copy is unrated. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are a number of innovative brilliant characters like Hamburger Pimp, Honor, Mayor, Queen Bee and others. The garments are big and the sets are full of 70's style. There are a few confusion in production, such as the booms that appear, but which adds charm and laughs. <br /> <br /> I would recommend drinking 6 packs before and after this movie and keep the squares and the man far away.
