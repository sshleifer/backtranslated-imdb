So it may not be completely historic. And there is little or no real character. But for Jake (Ridley's son), Scott's first attempt is worth the ticket price. <br /> <br /> Captain James MaCleane (Jonny Lee Miller, who looks as good as ever) can be a gentleman, but he hasn't got the money or clothes to prove it. The plunk (Robert Carlyle with all his clothes) is a pharmacy-reversed language. The circumstances of their strange meeting are the dead body, the ruby, and finally the gentleman's partnership. As the label line says, "they're robbing the rich ... and that's it." There is not really much background or even deep development, but the object seems to be enough to relieve enough money and aristocracy for jewels to pay for two Highwaymen passages to America. One small problem: MaCleane falls in love. Rebecca with Liv Tyler. Who also happens to see the Thief Taker General. <br /> <br /> The plot is original enough, the casting is great (especially Alan Cumming as Lord-Queen Lord Rochester, Carlyle and Miller - also with "Trainspotting", they haven't lost their dynamics), the costume is fantastic, makeup is outrageous, and music is a hard-knitted techno with a strange classic undertone. Jake Scott has an eye for light and shade, a good balance between sight and plot, and it doesn't make sense to show off the most unpleasant side of London in the 17th century. And we are happy to have faces, especially eyes. Jonny Lee Miller's eyes. And also Liv Tyler, but hey, who's this movie? Rebecca? Plunkett and MaCleane. But this film has more than just a pretty face. In the event of a threat to the air conditioner, it is a fast, furious, and sometimes frustrating ride with Robin Hood, with the finest highways. Decadent, buggy and violent, Scott's debut film makes the film an entertaining evening. <br /> <br /> MaCleane says, "I was terrible, and it was a bloody laugh!"
