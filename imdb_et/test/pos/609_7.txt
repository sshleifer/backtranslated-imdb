Look at the three geishas in front of their prime minister. Now they look back on their past with love and condemn their present. Kin (plays Floating Breeders "Haruko Sugimura") has sworn men and has made a good living as a housing provider; all in the block owe him. The other two, Nobu and Tamae, want them to take their spouses off but are not stupid enough to believe they ever are. In the meantime, their children - who have a son and one daughter - are both married (not to each other). Tamae has tempted how much her daughter has become more beautiful and tries to convince her not to marry. Nobu's concern for his son is more justified in nature, but they are (understandably) self-serving. After leaving the son he is alone. A bit of a movie, two Kin's former clients are being searched for by him, one man who is so obsessed with him that he tried to make him double suicide, the other one of his more convenient customers. Unfortunately he comes for money, not for his love. The way I've described the film makes this sound unevenly depressing, but it's not really. Sad, but not deadly. It's more bitter. Unfortunately, I just loved Chrysanthemums late. The story looks better when I look back, but it's very slow and boring. In fact, I nodded twice during the movie and I wasn't tired at all before. It's a movie I appreciate more than I like; it reminds me very much of the reaction to a couple of Ozu's most famous films. 7/10
