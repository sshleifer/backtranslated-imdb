Skenbart takes place in the 1940s, just after World War II. The main character, Gunnar (Gustav Hammarsten), is relinquishing his job to be able to "exchange" in post-war postwar Europe. He writes a book by his favorite filtermaker Ludwig Witgenstein and starts a journey that finally proves Witgenstein's famous statement: Nothing is what it seems to be. <br /> <br /> There are two main plots and several sub-points. to the film that takes place on the train between Berlin. The writer / director Peter Dalle (who also plays the role of train conductor) has collected impressive casts, including Swedish legends Lena Nyman, Gösta Ekman and Robert Gustafsson. Generally it works great. <br /> <br /> Skenbart offers somewhat twisted comedy with finer black humor (like a nun who loses his faith and is grieving). It's like Killinggänget meets Peter Jackson (Braindead, Bad Taste) on Schindler's list. I laughed at most of the movie and when I woke up the next morning, I laughed more. Intelligent film for Swedish comedy fans.
