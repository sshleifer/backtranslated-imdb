I agree with most of Mr Rivera's comments and I just want to make a few warnings. This film, "Mascot", has been criminally ignored in its current form. It's also called "Vampyr". "Mascot" is not a "bonus feature" - it is dealt with in the "Vampyr" chapter. Although it is very clear that this is a separate film, the producers would have had to deal with it. And while I've done it, Vampyr also needs the same respect and purification. I have the feeling that the decision to put Mascot in there went something like that. <br /> <br /> Dude A: "We took Vampire over to DVD, but it's about 20 minutes short. We have to put something out there that doesn't cost a lot of money. Do you think movie critics want to talk about movies "Dude B:" Don't worry. I have this little animation that has been sitting in my drawer. Just go ahead and throw it in as an additional chapter. "Dude A:" You're awesome, Dude B. "The Mascot's animation is great and I don't need to repeat what Mr Rivera did so well. But this thing needs more cleaning and restoration, especially sound. The plot passes through the dialogue, and there was so much lift in my copy, jumps and places where the sound just fell off (I would have no idea what the dog went out of the box after reading it, there wasn't much more understanding of the words, it just brought tinniness up and made the lifts and sounds louder. <br /> <br /> Starewicz movies must be put in a respectable collection, cleaned, spiffed, liner notes, and all nine meters.
