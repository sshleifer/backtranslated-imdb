This film appeared on the 13th channel in the 1990s when they made many comedies from Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s. In fact, the Jolly Fat Policeman team was editing the scenes in the movies to introduce a series of people laughing, including one of Gary Cooper's chortling, watching the film in the film house - a sequence. It all starts innocently enough as a millionaire, Cooper goes to buy pajamas in France. But he only loves going to bed. The judge (Tyler Brooke) demands that he can't sell half a pair of pajamas if Cooper wants to. Claudette Colbert hears the argument and offers help - she just loves to sleep at the bottom of pajama. What if Brooke sells them everywhere? Brooke has never made such an offer before, so he goes to the floor builder (Rolfe Sedan) and asks if it can be done. He is also disturbed - the application is quite unusual. Finally, they contact the shop owner (Charles Halton). Halton is in bed and goes out - her skinny frame only supports the pajama top (if it is suitable for long censorship). Can they sell two clients in one pajamas set (for every half)? Halton rightly fears, "No, of course not! It's communism!". Therefore, sales are not allowed. Probably no one thinks Cooper could buy the whole pair and sell half to Colbert. <br /> <br /> The eighteenth woman of Lubitsch's BLUEBEARD has had a declining reputation, most viewers dislike the misinterpretation of Colbert's character. He is seen as quite a mercenary for Cooper - selling himself under his own conditions. <br /> <br /> In fact, Cooper's character is nastier because he is rich and figures that everyone has a price. He's right about most of the time. See how Colbert's father's aristocratic enemy Edward Everett Horton sees his new brother as the golden goose he can use. Cooper's willingness to marry Colbert has somehow agreed that if he is hesitant or unwilling to marry him, he will have to pay damages. When he understands it, Horton watches and (with the most calming voice) tells Cooper, "Take your boyfriend time!" To decide. Later we see that Horton's wardrobe has become more modern and masterful. <br /> <br /> The script, Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett's script compares well with their script Mitchell Leinen's MIDNIGHT (including Colbert, but Don Ameche and John Barrymore). There, Colbert is ready to sell himself for marriage (Francis Lederer), but this is done by a complicated fictitious marriage with Ameche. He really loves Ameche (taxi driver), but he explains to him suddenly at a realistic moment that his parents were married for "love", but because of poverty they grew to hate each other. This is not found in BLUEBEARD's eighteenth woman, where Colbert has no such background (she is a daughter of Marquis). Drawing his mercenaries is to teach Cooper about his standards. <br /> <br /> The film has a nice support staff, including Herman Bing as a private eye, who hides what Colbert is learning and young David Niven, who has moments of choice as a stent in a punching bag and wishing Cooper. Coop tells Niven about his problems with Colbert and how he's so scary. Niven listens respectfully. Finally, Cooper touches on his willingness to hear what he was supposed to say. "Albert, how much am I going to pay you?", Asks Cooper. Niven thinks and says, "Thirty-five francs a week." Cooper deeply sees his soul and says (shaking his head), "It's honest!"
