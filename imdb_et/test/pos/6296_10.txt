Conrad Phillips celebrates the 1950s series of adventures - William Tell. William Tell is a reluctant freedom fighter who fights against the tyranny and oppression of heroically invading forces on 14 October during a hostile occupation of Switzerland in the 14th century. William says is the Swiss version of Robin Hood. Conrad Phillips plays the main character fantastically. Maybe Pascal Bugnion would have been more successful in his role, but he wasn't available during filming. The classical competition consists of 39 series. Episodes are black and white, but it does not in any way reduce entertainment.
