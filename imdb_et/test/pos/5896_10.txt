One of the greatest things in the best years of our lives, which is quite certain in World War II, today is as real as the VE or VJ Day 1945. The acceptance of returning war veterans is as old as the history of our planet. <br /> <br /> And while we often don't know history, we may be grateful that the United States has done it. to learn about what happened to your veterans after the last world war. The draft GI rights has been mentioned after this. The best years of our life were perhaps the biggest social legislation of the last century. So many veterans used it, as did veterans like Fredric March, Dana Andrews and Harold Russell, whom you see here. <br /> <br /> All three actors played archetypal veterans, characters that every corner of the US could identify with. They all meet on a military airplane that rides to their home country, Boone City, Iowa. <br /> <br /> War is the great leveler of class and distinction. Banker March, Soda Jerk Andrews and High School Football Star Russell will probably never meet in real life even in a small town like Boone City. But they meet and warfare indestructible bonds that can never be crushed. March is the oldest man with two children and the perfect woman of Hollywood Myrna Loy. She lives first and best. He has some wonderful scenes, when they return to his return and later with a little fluid, he speaks insecurely to the bank's officials. <br /> <br /> I also love his scene with another returning veteran who wants to get a bank loan on his land. Look at the phrases in March when he listens to a man's pitch for money. You may feel that he is reading the man's soul. For this film he got his second best actor Oscar. <br /> <br /> Harold Russell was a real veteran who lost both hands in the Pacific. He was especially praised for the Oscar for his performance. That's why it was probably unfair to call him the category of actor that he won. His performance, especially his scenes from Cathy O'Donnell as his loved one who loves him with or without his hands, is beyond anything that could be Dana Andrews's only colleague officer in the military air force. Maybe he should have stayed from their group. He also comes from the poorest background in the group and was an officer and a gentleman. This uniform and monthly distribution control is what Virginia Mayo was interested in getting married. The problem is that he is far less civilian in his eyes. <br /> <br /> Although Mayo fools with Steve Cochran, Andrews is very fortunate to have his daughter Teresa Wright interested in her. They are the main story of the film, the adaptation of Andrew's civil life and the adaptation to marrying the wrong woman. Not all veteran problems were solved with GI Bill. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy recognizes little of our lives for years. I think this is because his role as a woman was too much like the stereotypical role of a woman she had patented in MGM. For the March woman and the mother of Wright she is really an adhesive that keeps the family together. <br /> <br /> The best years of our lives have won the best picture for Sam Goldwyn, William Wyler's best director and some other than two acting Oscar. It was a critical and popular success, perhaps the best film ever made. Nowadays it is a pleasant and lasting classic and it has been for centuries. It is almost three hours long, but your interest will never decrease. In his memoirs he said he was disappointed to miss this year's Oscar, but that his friend and colleague William Wyler has created a masterpiece that he deserves for each prize he received for it. Of course, the film Capra hoped was a wonderful life. The years of our life year cannot be commended.
