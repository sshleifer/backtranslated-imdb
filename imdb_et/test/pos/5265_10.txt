As a veteran screen writing instructor at Richland College in Dallas and former MGM screenwriter back to decent movies, I'm excited to have accidentally clicked on Channel 33 in Dallas today and watched this enchanting film in which Betty White is GORGEOUS and makes one longing for old good movies before Hollywood it all started for teenagers. When the manufacturer listens, I would like to say that we have enough over 60 years of age to pay for a movie that has no weapons, no kills, no special effects, no sex or violence and just a good story about human relationships that leaves you a good warm feeling like this movie for me.
