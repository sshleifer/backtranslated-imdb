I liked this movie, which offers a variety of interesting sub-blocks and complicated love-hate relationships, with mixed scenes and some mild moments where mountain men are responsible for tough army disciplines. All the main characters are well cast. True, John Wayne or Robert Mitchum could probably have done just as well in the starring, but Victor Mature is undoubtedly terrible when he shines brightly. Reminds me of the role of his film, like Samson, another hard but impossible man to tame. <br /> <br /> Mountain men in the open scene are definitely anachronism, as the men of the clean trap mountains are pretty much over 20 years earlier, with the collapse of western beaver populations, as well as the fashionable bamboo fashion market. This story is being held in Oregon just before the end of the civil war. In the background of an open scene against a volcano (probably Lassen), the fictional fortress was somewhere in the far part of the cascade because we never see any other civilian. However, there is much contradictory evidence that this is actually happening in the mountains of Wyoming or Montana! The Red Cloud, a warrior who threatens birdwatching and soldiers, is the namesake of the very famous Sioux warlord who led a very successful campaign in 1865-66 to destroy the newly built army fortresses in Wyoming and Montana. It is mentioned in Fort Laramie (East Wyoming) that it is not too far from a fictional city. The Assiniboines Plain Tribe mentions joining the Red Cloud. This aspect of the story has a general similarity to the historical fact. <br /> <br /> It may be interesting to note some similarities between this story scheme and John Ford's "Fort Apache". In both cases, we have a commander of the fortress who was recently appointed to his first border post with Indians. He underestimates the military capability of his opponents, keeping them little more than a cannon for career advancement. In both films, he pays dearly for his inexperience against the enemy. It is also common that, among the green bosses, he sends a subordinate who has long experience with local Indians, and wants to tell him what makes sense and not to do. In both films, there is a masterful romantic relationship between the commander's close wife and the subordinate, which the commander does everything to break. Obviously, the commander must be removed to allow the completion of these romances. <br /> <br /> I also see some similarities with The Misfits. The soldiers as a whole, including the commander, are misfits ((as one of them admits): mostly they have "problems" or untrained recruits who have no experience in fighting indigenous peoples. So it is a fort or near by nature, with a husband who is in his future in the army, very uncertain, and the traps are wrong, which do not really want the army or civilian discipline. Their past free spirit is living by the Red Cloud caused by the recent army. <br /> <br /> Finally, we can also compare this story with Anthony Manni with later movie "The Far Country", where Jimmy Stewart plays, he may eventually choose to be a lonely cowboy, but Mature's character is not a delightful new way to be his own boss because Red Cloud has changed life outside the army in the area In addition, he has a confession with his wife.
