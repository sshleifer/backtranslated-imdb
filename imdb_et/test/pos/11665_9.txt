"Dead Man Walking" is an incredible movie. All operations are top-notch and realistic, and the script examines both sides' death penalty, with equal respect for both. Above all, it is a deeply moving story of redemption, death of dignity and the disappearance of the ego. Any movie that deals with it with such an incredibly complicated subject is worth the rating 10/10. Thank you, Tim Robbins!
