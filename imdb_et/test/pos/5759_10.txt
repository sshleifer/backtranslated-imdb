iv was a fan of Rik Mayall and Ade Edmednson, as I remember my youth or the bottom. and I just have to say that I haven't laughed so much in my life! guest house paradiso is bloody brilliant! I know it doesn't come with every cup of tea (vomiting, hit comedy, violence and flawless language), but just don't look at it unless it's yours. it doesn't like it if nobody knows what sick and twisted things come from Rik and Ade when they work with each other! I think it's unfair that this movie got a slip from the critics because I don't think I'm the only one who thinks this movie is out of 10! :)
