It was / is an incredible movie that is incredible cast, music, singing, story, etc. It is a tragedy that some delightful families (Gerswhins or Premingers) can keep it available to a generation generation. I wanted to see it all over my life. I just found this site and read why it's not available. Shame on their families for their deception. My wife is from Germany and she has never seen this movie. Nor are my grandchildren or grandchildren. It is very sad that the depth and quality of the film cannot be seen for them. Where these families give up such a conceivable, self-evident egotistical decision to forbid generations to enjoy this movie, these stars, these performances, this music! Unleash the video and let the world judge and enjoy!
