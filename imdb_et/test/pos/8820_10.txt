Michael Sheen shines like a comic genius in a glorious imagination in the afternoon at sunset. If you are familiar with Kenneth Williams' motives and diary, this drama takes their nature perfectly. When I read about Kenneth in swimwear, I laughed and then brought it to the screen, but this time I wasn't laughing because it was put into perspective as a repressed and tortured human activity. It has to be a lonely existence that is in Kenneth's skin, wanting to pay attention, but that is where it really matters! The last 20 minutes are heartbeats, as you can see that Kenneth gradually falls into the depths of despair and sees suicide as the only alternative. I've seen it a dozen times and still cry uncontrollably in a place where she offers a good time for LOUIE. I can't recommend this drama enough. Sexual, explicit, but it leads home to the fact that Kenneth could not let anyone penetrate his world and that is where the man is sad. Because the genius who brought happiness to so many people is a shame that his private life was filled with such despair and sadness. Pauly.
