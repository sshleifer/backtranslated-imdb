The theme song often goes through my head for all these years. I was never an observer of television, probably because I just entered my busy teen years when my family bought our first set in 1948 and it never became part of my life. But I've been hooked on Lawman's first episode, and that's the only TV show I've planned for my week. <br /> <br /> Intelligent, plausible, well-written and well-behaved and John Russell is still the most beautiful man I've ever seen. (Peter Brown was not a dog, either: o) <br /> <br /> I agree that this is the least-valued TV series of all time. I hope I find my grandchildren watching them.
