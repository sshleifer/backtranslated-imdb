First of all, it is interesting to note that one user here commenting on the film (from Belgium) was supposed to add that Lumumba was "communist". When this user really looked at the movie, the message was that he was not a Communist, but was a "communist" leader of individuals, corporations, and the state (none other than Belgium, the US, the UN, etc.). political and economic benefits. Even if it were decided to accept that the film was participating in "revolutionary history", it would be naive to assume that Lumumba was a Communist, especially from a country that "gave" Congo independence, and because Lumumba was elected DEMOCRATIC as Prime Minister. <br /> <br /> For film ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the most important and powerful films I've ever seen. The depiction of the struggle of the African freedom fighter and the struggle of the prime minister as the first leader, Peck, is a very commendable job of bringing all the pieces together for one job. And it has to be quite a task. Due to the fact that most people outside of Congo and Belgium are unlikely to know the history of Lumumba and Congo, outside African imperialism (hopefully) in one high school / high school (or perhaps at university / college level), he was cut off for him. <br /> <br /> And to think that Oliver Stone's "JFK" took over 3 hours, "Lumumba" lasts less than 2 hours. And it was the most inclusive 115 minutes when we found that his desire not to compromise with the Western powers (whom he was responsible for his people, especially Belgium) for fighting against power within his borders, apparently even with some of his friends, is amazing that he lived as long as he did. <br /> <br /> It is for everyone interested in equality, justice, humanity, history, politics and true freedom. You don't have to be disappointed.
