For me this is good. I'm disappointed that Ana Lucia and Libby died, but more irritated that Micheal lied to everyone who killed them. And if anyone can answer it, what were the guys who supposedly were "Henry Gale," as it was the leader of others (or was it Mrs Clue?), If you know her name is cool. Well, trying to think about what might happen next after they finally did not sink this button. Does it interfere with the whole DARMA project thing, and I personally thought it was cool how they had the main thing underground that Desmond used to close the magnet, and what was it? I'm just glad they didn't sink at the end of the button, but what happens to the people in the hatch? Like Mr. Echo, John, Charlie and well Desmond probably died, but what about others? I think they survived, forget? well it's just my little thing I was thinking about this season's finals !!!
