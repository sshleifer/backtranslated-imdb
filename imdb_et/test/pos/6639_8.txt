What Bergman has received is "What if all these bad things happened here in Sweden to nice people like us?" And what he does in Swedish with Swedish actors, in Swedish places (and using truly Swedish military vehicles), what was familiar to war movies in almost all other European countries - all the confusing invasions and counter-attacks, political lies, internment camps, fake confessions, summary executions , torture, coats, "companions", etc. As in the modern short story, it has been done abstractly, without real names, cities or countries. But the stronger faction is "Nazis": they talk about themselves, and some wear shiny knee boots. One even whips things in riding culture (ok, it's actually a rose). The sacrificed couple is called Rosenberg. In addition to the shame they feel on finding more direct ways - and who doesn't do what they did? What all of the above can be said is that the title is clearly meant to refer to the de facto involvement of the Nazis in Stockholm. Indeed, what we have shown is what Sweden would have seen if Germany had asked for a bit more than mining concessions. <br /> <br /> The first side plays like a black comedy. We see a "war mist" from the point of view of a comic passive couple who ignore forces around the world, long convoys, bombed buildings, news and c. They don't even worry about finding a working radio. They're the ultimate "Not in my backyard". They talk about wine and copper; in the meantime, friends have been mysteriously forced and more and more troops are growing in the city. They don't show curiosity about the war that has been around them for years. <br /> <br /> The man (Von Sydow) is cultured, sumpy and navel-gazer; The woman (Ullman) is somewhat more impulsive, passionate and outward-looking. There is a beautiful scene where a man speaks of his violin: a producer who says he is funny fought in Napoleon's wars, but his own interests stop with his cultural artefact - or more precisely what his own warm feelings about owning and owning it. Not in my backyard! But when the war finally breaks into its bucolic idyll, man's indignation, irritation in good times becomes a responsibility, one that he eventually over-compensates - as is often the case - as Bergman shows finely and beautifully. Definitely worth seeing.
