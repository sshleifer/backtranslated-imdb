I saw it originally in the UK. I was fascinated by it and it was all tears throughout its duration. I kept it on TV, but over the years it has worn out. And the TV never seems to show it. It was therefore a pleasure to know that True Movies owns copyright and shows it on its channels. This time I stuck it on a DVD so I can enjoy it again and again. <br /> <br /> Lucile Fray (Ann-Margret's great play) discovers that she has cancer and is a terminal. Her husband has arthritis, and although he is loving, he is an alcoholic and he is unable to care for his children. Therefore, he must find new homes for each of his children before his death. <br /> <br /> The actor is the upper limit, the music is beautiful and it has been a wonderful experiment over time (it still makes me cry)!) If you have the chance, it would be stupid. This is a great movie! Must See Everyone !!!
