If you have enjoyed Butterfly Effect, Donnie Dark or The Machinist, you will also enjoy K-Paxi. <br /> <br /> This movie seemed to me to be really resurrecting and finally frustrating. Spacey offers great results like Prot. Also, you should not forget the appearance of Saul Williams in the movie, of which I am a big fan. <br /> <br /> After I looked at it, I suggested the movie to a lot of friends, and everyone was pretty much blown up. Sorry, it's not about blowing things out of things, how people behave, and how people live on worlds that don't exist. <br /> <br /> Go and have fun.
