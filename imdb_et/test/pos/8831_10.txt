Duck_of_Death has to watch this movie again, because his big criticism is totally unfounded. The film never forgot the time, and it was explicitly mentioned in a few places. The team was never shown any interviews with mission control that did not follow the deadlines. <br /> <br /> One thing I thought was a bit far behind, if the risk involved was - will the team land on a planet where pressure vessels would last only two hours? I doubt it. Will a manned spacecraft go into the coron of stars? I doubt it. Do people get into the moon that was bombarded with huge radiation? I doubt it. The ship also seemed too strong. Would the ship build such a risk into the atmosphere? I doubt it. Will it survive by the comets of comets? I doubt it. In both cases, I think the structure of the structure would be too big. But all-in-all, unlikely scenarios were offset by some nicely done special effects, good editing and production, and some good practices, especially by actors who portrayed the ship's chief and Russian cosmonauts.
