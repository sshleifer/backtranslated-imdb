I've been a fan of Larry King for some time, I think he's doing a terrible job in general and I don't think he'll ever "start" because so many people believe. She is a fine Scorpio, she gets her invasion when she needs it just as she managed to do last night with Paris Hilton during her first post-prison TV interview. <br /> <br /> The thing about this whole thing has amazed me that Hilton is still probably married, why Judge Sauer gave him what he thought was too harsh (and even more, MADE was serving him). All the time he was in prison, allegedly alone 23 hours a day in his cell, he never wanted to change his mind about what led him to be punished by Judge Sauer forcing him to. He never thought that he could have left a larger red flag when he (1) showed that he was late in the trial, and (2) continued him when he asked him if he didn't know his license had been suspended whether he did not receive papers by mail, "I have people reading this thing for me." <br /> <br /> All the time he was in his cell, he never realized that this action (which shows up late) and this statement - and more importantly - the attitude - the complete cavalier failure to prosecute the system and the law in general and his driving rights he showed - just might have made Judge Sauer (forgive punishment) sour. <br /> <br /> Last night, at the royal show, after he had made his traumatic experience forever, how he "learned" his lesson, he answered his question, "Do you think I got the raw material? Surprisingly Yes, and during the conversation (if you call it) he said more than once that he did not feel he deserved what happened to him, the king asked gently, more than once, if he didn't feel he was creating his own in life, he "finds" himself, where he looked pretty much, so he is basically aware of the conviction that he has fallen victim to this situation, he does not understand how he himself did this day, met his judge's attitude towards the judge. I think it is very sad - tragic, even considering what a huge "role model" Hilton is for some people, and it changes something that he said last night about his so-called rehabilitated state, full and complete marriage, controversy and hypocrisy. during the show, Hilton referred to spending a lot of time reading the Bible. At the end of the interview King King made the main points asking him what his favorite Bible was. He replied barely waving his mischievous remarks (completely superficial non-insights he had read in the air, as if he were Nelson Mandella or something) and finally attacking, "I don't have a favorite page." <br /> <br /> Judge Sauer, in my book, is a hero and after last night, so is Larry King because he exposes Hilton for what he really is.
