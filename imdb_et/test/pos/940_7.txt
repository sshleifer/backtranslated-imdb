I saw this movie purely by chance. It was very late or very early on television. I was awakened and had trouble sleeping and this movie came. <br /> <br /> He is dealing with many times covered topics (this is definitely not as good as Rita's training, despite the twisted twists) and is a very predictable end. <br /> <br /> Despite my very obvious drawbacks, I enjoyed this movie and it was thanks to some of its players, not the story or the whole work. I'm a big fan of Sam Neil and I've seen him in many different films, including: Dead Calm; Piano; Sirens; Children of Revolution; Event Horizon; Bicentennial Man and the ubiquitous Jurassic Park. He was very good, but he could have played that part with his eyes. <br /> <br /> Some actresses, for example, were terrible for me, for example, Rose Byrne, and some elusions were quite heavy (all the empty-minded woman's dress, for example, was wholly white). <br /> <br /> But two actors (who I didn't or don't remember seeing before) impressed me much with Sin√©ad Cusacky as Frances (Frank) Kennedy and especially Matthew Newton as his son David. He was especially convincing and would like to see him much more.
