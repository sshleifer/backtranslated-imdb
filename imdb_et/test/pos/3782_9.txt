Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments, like Charlie joins the army to fight during World War I. <br /> <br /> First he goes to the camp where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to go in line. This is really a funny scene because the tramp is not used to keeping the legs straight. <br /> <br /> The next thing you know is he's in a ditch in France. Fun scenes are here starving Charlie, who eats a piece of cheese and reads letters from home over someone's shoulders. <br /> <br /> When Charlie goes to bed, he finds his bunker flooded and his roommate snoring. It's such a funny part! I can't really describe it, just look at the movie. When Charlie wakes his feet feel dull that he's trying to "wake them up". It was me rolling on the floor when it turned out that her second leg still feels dull ... while Charlie rubs her roommate's mouth! Germans from their ditch (though it is done in a very funny way) and personalizing it as a tree to get close to the enemy, saving their friend from their death. <br /> <br /> The last part is to get the French girl in trouble, hiding in her house. He then has to rescue him and by doing so he also captures the German kaiser. For that, he embodies a German colonel or something. I love it when Charlie is asked something in German and she's like her ninja. The soldier looks at her in a funny way so Charlie changes her mind: and and and! Kaiser gets stuck and Charlie is a hero ... but then he wakes up again in bootcamp, it was just a sweet dream! <br /> <br /> Charlie did one of those dream sequences (the bank remembers), but who cares, this movie was so funny that I had a laugh. Chaplin also has something to say about this film (since his later work became more of a social commentary on a number of accidents in the world) and is best explained in the last sentence of the film: "Peace on earth, good will for all mankind. In short: Charlie's classic, very funny, timeless. 9/10
