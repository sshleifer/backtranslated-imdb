It was a film that I read constantly and again; and despite being played in the Film Museum and not in the Pathe Theater? I decided to try this movie. The reasons were many? the review compared it to Pulp Fiction, the film had several parallel stories, and finally it had already won 17 international levels in different categories. I was eager to see this movie and, after Greenpeace's day, I decided to see and enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a story based in Finland. I think it reflected people's general life? drugs, crime, sex, anger, anxiety, fear and guilt. In the film, every emotion was busy. There are several characters and stories that are intertwined, but some characters come back in the last half? creating a link with start sequences and the one that takes the story forward. <br /> <br /> The story is about two friends? one of whom is a computer geek and another is a drug addict? son of abusive father. Drug boy trades with Euro 500 note? printed by his friend? Buy your music system back and return big money exchanges to buy more drugs. Does Euro 500 continue trading at odd events? shop trader car mechanic cum robber ?? to a car dealer? vacuum cleaner salesman? to a prostitute? a police officer? then his family and children. How does a little thing begin? creates a chain reaction that, even after 5 years after the first case, leads to a depressing final comment? which I am not publishing here. <br /> <br /> The direction is great. The film's character development is first-rate. The person who stays in your mind even after you leave the movie is the salesman of the vacuum cleaner. All sections of the movie are handled well. Here I would like to make some critical remarks. First, after another sequence of events, I felt the coincidence was too fast and forced. But this scriptwriting mistake is grace when we see the entire canvas. Secondly, the path of another character returns to the first two characters, and again I found it a forced decision of the screen writer. There was no need to see the same signs again if there were different reasons in such a big city that caused different effects. <br /> <br /> But after that? this is a great movie! It's a dark film with quite a few sex scenes. The characters have black, white and gray tones and emotions that change from a different situation that the director has hit perfectly. <br /> <br /> High-end movie! It has all the components of becoming a cult film. I hope that only such films should not become statues of worship movies and win and win many awards, because without crimes, sex, violence, drugs, etc. can fantastic movies be made? Bicycle Thieves and Pather Panchal are its main examples? the only thing is that they were a long time ago and times are changing and I think the films reflect the current times.
