"Cahiers du cinema", the young jerki François Truffaut, the future "New Wave" of the main bastion, made a great show of the hatred of this film and even accused him of dragging the French cinema into mediocrity. Truffaut, who was sexually repressed, was already jealous of how Carné won a tremendous success story that pushed all of her audience's better buttons, and indeed accompanied her with something important that was all about sensuality and lure. In other words, when the public and many critics saw a beautiful film in an understandable sociological analysis, Truffaut saw "girls open". After all, Carnéel was all lacking in New Wave: intelligence, refining, humor, a great talented narrator, great ear for dialogue, dazzling technical shine, power to make her actors do what she wanted, and a good taste of taste. For comparison, Truffaut is a provincial cage that has nothing to say. <br /> <br /> The 50-year tragic "Pride and Prejudice" remake of the French "Rebel Without A Cause" - an updated version of Paradise, "Les Tricheurs" talks about the hopelessness of young Parisians who have lost their path to existentialism, sexual abuse Some (young) critics perceived the Carné theme as a moral inclination of the "older person", while I think that the fact that Carné is gay and knew about it or two repressions felt a surprising sympathy for the young iconoclasts In addition, this French film, which is not mistaken for this rebellion is essentially sexual, is something that was still decoded in American films such as "Rebel Without Cause" and "Wild One." <br /> <br /> The Carné youth are all very beautiful, graceful, elegant, spontaneous and intelligent, they are Gods and Gods, they run the latest Vespas and the right cars. The cut of dresses and duffle coats was the high point of last century fashion. Their discounts are still plastered on the local hairdresser's wall. Their body shape, which they achieved and care without effort, is still a modern Western ideal. They listen to the best jazz musicians. They know how to move, how to be sexy and how to love? although the pill has not yet been invented. They know how to negotiate different social classes and cultures. Unfortunately, they are defined and live by the gang code and their heartless rituals, which exclude sentimentality and sin of romantic love. The only thing with them is that their parents don't talk to them and vice versa. The incidents that emerged in this film for a long time in France received many languages ​​concerning the immorality of young people and nihilism, but still a great public and critical success. <br /> <br /> This movie is so stylish and proud, I suspect that older viewers who wished they were like people in the film and quite a few young filmmakers or aspiring filmmakers like Truffaut have developed bad jaundice, which reflects how they can never portray a movie as sexy or popular, even though they would be very good at nihilistic bits. On the other hand, given the script's certain piano (a gracious misunderstanding that leads to a medical emergency), one can only be surprised that Americans would have come out of the same basic script if they had dared to deal with it. "A year earlier. When Hollywood saw the picturesque aspects of Rive Gauche and existentialism, Carné restored her tragic and ironic dimension. Watch this trailer on YouTube: 19ZkKeoNjPo
