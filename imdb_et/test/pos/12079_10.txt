"Who loves my kids" is the saddest movie I've ever seen. Definitely 10/10. A film published on television in 1983. DVD release is key, not before. A mother who dies of cancer must find homes for all her children before her death, because her thoughts are that her husband and father of children cannot take care of them when they die. He succeeds in finding children for children, except for one, a young boy who does not want to, because he has epilepsy. Very sad if you didn't want to. For a real good tear jerker, get your hands on this movie. I'm a man even when I watched this movie. Must not be skipped.
