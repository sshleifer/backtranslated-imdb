What a wonderful documentary - I sat down thinking that it would be a transformation of the bitchy stories spoken by Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, but it is actually a clear and prominent celebration of a strange and twisted era that created some really great movies. What struck me was the lack of bitterness in the director's interviews given that filmmaking is now in great fashion - instead, the eyes of Friedki and Coppola seem to glow positively to their glory. The film material from the audience that came out of the exorcist's daily examination was invaluable. "It was traumatic," says one man. A big epitaph of late Ted Demm, an exciting movie, I just want it to be longer - I could have been sitting in that three hours.
