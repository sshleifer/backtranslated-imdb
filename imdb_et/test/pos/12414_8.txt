This is the perfect movie to watch with a loved one during a cold and snowy night. If you like some laugh with your fear, it's a movie for you. Creation of a true cult classic. It has everything you want to see in the horror movie. Beautiful girl, hero, buffalo, MONSTER TRUCK and of course the family of mutant satanic killers. It's full of blood, courage and gore. I strongly recommend that you look at it early in the morning and be wary of seeing you as a monster truck, Bad {But Funny} one liner and our hero who eats the ball. Not as good as Evil Dead, but the other. Remember that WARNING ..... DON'T BE LOOKING FOR THIS FILM ...
