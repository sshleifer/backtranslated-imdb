Good sadness sethrp-1, you left this point completely. The girl was only briefly seen. THAT she was the one who wanted to kill herself ... everyone else was packed in her stories that they didn't notice her, nor did we. As another student says at the end - we are all so we have put together our problems, we don't notice what else is happening. <br /> <br /> The director himself said that if he had killed one of the others, he would have suggested that their problems were worse than anyone else. The point of Kelly's killing was that you didn't all notice us. Get it now ??
