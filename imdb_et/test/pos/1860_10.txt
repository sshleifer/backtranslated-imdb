I believe that the reason why this film was not appreciated is because Darwin, pro and con have many misconceptions. I would say that the real man is depicted here without sterility. He's what he's. Although the film is just a present-day man, storytelling technology extended his life much longer than in the movie. It is a deep film, a way of thinking modern life, and the way we think, and it can provoke a study of a man whose thoughts (and others who used him) have certainly influenced our lives. There are some films that the historical context is so great that the main task of the actors is to stay away. History five days and participants did their job. I'll tell them a good job.
