What is your striking problem? Do you have anything better to do than sit on your fat ass and blog, how to find something with a bad taste? Here's the idea: Go out. That's right: walk outside your mother's basement, where you have lived for 13 years and go outside. "But I can't leave! Star Trek is turned on after 30 minutes and I'm still not married to the avatar of World of Warcraft!" Oh my God, stay in this case! Okay, I could have gone over there. I mean, Star Trek is okay, but I'm not following it anymore. In either case, you really have to write a mess about Mencia. This is a good example. Maybe you are just angry with your anger because this girl threw you into World of Warcraft. Or you are constipated. Try to put your diet on fiber.
