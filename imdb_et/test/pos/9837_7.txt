Years ago, I didn't love and respected Jimmy Cagney's movies as much as I do now. I noticed that many of Cagney's films made with Warner Brothers in the 1930s lacked realism and his exemplary style was far from subtle. But the more I watched these movies, the more I found that I was hooked with these aspects in mind. Actually, I am now and look forward to them! Old-time fans Hollywood movies probably understand what I'm saying - teenagers and other young whippers! Well, when it comes to entertainment, HELL will never give you anything from start to finish. While the idea of ​​how a shady character like Cagney played in leading the reform school is ridiculous, and although all the changes she made seemed far removed, it has all been somehow worked out and provided some form of entertainment. <br /> <br /> The harsh bats were before Dead End children and Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, and Billy Hallop play Frankie Darrow and Farina similar roles here. Yes, I said "Farina". This black actor was already famous for his roles in our Gangs comedies and was, or not, one of the highest paid child actors in Hollywood. All he had to give up in return was named an unpleasant name and works like a nice stereotype "Negro". Here he was actually pretty good and the usual black stereotypes are a little more modest than usual. But some will start in a very funny but terribly offensive meeting with Farina and his father Fred 'Snowflake' Toones. Don't tell me I didn't warn you with terrible names like "Farina" and "Snowflake". <br /> <br /> In addition to this small complaint and plot that is hard to believe, the movie is extraordinary and fun. Children do a good job, like Cagney and Dudley Digges in a truly despicable but exciting role as a caregiver of evil. It is also a plus that you see Allen Jenkins, a multi-year Warner shareholder, in his first studio.
