It was very good in the West of the 1950s, one of the best I've seen in the decade that presented it on the screen and on the TV. There were certainly three big actors at the client: Glenn Ford, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson. It turns out that Ford was the star of this movie, while the other two stars were in support. Ford had most of the dialogue. He was also a "good man", while Robinson was a "bad man" and Stanwyck was twice as bad as Robinson. He played a real hard one in this movie and the character he played was sometimes too controversial. <br /> <br /> Ford worked very well as he usually did - especially in Western countries. He played a nice man who didn't want to fight, was a peaceful man ...... but if you put him ..... look! <br /> <br /> The story was a nice mix of activities and noodles, not too. It was an expansive western device that was well used on the wide screen of CineamaScope. It also included realistic people in a realistic environment. This credibility with characters, especially supportive players, was the most impressive. The men went out, acted and characterized the women of this film. Dianne Foster and May Wynn were weak - the only production factors. It's easy to see why these two actors have never become stars. Although it is over 50 years old, it is the West that you are still moving fast enough to enjoy, no matter how old you are or what you are used to seeing. For classic film fans, this is the main cast and good story. Highly recommended.
