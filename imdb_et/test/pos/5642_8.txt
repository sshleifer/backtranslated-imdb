The fires led by Kon Ichikawa and written by Shohei Ooka and Natto Wada is a World War II film that ultimately does not show allies who fight against the power of the axis, but fight against Japan and fight for their lives in the Philippines. The main characters are Tamura, played by Eiji Funakoshi, and he is a soldier who leaves his regiment because of illness. All he has is a hand grenade, his gun and some potatoes. In doing so, he tries to go to the hospital to get a doctor and treat his illness. But as the hospital turned away and destroyed, he started a long walk. Throughout the film, Tamura remains a bit of a cuddly but very civilian when other soldiers become more animal-like, using their key pressures to survive, Tamura is still human and does not break down. The scene that has thought and thought a lot about my war film is when Tamura arrives at a village in Phillipino that is completely abandoned. There he fights with the dog and finds many corpses of Japanese soldiers gathered in front of the church. It makes Tamura think and even more fearful than it already is. This shows that a soldier is not a brave killer, but a servant of the highest beings and man. After he turns out of the corpses, two Phillipinos (a couple or a brother and a sister: a very close relationship) turn back to get their salt back. The main character of the film first wants to be friendly, even though he went with their gun, but lets the woman when she screams. His brother / boy / husband then rides with fear and instantly watches for Tamura and shoots wildly fleeing Filipino. He didn't hit him. After Tamura picks up the salt bag, something very valuable, he falls to the gun. This gesture is very important to understand Kon Ichikawa / Shohei Ooka Tamura and the war profile. Compared to this movie with other World War II films, it is not at all typical. Of course, heroes suffer from all the films, but their heroes are more heroic than Tamura. He expresses everything that is human: he starts to manipulate, he is weak, he is afraid, he has hope. This is a typical Japanese World War for two films and Japanese society. After the Second World War, Japanese society has not discussed the issue, and the Japanese are likely to be the victims of the Second World War. This victimization is also very visual in this film. One example is Tamura, another congregation in front of a church of Japanese soldiers, and another is when Japanese soldiers are trying to cross the street and Americans are already waiting for them and all Japanese soldiers who have inferior equipment and are inferior, and who do not have health equipment or anything else. In my personal conclusion, I have to say that this movie is worth seeing to finally see the movie on the other hand as usual. It also has no national propaganda that could have been easily built. If you have been watching the movie completely, you will be able to see the horror of the Second World War in its entirety.
