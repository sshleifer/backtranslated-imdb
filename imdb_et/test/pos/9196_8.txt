View 1 of 10/28/2007, 8 out of 10 (Dir-Jesus Ponce): A simple, cute story about a couple of homeless people and their everyday adventures that live in everyday life without a roof. The film begins with a woman who is a story (played by Isabel Ampudia) released from prison, but we do not know what she was or how long she was. He runs over the story and his boy-hero Sebastian Haro, because he's changing cars. They break down under an old, broken building with only one heat and a small mattress. He is a drug addict who just tries to fix it from one to another, but he has a strange, obsessive attraction for him as the person we finally accept. He also has some sexually transmitted disease, so that their sex is beyond that, but it does not seem to be one of them. He loves this man as he is, without a doubt and without having to change, which is rare in any place. He serves him, carrying the bucket and washing the washing machines. They eat the baking roll every day and hold this party. Isabel's character dreams of a normal life, but doesn't think it's happening, and doesn't expect this role to fit into this group, so it doesn't mean much. Both characters come from very broken homes, and therefore the audience has compassion for them despite their compassion. Isabel's character leaves a lot of hope without giving up, but the man continues to get worse and worse with his drug obsession. The story that drives it to the masses is a nice melodramatic conclusion, but in general it is a great independent film about the relationship between the world's inconvenience that keeps you interested until the end.
