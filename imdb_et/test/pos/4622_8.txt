Many other viewers say it is not good to watch a movie because they feel it is not "realistic". How it can't be considered realistic. They feel to say that the part of the Incest is not easy to associate with, that it is not normal. I can assure you that you have met more people than you think there have been incidents. Many of them do not come out and say it, and mostly they are victims. Many people are gay and are still in the closest places because, no matter how much they would like, they know they are ridiculed and may even give up. And tell me how many children you have attended in high school, what is pregnant, or was there a eating disorder? I bet a lot, and although pregnancy is not usually incest, it is mostly unrelated. Who can't be drowned or bullied? it happens all the time. and many viewers are likely to be involved in education such as Marcus. The stoner is probably quite common. so there are many things to associate with. What's more, no matter how popular you may be, sometimes you feel invisible or alone, do not notice or neglect, such as suicide, how do you feel associated with the film? I find the film may be pointless for others, but I would like to think of it as important. This is an interesting way to show that suicide is happening, and be aware. it comes from people who don't show their unhappy thoughts, it is very surprising. People who show that there are problems sometimes commit suicide, but if you hear suicide, who would have thought that it usually works through most people's thoughts. <br /> <br /> The end surprised me, I didn't expect it to be a girl who, before the end, was mostly an add-on to scenes, not even in the introduction. The story, even in its description, tells about its 6 teenage lives when it was actually 7. My only real disappointment was that it was not one of the characters we knew, but at first it seems to be a movie it was pointless to watch whether a real victim is just one random chick. Until I thought more. it was perfectly reasonable to be a big surprise because it is what suicide is. plus, who had to choose who another student had more reason than the other. <br /> <br /> Although this film has some bad points, most movies are scarce, but I would recommend this movie as long as you can deal with the tragic moments of suicide viewing and the violence and torture shown in this movie.
