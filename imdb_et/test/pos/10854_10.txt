Like a lesbian, I'm sick and tired of depicting movies and TV as a sad person, forever getting suicidal and killing, but never having to find happiness? <br /> <br /> If you are like me against Hollywood anti-lesbian propaganda, then the BBC will breathe in such a delightful offer. Nan Astley is the daughter of the Oyster House restaurant, "wondering why she doesn't know how she should talk about Freddy" (one of the local boys with her eyes). He falls? and falls hard? Kitty Butler, a visiting theater group. Nan accompanied Kitty to London as her dress? <br /> <br /> Not everything that happens to Nan is pleasant with this story, and some of the things he doesn't do are pure-clean - but he wins your heart and his story of love wins you. If you have a beautiful one-time cucumber at the end. <br /> <br /> If you are a lesbian-hating-men or a homophobic housewife or a religious fundamentalist who believes that homosexuals should die and go to hell, this series is not for you. But if you have a heart and you believe in love, you will cry as much as I did at the end!
