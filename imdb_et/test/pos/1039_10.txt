... a real geek girl's dream: high technology, high drama, smart boys, steamy sex and big explosions. (Very big explosions.) Sam Waterston is so natural in the role of Oppenheimer that the REAL Oppenheimer tapes sounded odd: probably his voice was similar to Ronald Reagan! Oppenheimer's triumph and tragedy are one of the most disturbing dramas of the 20th century, and this film is an example of what should be a docu drama: facts are allowed to speak for themselves, while fancy parts are used to amplify and fill a record, not to pay attention to yourself. Interesting fact: some of the technical details used have been declassified and are therefore of particular interest. Must-have!
