This is a FANTASTIC film. Hana is a very old and very young heart. He knows how to live his life completely every day by connecting his friend, making his bow to almost everything, even his own death. Although her husband cannot cope with his "irresponsible" behavior, he also knows why he loves his man for almost half a century. I would like to spend with this old boy because he knows how to live and never die. He is cheerful, witty, mischievous and never boring. Vlastimil Brodsk√Ω played Haan perfectly when he was 79 years old. Every eye look and every move from aging muscles gives the audience so much character. This is a film that leaves a big smile on the face after that, and it makes me look a little closer in my life. Tomorrow I'll go and buy my mansion and enjoy the fun. If Hana can, do I. But I think I'll skip the smoking section.
