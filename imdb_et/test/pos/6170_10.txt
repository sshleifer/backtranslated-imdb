Ever since I grew up in Czechoslovakia, after World War II UK RAF pilots and crews, I was stories and tragic that ended in fighting or communist prisons and camps. This is undoubtedly more than a dark chapter in our history, although the fact that these brave men can go through it and get back later is amazing. For all the people who want to see a big movie ... it's one! At the last visit of the Czech Republic I saw this movie three times in three days (we play it for just three days ... otherwise I'll go see it a few more times! It's worth it!) I hope you enjoy it though it requires a little more thinking and knowledge behind the background, pretty much the same way as the movie "Kolya". It's not a simple movie because it's a deep story, and the way his talks make you cry ... it made me three times in a row ... Zdenek Sverak always made a great script, his son Jan made a great movie and cast? Undoubtedly they did a great job, I was surprised by Ondrej Vetchy, who played a big role in Oldrich Kaiser and all the other players who just GREAT !!! If this is not an Oscar candidate, I think I'm a strike in Holywood.
