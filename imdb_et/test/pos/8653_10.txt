Film is a great vision that is very thoughtful. I believe this is a film about how you would be like living in a catalog-created world. Scenes are all ideal for Ikea's catalog, which they even watch on TV sets. When they break into the kitchen, they break another perfect picture of how the kitchen looks like a catalog. When he is born or whatever you want to call it, he returns to a harsh reality. I love it a bit when he talks about his new love he has left with his partner. It's amusing to commercial bliss, saying you have it all and while it's nice to have the same things, but some things you don't want to share. A childless film about Say gives a perfect ten.
