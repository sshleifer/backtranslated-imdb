It is a brilliant and rich Czech film about Sverak's father and son's team, about two Czech pilots fleeing to England to help RAF in the British battle, but who also fall over the woman (beautiful Tara Fitzgerald). Includes some great and incredibly realistic anti-aerial scenes? probably the best and much better than Pearl Harbor or even the British battle - and many interesting general topics like love, war, romance, comrades, losses and servitudes. There are also challenges and misery of moving abroad and learning a foreign language (although it has become much easier for Anna Massey). The movie has some very small motifs, like the world-famous RAF bullseye. shown in a black vinyl record that was well reflected at one time and turned around (music is of course the second theme of the movie). Plus, all the traditional icons of English life: dimpled beer glasses (unlike post-war direct glasses used in Pearl Harbor), make a nice Chinese tea set in an English country garden (though shot in the Czech Republic?), Mascot dog, vintage bottle of HP sauce, even darts! <br /> <br /> Of course, the airport and its surroundings are ridiculously different from all the southern parts of England, although the virtuoso airflows offset this showing Eastbourne and the seven sisters, which are always synonymous with the battle between southern England and Britain. Best of all, Ondrej Soukup's sensational musical score is as good as Hans Zimmer's, but all of the later, superb Ron Goodwin tradition who threw the original British battle movie into other classic English war films. ???? probably ?? famous Czech musician and actor (and Kevin Kline lookalike) Oldrich Kaiser, who plays titles on the piano, Dark Blue Sky. Great! <br /> <br /> It also has some small but funny little Freud devices, like always when Karel (caller but brilliant Krystof Hadek) is in a dead end when his love rival and husband Frantisek (Ondrej Vetchy) is With Susan. <br /> <br /> Another great English actress in this movie! Charles Dance is, of course, good as Wing Commander Bentley. <br /> <br /> Very recommended and worth checking out / renting? Get the DVD with special features (things like how they made dog fighting and things). Probably the only movie that combines subtitles with English, German, French and Czech simultaneously.
