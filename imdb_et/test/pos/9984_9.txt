This movie broke me. I'm one of those people who just risk taking movies that I don't like at times, and I have to say that it paid off. I mean, Wow! Even my young boys enjoyed the movie (at 5 and 6), although I'm pretty sure it wasn't targeted at their age groups. <br /> <br /> This movie was also clean, which is a great plus. It's so nice to sit in the movie you enjoy thoroughly without torture, violence (except for one very short scene) or something that is probably morally disgusting. <br /> <br /> This movie brought you along so you can believe in a great show. It seems that a large number of emotions are depicted with signs. <br /> <br /> I've never thought that golf would be on the edge of my seat, but I couldn't be very interested in how it would work. I have nothing to compare with it because I have not been watching golf in reality or in the movie before, but all did a great job of keeping pace and emotion here. The score also did a miracle; Great, great score. <br /> <br /> Even if you don't think it's a movie, look at it. You may be pleasantly surprised. I certainly was.
