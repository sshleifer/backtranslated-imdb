Women love this movie better than men. Of course, women like all romantic comedies more than men - on average. I generally like romantic comedy, but I thought it was 5.5 in the first 50% of the movie and about 6.5 in the next 40% and around 9 in the last 10%. So, I appreciate it. 7. I recorded and kept all movies rated 7 or better, and none that is 6 or worse - at least that's my goal. I have over 1,200 movies, so why keep dogs. <br /> <br /> My wife loved this movie more than I did, although I'm not sure why. I'm a bigger Drew Barrymore fan when he is. <br /> <br /> The whole point of this movie was about a young woman who goes back to high school (secret) to write a story about high school experience today. He was in the middle of high school for the first time and must learn to cool down a second time. His journey toward coolness, as well as falling in love with his teacher, is a story. <br /> <br /> What brought me the nuts in the first half of the movie was how he looked. I was wondering why they chose him for that role until I realized how capable he was as a dog. So much so that I really don't think I want to see her in 15 years when she gets up in the morning. ARGH! Of course she finally became a pretty attractive (cute) woman and she became very popular. <br /> <br /> The end is about 9.9 on a very sweet scale, so you like it. Otherwise, it is not very memorable and easy to use.
