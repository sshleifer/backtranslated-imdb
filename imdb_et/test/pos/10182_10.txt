I got into this series as accurately as the sea swept me into my grip. Although it started slowly, I found that the realism of portraying a ship, the diversity of characters and a lively dialogue keeps me looking. The chief specialist was set to challenge, grow and change for this trip, and I wanted to be there. I was not disappointed. The series took you from humor to tragedy and all the same soul between the intermediate, often the same scene. There was a lot of emotional overlap, communication and expression - relentless and convincing. The movement of the ship increased the almost strange component for many scenes, making the characters bad and adding humor to the next. <br /> <br /> Edmund Talbot is a complex character that doesn't like to look often. We can know where the captain stands or Mr Prettiman, but they are the older men on their way. Talbot was young and arrogant, learning, experimenting, and experimenting. He struggled with other people and made mistakes like a real person, but he had a heart that could be touched with every hard-learned experience. I appreciate the excellent characterization; it is too rare in movies and television.
