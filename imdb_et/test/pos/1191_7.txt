I've seen this movie for a while, but finally I got a copy of it. Born too late to see "hair" in your modern environment, I've been familiar with the recordings of the UK and Broadway for years; and I saw it in the late 1980s, where it seemed a bit colorful but still fun. <br /> <br /> Movie. It falls on some songs (The Bed, My Conviction, Frank Mills) and cuts others (Walking in Space). But what is left is indeed very well presented. All singers and dancers are great and the main performers (especially Treat Williams as Berger, Beverley D'Angelo like Sheila, John Savage as Claude) are memorable. <br /> <br /> Hair can stay strong even on a film made ten years too late. It was no longer a time of peace, love and the Biba era, but a punk rock ... although watching this movie now, during the Iraqi problems, the new resonance is giving rise to the problems of Vietnam in the 1960s. /> <br /> Milos Forman, who also made Amadeus, did a good job. By its scale and sensation, it resembles Norman Jewison's "Jesus Christ Superstar", especially the joy of "Aquarius" scene and the "Easy to be hard" closeness. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie and this is the first time I have been truly representing a truly hedonistic music.
