He celebrates William Holden, a warrior who falls in love with the stunning Eurasian doctor Jessica Jones in the background of Hong Kong's stunning. Cinematography is great when they meet Hong Kong on a hill. The story is about racial tensions, societal frowning mixed relationships and extra marriage things. But what I love is the strong character of the heroine depicted by Jessica Jones, a Eurasian doctor, who remains humble and persistent in the altruistic mission and remains loyal to her love. Nevertheless, she gets her dismissal from the hospital with a married man who is high. One day William Holden is called to the Korean War he covers, and then it is a bad day when he learns of his death. The end, of course, is tragic, I cried when he went to his mountain. It was a very cute bad beloved love affair. It loses all the odds, the fact that he fired his job, how his wife does not give him a divorce, but their great love remained - they experienced great love despite that. Personally, I don't believe in extra-marital issues and I think he shouldn't have started when he was tied to someone else and he shouldn't have allowed it to happen, but despite being a really great movie. I think the hero overshadowed the hero. Jessica Jones is strange and gave excellent performance, although I thought it was strange that they didn't hire a real Asian actress or anyone with Asian blood. I agree with one review, Jessica Jones is sexually abusing when she sits on the ground and looks at William Holden calmly, but her eyes are coming to me right away. <br /> <br /> I think the biggest films were made before I was born, it seems that many Hollywood films are not in depth, they work very well and are totally dependent on tricks and difficult sex scenes. It's really one of the biggest badly-loved stories about movies.
