For those who still prefer movies that focus on human relationships, Birch Street must have a vision. <br /> <br /> Training your family, focusing on a landscape that is borderless for most filmmakers. He explores common but often unspeakable family dynamics and does so without using hyperbole or sensationality. In fact, the film is at first a deceptively low key. <br /> <br /> In addition to probing one family - and more widely - every family - Block has crowned a very specific period in recent history. I don't know if it was deliberate, but inevitable because of the archival content. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
