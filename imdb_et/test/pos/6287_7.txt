I've been through several Pauly Shore movies, but that's the only thing I liked. Of course, it helps much less irritate than usual, maybe even a little more pleasant. The rest do a good job, especially the undervalued Carla Gugino. The film itself is basically harmless and silly comedy, and while a few jokes are especially funny, the film is a lot of fun.
