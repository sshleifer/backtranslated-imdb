Over the years I have been very interested in the life of a teenager who left the world with such a deep and indelible mark. My charm is also born of the fear that it may happen again. <br /> <br /> And in the coming years, yes, I'm afraid it will happen around us and of course "it" would happen long before Anne. Of course, the so-called civilized society, on its own or on the innocent state / race / continent, can turn to citizens and murder citizens with cold blood for the most free excuses? I'll leave this question out there. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the documentary, the head of Adolf Hitler is published in the sense that one of the serious facts about Hitler, which was never mentioned, was that he was democratically elected and that all the atrocities that were committed were the result of a compliant disorder and a terrifying propaganda. , which played over and over again to the obedient population. <br /> <br /> One of the cruelties was Anne Frank, who saw Kenneth Brannagh do a great job in commenting and interviewing, she has this rare gift to minimize her personality, thus allowing subjects to speak for themselves <br /> <br /> Many new facts and people who have not been interviewed will be carried out in carefully conducted research that I will not go into because they add immeasurably to the reality and gut. /> <br /> Glenn Close reads the diary, and his choices in the voice are partly perfect, he brings naive and freshness to the role. <br /> <br /> Anne's old childhood friends are being questioned for a long time and her last days before death are well recorded and recognized with her lively and amazing personality. <br /> <br /> This must not be forgotten. A wonderful and respectful film rarely seen by Anne. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
