My wife and I saw this movie once in 1989 and enjoyed it so much. We wanted to see it again. It was so touching that I called it a tear. The mystery sent to Billings is not a mystery at all. Corners !! It seems that whenever He turned, something happened to him, all good, and I believe he scared George a bit, because he did not understand what He had received. It just shows that even people with a cold heart can be right. If only we could all treat each other with each other, the world would be a better place. By the day we have been looking for a copy of it, now I have a connection with it as soon as I can buy a copy, I will try to grab it.
