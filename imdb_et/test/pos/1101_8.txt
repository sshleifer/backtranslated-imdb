OK .... so after 15 minutes there is still no dialogue in the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie came with a soft bag from Down Under, Sharpie's encrypted information. I am a programmer at the North American Festival and MOD LOVE was sent to me by our manager as a potential starter who preceded the Moscow / Karlovy Vary interface. <br /> <br /> Straight I thought "this movie is not for us" (no dialogue after 15 minutes?), but I watched. Well, well. He built and built and built and participated in this film half way because, as you go to the zoo, you are at first reluctant, but by the time you reach the dangerous snakes, you are a dangerous movie, not at all much mortgaged at WolF Creek, but because it is so completely "other" in every sense of shape and form and it seems that it weaves a web that consists of all the fantasies of the most independent first-time helmets. - Gloomy weather, red neck intrigue, strange splicing, eerie music and a plot that is imperfect and basic, but which is one of Wier's "big Aussie films", ie cars based in Paris. But MODERN LOVE is not really a Aussie movie in the sense of Ocker-ishness and playful self-restraint that goes through many of the country's films. It works from the very beginning as a more horrible world. There are no cell phones, brands, i-shops, sparse urban environments / class angs - just a guy who is married to a good viewer, an old Volvo and a little boy (son) who has strange teeth and cartridges around. Oh, and it's placed in a strange sea area where people all look a little wrong. The music by Nick Matthews (2:37) and Tom Huzenroeder (ten channels) MOD LUV succeeds where many Aust. the films fail - that is, it stays without the "unrecognized" country from which it comes out. Instead, it enjoys a twisted but entertaining puzzle that the film itself can't solve - and here's the weak link ... what on earth does this movie "with Modern Love" ???? The last minutes of the movie give the answer or at least one tip ... and when I sat down and drank coffee and ate for my Hershey, all I can assume was that this movie's bead, Alex Frayne, is a lot of fun with this amusement. /
