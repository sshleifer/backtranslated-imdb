I can't say that this film deserves ten because I lie. I adored this movie when I saw it! It carries a unique bond of friendship between a teenager and a dolphin. Although it doesn't show the sweetness that Jesse and Willy had in Free Will, it offers an exciting movie that the whole family enjoys! If you love marine animals, or if you just love the perfect family picture, this movie will suit you! Flipper shows us how adorable the dolphin is, and they are playful and can just be pets if everyone has a large pool! I love whale and dolphin, so probably this movie works for me. I think the manufacturers should have chosen another shark instead of Hammerhead to improve the antagonistic part of the story. Maybe big white? FLIPPER is great! So look at it!
