Having seen only 200 Hong Kong films during my time, I have to say that this movie is one of my most popular favorites. Incorporating a plot (not surprising in any way, these days is rare for any film), but the chemistry of the two leading players is great. Top-level casting! And though often even the most serious HK films tend to insert quite a bit of humor between all the drama and action, often breaking a bit of mood, then jokes are considered fine and woven, even improving character relationships. The music is also very well done and the two main themes are very beautiful. With the release of the special edition of HK, they even cleaned the picture (the first edition was grainy) and the subtitles, even if the quality of the translation is still missing (something new). All in all, if you need to see a HK movie that isn't run by John Woo or if it has Chow Yun Fat, it should be at least your short list! Truly exciting and fun to watch!
