Mom must be one of the most uncomfortable films from time to time. It has an elderly lady whom you would like to have as your Nanny, who gets a nastja mother f *** ing monster that you would ever like to meet at night. <br /> <br /> This dinner eats babysitters by opening a young lady movie and becomes a simmer. When describing Moor, it seems like a mother! The description refers to the cross and the dead brain. <br /> <br /> Need for horror fans who have a stomach for it (if you've looked at the animation or brain dead, it's a swim on your boat) and is ready to shut it off temporarily for an hour ... Let the gore pour! ... 8/10
