It's like something I've never seen before. It was bursting me all the time, I don't think there was one scene that I didn't laugh at. It's about a girl from a southern country going to college to a big city. At school, he communicates with RA throughout the hall. If he realizes that he has no family to go to the Thanksgiving, he calls him to come home. Rabecca and her family and her serious boy are going to dinner and Becca understands what her boyfriend is ... Propose. He urges Cral to do something that stands and shouts something like this ... Sorry you're too late to ask Becca to marry me a couple of weeks ago and say yes. It all becomes chaos. Please look at this classic that is absolutely worth it ... I swear.
