Remember that it came out before the Gulf War I, which gave us Werner Herzog's "Lessons of Darkness". <br /> <br /> Le Dernier Combat is not a "Sci Fi". It is rather a judgment. I looked at it at least a dozen times. In fact, it is a suitable companion to Herzog's "Lessons of Darkness": "And at that time, men will try to die, but they will not find it because death flees from them." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, today may be in Iraq. But back to Le Dernier Combat, be sure to watch the movie in the last second. I wouldn't call it "surprise," but it's something you don't think if you just assume the end isn't more than what you've already seen.
