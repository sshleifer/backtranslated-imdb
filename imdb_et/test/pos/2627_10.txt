I've never forgotten this movie. All these years and it's been in my life. I've been looking for this movie in so many places and stores. If anyone ever reads and copies it, I'll pay you a copy or let me know where I found it. This is a movie that should be known as classic romance and also my favorite, somewhere in time. It was really great. If the right actors were around this film and given it the patience they needed to act, it could be a blocking buster. The love story is as powerful as it should be for all lovers. I remember being sad at the end and it was really a shock. I believe with all my heart that Johnny loved her and her. It was one amazing movie and it's a shame that it's not available to us. Please contact me at shawe49@aol.com - I want to thank a wonderful woman who replied to my message almost a year later. He had a copy of the film and was so kind to send it to me. He's a big fan of this movie, as I am. With her help, these DVDs have received 3 happy ladies. He is waiting for a book based on. I check on behalf of my local library, "Maitlands Affair, Margarett Lynn. I'm sure it's great. Thank you Julie for your gratitude and friendship. I'm always your friend / Sharon
