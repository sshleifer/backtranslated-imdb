Although not the best work of Hal Hartley (my personal favorite is "Surviving Desire"), this movie is still much more enjoyable, especially for fans of Hartley dialogues. Even for Hartley's new audience, I would definitely recommend this movie to the sophomore "Dogma". This film is more intelligent, more reliable on its source material (Bible) and more fun than any other millennial apocalypse. <br /> <br /> This movie is actually part of French. Alongside. (2000 Par Vu) series, this is perhaps even a budget with a smaller budget than Hartley's other works, although the need for simple scenes captured by a digital camera is understandable in this context, the main problem with this film is the blurry / nervous effect. not to use the movie again, especially at first it makes the movie almost invisible, but forget this mistake and you will be treated as a fine movie. Magdalena (played by PJ Harvey), explaining how Jesus saved him stoned, is a short scene I found (Despite the fact that it wasn't Mary Magdalene that it happened; the woman in the Bible was unnamed.) <br /> <br />
