An exciting, exciting and interesting movie that tells a story about some of the men in the Italian naval base and their adventures on the naval submarine during the First World War. Tommy and Brick (played by Robert Montgomery and Robert Young) have two bales and I have to say a few very beautiful officers. The new captain arrives on board a ship that is already familiar with a Dead Pan Toler (Walter Huston) and is a real stickler to comply with the rules and "code of honor". Soon, Tommy and Brick will be pursuing an official dancing with an attractive blonde, Tommy insults the captain - and of course the blonde is actually the captain's daughter. But Tommy wins anyway when he and his daughter slip out of the dance to the carnival on the street, and soon compete in an air strike - unfortunately, he's married. Later, Tommy goes into real trouble if he doesn't accept orders to save his friend. <br /> <br /> This movie is a lot of fun with a plot of land that will absorb my interest and all the top performances. The climatic death scene, with Sterling Holloway, is really strange - the most memorable scene in this movie. Eugene Palette and Jimmy Durante add some humor players here - Durante's character learns to deal with a dentist by mail order and constantly rides the land with a British man who makes the nose fun. Okay - if you are looking for a movie that shows the kangaroo boxing, it would be one.
