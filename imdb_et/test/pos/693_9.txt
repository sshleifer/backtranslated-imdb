The film made by a British manufacturing company during World War II does not, in my opinion, have an honorable last day. The closeness and closeness of so many things to Dawn We Dive: as the successor to Admiral Horatio Nelson and as a student of all aspects of World War II, especially in naval warfare, I am in favor of portraying sub-activities and activities in the North Atlantic, and especially those containing things from the German side. For those who do not know the target priorities, the attack on the enemy warship is the biggest event a submarine can count on, and such a rare opportunity is developing surprisingly like what we see here. Stimulation is deliberate and typical of the work coming out of the Ealing, Rank and British-Gaumont studios: frankly, I prefer my quieter, more brain approach to my humanity and to realism that works much better than any Hollywood film ever produced. It reminds me of Powell's and Pressburger's 49th parallel thanks to the powerful convincing Eric Portman, my favorite. John Mills gets a second billing and a smaller fund in the headlines, so it's probably meant for Mr. Portman's movie, but the whole cast shines. As for the title order, am I the only one who is the lovely pre-CGI Gainsborough Girl of Gainsborough Production?
