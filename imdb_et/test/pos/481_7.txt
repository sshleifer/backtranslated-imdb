If you would like to see some great Mikado action that is perfectly played by expert timing and panic, don't look at this version. If you want to see a hammy version of Eric Idle, a 1930 English gentleman's private club, that's what you look at. It's a fun and good intro for Gilbert and Sullivan, but then hurry up and rent a Canadian Stratford version. You see the difference between good and good. Nobody does G & Si better than Brian McDonald and Stratford Group.
