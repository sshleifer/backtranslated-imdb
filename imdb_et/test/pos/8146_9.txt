When I was told about this movie, I was not too happy to see it, although it ultimately turned out to be one of the best films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite graphic (male-male scenes, you don't see everything) wouldn't be a gay movie if it weren't ... <br /> <br /> with light humor and contains some very funny parts. I recommend this movie, about 3 quarters of what you really know with the main characters, and I think it will bring the whole flick together. <br /> <br /> Once again, very nicely assembled .. plus lovely Mormon.
