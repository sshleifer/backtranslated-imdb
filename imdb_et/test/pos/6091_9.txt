As read from many reviews, this is the movie you love or hate - probably not enough room for opinions. I think it's a good sign. <br /> <br /> I've always appreciated this movie, even though the genre is not my typical style (I never saw Titanic ever going and do it). <br /> <br /> The English patient's handle, as it shows how people can be different when they are in an exotic environment when they are "home" (Katherine), showing how destructive love can be slowly, strongly, and completely painfully, it excites the very passionate thing about what is going to retreat, how pointless it is to move on. Photography is simply stunning, not to mention the act of the actors. This pace is slow but timely and justifies the book, schedule, and depth / development of symbols. Within 110 minutes (as some seem here desirable), this film is multi-layered. People tend to get into the pace of movies ... as if they were hurrying to work. Hey - get life! ;-) enjoy ... <br /> <br /> I give this movie from 4.5 out of 5.
