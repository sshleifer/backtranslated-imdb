This movie, as my Chinese girlfriend told me, contains two well-known Hong Kong pop stars. While this can make the movie a mere marketing stunt, I found it workable and both are cute. <br /> <br /> The story is generally bad. However, vampire features and weaknesses are used humorously and some unique amusements are created. Quarreling between the two girls made me confused and it provided an excellent balance with well-done scenes to create a fun movie.
