In the thinking of the Soviet cinema, the masterpieces of Eisenstein's propaganda or Tarkovsky's lovely meditations come to mind. They are very good movies, but in general they are not the most entertaining materials. However, the Iron Curtain states apparently knew as much as their states of their escapist musicals. In fact, from the 1930s to the 70s, forty of these singing and dancing extravagans appeared to the public with much respect. But they are completely unknown in the West, so this documentary attempt to remedy this situation. This is a terrible job of presenting these films as well as their appropriate cultural context. Despite the fact that I have never been a fan of musicals, I found that this documentary is completely convincing from start to finish. This proves that no matter how many movies you can see during your life, you are limited to the whats that are there. <br /> <br /> As for the movie clips themselves, they are a lot of fun. While some musicals are blatant propaganda that shows that employees sing how much they love to work under the regime, some movies (especially later ones) look quite accomplished in terms of production. In addition, they are all extremely appalling because they are foreigners to my western eye. There are some similarities between these and the American musicals that I am used to, but enforcing a rigid government of the message gives them a surreal edge. They certainly do not resemble musicals made in the West. This documentary is one of the most bizarre and amusing films I've seen in the last memory, and its absolute must-see for every film buffer.
