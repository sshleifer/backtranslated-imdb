I just checked Norther's monastery from a local library and didn't expect much. Imagine my surprise in this Gothic habit! The Northanger Monastery is one of the most horrible places you have ever seen, with empty passages and beautiful spaces full of hidden secrets. The film's glory is that it never reflects: your imagination is free, runs into the imagination of the main game, one is Kathrine M. She is a wild imagination, a reader of gothic fantasy that she brings (and us) into the real world. <br /> <br /> If I used one word to describe this great movie, it would be surreal. Dreams woven across the film, enhancing the mood. Sometimes it is difficult to say what is real and what is not; I believe it is deliberate. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is the highest. Music is not what Jane Austen would expect from a movie: it is terrible, flute and drum-based, high and haunted to the bottom of fear. If a soft, pleasant tuning is played in the Norther Monastery, it would be a positive call. Now it's a predictable, gloomy and harsh palace of enemies. (But! Characters! You have to see them yourself!) <br /> <br /> If you are looking for the most enjoyable evening, don't look beyond the Northerer's monastery.
