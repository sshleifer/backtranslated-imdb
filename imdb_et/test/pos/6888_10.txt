I love the promised land. The first episode I saw was at a time when I was on my mission in 2003-2005. I really loved the rich family background that was shown at the show. Here was a family that had its own struggle, but not their establishment; they come to love others who have had the same problems, trying to forget and go to work. That's what made me show love. All participants; especially Gerald McRaney; had shown the true meaning of "family", which has left an indelible mark on my life. I've been on the same path they have, but it has taken a lot of time to develop this kind of character. I love this example so much that I wanted to share it with friends; but I was really stunned when I heard it was taken off the air. I thought and I think they should BACK! So many lives benefit from heaven-inspired media. I honestly believe that this exhibition was divinely inspired; because it brings the spirit every time I see only one episode. It really shows (in my book) the promised land. It is the love you keep in your heart with others; leading you to a higher destination. The spirit of love is one of the most powerful messages in this series, and all I can say is to bring it back. -Robert
