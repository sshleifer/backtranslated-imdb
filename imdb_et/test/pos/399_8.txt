Usually Anthony Mann made the West with "big boys" - James Stewart, Gary Cooper, Henry Fonda. . . A list of cowboy stars. But in this B + film, he dealt with something very different and he had a lot of success with what turned out to be a real Western. The main player, played by Victor Mature, is a trap / mountainman and usually in romantic films - Robert Redford by Jeremiah Johnson, a thing where the hero is not really a typical mountain man, but a pure heroic character who fetches true mountain men. Not here. Once upon a time, a real mountain man - vulgar, raw, natural - is something to see, giving Mature one of his best later roles. The real crust is provided by Robert Preston, a perfectly self-absorbing Custer cavalry commander and poor Spencer Tracy, James Whitmore, as one of the old timers who feel themselves among the increasingly hostile Indians of civilization. Even more impressive is the very young Anne Bancroft, the official's husband, who was originally repelled by Mature's harshly characteristic phenomenon, and finds the plywood of his civilization that slips away when he starts to realize that he is interested in his shock. Rarely, has a fortress in the distant been realized so precisely without the romantic warning that John Ford gave such a place in his masterful Fort Apache. Battle sequences are big and particularly violent and especially impressive when seen on a widescreen. A good exhibition and an underrated movie, everywhere.
