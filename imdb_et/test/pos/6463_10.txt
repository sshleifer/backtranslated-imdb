I'm crying a lot of movies. Call me sentimental. Call me one of those viewers who always likes a happy ending. This movie, though it's a sad ending, was great! All the actors I would like to have lunch would be Sidney Poitier. His actions with John Cassavetes and Jack Warden (12 Angry Men's fame) are stars. His character, who interacts with his friends with friends (Cassavetes) and helps him out in every possible way, is incredible. <br /> <br /> This is one of those forgotten knives made at the end of the Moose Age. It's well done, it's a great cast, a very talented actor, and a great movie art. It's a movie that's worth it again and again. I highly recommend it! This is another really great movie made by Poitier and to be sold on DVD. Although I cried, he bowed to such a great art!
