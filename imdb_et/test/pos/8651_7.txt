The man arrives in a strange, beautiful, sterile city, where no one knows emotional and obsesse instead of interior design. The remarkable similarity of his days resembles the "day of the earth"; the strange passages and memories of this world are more like "Being John Malkovich". But really, this is a Scandinavian film, a self-titled piece that is also a Scandinavian style: the tone is tough and even the most fantastic scenes are played straight, encouraging you to laugh at absurdity. In my opinion, this combination is not entirely successful: there are not enough genuine laughs to compensate for the difficulties that are required when a piece is a pure drama. This is definitely original; Perhaps my problem is that the world he is satirizing is not what I feel. Maybe I should go to Scandinavia!
