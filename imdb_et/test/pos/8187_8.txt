I enjoyed the movie very much, especially the exceptionally beautiful Gong Li as a competing man. <br /> <br /> It was a bit annoying, however, that the PLUS PLUS subtitles in the Chinese PLUS PLUS sounded fine, even though the voice was very synchronized. <br /> <br /> Qin shi huiang di (family's first emperor) surname was Zheng and his first name is Yiong in English so he should have been called "King Zheng" or "Emperor Zheng" and not "King Ying Zheng" because these days two family / first names were not used together. <br /> <br /> The state of Qin is pronounced "Chin" not "shin" - it is a pity that scientists did not get this right. <br /> <br /> I forgave it, but I was at the end when the commentary said he was buried in "Zai-an" in his terracotta warriors. The city of Xi'an is pronounced "see", never "Zai-an" - surely the American speakers would have received this right!
