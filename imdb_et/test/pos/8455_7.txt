All the right elements seemed here to make it a memorable thriller for years. You have a constellation - Michael Douglas is an atypical "free spirit" role that brought his film career a lot, Fonda played his typical female woman, and Jack Lemmon is sure to show us a crisis of confidence. Give them a hot button theme that is big business that is double, and it's encouraging for kickoff, but to get a life-imitating art so fast after that, the marketing man's dream is. <br /> <br /> The script is impressively tense, intelligent but lovingly keeps the jargon to a minimum and is a real feeling of the constant tension the director plays when our three main characters compete on the clock. If you like "felt", it is not as good as "Insider", but the whole thing is more nervous.
