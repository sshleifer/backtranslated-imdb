"What Alice Found" is the biggest movie ever heard! I underestimated it when I heard about it, and I do not think it would be a favor, it wouldn't be a plot and just really stupid, but it was really good. They say that all indie films are sucking, but this and "Napoleon's dynamite" do not wonder. I asked my friend who saw it before, and he said that Alice has all these three ways, and you can see all this nudity, but no, there are three ways I remember and a little nudity. The film had an idea, and it taught me that they didn't trust the hacker. I liked the fact that they finally got Alice's little dolphin Finally, on her way to Flordia. I suggest you see this movie.
