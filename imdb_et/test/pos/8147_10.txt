Frankly, I first watched this movie because I heard it had free movies, but when watching the movie, he just realized that there were still good and reasonable movies. Really, this is one of the most groomed and touching movies I've ever watched. I'm a teenage bisexual and the film told me about my assumptions - sex, religion, love, acceptance, etc. This gave me an idea of ​​how to deal with these issues with my own and other people around me, who I am. Cox really did the film, sprinkling it with warming lines and some sexuality. This made the film more interesting. Some people compare it to Brokeback Mountain, but I disagree. Brokeback Mountain has more drama, in recent days is balanced.
