Some critics are comparing the Chop Shop with the City of God and Pixote Theater. I've seen both these and the Chop Shop, and as in many cases, I don't feel the comparison is justified. God's City and Pixote certainly had a much bigger budget. The Chop Shop is a low-budget independent film about survival and hope, frustration, and continued life. One of the scenes is allegedly filmed during the US Open, and whether the filmmakers had incredible links or the scene was filmed at other times and US film footage was added. I say that because I live in the filming area of ​​this movie and the security is crazy when tennis games are running. It is also remarkable that the real names were the names of their characters in the movie. Back to the movie. This is an enjoyable story of survival. At the same time, it came to 7, because ... at times the actors acted very well. At other times, they just seemed to have their own line. If the actors were less competent (as they were, for example, the low budget "Big Dis"), I would have been more forgiving. But in many scenes, each of these actors gave an example. Other times they seemed bored. The director may be guilty here. I also had termination problems. This is one of those films that "just ends". Maybe Part 2? Definitely worth a DVD. I'm not talking about the story because this information is already available in IMDb.
