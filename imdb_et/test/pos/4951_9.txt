I like opening a movie when Colonel Ted Masters understands on his fighter radar that four enemy planes are approaching around 10am. The good news is that the film does not mention in the beginning that the Colonel, together with the Lieutenant Winged Fighter, was trying to escape the freedom of navigation of the East Medittera Sea, but also went a little bit behind the restricted airspace reserved for rogue Middle Eastern people when they fly soon. <br /> <br /> I also like all Colonel Graduate Radar readings, and the computer is showing aggressively as an enemy plane two American fighter planes participating in a violation of their airspace. This first bomb attack immediately reminds me of the famous fighter movie "Top Gun". Waxing the enemy bandits with a thirty millimeter round of enemy aircraft that hit the colonial jet engines and forced the plane to force him to throw it all reminds us of one thing. ... but one wrong move can let you down. The only problem in the movie was the "snake sequence" scene. It was a little too long. Yes, opening the movie was great when you saw the conflict ... which was a fighting fight. Only when one boy tells Doug Master that his father was fired after the Cessna planes landed on the ground, will force us back to the beginning of the conflict. I think the masters in the middle of the championship are cut off by the masters of the column who are pulled into the handcuffs in the middle of the Bilyad desert when they go to the detention center ... while the musical passage of the "snake" continues. The film doesn't do it ... if that were the case, the details of the conflict would have been smoother at this point. Still good otherwise. <br /> <br /> When the word became known, that Colonel Ted Master's trial for high betrayal (in violation of territorial air sovereignty) was over and he was sentenced to death in three days, Doug Masters decides to act. As the Air Force tried to save the man, Doug decided to pull his friends and Colonel Sinclair (played by Louis Gossett Jr.) to plan to save the Masters. At high risk of meeting the court and spending more than a year in the military career, he goes against the Air Force's policy and plans to save the masters without the consent of the US government. <br /> <br /> Doug and his friends get to the base in a number of classified areas to get a lot of things in the area where the Masters are supposed to be hanging up, and the surrounding area around Bilyad (which turns out to be a fake in the Middle East). One plan included firing firearms outside the dark space of the air force to get classified photos and care products on a fighter plane, battle base, intelligence, and all other military things around Bilyad. <br /> <br /> When everything was said and done, and Sinclair examined all the intelligence, he almost wanted this plan because Doug was too clever. Not only when they got two F-16 planes and tried to run dry in the burning area, so I realized what they were going to do abroad. I realized that shooting a Doug fighter and falling bombs is not good until he hears rock music. I remember when he fell on a horizontal target of a Mach 82 bomb, and the bomb was between 20 feet ... I realized that Doug was unusual. He loves music when he destroys ammunition. <br /> <br /> The final part of the conflict, the final battle against Iron Eagle, was better than the climax of Top Gun's hostile warfare sequences. I liked the last conflict, especially when Doug Masters was facing a Middle East aces fighter pilot who actually led a trial against the Ted Master. Short, but sweet, when Doug took out a side-rocket missile after the second attempt. It seems that this Bilyad Colonel was similar to "Darth Vader" in Star Wars ... in the air, he may be very bad, because when you've seen Star Wars, Darth Vader was actually Anakin Skywalker who was just a pilot in space. Unusual connotation to this, but still works!
