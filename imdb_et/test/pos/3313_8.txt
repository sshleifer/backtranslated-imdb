This 1959 soap opera film takes us to the life and love of three young female publishers as secretaries. It follows the same idea as THREE SALES FOUNTAINIS a few years ago. This is happening in New York, while MONIDES are held in Rome, Italy. Our three beauties are Hope Lange, first starring Suzy Parker and Diane Baker. Lange does it well and has a strong veteran, Joan Crawford. Suzy plays an obsessive woman who has a hard time losing her beau. It is hard to believe that someone can reject this beauty for some reason, but Louis Jourdan, his heart beats, just does. The same will take you back to Paul Neuman, who refuses to wear the beautiful Elizabth Taylor in HOT HOT TIN ROOF, isn't it? Diane Baker, the third girl in trouble, meets and meets Robert Evans before she became a producer and wife of Ali MacGraw, she's known. Hope's boy at home, played by newcomer Brett Halsey, allows him to marry. He will also meet with Stephen Boyd, who is in our hope. All three women have their drama in front of them. Crawford almost steals the movie. His presence and his usual strong bitchy self are fun to watch. Veteran actor Brian Aherne plays with the yen one of the bosses squeezing the back of his leading ladies. He's charming. Martha Hyer is also cast, who is wasted an ungrateful role that has never been studied. Too bad if I like this actor who never seems to be distinguishing his abilities. He's a broken husband at Donald Harron's office, with whom I was happy to work with a couple of Shakespeare in NYC. He is also a prominent actor that this movie is disappearing. <br /> <br /> All this is fun with Technicolor and cinemascope, directed by Jean Negulesco.
