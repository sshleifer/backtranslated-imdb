Man! I remember this exhibition with nostalgia ... I dug Bravestarri because he wasn't an ordinary hero. He was more than a futuristic Texas cowboy. The man was the strength of the bear, the vision of the walk, and ... ... I don't remember it. <br /> <br /> The sequences were great! I remember Bravestarr always using his bazooka called SARAJUANA (translated into Spanish) at any time when he was in great trouble. <br /> <br /> It was a quality comic. I loved those signs, dialogues, music, and of course opening times! Bravestarr! live for him. Classic class, in my opinion and must see.
