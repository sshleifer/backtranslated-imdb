** HERE IS SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Commemoration: Macleane (Miller) knows the robbery of Plunket (Carlyle) that goes wrong. The plunk partner gets off (and killed), but only after he has swallowed a large ruby. Plunkett and Macleane then meet in the cemetery when both try to get ruby. Unfortunately, they are caught as hatchlings and sent to prison, but not until the Plunket has swallowed the ruby. Ruby is the key to their freedom, and when they are free, they form a robbery partnership. Macleane must be a gentleman and find out who is worthy of robbery, and then they just rob him (and robbing him of style). But Macleane falls in love with her first victim's niece / daughter (?), Lady Rebecca Gibson (Tyler). And Mr Chance (Stott) is trying to catch them and his methods are not very nice ... <br /> <br /> Comments: Good action, tasted by comedy and adventure. Carlyle and Miller form a good team with lots of friction and friendship. And then there is a relationship between Macleane and Rebecca Gibson. The ball scene is very good, especially the use of music (anachronistic). In addition to these interesting characters, Cumming plays them all, Lord Rochester. Both the character and the actors are the stars and the best of the movie. All in all, the movie works very well, it's a good balance between story and special effects, action and comedy. Very fun. <br /> <br /> 8/10
