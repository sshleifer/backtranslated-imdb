I'm sure all the IMDb Canadians are very familiar with Canadian content and how much it is ... well, we say, weak. There are some some Canadian exhibitions that are actually worth watching, but this is definitely one of them. <br /> <br /> Simple assumption. Two men who raise the girls with certain instructions and rules in the bar, add a surprisingly pleasing self-proclaimed "Alpha Males" group to some smart and smart comments, and you have a very fun program. Every episode is strong. When "players" are the minimum parameters, there are some clumsy moments and they have some delicate jokes. When the "players" are good, it takes a moment that you just have to turn up and praise, and they have comical praise. <br /> <br /> The assumption is what I know, and I know a guy who is usually proud of being elevated to a regular, terrible reality television, I have much to admit that this show is actually funny and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> One thing to note is that Comedy Network has made this exhibition a terrible marketing. For a long time I didn't even know the assumption, and all I knew was that it was a somewhat shattered man who "loves the cougars". But after watching the show, I was surprised at how surprising the Canadian content was (despite the pretty flat opening credit sequence). So give it a chance. I have not yet found anyone in the targeted demographic (men aged 18-30) who have actually seen (not just annoying ads) who did not like it. <br /> <br /> Bring it back to the third season, Comedy Network. It's actually a good premise, unlike other Canadian exhibitions you've had (cough * girls are girls * cough). I usually book 10/10 works on "works of art", but I just have the fun to watch this show and I think many of me have judged what I just had.
