I have no idea why everyone hates this movie to call it a travesty, an unacceptable order that is just unfair. I really think it should have been a sequel (Rodney Dangerfield) says: hey everyone was ready and then little dance, and this is the end of Caddyshack, although the movie's first rating was (R) and the other was (PG), it was Still having fun. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
