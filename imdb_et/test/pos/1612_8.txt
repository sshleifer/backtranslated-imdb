Thomas Mann's controversial novel is the basis for the film "Death in Venice." Although the book has a hero author, the film is directed by director Luchino Visconti, who also wrote the script. As such, the author / composer, Gustav Von Aschebach (Dirk Bogarde), is an artist burnt on the edge of mental exhaustion. After a long and successful career, peace and peace are now looking for less passionate life. She decides to go on a vacation to Venice, where she hopes to rejuvenate her declining ambition. When she is in a picturesque seaside resort, she takes the attention of a beautiful young teenager, Tadzio (Björn Andrésen), who looks at her curiously interesting and immediately captures her. Although Gustav is admired by wonderful youngsters, he still has to find a private time in the boy's gang (Nora Ricci), while at the same time coping with an attack that seems to have been infested with the city. The film's dialogue, like the novel, remains fine, as well as a few short meetings between the boy and the artist. Finally. Audiences, unlike the book, are impeded by innocence and fancy imaginary flights. Their thing has never been given to wings, content, or opportunity, and if it were not for the book's short resolutions, it would only allow the film to be as if. Nonetheless, the hero's compassion can be desired and a moment of peace for him to get what is forbidden, difficult to understand, but criticized by stubborn eyes. Great Story and Bogarde Classic. ****
