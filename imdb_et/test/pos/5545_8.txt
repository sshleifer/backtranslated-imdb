It's a fun movie with a fine intention. His off-beat comedy is fun for me, my friends. Soundtrack is perfect. <br /> <br /> I own it on VHS and I've been watching it a lot of times because it's just a fun and funny love story that has great performances for all principals (though using only Joan Cusack as a big hair perch a waste of his talent, I know, I know he was still young ...). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I noticed that I was watching a DVD last night. (instead of watching my VHS tape) and it was SHOCKED to find many important scenes. And when I was copying what I watched, there was no special feature of the deleted scenes: it was like deleted scenes would never exist! I'm so glad I bought a used VHS flea market. <br /> <br /> It is clear that there was a lot of choreography in it, which is another reason I really love it. Scenes move to the scene with a great skill, talent and genius, such as Mercedes Ruehl, Dean Stockwell and Matthew Modine. Miami, Chicken Lickin Attack, Foot Massage, Salon Hair Lingerie.) This movie has a very "theatrical" feeling that can be so many people who have a bad overview: I know some viewers who don't understand this style perfectly, overdoing and overplaying bad performance and worse. Not so. Jonathan Demme is doing a great job of bringing the whole company and its roles to life. <br /> <br /> Opening credits and the first scene are also among my all-time favorites (second favorite opening credit / first scene: Fly Away Home). <br /> <br /> Too bad Matthew Modine missed the eye; I really like her and found her casting in PERFECT's role as Mike Smith. In fact, this film has gone well from the soup to the nuts: everyone is credible and real about his role. As for the question of waiting for the audience to accept Pfeiffer and Stockwell for Italians - why not? I thought they pulled it out very well. Charming, fun and exciting ... what doesn't you like there? If you want a little fun, check out this unique, colorful adventure-mob-love story.
