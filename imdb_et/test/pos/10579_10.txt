I love Sarah Waters' Fingersmith and worried about adjusting the TV because I was disappointed with the BBC version of Tipping the Velvet (which was nice to see what Keeley Hawes didn't allow to sing, and Rachael Stirling didn't act). Fingersmith is a very tightly drawn novel that breaths in and I thought it could be done just in 3 hours. <br /> <br /> I don't have to worry. Adaptation was great, very little cut and went along the crack (though I don't know if you didn't read the book, did you miss out on things?). It was the look and feel of the drama of the BBC's classic costume and I had to remind myself that this is a modern book. <br /> <br /> The actor was perfect. Sally Hawkins acted as Sue Trinder and slowly as Elaine Cassidyna, who at the end of the story was glowing like Maud Lilley. Love, passion, realization of the acts of betrayal would have had to be fulfilled by both. It was a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> I hope Rachael Stirling looked: this is how you play Sarah Waters character!
