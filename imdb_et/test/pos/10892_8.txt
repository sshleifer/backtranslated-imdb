There is a lot of "GoldenEye" near the packed and staged pace levels. When it came out, it was always the biggest game, and even today it remains strong. <br /> <br /> I admit that this game was boring after a few months of playing and not playing it again, until two years later, I was back to my biggest, almost as if I was playing it for the first time. <br /> <br /> There are 20 action packs that are probably the most about any James Bond game. Probably the most unforgettable Tank Tank, which was probably the most explosive video game sequence at that time. And shooting the first person and using Q-widgets is what James Bond fans always use. <br /> <br /> Frankly, as a fan of James Bond, I am looking for aspects of a real James Bond experience that are now displayed in PS2 games. So this game, even though it has some fun activities and gadgets to use, was somewhat more, even in 1997. Also, I didn't want Q or M or Moneypenny or any of the MI6 on this game. While watching movies, Bond interacts with these characters at least a few times each movie, but there is no way to see them in this game. And the vocal dialogue would have made the game more vivid than the text chat they used. They had the technology. They just didn't use it. <br /> <br /> Probably the most annoying feature of this game is that it somehow closely follows the story of the movie and other ways it is cohesive. For example, there are two different levels to protect or rescue Natalya, although she can take care of her in the film. There are also some unnecessary levels, such as the level of the boat, where you need to disarm some bombs (which are not in the movie) that don't tell the story at all. There are even some levels where you can rescue Natalia, but at the beginning of the next level he is caught again. How? <br /> <br /> Well. Even these little things can't really put this game down. And while I prefer newer games, this Bond experience is definitely one you won't forget. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
