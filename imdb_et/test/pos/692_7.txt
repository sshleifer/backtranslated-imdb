This is a great war-time warrior. John Mills leads the British B-film Stalwarts Fine Light when he puts a gender underwater attack on a fictitious enemy battleship. <br /> <br /> Filmed in black and white, it is well paced and well positioned, given that war was at that time. If that is something, it shows how seriously the authorities took positive propaganda. <br /> <br /> The mission-based part of the movie is on real submarines. Things are narrow and claustrophobic. The actors look suitably gloomy and sweaty without being too offensive to the heroic mouth. Other commentators have already drawn attention to authentic small details, such as forgetting the trim of the ship and reading the instruments, as well as the engine room activities. Dead German) The torpedo tube is blown to fool the enemy destroyer. And this is the only time I've seen part of the ship's contact with drowning - high-risk gaming than ever before. <br /> <br /> I am a little skeptical about whether this submarine can hit its wire through a cable. The underwater speed was barely twice as fast as the human walk and the net would have given much. The engineer was also at the same workstation and worked on the same currents both underground and under water. It also seems unbelievable because either diesel or electric motors were used and they were in different parts of the ship - or I was told. to my taste. But then it was a propaganda endeavor and it clearly contained a memorable message to the civilian population about their behavior, as it could damage the morale of the service and consequently the war effort. <br /> <br /> These giggles set aside, it's a fun little adventure. Nowadays, such vintage films tend to be reviewed in the afternoon, while many more modern and lower films can be enjoyed for the first time. But then; it is no longer politically correct to mention war in the presence of our European friends (too many of them have been convicted) or our own left-wing fascists (none of whom have ever won for the freedoms they now take for granted) <br /> <br /> very collectible. Better than the enemy below, I think it's less demonstrative. Not as authentic as "Das Boot" in any way, but not so gross.
