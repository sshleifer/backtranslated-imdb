The story doesn't tell at all, is it? Barnens ö, written almost like "booné aww", is the title of the endless novel of the 1970s that shocked many people, including myself. Raine Raine, the main character of the Guiness World Record Book as her Bible. And he wants to break new records himself. Especially the youngest person under water for three minutes. <br /> <br /> The story, like most of Sweden's timed movies and magazines, is deep, consciously provocative and awe-inspiring. Bergman started his latest movie and Cries and Whispers was barely out. The expectations of Swedish films were quite high. They taught us that a big theater, great actors, great writers and talented leaders made a true perfection team in the cinema. <br /> <br /> All this said, Barnens is a story of discovery. This is also the story of alienation: cities are alienating and living in one of them making us aliens for most of their inhabitants. It is a story of revelation and unexpected encounters with our own destiny. This is a movie of enormous hope and despair. Insulation and isolation layers and layers buried from the feelings of a world that doesn't care less ... <br /> <br /> This approach in itself is a rather complicated way of knowing a convincing convincing story. The masterful instruction by Kay Pollak about Ola Olson's PC Jersilds novel script makes it not only an opportunity but one of those cinema masterpieces. <br /> <br /> I can't agree with someone who said this job was all but forgotten. This is not. Even though I am writing this in 2009, a discussion about P C Jersild's story is taking place all over the world and the film is shown in many film schools and small theaters. <br /> <br /> Why? Waxing philosophy for everyone would be difficult and many have already done it through writing and lecturing. The reason why Barnens Ö was and IS is a special story is the cozy feeling you get from the beginning when you discover that everything is spoken in the eyes of a little child. And that's where it ends. Perhaps this is a clinical view, as someone else pointed out. But deeply disturbing, touching and satisfying. The concept is deep: as long as we do not have the hair of the pubic, we can still live one more day as an angel. Later, we get what Raine describes as a rosin of experience: "Men are pigs". He thinks he's afraid if he's fearless. He finds love when the world breaks around him. He discovers the reason not to behave like adults because he refrains from crimes. He made his inner purity and trust with others without reservation to find out how a man can be a soul. <br /> <br /> When love is awaited, he finds hatred. If compassion is needed, he finds a suspicion and a cold heart. This is a metaphor film. Think about the movie and raise questions that are hard to ask, but which is harder to answer. <br /> <br /> Finally, the satisfaction of witnessing such an excellent job (which really brought out all the other Swedish films) is a joy and hope. Remember, this is a movie full of the dark side of our nature. But sadly! The film's hope and deep joy. The Rhine remains the island of Stockholm, but it is a great hope to live today, even if we found our first signs of sexual maturity.
