This movie begins when it ends and ends when it starts. In the middle of the middle is comedy, philosophy, music, observations, comments, mini-stories, color and more. It looks at the world and our lives and tells the story of Monkees from the group's own perspective. He also watches television and film and makes a visual comment. It also shocked the scenes of war and shows how we are just big in the game. It says all this and more, but if you do not look at it objectively, you will not see more than scenes that are put together to connect music. This is a movie that can never be boring because it is so wise.
