River's Edge is a great movie and it's a shame that it hasn't been cinematic yet. In the eighties, many sharp films were made around school students, but all those I've seen; it is certainly the most nihilistic and disturbing. The film has a narrative that interferes independently and adds to the theme of teen sliders and their unnatural attitude to things that take the story to the second level. The film works because the central story is interesting and is played by complex characters. The film begins with a murder. Then we follow the murderer, nicknamed John, when he goes back to school and tells all his friends what he's done. Instead of giving the expected response, most of them do not respond almost at all, and the strongest response a murderer gets is from Layne; who makes his first priority to help John get rid of his confusion and get out of it. The rest of the friends are accusing the crime and one of them goes to the police for a long time ... <br /> <br /> River's Edge has a large number of performances by its youth. Keanu Reeves has a good and good cause for wood; but he fits very well with this early role and this performance is just one of his best. Crispin Glover is the biggest challenge for a little insane Layne. Glover always stands out in all the movies she has turned on, and while she is moving up slightly; he also persuades the leadership of this film. Reeves and Glover will receive good support from the talented youth cast, which includes Daniel Roebuck and Joshua John Miller, as well as the great Dennis Hopper for another wild role. The film has a very sharp image that gives a good overview of the nihi tone. The central characters are all descended from the generation and the way they really do not care about the murder of their friend is more shocking than the murder itself; and the idea that the film tries to do in modern society is both strong and well defined. The film is also somewhat funny due to some character lines; but humor is dark black and this film was never meant for comedy. In general, this is a great and memorable film that is definitely worth it!
