Fascinating and still impressive early Talkie Western Pioneer Days; other modern films include covered WAGON (1923), IRONHORSE (1924) and CIMARRON (1931)? none of which I have watched, although I have the last VHS. It was filmed at the same time as the "standard" full-screen ratio and in the experimental wide screen process called "Grandeur", but only the first have appeared on the bare bones Fox DVD; can only assume how it would look in a broader sense but careful design? not to mention excellent cinematography? This is obvious even in the "Standard" version. <br /> <br /> Young John Wayne is surprisingly in the lead (a role that, however, did not lead to the expected start-up? B-West in the next decade, before John Ford came to rescue with STAGECOACH [1939]!); anyway, he and Marguerite Churchill (DRACULA DAUGHTER [1936]) make a nice pair? despite its somewhat annoying character. Supporting characters include a variety of stock types: veteran western, comic-embossed sidekick (tendency to make a noise with your mouth!), Brash and rude jaundice (played by Tyrone Power Srl!), His two mucus cohorts (Mexican Southerner, who also performs Wayne contestant For Churchill) etc. There is also a terrible Swede among the members of the wagon bunk (full of optimism about the permissible land, but who has constantly set aside his naughty mother) and later Wayne's usual Ward Bond. <br /> <br /> Episodic narrative solves several alternating hornballs, lyrical and action-packed vignettes? when we see future settlers fighting against elements, Indians and themselves; the film, however, has a completely authentic feeling that smoothes out its essentially dated and static quality. Also, the editing is somewhat negligible (especially on the second side)? No wonder, because the DVD edition of the movie is just 108 minutes for the 158-minute Grandeur version!
