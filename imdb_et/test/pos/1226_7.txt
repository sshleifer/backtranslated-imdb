This movie is about six men who have been allocated money from banks to businesses. Ty Hackett (Columbus Short) was in war in Iraq, serving his country, and now he is just living with his friend Mike Cochrone (Matt Dillon), ensuring he doesn't loose his house. Mike tells him it wasn't the life his parents were expecting from him, and he should live a better life than he is now with his brother Jimmy Hackett (Andre Kinney). Talking to Tile that he and Jimmy have always been with her family and would do something to help them out, says Mike Ty on a plan to make them. Money would also be shared six times among the other transporters at around 43 million, though Ty doesn't like the idea he tells his friend Mike if no one gets to him. Last night Ty had to talk to the lady of well-being in the care of her brother, giving her the dilemma of losing her most important life. Although the plan sounds safe first, greed is not all that comes to life. <br /> <br /> If you talk about the thrust, either you or yours, so if you don't go together, plan to play your hero and finish the greedy people when it comes to big sums of money. This movie has a star carved star that keeps you interested in Jean Reno, Laurence Fishburne, Amaury Nolasco, Fred Ward, Skeet Ulrich and Milo Ventimiglia. Short I remembered her recently only "Stomp Yard", which was about a boy who lost his brother and lives in his dream college to go. This was probably one of his best films I've seen him, and what he fits well with the character is nice to see on the big screen again.
