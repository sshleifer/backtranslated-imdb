This is such a beautiful movie! It is not only war, but also friendship and love. Slama's life is full of sadness, every aspect of his life has collapsed. I can only imagine how he would feel when his friend made a final sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I can see a little bit of similarity to "Pearl Harbor", which is also about two pilots who love the same woman. But this film is much better because it does not make a woman unfaithful and simple. Friendship between two men is also more convincing and well-built. I definitely recommend this movie to all people.
