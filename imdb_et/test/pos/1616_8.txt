I bought this DVD from Walmart cheap, thinking it would be a typical, nonsense direct-video monster junk, but it turned out to be much better than expected. There's no criticism about it ... it's obviously a small budget, but it just adds the old-fashioned fun to the cheese. It is very cool and entertaining. <br /> <br /> There's everything: horror, sex, big plane crash and good signs. And I would say it's pretty original, cuz it doesn't really come like any other movie I've seen. It has its own unique look that I really liked, which is why this film deserves credit. I am looking forward to seeing these great movies The Scare Master, Brett Piper, whom I have never heard before. <br /> <br /> The DVD menu is really creative when it plays over it. , so it's perfect only to hold it if you're not ready to sit and watch it. It also includes some special features that are really interesting. But we can never see the director or listen to him in the commentary, be shy. It comes out of the Edgewood studio in Vermont, USA. I highly recommend it to all horrorists, love it!
