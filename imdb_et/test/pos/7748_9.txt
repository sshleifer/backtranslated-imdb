I thought this movie was pretty good. It was in TCM (Turner Classic Films) for three days one night and its amazing humor kept me fifth. Kelly plays a beautiful role in this role, especially with her grandmother (whose fool almost laughs at me from my seat). The main actor was fine, but his father was able to keep his character isolated from the marriage conflict and kept humor. If you like a good competition, an older film would recommend it. Unlike other comments, I like Gene Kelly. He was a leading actor for many early musicals, and I think he plays his charisma in this role. One drawback is that the dance scenes get a little longer, but when you get through, you are clear.
