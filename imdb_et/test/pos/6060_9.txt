Jack Webb is a rivet as a marine drill in D.I. Webb plays Sgt.Jim Moore, a difficult but fair Marine, whose job is to prepare young teenagers for a possible fight. No one could play this role better than Jack Webb. Like former Marine, I can assure you that this is the most accurate film that Corp. deals with. basic training. Extremely Fun!
