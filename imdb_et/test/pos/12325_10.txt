I've been watching thousands of movies in my life and I believe this movie is the most "perfect" movie ever made. Perfectly, I mean storytelling, plot, actor, production, camera work, etc. (This is a definite opinion; I have no background in film production.) Many films have perfect scenes, such as a bartender reporting to a police officer in the movie Fargo. (Indeed, this scene can be played in a short time.) The Dead makes every scene perfect by making the whole movie perfect. Perhaps John Huston sold his soul to the devil for making such a movie. Hopefully, Daniel Webster has come out of the contract!
