One of the most intriguing aspects of this historical drama is how the "Tories" or British American Loyalists are portrayed, and the kind of luster that is given to their passionate support for King George III. The American Revolution was certainly a family affair in many ways, because some of the richest colonial families were divided. If this film has strong criticism, it is that the people in this story have been developed a little more beautiful than they were in real life. <br /> <br /> The action of Major Boulton, played by Cornel Wilde, makes him the least pleasing member and foul story. It seems that he varies from being a stubborn patriot to some sort of "cause". This film largely focuses on the concept of personal glory and personal prestige, which was a great social norm that day and age. <br /> <br /> The subtext is that about twenty-five percent of the colonial population was decisively British. However, the strength of the Tory element is not obviously spoiled, although the good physician's character is about eighty-five percent of the top class twit (to steal the fine phrase Monty Python's driving circus). Anne Francis does a lot of the script quite thin and it stands out. He was a good choice for a woman of shared loyalty, the "gal" who was more modern than the social conventions of that day, had there been no struggle for life and death. <br /> One good aspect of a movie is how rivalry of American revolutionary leaders degenerated into direct jealousy, and how these personal conflicts almost sabotaged the whole revolutionary effort. All in all, the leading characters are very well drawn, juvenile characters are not just human "props", and combat scenes are sufficiently credible to bring about dramatic action. <br /> <br /> This is a great spy movie. This is not a big historical drama, but it does well enough. It determines seven largely because Cornel Wilde has been so deep in his role and doing so well, and Anne Francis uses his support efforts the best. <br /> <br /> The color print used in Turner's classic films was also very clear, and so was a pleasant presentation in this important part. <br /> <br /> I hope it will come back soon.
