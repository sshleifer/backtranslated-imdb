Eric Bogosian gives such a great result if you ever see Oliver Stone on the film. His Barry character is a rifle of assault that is hidden as a man and blows out someone, the air or the one that offends him. Adapted from Bogosia's performance, "Talk Radio" is a witch and frightening race that won't let you out until it's too late. By this time, you are familiar with racists, rapists, paranoids, wannabe assassins, and mere janitors who listen, speak and lurk at Dallas night. Stone behaves when it is even possible, allowing Bogosian to dominate each scene, ranging from the humble foundations of Barry to the mark or break when his radio broadcast reaches the national syndicate. The rest of the cast is evenly excellent as lovers and / or co-workers who Barry shared and throws away. <br /> <br /> The only thing I would change is the recurring theme music, "Bad to The Bone." I would have used Bachman-Turner Overdrive for "Not Frag". The better song I haven't heard in the movie so far and riding, relentless tuning, with a malicious riff like a real soundtrack to Barry's life. Listen, if you dare!
