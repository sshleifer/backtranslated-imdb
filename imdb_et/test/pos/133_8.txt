SPOILER ALERT! Don't read on if you're not ready for some spoilers. <br /> <br /> I think this film had a lot under its shell. In addition to the obvious links with "Oldboy" (and Park-wook with other films), I was bothered by this bleeding, but also by the subtle erotic theme that hung around for vampire and physical activity. <br /> <br /> The main actor, Kang-ho Song, is terrible in the priest's Sang-hyone group - by chance, "song" means "blood" in a language that really loved Tae-jui played by OK-bin Kim. Their relationship reminds me a lot about Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek in "Badlands", where the girl appears psychopathic and the man is basically surrounded by her finger. <br /> <br /> Their relationship is one thing, but the girl's mother is completely different. In the joints he is rigid, one-dimensional and tense, but paralyzed, he says he is not moving, or through the eyes. <br /> <br /> Park-wook has really learned its cinematic artwork, and it owes much to Stanley Kubrick; the whole movie has a whole host of beautiful shots, some for simple effects, and some that require multiple pictures and probably repetitive views to catch up. its main monoreaction; it is very good that the character is the same as he is. Although he does very little and loses, he seems to be a person who thinks a lot. Though his love interests say and do much, his activities are very little thought. In my humble opinion. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is a very disturbing film that is not intended for activities that are not even the same dimension as most of the things these days are about vampires; it is great and at the same time repellant.
