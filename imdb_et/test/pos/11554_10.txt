Pola X is a beautiful adaptation of Herman Melville 'Pierre; or, ambiguities. The remarks made here surprise me, it makes me think that has led to an overwhelmingly negative reaction. <br /> <br /> The shock is the least attractive to this movie - a small detail that is blown proportionally. The story is about the collapse of Pierre and the ensuing destruction that is publicly demonstrated in his qualities, behavior, and idol. Dialogue and soundtrack set this movie any other thing I've seen, and basically convert the traditional story into an incredibly emotional epic with contradictory twists. <br /> <br /> I can't stress enough how important it is to leave everything you heard about this movie and watching, as I did, openly. I hope you will be rewarded like me. I felt half-an-hour and nervous, but the film is far from scary in any traditional sense. It leaves you with 1000 thoughts, each of them cumbersome and exciting at once. I know I'm here, but I feel the need to make up for the negative perception of this movie. That's the best I've seen during the year.
