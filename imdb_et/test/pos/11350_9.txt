Two people living in the same apartment complex find their partner relationships. As they try and put together, how did it happen, do they also start an emotional journey that hurts the resolution? <br /> <br /> Wong Kar Wai gives us his successful success with Happy Together and Chungking Express. a rather old-fashioned and wonderful story of revived passions, longing and unorganized love. <br /> <br /> It is possible that the mood in love is not for everyone's taste. It goes quite lazy to 98mins: not very long for a movie, but it looks longer because it doesn't happen much. However, this lazy feeling hides a rather tightly built movie. Most of the stories are cleverly woven lines of feature films, where the characters work between the expected scenarios between their spouses, trying to find out how things started. I say cunning because it naturally makes it difficult for the audience (and characters) to say what is "role" and what is genuine. <br /> <br /> If all this sounds rather funny and self-conscious, it's because it is. Unashamedly so. And it is perfectly played by two of the best in Hong Kong, Maggie Cheung and Leung Chui Wai, with excellent support from Ping Lam Siu and Rebecca Pan. <br /> <br /> This is also a virtual performance by Wong Kar Wai, who treats the audience with sensory and sensual overload. The sending of Christopher Doyle (later his lush, too mature style to Hero) and Pin Bing Lee (whose beautiful undervalued style is seen in the small town in the spring) was a cinematic genius. It has all of Doyle's bold beauty, frankly, that his work with Hero is an Athena poster. Music, as always with Wong, is outstanding. From Nat King Cole, who sings in Spanish, to the haunting strings of the main theme, it fits perfectly into the eclectic beauty of images. All in all, the top film is rated by plot, actors, cinematography or soundtrack. Like Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire, it's a beautiful, old-fashioned story of love lost and restored. <br /> <br /> And look at Tony Leung's hotel room 2046, which introduced Wong's recent film with the same name.
