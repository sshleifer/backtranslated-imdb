This film was impressively impressed. This is one of the best sports movies I've seen. The images in this film are outstanding. I love the sequences in which the camera follows the ball when it flies through the air or on a cup. The film is moving well, offering both excitement and drama. The film was fantastic. <br /> <br /> Good performances are great. I was surprised by the young Shia LaBeouf. He performs this role well. Stephen Dillane is also a good Harry Vardon tribe. Peter Firth, Justin Ashforth and Elias Koteas offer strong support. The film is captivating and entertaining, and for the first time in my life I have been watching a golf tournament.
