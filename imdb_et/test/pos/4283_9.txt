How can the earth give this film a low rating. Unbelievable. The performances of Wilkinson and Watson are so great that I can only imagine that these detectors were weaned by attackers and porn. (If it sounds bad, just because I just wiped my original 400-seat immediately), I was so impressed by Tom Wilkinson. It's all a guy. This is the presentation of remarkable fineness and massive skill. His development as a Montreal actor in this masterpiece is amazing; one of the best things that have happened in the past ten years when making a movie. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson has somewhat less commanded, because her eye brightness says "you see me?" this funny woman, here? You can't guess what I'm going to do because I don't know it! 'He seems to be something he can't show us in every role, but he's a terrible ability and presence. She's very sexy here, as she has to be, and she's got a fair game for her: it's the quality of the screen that isn't usually for me in previous movies. <br /> <br /> As you might expect, Rupert Everett is bound to play upper-class late-30s that could teach Phd-level, not to hit the hell on a trend for complete selfishness. She's so thin here, worry about the whole movie. Linda Bassett's housekeeper is also great: a small role, but with a large plot of twists, he gives you the thought of how much talent we have in Britain in terms of behavior. I want to see her more. <br /> <br /> The narrative arc is good; it is a lot of interesting plot, because no one seems to be trying to convince Joe Public that there is nothing new under the sun, even though it rejects the 40th melodrama in the last "roll". But do not forget that this is an 80-minute value for someone with half-brain money. Congratulations to Julian Fellowes for the efforts of his first leader: o How we need more such movies. He shows a lot of skill in adjusting the original novel, telling the story a lot about efficiency and fine. Also congratulations on the immense display of art by actor Tom Wilkinson. What a geezer is. <br /> <br /> T.
