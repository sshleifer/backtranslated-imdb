This is one of the best films made for 80 punk scenes. I saw it a "bootleg" copy a few years ago and was surprised. Very few toddlers know the true root of punk and this film shows some of the 80's punk legends like The Germs and shows how it was. Nowadays, so many punk are widespread with MTV and radio, and it's good to see the real underground rebel movement of the original scene. Darby Crash (The Germs) is one of my heros and this movie shows why. Must See All "Punk" And Someone Curious About The 80's Punk Scene
