Wow! Fantastic movie in my opinion did not expect this good! I was fascinated from the beginning to the end - this is a very well done and educating film that really gives us an exciting overview of the trials Darwin had to go through to convey his ideas to the world, crowning his life when he writes: "Types"; He also struggles with his mind, body, and soul, because personal things reach the breaking point and even his family seem to slip ... while the rest of the world stands against him because he knows that his findings shake the word literally the basis of life, culture and meaning. This is a subtle film (not exaggerated in this typical Hollywood, a British film produced by the BBC), but fortunately it makes sense and thanks to the amazing well-directed scene and excellent Bettany action. Connelly acts more as a light-supporting role, but I enjoyed it and she is as good as expected, as always, ia was definitely strong and loving with her husband, you could feel the connection and their real husband / wife bond definitely looks through these shows. The star of the show is definitely Bettany and she does a great job, very good performance - I realized and understood her compassion because she fought for her own humiliating health and was "madness" to try to understand what she has discovered and what it really means and he thought that his thinking was in contradiction with his feelings, and found that he would lose everything, including his wife, who of course believed in faith and a confident Christian when he was in the field of science; two worlds that did not see the eye, so their relationship was at stake. <br /> <br /> Anyway - a really good, well-functioning emotional drama and I dare say that during the tragic peak I have a tear that was truly heartbreaking and beautifully horrible and moving. The film is also symbolic and very intellectually artistic, in fact I can't wait to see it again, because for the first time, what I wanted was a lot to do. Just one of the best films I've seen this year.
