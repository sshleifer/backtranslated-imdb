An absorbing study of virtual reality, though it is not clear how much the director himself intended. This film will deliberately take you through several layers of artificial reality, leaving only subtle clues as to what layer of virtual reality you are, creating an ontological confusion for the viewer to contemplate. <br /> <br /> It can also be seen as a satire of video games - however, the whole film may fall into the misleading form of imitation. He seems to be unable to access the genre of video games he imitates; so satire becomes problematic. <br /> <br /> Several interesting ideas, however, crossed: the biological mutant is one; technology and biology interface, kyborg's desire to overcome reality and philosophical hints such as the title of Heidegger with existential issues: ie, game marks are partially scripted or assigned and partly free to change their destiny and they do not know how strange this game is. One sign then points out that this existential confusion is like a real life, thus erasing the distinction between virtual and real. Like the observation that it is unpleasant to stumble in a world where you do not know what will happen, and you are not sure how to play, because you have to stumble to find out the purpose and unknown rules. The virtual game in the game is called "TranscendenZ". There is also criticism of how virtual violence makes it impossible for us to experience the consequences of true violence. Even the heroes of every level of ontological existence are confused about violence. They don't like it, but it's an exciting and part of the game that fears it is real. <br /> <br /> The creator of the game, the god of the system, will end; but this scenario is played directly in parallel with the video game we just saw - and spectators believe it is still part of virtual reality. Finally, the film does not resolve the doubt as to whether it is "real", but the point is clear (anyway). Existenz means Da-wall: You are there. You are thrown into the rules and secrets at every level. Ontologically, virtual reality brings reality to reality. And its common game motives, like the royal path of unconsciousness, are our own charm of violence. <br /> <br /> While Cronenberg confirms these philosophical clues in a movie interview, he claims he is very much against the "reality ... {underground name of a terrorist group}, which is depicted in the film both in the game and in the" real ". level. " It seems that Cronenberg himself did not think much about this film, although his impressive education is over. The interview at Cineaste gives the impression that the mid-intellectual who is trying to be an avant-garde is inclined. Cronenberg is just on the side of free imagination - the cliché modernist credo of the cliché - despite the ambivalence recognized there. (My impression can be here because of a limited interview.) However, it seems that Cronenburg ignores the point that his film is a testimony to the misleading form of the imitating form (here simulating computer games by making satirical criticism, but criticism that cannot "cross" the same form) ) probably because he really thinks it is "imaginative" and radical. But the imaginary world of the film is less tolerable and more jealous than our own real world. It stays trapped in the computer game worldview.
