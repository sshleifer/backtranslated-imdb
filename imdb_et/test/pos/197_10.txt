This film received a special prize from Cannes for this action and it is not hard to see why. (Some spoilers - but at the end you have to watch the movie!) A simple story - In Moscow on the eve of the Russian-German War In World War II Veronika (Tatiana Samoilova) is in love with Boris (Aleksei Batalov), but they have a spat when she learns she's involved in the military. Boris leaves before Veronika tells him he loves him. Boris strikes, but his final destiny remains unknown to Veronica or his family. Mark, Boris' cousin, rape Veronica, who feels obliged to marry. The scary Mark, Veronika, was broken and humbled the hope that Boris would return one day. Excellent camera work and excellent works by director Kalatozov. (For anyone interested in film technology, Kalatozov's second film "I AM CUBA" has at least two excellent sets, one of which is a long tracking process that begins with a funeral on the streets of Havana, raises two stories at the cigar factory, follows windows and follows the procession along a long, long road - Everything without cut.) Great action, especially Samoilova and Vasili Merkuryev (Uncle Boris), which is more disgraceful than it is too little. Destructively romantic film with a play that stops the heart of Samoilova. (This movie is often associated with the ballad of another Russian classic soldier.)
