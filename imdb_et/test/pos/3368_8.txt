I wasn't sure what to expect from The BOX. I'm a big fan of Darko, but I also saw the confusion that got from Southland Tales, be it a studio botch up who knows. I was pleasantly surprised with the box. It was a setback for the classic sci-fi paranoia film, which hints at much larger deviating events, but focuses on the basis of an intimate character. the whole movie. Any change at such a pace would have led to a typical Hollywood or "MTV" style that simply would not have served this story correctly. Everything from strange views / acting attachments to full, lower score scores, to a minimal explanation of what exactly happened, added all purposeful fear and shrinking hope to our greedy, though well-meaning. It was something well thought out and Richard Kelly's initiative from the first activity to the end. The brief introduction of Richard Matheson, which was based on this, not the Twilight Zone ep, which was another story, was the morality and greed that was still the central element of THE BOX. Being only about 8 pg long, its extension to the substance-containing function would not have been an easy task, but it was done with style, originality, and leaves the viewer with longer thoughts on the film. Many of them have and have a comparison with DARKO about whether it is so deep, but I found that it is a completely different film, thematically and emotionally. It is completely different, as are the messages and intentions of this film. When Darko kept us inside the questions, BOX leaves more questions to the viewer, involving the world around us. Would the knowledge of human nature be the end of the BOX experiment? Decent action, a big horrible vision and an intimidating atmosphere add to slow cooling. It is not for everyone, but for those who get where it comes from.
