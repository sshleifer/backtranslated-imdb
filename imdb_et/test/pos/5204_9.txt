I recently saw this movie in the hope of seeing the busiest battles of the 20th century. I got what I had been waiting for and more. Just think I came out of luck with this movie before I ever heard it. This is a German film made in 1993, so I think I can't be surprised that it is almost unknown to today's American audience. It is a shame that it is indeed a remarkable film, I dare say it is as good as not better than Plato, Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse and all quiet on the west side; all are iconic war movies. 1942: World War II is in full swing. Nazi Germany has crossed Europe and parts of North Africa, and Adolf Hitler is organizing a total invasion of the Soviet Union. A fatal step, which ultimately makes the Nazis defeat Germany. In the early stages, the invasion goes well and the German army conquers much of the Soviet territory, but the critical battle takes place in Stalingrad, a city with great symbolic and strategic value. The battle will soon become a blood bath of epic proportions, a battle for both German and Russian soldiers. On the brink of pulling the city, the Germans are suddenly counter-attacking by the Russians, who finally end up in the entire German 6th Army in Stalingrad. The winter in Russia is getting worse, causing the Germans incredible suffering. This whole battle is seen by some young German soldiers fighting for survival, not only for Russians and harsh winter conditions, but also for their own sadistic officers who only care about medals and honors, and generals who have neglected the average foot soldier. <br /> <br /> This movie will haunt me for a while. The German soldiers who focus on the film are both young and naive, their humanity and peace of mind are removed and you really feel for them that their non-demonic Nazis are often depicted on film. Everything they fought is no longer important, and everything they believed was broken and after fighting the devastating battle against the Russians in Stalingrad we see them even more when the winter begins, causing many to die. Battle & Winter scenes were like a terrible nightmare, but it seemed so real. It's amazing, at first we see the fascination of young men at the beginning of their lives, and finally they are the crusts of the former celebs, all of which have been taken away. After they saw so many killings, they had just lost their will to live, it was really sad. When, finally, the moment of hope, when Hitler betrayed them, who eventually give up those men's terrifying deaths, which is just one of Hitler's crimes, who give up men who fought for him to kill the Russians. A good anti-war film depicts the horror of war and this is what the film does. The fight for the tractor factory sequence The closest thing that goes to the earth in hell, but that's really what the battle against Stalingrad was. German and Russian soldiers were depicted with humanity, but bad apples (especially on the German side) were executed by men. The bottom line of this film is the amazing reason why we see how men physically and emotionally disintegrate during the war. We all have borders and these men were pushed beyond our borders in the most deadly battle of our time. What Stalingrad's average infantry suffered was an imagination outside. Even if they had all seen and done, they would have scared life. <br /> <br /> Stalingrad shows us why war is hell and what exactly looks like hell.
