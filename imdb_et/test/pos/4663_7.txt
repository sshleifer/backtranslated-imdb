** Warning! Lightweight Plot Spoilers Ahead! ** <br /> <br /> "Italian Work" is not the best movie you see all year round or probably even this summer. But it is worth two hours, because it paints inside the lines, knowing its boundaries and not trying to cross them. <br /> <br /> What a movie is wearing is cast. People need to have a good relationship with each other about a film of thieves. Without this unified feeling, the audience does not believe collectively or individually, and the film never has the chance. But the first scenes where men are joking and dressing up each other in the invasion of the Venice Castle have the right chemistry. They are your main criminals, containing about half a dozen players, each with a specific skill. But every actor brings the right goods to the table. Mark Wahlberg's undervalued actor and humor fit well with his role as the main planner. Edward Norton offers his mustache well in his dark role. Donald Sutherland is a teammate figure and he looks at some of the old and old-fashioned early, who are still mentally spoiled. Jason Statham, Seth Green, and Mos Def do not make their character far beyond their abilities, but they reach these parts. Statham as a smooth driver; Green as a technical swing with its own shoulder chip; and Def as a demolition worker. Charlize Theron slides well in a part that doesn't ask her too much. He is mostly asked to drive fast and look good. That he does it. No character is that it is deep or three dimensional, but in this familiar movie everything is necessary. <br /> <br /> As the title suggests, the film has a European feeling, "The Bourne Identity," partly because it is filmed in Russia with Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Helping the Euro flute is also a rhythmic, rushing music that adds trembling to the wonderful character and complements cast rape. The appearance of the film is also perfect. Vivid colors of all locals improve mood and attitude. Minis not only offers a fun variation of car chasing, but also works as a necessary plot device. <br /> <br /> The plot is more or less straight. There are a couple of surprises, but they are a quick and smooth variety, unlike their own jaw hair curve. Even with them, the speed of the movie is accelerated. If the foundation is for the first act, everything will continue. Fortunately, there is no interruption to the romance that wisely avoids the film. There is not even a pause in "real life". The story is your goal and runs this course without any disturbance. The lack of symbolic depth prevents "Italian work" from being more than a good popcorn film, but because of all the complex details, these superfluous factors would have dragged on the flick's pace and quality. <br /> <br /> There are a number of uncertainties that I thought about during and after viewing. But the film is so enjoyable that I didn't care and care about it. In the real world, most of the film probably couldn't go away from it. But "Italian work" does not happen in the real world. It takes place in a stylish and light-hearted criminal world that invites us to all the rebels. <br /> <br /> "Italian Work" is the correct meaning of the movie. It has no Oscar claims and does not contain a deep moral message. It offers pure entertainment and does it quite well. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Maybe the best popcorn of the year. 7 out of 10
