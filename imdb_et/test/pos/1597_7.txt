Movie for sharing with viewers. Just criticizing the pace of his funeral, the excessively used snap zooms in and out, stopping between the main characters. Favors Dirk Bogarde's powerful performance and Pasqualino De Santis's Venice reference photography. <br /> <br /> In summary, it may refer to petting, romantic elions, homosexual love gossip (at once, 1971, when it became unanimously legal). In fact, Visconti has managed to produce a richer and more complex film than such a single-edition vehicle. He has knew carefully his ideas - foibles and everything -. <br /> <br /> This is the central performance of Bogarde Aschenbach. Instead of forcing Johnny-come-recently gay, he succeeds in giving a pathetic composer who was beaten by tragedy and incomprehensible honesty who sees Tajio's salvation. His frantic astonishment around the ever-hitting Venice after the boy has a straight metaphor for the artist's truth against the dilettante mobi teeth (and is explicitly cut back). <br /> <br /> Mahler's music is perhaps overestimated, although it is well-known. Italian overdub is a worn anachronism, but fortunately the actress does not suffer too much. 7/10
