First of all I have to say that I am a big LOST fan. Anyone who does the exhibition I love. I have it all, really. <br /> <br /> I'm glad they have big people like Jack Bender is the biggest director, maybe even after J.J. Abrams. And, of course, full credit to Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse. They are geniuses. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the season 2 final is definitely one of the best episodes LOST ever !!! Die Alone focuses together on the story of Desmond David Hume Island and Henry Ian Cusick is such a big game that this character! The exhibitors would have been very stupid if they let the old ones die for us. <br /> <br /> So LOST has over 65 days of anti-aircraft deterrents. 65 days, man. Whileas Rousseau has been there for sixty years and others have been where God knows how long. Referring to Jeffrey Lieber, Lindelof and Abrams. Anyway, I hope we get the answers we need in season 3. Can't wait! My voice is nine.
