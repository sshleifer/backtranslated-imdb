Crackerjack is a funny movie, everyone has seen it and everyone says the same. The cheese wheel was a big part of the film, as well as a loud speaker, "dear sir and so you have left a better figure". Or, if Jack goes home and puts the couch down and breaks the beer, "bowls are hard work" broke me. And if his roommate shows interest in joining the club and calling the bingo number. Jack bought all the lottery tickets for the meat. Bloody great movie when you get into the lawn, if you interact with it, if your lawnmower does not forget it. Evans Head Bowlo would appreciate Aus' best club, friendly people, big company.
