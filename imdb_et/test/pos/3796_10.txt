I rarely write comments, but this film just needs more attention than it gets because it contains the most hysterical robbery that has ever been commercially wrongly ranked. <br /> <br /> I've only seen it once and found it to be the most fun movie I've ever had the right to watch. I laughed from beginning to end. It's a disgrace that it's not on DVD or video. <br /> <br /> You can only compare your cinematography with the mad world, the mad, the mad, the mad world, or let him do something. Only this story is not nearly as complicated as Mad World. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie will be released in the near future because it would be a shame to lose the comedy we have today.
