I thought this movie was great! I saw it coming out in theaters so I don't remember all the details. I remember it based on the Homer stage at Odysseus. The names and events of names have changed, but you still see the similarity story. <br /> <br /> I found it funny how they would get into trouble and how they would get out of it. I really enjoyed this modernized version of old stories much better than Romeo and Julia with Clair Danes. all this is a great adventure with some big name participant.
