Anna Christie (1930) <br /> <br /> Anna Christie has some awful parts and some amazing performances, but it should be even better. It has a drama. Some scenes are really atmospheric, and when the inner frames of the boards are drilled, other shots are really exciting at night and at sea. Then, in Coney Island, there are some historical, lively scenes (even a short nervous roller skate) and an episode where two women are in a separate bed with a net, and midwayers can throw the ball to try them out and women (little dressed) eggs are strangely sexual. Everywhere Garbo (front of the crowd) looks. <br /> <br /> Garbo is, of course, what makes this movie more than just a very good early speech. He plays all aspects of his character. He is coy and skeptical and has some kind of internal anxiety. She laughs and cries, pulls out and pushes it out. In some way, it is a forward-looking spectacular film (directed by Clarence Brown, who has a number of important films from this pre-code time). <br /> <br /> Although it is based on a successful play by Eugene O'Neil, it is in writing that it fights little because the actors seem to be through the ages. Marie Dressler is big in this exaggerated way she has almost branded. And then there is Greta Garbo, who really has a natural presence, even if she seems to be overweight, just a little, sometimes (but then everyone else). Garbo is, of course, a first-time silent actor, and this is his debut film debut. The audience loved her enough to make the next year's German version.
