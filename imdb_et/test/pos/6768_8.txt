Adam's apple and your permission. I didn't know until I was looking for it right now. Also, errrrrrmmmmm 'Wilbur wants to kill himself' I prefer this highly focused cemetery ... drama over Adam's Apple over top comic zeal. But with your permission, it's much more layered and subtle, but it's another director. A little claustrophobic .. maybe it's deliberate. It is based on the atmosphere. You scare again and again and again until "kick in shin". <br /> <br /> It's funny stuff.
