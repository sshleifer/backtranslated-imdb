loved the story of a man trying to get his girlfriend back ... been there, done so I can associate ... somehow, I love the camera work, how the camera "stays" from time to time and they just sit there talking about the scene or others things ... or how the camera follows her to find the cast and what not ... I looked at it in the IFC last year and I loved it so I told a few of my friends about it and some of them looked at it, and they too loved it ... check if you can, sure, but its still a good movie ... i gave it to the 10/10 because two reasons ... one: i can associate ... but anyone who has ever fallen in love and made a mistake, may be related ... two: his creative way of making a movie, as you are constantly there, right in the middle of filming ... as I said, a great movie
