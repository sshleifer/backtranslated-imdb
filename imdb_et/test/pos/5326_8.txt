Before I saw this movie, I read the comment of the person who didn't really like it. I have to admit that I am committed to devoting 1 hour and 48 minutes to my life, but I'm glad I did. Ryan Gosling is a fantastic actress, especially a lover of faith. Don Cheadle was also fantastic. The film provided an interesting view of life and death. It was very touching and very sad, but it kept me interesting, which most of the stories I can't do. This is a movie that is careless, whether you like it or not. It was unique and I don't think anyone can ever copy it. All the young actors were surprisingly aware of the subject and the emotions that got into it. I was pleasantly surprised.
