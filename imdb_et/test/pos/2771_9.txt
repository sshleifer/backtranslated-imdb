does anyone know where I can get this video or movie. I've been looking for it for a long time to show my daughter to show her and I can't find it anywhere. probably because it was just a video and they never made a DVD or VHS or idk. <br /> <br /> I immediately saw it from Disney in 1996 and I think it would be the best video for her. such a good film that has any emotion throughout the film. There are also many participants in this film who started their career. If anyone knows how to get a copy of this movie or have a copy of it and want to sell it to me, for example $ 50 or something, please call 201-566-0148. thanks
