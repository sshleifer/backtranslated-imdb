A group of young adults get outside where the only place in the neighborhood is a museum with a wax mannequin and the only form of aid is the local Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors). As the night falls, the children get down in record time. <br /> <br /> A strange, amazing B-movie that combines tree-tree settings and all-too-viable dummies (this is a good "refreshment" of wax museum bodies), it's an intense shock festival "Texas Chain Saw Massacre". (Then it should not be surprising that the artistic director of TCSM, Robert A. Burns, repeats this commitment and is always comfortable to decorate his eye.) Pino Donaggios' score is cool; with Nicholas von Sternberg's twilight photos, it drags the film in an oppressive atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The plot's twists are successful; there was one that I saw miles away, and one that really surprised me, and I was even happier for that. One of the best moments is almost instantly shared with us, because the first victim of the champion is trapped in a room where things fly at his own will. The captain is a big impalement from a pipe whose blood drips out. <br /> <br /> Star Connors offers an interesting job as an antagonist of our good housewives, while younger co-creatures are predictably unable to perform at the same level, although Jocelyn Jones is a pretty nice and definitely expensive woman who is memorable enough to understand affectionate girl. Co-star Tanya Roberts (a brunette in this movie) has good support. (If I had one problem with this movie, it's just that the victims are a little too stupid. Then again, it doesn't make much of the 80's fiction films.) The future remarkable names of credit include future directors Ted Nicolaou, who was the editor here. Ron Underwood (who made his big debut nearly a decade later with Tremors) as an assistant director and veteran make-up artist Ve Neill, who has made many films and won since three Oscars. <br /> <br /> Although some horror fans may be disappointed by the lack of nudity and sexual elements, it is otherwise a nice surprise that the debut director David Schmoeller is convinced and delighted. Recommended. <br /> <br /> 8/10
