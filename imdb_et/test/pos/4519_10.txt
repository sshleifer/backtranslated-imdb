I watched this movie exactly during the review. I had not read the book and knew nothing about it, but I went because two local colleges chose the book "The Book of the Year". So I can't compare the book to the movie, as others have done. <br /> <br /> In short, I thought it was an incredibly moving story. The operation was plausible and the overview of Afghan culture and political history was both interesting and shocking. My oldest friend is an Iranian-American, and so I felt affinity for some of the values ​​and traditions of the Middle East that were portrayed in the film because they reminded me of how much time I spent with my family. <br /> <br /> Friendship, family, human values, and courage in the fire are universal and well developed in the film. I don't read the plot details because they can be found elsewhere. But based on the technical aspects of the film, the actors and, above all, their heartfelt story, I would definitely recommend this movie.
