In a melodramatic sense, WESTERN UNION speaks of a line of telegraph lines in two western directions. The sister brothers Dean Jagger and Virginia Gilmore are working for Western Union, Randolph Scott and Robert Young work for Creightons. Indians and some bad white boys are on the road, but nothing can stop American development. This obvious sense of destiny is greatly enhanced by first-class musical performance and vibrant color photography. Scott is a bank robber who wants to improve his way, and both he and engineer Young are taking the symbolic Gilmore's attention. Many great characters show that big production is moving forward.
