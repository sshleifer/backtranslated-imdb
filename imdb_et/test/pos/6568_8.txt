It is true that this film violates the convention because it does not write the graph to the viewer. Although some may have a problem for themselves, I would accept Uzumaki for "negligence". It's PLOT, it's just that it may not be available to the lazy viewer immediately. This is a film that invites all interpretations, like all the great arts, but it is also a very fun movie, making it a rare film experience. It is provocative and fun at the same time.
