Bob Cummings is great in this respect, because this technically ingenious Hitchcock movie doesn't really fame as some of his other films, but is now very observable. Priscilla Lane proves that she is capable of having other blondes who later worked with Hitchcock. After that, he made a handful of movies, which makes him almost forgotten today. <br /> <br /> There are sequences that remind the viewer of the director's later films. Operation is so well done and the story is so well done that this movie is still very fun. Every cast person does well. There are several great wallpapers in black and white. <br /> <br /> This was the first film to be dedicated to Universal Hitchcock. Hitchcock would have had to deal with universal films and TV series, so Hitchcock makes as many accounts in the studio as anyone who worked there. This fact disappears in film history. <br /> <br /> Norman Lloyd is a really bad guy in this movie. The story is moving well, including Hitchcock's only filmed western part. This movie is very good, because everything has come with it.
