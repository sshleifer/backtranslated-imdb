We went to the cinema, waiting for the biggish budget to be released and got the art house movie. The film was digitally projected about two-thirds of the screen's real estate with sloping edges, a classic digital projection, and limited stereo sound that was wasted on cinema. <br /> <br /> The content of the movie was the same old historical content that we've all seen before but heavily disinfected to prevent the audience from getting sick. The few live scenes that were few of them were used continuously in the classic documentary style, which got annoying after some time. <br /> <br /> I was somewhat surprised that only 4 people looked at it, I think the rest knew something we didn't do. <br /> <br /> I think manufacturers made a movie to celebrate Gallipoli's 90th anniversary. I have to ask if they should have worked. <br /> <br /> Seven out of ten to try, and respect for ANZAC.
