I heard about this movie a long time ago and finally found it on eBay for five bucks. I didn't expect much, but wow, I've ever been surprised. This is the story of a boy and a girl who loves to try to escape from the evil king, who wants a girl for himself and a huge castle, reminds me of ICO for PS2, because some shots gave you a sense of thought. this movie is crazy! It is hard to believe that this original animated feature was made in 1952. The king was probably one of a little character I've seen for a long time, a feminine walk, strange eyes (usually overrun) and a soft but soft scary voice. The only problem I had with the film was that the boy and the girl had no personality and hardly even had any lines except Mr. wonderbird (big speaks green bird) to save them. The animation was fantastic in most areas, but some cells lacked some scenes that suck. It's incredibly original with flying police and gigantic mechs, and even laughs at times funny, it's a real shame that it's such a hide title because it's really a good movie. Check it out sometime.
