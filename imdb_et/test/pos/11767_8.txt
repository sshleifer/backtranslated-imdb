Fun romp ... lots of good turns! (and we weren't even baked!) <br /> <br /> Didn't know that this movie existed before watching the extra trailers on Monty Python's DVD ... (strangely it was with a city of lost children) and baron Munchaushen's Adventures) <br /> <br /> Wrestling keeps you wondering. <br /> <br /> The actor was fantastic ... Hank Azaria shows his talent again, Bill Bob is Billy Bob ... (wecis?) <br /> <br /> Be sure to check out.
