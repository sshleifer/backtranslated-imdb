This film is a perfect example of Barkers' cinematic gifts for the horror / monster genre. I thought this film did a great job of keeping up with the feeling and appearance of the short story and comics (or actually the comics have come second, forget). This movie was made for Barker fans. This will help you read the book beforehand, but it doesn't matter if you can watch the movie. I saw everyone on the fence of this movie read the book and watch the movie again. New respect for the film may arise. I came to this movie already as a big fan of Barker and read the book before, loved the movie instantly. In this movie, there are big fires, makeup, writing, management, etc. This film does something that most monster / horror films fail, show monsters. They are there in full color, not hidden in the shadows and take most of the screen from time to time. Unlike other movies that use fast cuts or trick lighting to hide the creature, this film marks the grotesque and throws them at the forefront as a good guy. Two thumbs Clive. We always wait :)
