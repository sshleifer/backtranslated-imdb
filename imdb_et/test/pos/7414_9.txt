How on the ground this movie is no longer considered beyond me. <br /> <br /> I chose it for 1 pound and I'm not exaggerating when I say it is the best pound I've ever spent on a movie that usually lets the club's scene play music or real scenes that are filmed with film. <br /> <br /> Here, music and club scenes are completely reliable, using some of the biggest stories of time and filmed in real clubs, where people actually look like they want to be there. <br /> <br /> Actresses' exhibitions are at a high level, although Especially Jason Donovan is different for me (he played Frank N Furter at the Rocky Horror Show in London at about the time it was supposed to be filming so his drag phase was full! ) And of course, Tim Curry, who is telling. Drug Ground Boss is convincing. <br /> <br /> Simply put, if you are a fan of British film, you have to see it, it does not mean that the movie is a strong eno anyway like a story. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
