Allow me to deviate from many of the comments you read here and say that this movie is one of the top five bonds with her Majesty's secret service, from Russia with love, to kill the license and only to your eyes (The only time Roger Moore actually played Bond's role, rather than around him turn). Of course, Sean Connery pulls the whole thing together - as a co-author, co-producer and her best performances from Russia with love. He is capable, energetic and obviously enjoys himself. His actions are mature, confident and blessed with the right amount of humor. It's the opposite of his mechanical performance in Thunderball, his dream through You Only Live Twice and his jowly, paunchy romp through this cartoon, known as diamonds, forever! <br /> <br /> This is Thunderball's imaginative reprocessing without characterizing and drawing on sets and machines. It's also much better. Klaus Maria Brandauer brings her unique style to Largo's role, based on an eye-catching, SPECTER-ring or boring form. Kim Basinger is sporty and cute, Barbara Carrera is dynamic and at the same time Bernie Casey's big Felix Leiter. The M and Q images are original and the addition of the Small-Fawcett ghost is fun without a fire. <br /> <br /> Director Irvin Kershner takes advantage of their locations (Bahamas and French Riviera) without losing sight of their participants. Although close control shows some mediocre special effects and loses consistency, Kershner keeps the movie moving fast, unlike Thunderball (which even his director Terence Young did not like). Obviously fans will miss the gun barrel mark and the 007 theme music, but they are after all, Eon Productions. <br /> <br /> Michel LeGrand may not be the most memorable score, but it captures the atmosphere without being too intrusive. No wonder his best moments are in southern France, his French love song (in the wellness center) is particularly attractive. And tell me how much Moonraker music really remembers? Personally, I would forget that a person is with a golden weapon and a view to kill! <br /> <br /> Eon people may want this movie. (Yes, Octopussy made more money.) At least Connery's ripe 007 did not pass the jungle, which separated Tarzani. He did not rob a Bengal tiger and won the "Indian" snake charms with a tennis racket. Despite Eoni's desperate efforts to stop this production, Kevin McClory and late Jack Schwartzman made a fine film that I think Ian Fleming would welcome. <br /> <br /> If you see James Bond dwarfed in a dwarf, step into another tiring struggle with "jaws", jump to bed with Grace Jones, or take a brilliant firetruck to chase through San Francisco, this is not a movie for you!
