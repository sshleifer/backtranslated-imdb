Ali G Indahouse must be one of the funniest films I've seen for a long time, and Cohen's British gangsta portrayal is fun. This film has a cult classic written all over it and contains some really great features. Ali G Indahouse is a good party party film that leaves the viewer laughing literally from start to finish. Be sure to vote for Ali G and keep it real.
