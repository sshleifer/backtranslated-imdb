Ronald Coleman had been on the screen for several years when the talks came and what was his career momentum. His Oxford English accent is so appealing that I can listen to him, saying farmer almanac and not boring. <br /> <br /> Coleman plays Willie Hale, a 30-year-old playboy with a wealthy family who spends their time playing feminine and gambling. Yet it is a pleasant scam - not only for the audience, but also for family members and friends. She has once again broken her gambling and sells her assets in foreign places to settle her debts and go home to England. When he arrives there, he first meets his father, who asks him to kick him out - he has it with Willie and his ways of reconciliation. But for five minutes alone, Willie and his charm in the room, and Willie have not only forgiven his father, the father has given him one hundred pounds, which he has to boot. <br /> <br /> Willie then goes to her day to relax with her sister and her friend, Dorothy Hope (Loretta Young). Dorothy is busy with Grand Duke Paul this evening, mainly because his father wants to serve in the family and no one else lives in his life. It will change after Willie's day and soon a scandal will come because Dorothy refuses to consider marriage as planned. <br /> <br /> Ronald Coleman is always happy to watch these early films for Sam Goldwyn, where he plays a confident adventurer or frame or both. He has a similar behavior to Errol Flynn, but he is unable to demonstrate Flynn's physical mobility because he was a vulnerable wound during World War I. Loretta Young, only 17 years old, when this picture was taken, shows the sweet girl of her brand, which can break the fire once she asks. Myrna Loy plays Willie's girl's past - Mary Crayle - showgirl. Here, Myrna still plays a part similar to the parts of the exotic vampire that she had so often risen in Warner Brothers when she was a contracted player from 1926 until shortly before the film in 1930. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of light and wind-free romantic comedy from start to finish. If you're in the mood for entertaining entertainments that lighten the hearts of the audience during the Great Depression, this little movie will fit the bill.
