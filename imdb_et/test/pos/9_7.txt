I've seen this story before, but my kids haven't done that. A boy who is happy with the past, joins the army, faces his past, falls in love and becomes a man. Mentor plays perfectly with Kevin Costner; A normal person with common everyday problems living an extraordinary conviction to save lives. After losing his team, he takes the position of a teacher who trains next generation heroes. Kutcher recruits young people in difficulty. Although her scenes with local love are rigid and do not produce enough heat to melt or, she can congratulate Costner. I never understood a woman who had been neglected by Sela Ward and felt she would want Costner to give up her concerns about her safety, not her selfish needs. But his presence on the screen is a joy. The two unconfirmed stars of this film are the Coast Guard and the Sea. Both are powerful forces that should not be taken for granted in real life or in the film. The film has some slow spots and they could have used a 15-minute waste to strengthen their characteristic relationships. But it still works. Rescue scenes are intense and filmed and edited to maximize impact. This film serves the audience's applause. And the applause of my two sons.
