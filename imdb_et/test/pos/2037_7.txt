A surprisingly well-written, well-written film about a hard rockin-but-decent young man who got this hope for a stardom: his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace his singer. Not far removed, the film tries to keep things in perspective and doesn't go over; it definitely makes you think twice about the fantasies of adolescents regarding the music business. However, despite the strong dialogue, the script follows a tried and true, formal pattern, and gets its clich√©s in the final act. I liked it much more than the sweet fluffball "Almost Famous". It is a nice, bitter edge to go with the disappearance of heavy metals, but a stronger finish could have made it more memorable. ** 1/2 from ****
