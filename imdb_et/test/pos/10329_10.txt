Bug Juice changed my life. I know it sounds strange, weird and weird. But it did. I'm from England, Bug Juice never went there, but five years ago I rested with my family and saw it on the Disney channel. When I saw this TV series, I wanted to go. It took many parents convincing that my brother and I could go to Waziyatah. I've been there because I was 12 years old and it was my summer this year. If you are a teenager reading this page, it will change to the camp, changing your life. you make lifelong friends in waz. It doesn't matter who you are or if someone at home doesn't like you all like you camp. You have so much fun. If you want to watch www.wazi.com and watch it yourself. It's so much fun that I love it there. This is my home away from home
