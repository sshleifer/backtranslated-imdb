"Gaming? Nicotine? Fisticuffs? We're moving into a falling crime!" So St. says Head of Swithen after the inspector is normal to Captain Nutbourne. St. Swithen faculty and students have been commissioned to share Nutbourne facilities to avoid German bombs during World War II. Then there is a masterpiece. "Samuel Pepys Diary? Limited ... well, this is something grateful. What is this? The memories of Casanova? Is that the book we read in Jessica James's closet?" Decameron Nights! What else can or may not be the place to bring carefully grown girls! "Yes, the Ministry of Education has made a terrible mistake. Nutbourne is a boys' school. St. Swithen is a girl for girls. And what makes it one of the postwar British comedies is Nutbourne Master Wetherby Pond ... what Alastair Sim plays, while St "Swithen's chief is Muriel Whitchurch ..., played by Margaret Rutherford." "You don't want to say that you are a school for boys and girls?" He asks one of the early girls. "Only the girls" he says happily. "Does that mean, sir," one of Nutbourne's teachers asks "that we are waiting for 100 young girls?" "This means that not only has the ministry been wrong at school here, but that it is guilty of terrible sexual aberration!" Margaret Rutherford's Miss Whitchurch is as battleship as Alastair Sim pond is surprised by his big bald and has decided to rescue his school. In the meantime, there are 100 young girls and 170 young boys fed , and the places to sleep with them (with all those teachers.) Chefs and caregivers, totally put, walking, Miss Whitchurch and her girls are still ready to cook. "Come on, Angela," she says to one of the sisters. a guy who tries to mix something big in the pot, "haven't you made a porridge before?" "Yeah, but nobody should ever eat it." "This is a defeatist attitude, dear. Mix it well and don't shine. "Things hardly go well when Pond discovers four school leaders who want to drive, arrive at every moment to see how well Nutbourne is. And Miss Whitchurch learns that four wealthy and influential parents are just arrived to see how their daughters are doing in a new boy, they were told - facilities. The only solution? Miss Whitchurch and Pond, their teachers and students, made the division for the second time to give a hint that Nutbourne has no girls and that St. Swithen has no boys. After the parents checked the dormitory and left the classroom, the girls sit in bed and the boys who were hidden in the bed, as the leaders step in. The boys are looking at the rugby and as soon as the governors turn their backs, the gate posts, lacrosse fall, nets are put up and then the parents go to watch the girls, one parent puts his daughter's science class, then moments later see him in choral practice, then moments later .... "There's Angela," she says to Miss Whitchurch. "Why this is so," he replies, bothering the parents, to prevent governors approaching the corner. "The child is quite everywhere." When we leave Nutbourne, everything is discovered. Students grind. Teachers have failed (with the exception of two who kiss.) The Ministry of Education has just sent several more students. Parents are without words, but there are no leaders. "We're waiting for an explanation," one says sharply. Pond keeps his head and shakes. "Don't you see I'm trying to think one." <br /> <br /> The film moves after another difficult and ridiculous situation, drawn by a very funny script and two tremendously comedy Rutherford and Simi performances. The insecure determination of Sim's droll exasperation and Rutherford is so well matched that it is a shame that it is the only movie they ever did together. Joyce Grenfell, like Gossage, St. Swithen's long, uncomfortable sports teacher gives them some competition. If you keep your eyes open, you will also find fun references to director Frank Launder, including Gong's Nutbourne, which looks like the Arthur Rank's dwarf version, which is the faint echo of the third man's shining theme and the shot of David Leani's Oliver Twist, except this time when a little boy walks in his porridge bowl and says, "Please, sir. I don't want anymore." <br /> <br /> Frank Launder and his partner Sidney Gillia were responsible for some of the films produced in Britain during the thirties, forties and fifties. They wrote, prepared and directed, sometimes we did one, sometimes another. In one way or another, they were responsible for first-rate movies such as Green for Danger (a masterly glimpse of the Sim), a blind stranger, The Lady Vanishes, Night Train to Munich, Wee Geordie, The Belles of St Trinian, Rake's Progress and many others. Launder wrote his most happy days of his life and directed both. This is one of their best.
