Filming is cheesy. Some participants are moving over. Some activities are inexplicable and inexplicable. But ... <br /> <br /> This movie is in the 50s psychological drama mode. <br /> <br /> This is a moral game. Like a movie where the "method" of the actor becomes a bad thing, he is forced to watch movies because he is a film editor. It gives him a nerve damage that leads to complete psychotic fracture. <br /> <br />
