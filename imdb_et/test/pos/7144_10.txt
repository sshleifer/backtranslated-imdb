It was a very faithful presentation in the mid-50s of Lewis life. The dialogue with theology and his colleagues was very good. Michael White's book "C.S. Lewis: The Creator of Narnia" deals with this schedule very parallel. The actress of Joss Ackland was surprisingly catching the unemployed by Lewis. The film was accompanied by major pains to be played in English. Developing a strong bond between "Jack" (his preferred name) and Lewis and Douglas Gresham, Joy's son from his previous marriage, was an enjoyable watch. The movie avoided the unpleasant element of the "Warnie" Lewis (Jack's older brother) drinking problem, but it would not have furthered the story, so it is the best.
