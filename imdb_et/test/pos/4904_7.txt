Lovingly designed and terribly interesting to look at Garfield's sharp, breakthrough work (introducing a new type of rebellious style that would pass on to post-war Brandos and Clifts, etc.), but all this sister affection is a bit warm. Priscilla Lane is a bright, interesting performer, but other nurses have not actually registered (though they are all allowed to be sour and witty) and I just had a hard time buying another man apart from Garfield. Jeffrey Lynn is a pleasant enough actor, but he doesn't have a movie star to match Garfield's happiness with Mickey Borden and throws the movie a bit. (Imagine Jimmy Stewart or anyone in that regard.) I was also not convinced that Garfield would make a central (not to mention) final decision he made. The film needs another half an hour to better explain this activity; it seems terribly rushed and motivated. <br /> <br /> However, it is not hard to see how someone who grew up with this picture would remember it gently. It's not classic, but contains some classic moments. Two gate rotating scene is pure movie magic.
