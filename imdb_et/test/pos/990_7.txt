Although I know Dylan Thomas very well, I don't know anything about his life. Regardless of his life and his marriage in particular, I would imagine that the edge of Love (based on the novel) manipulates things a little, but if you are not a historian or poet who cares. <br /> <br /> The film is less about Thomas and more focused on the two most important women in his life. One is his wife Kathrine and the other is Vera, who was her first love. One romantic night on the beach as young is something that both have tried to be behind them, but they can't, now they have grown up, they are good friends. I forgot to mention that this is during the war. Vera goes to Captain Will Killing, who she is pregnant and is fighting for. When she is away, Vera starts to fall back to Thomas and Kathrine is in love with her. He also bears the baby of another man. Things get even more emotionally complicated when Kill's Kill is back <br /> <br /> As you can see, this is a very operative soap, and it is slowly developing into a fairy tale, perhaps with too many happy sequences. dialogue. But everything is still missing. For non-Hollywood production, I think the Edge of Love is about as stylish as the picture. Certainly it is bigger in size and more intelligent than about 90% of contemporary novels, Hollywood production or not. Some of this is related to putting in place during the war, which creates an emotional conflict that seems more persuasive and less artificial, just like reconciliation. This one function works and cinematography of the equal talent of Joe Wright's Oscar candidate, but it has a much greater need for stable pace and progression. Things are up and running okay, but the middle part is where your attention can be tested unless you are deeply and deeply rooted. <br /> <br /> I doubt if the edge of love has such an impact on the viewer, but it's a good movie to control. it can even make a good date for a night movie, whereas it is as wise as chick cocks that boys are forced to endure.
