At first I didn't think I wanted this movie, but when it progressed, it became better and better. I love music and I was impressed with how well Cage can fake mandolin. My son was with me and he also loved the movie a lot for his music and story, and how the story unfolded, showing how Corelli's girls won the heart. The way of acting and the story were as well done as well-directed. At first, Corelli's bravery was irritating, but soon he grew up on you. The plot twists were interesting, especially with the Germans. I'd like to see it again to track all the side surfaces. I also want to buy a soundtrack to listen to music again.
