Hmm, is it right to compare Tiffan's Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar's post Saved The Bell? Of course it's not right, it's ridiculous. And is it right to give this movie a rating of 10? Hahahahahaha ... it's funny. However, this film was not so terrible; better than I thought it was. TV movies are often so similar. So many of them have the same feeling. It had the same feeling, but it worked, even though it was another tortured woman who must get the end of the b * start. Before I started, I saw Thiessen as a 90th sedimentator, but here he was innocent like Kelly Kapowski, who was refreshing. Eric Close surprised me very well playing my part. With some good writing, the director got a pretty good, convincing performance without being cheesy at all. All in all, it was somewhat interesting, definitely better than most TV movies. My Class: B-
