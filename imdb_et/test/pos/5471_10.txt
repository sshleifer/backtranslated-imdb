I come from Texas and my family rested a few years ago with my brother Sante Fe. He suggested going to the church with a staircase. I was absolutely blown out of the miracles there. The movie is great - Barbara Hershey and William Petersen were perfect for the parts they played. It's amazing, absolutely amazing. If you have not seen the staircase personally, you should look at it. Wood is beautiful and architecture is amazing. Only staying in the chapel gives me goose bumps! It's a breathtaking thing to read the chapel's history and see its beauty. Watch the movie - it's great! Then check the stairs personally!
