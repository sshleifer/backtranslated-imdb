If you're tired, the front panel may be slow. The story is, of course, unhurried, unhurried - giving us time to understand everyday life and situations where the main characters are. When you have come to the story's climate, the course of events keeps you caught up in: how things turn out to be what our precious Fanda (represented by the silent perfection of Vlastimil Brodský, the actor of the Czech nation), how her husband (perfectly playing Stella Zázvorková) treats her what happens to Fanda expensive friend Ed (played by Stanislav Zindulka - with a suitable bandage Brodskýle) and Jara's son with an independent hidden agenda, blind to the kindness of his parents (oh!) <br /> <br /> Vladimir Michálek led the film reasonably with sprinkles of humor, preserving Jirí Hubac's incomprehensible script. Thanks to clear subtitles, I was able to point out every phrase in the "complaint" about Fanda's wife, a hint of "caring" that shows / buried between lines - and so did a sensible lady. Fanda is in the '76's 80 'and the affection of their lasting (married) marriage is manifested even in their distressing arguments. His playfulness can be infectious. <br /> <br /> This is a 'growing old with 101' (at least) over the fifties, and lessons learned for sons and daughters that parents are not taken for granted. You may have to think about assuming that “outdated home” is a tool to stop. The film is gently shouting at us so that we can live life completely. (Hint: It's a pleasure to stay there and look at the end of the credit.) <br /> <br /> We are happy to be able to see a random Czech movie. Father and son of Sverák ("Kolya") in 2001 It's good to take it now and slowly slowly, and understand the foreign pearl - its subtitle, landscape, melodic score and entertaining story with an elegant performance. "Autumn Spring" (aka Babí Léto) is available on DVD. Enjoy!
