If you want to see a real thriller, rent it !!! It is not "Scream" by the director or scriptwriter, it does not include excessive, overpriced "television" participants who leave as "stars", and this is not the culmination of the special effects of the mill. Instead, you get top-notch, strong, very strong (with violence) but exciting nailbiter.
