I think it's a pretty good movie, but one thing makes me very interesting. This is obviously obvious when you look at it: the main characters of this film are inspirations to Simpson's bully. Layne is Jimbo, John is Kearney and Tony is Dolph. There's even a "Simpson" episode where Jimbo uses the line "I beat him with a stick". <br /> <br /> Jimbo-Layne's connection is most evident with a knitting form and long hair and voice. Kearney has a shaved head, unlike John, but it's big, stupid. The Tony-Dolphi connection is obvious with long, divorced hairstyles and even second-tier status.
