NEXT KARATE KID is, in my opinion, a great martial arts flick. I thought Eric (Chris Conrad) and Julie (Hilary Swank) saw their prom attire well. For me, Ned (Michael Cavalieri) was a real bully. That's because he got Julie in trouble with the main Wilkes (Eugene Boles). If you ask me, Colonel Dugan (Michael Ironside) was pure ******! It was because he was a very tough guy who didn't tolerate mistakes. My favorite items were prom and showdown between Julie and Alpha Elite. All in all, I suggest you hit it for anyone who loves martial arts flick or fans of Hilary Swank.
