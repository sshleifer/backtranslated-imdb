This is a film of loneliness and how far? physical and emotional - people tend to annoy their relationships. <br /> <br /> Narrative is simple for banals: Yusuf (Emin Toprak), a young man from Istanbul, arrives in Istanbul with his older and successful cousin Mahmut (Muzaffer Ozdemir); Yusuf wants to work in a big city. After a few weeks of trying to find a job without success, Mahmut has too much Yusuf living with him. They quarrel? something physical, just verbal. Finally, Yusuf goes, leaving Mahmuti again. End of the story ... <br /> <br /> Except the performance of two men as relatives is one of the best films. Much is said visually; the dialogue is used to highlight the controversy, mistrust, hostility and uncertainty that exist between and between the two men. <br /> <br /> There are many visual gems in this movie. For example, if you are looking for a job, young Yusuf, who needs a relationship, is trying to get the attention of different young women in the city. The vision of his face when he is stuck every time, says it all. <br /> <br /> But if you want a cigarette, Yusuf opens the door to the balcony of Mahmut's apartment and lights up in the cold December, leaving the door open; Finally, the Mahmut rises from his desk, walks to the door (all glass), and the cousins ​​just look at each other for what seems too long. Then Mahmut closed the door, leaving Yusuf cold. The metaphor is complete. <br /> <br /> Or, Mahmut clears after Yusuf, maliciously and with growing anger; and all the time, Jusuf wastes his time to sit on his skirts instead of seriously looking for work, and does Mahmut spend money on the toy as his nephew? Yusuf is emotional, insecure, impulsive and vulnerable. The jar is a rational, logical, confident and demanding control crisis: the right brain, left-brain-dicotomy, played beautifully by two actors who say more in appearance, gesture, trap than any words can convey. But Mahmut is not entirely emotional: he still loves his former wife, who tells her she is with her husband in Canada. The jar affects the distant and self-confident friendship of his former and ensures that he goes well. She wants her well. He says goodbye. He leaves the cafe where they spoke. Later, when he calls the latter goodbye, he goes to the airport, Mahmut goes there and secretly watches when he leaves. The feeling of emotion on her face, when she disappears from the door, is worth the wait. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is the work of two main actors and director Nuri. Ceylan. Some may argue that the pace is too slow; but life goes a long way, especially for those who are alone. Camera operation is relatively simple: select the scene, set the camera and lighting, and let the participants move to the scene, enter the scene and leave the scene while holding the camera. There were a few pictures, some high-angle tracking shots, some rural scenes? but a large part of the film is shown as a fixed camera and a wide-angle lens. Except for TV and radio music, there is no music track. And there are many long silences as two men sit and watch TV together and / or participate in a very limited conversation. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on TV so I was having fun watching a couple of times watching TV while watching TV. The silence of the movie matched the silence of my house (I was awake, everyone else in bed); watching TV, my chair and position were the same as in Mahmut. Quite terrible, giving me the feeling of being "almost" with her? And I think I was in a sense. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying anymore because I want you to enjoy other scenes I haven't described. This is definitely not a movie for everyone. More than any movie I've seen, how much do we die when we're all alone? as we are all alone when we die. Mahmuti's face, blinking in the final image, stays with me for a long time ... <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for serious movie fans.
