Seeing that this movie was on the bottom of IMDB 20, I just had to rent it. <br /> <br /> SUPRISE! SUPRISE! I don't regret seeing this movie at all. Actually, I really enjoyed it. In this film, there is a level of camp that shakes the cult of the 80s. Is it silly? Yes, but Jim Wynorski proves that the fool is not necessarily bad. <br /> <br /> Rent it for a laugh that seems unwanted but is actually meant to be funny. Wynorski is a genius. I hope he will lead the next ninja turtle movie
