Every time this movie sprang up late in the late 1970s and early 1980s on television, I would always have time to sit and watch TV. See lovely Kate Jackson, beautiful Richard Long, "great" Polly Bergen I've never seen anywhere else except this TV movie, loving Tom Bosley and the other "great" I've never seen from the movie, Celeste Holme . It's really a love ship that talks about murder and chaos and the boy was once good! And every time I watch it, I always forget who the real murderer was. <br /> <br /> As expected, anyone here already criticizes the film as if it were really a great help to anyone. It's a great TV movie and it's worth every time. I can't say it's about half of the movies I've seen this month. <br /> <br /> If you ever have a chance to watch it on television that is unlikely, check it out. Considering the "Girl Most Likely" that will finally be released this year on DVD, there may be hope for a "Death Cruise" DVD.
