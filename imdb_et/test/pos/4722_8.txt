Although the film has its drawbacks, it highlights some of the problems of living in a country without democracy. It makes you empathetic with people in this government and makes you more aware of your life, struggles and potential leader Aung San Suu Kyi. It makes one wonder why our government is interfering with places we do not want, but ignore those who ask for our help.
