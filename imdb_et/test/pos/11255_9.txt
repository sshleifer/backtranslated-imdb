Spoiler Starts The movie focuses on three friends: Samantha (Summer Phoenix), Chris (Nick Stahl) and Owen (Aaron Paul). The movie begins with Sam and Owen as drug addicts, and Chris, the track as the one who takes care of them. As things get worse for Chris, he asks Sam what the medicine is. Sam is away from this point for rehab and sober and tells him to do the best. Then Chris tries to catch up with Owen and they start using it. Chris takes twice as long as he is a "full-time member". After some problems with the dealer and a testimony to Sam, he gets again. So the downward spiral begins for them. Chris od when he breaks the promise to Sam (I want some movie to be a surprise). He dies, Sam gets to college to be an architect, and Owen can be arrested. so the story ends <br /> <br /> Spoiler ends. Small Spoilers All <br /> <br /> Nick Stahl is amazing. She has one day Oscar. His idea of ​​Chris was a heartache. He was the only one who felt real about drug use in the film. Aaron Paul, who played Owen, acted as if he was not heroin at speed. Summer Phoenix was good, he's talented, but what I'm saying Nick Stahl stole the movie. Her stunned eyes, her slow movements, were all perfect. <br /> <br /> Writers had to show their extracts in the movie. This is the main reason why people do not want to give up. Secondly, that there are fun scenes (shopping scene and backstreet boy scene, man Stahl laughed at reactions directly on his head.), No, sad scenes (like a scene between Sam and Chrise in his bedroom after he beat up, I stopped and park scene.). It was also realistic. As S re-used, when Chris wanted to wash the medicine under the toilet, and Chris used it again after he went to Own, although he had been clean for two weeks, it was too strong. it is all realistic. <br /> <br /> Watch a movie about excellent casting, great music and semi-automatic drugs.
