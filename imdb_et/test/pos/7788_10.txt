This is the best film that appeared in Bollywood. The best comedy, the best actor and the best direction so far! Rajkumar Santoshi's writing and direction proved to be one of the best directors in the industry. Aamir Khan was just a finger's breadth away from an equalizer for Salman Khan. Shakti Kapoor was good, but Jagdeep was as usual! People are still copying this comedy and no other writer or leader has done this again! Even Rajkumar Santoshi has not been able to do this cult classic again! This movie was a flop when it was released, but it has been a cult classic because it appeared and loved all people. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION 10/10. DIALOGID is 10/10. <br /> <br /> SCREENPLAY 10/10. DIRECTTION is 10/10. <br /> <br /> MUSIC 9/10 <br /> <br /> LYRICS 9/10 <br /> <br /> Generally, this movie is recommended. If you haven't looked at it so far, they're great! It's ridiculous and the best comedy I've ever seen! Classical films like Hera Pheri, Golmaal and Jaane Bhi Do Jaaro are not even half funny. <br /> <br /> GREAT MOVIE, HATS OFF !!!!
