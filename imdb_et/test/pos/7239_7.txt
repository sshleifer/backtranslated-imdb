It is very odd to bring William Shakespeare's tragic love story to the screen. <br /> <br /> The Que family and the Capulet family have long-term anger with each other, often leading to violence. The anger is related to the film company and the fact that everything is quite crazy. In the midst of this madness, Tromeo and Julia, the most famous "stars overflowing" lovers of literature, fall at first glance and face problems when they realize whose family belongs to the other. <br /> <br /> The film follows an original feature film, which is very good and the main scenes use even the original or near the original lines. But the infamous Troma odd passes through the film from start to finish. It changes the film, which is definitely not for every taste, but it is quite inventive. Tyrone (Tybalt in Shakespeare) is a particularly funny death scene. 7/10 <br /> <br /> There are many different edited and rated versions. Everyone has violence, embarrassment, drug abuse and sex with a big odd dose.
