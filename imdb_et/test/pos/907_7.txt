This is one of L & H's short trousers, most often quoted as the first "real" L&H team and perhaps one of their best silent features. J. Piedmont Mumblethunder (Ollie) is a millionaire who has come to the docks to greet his nephew Philip, whom he has never seen. In the beginning, Ollie laughs with everyone when this strange little man unleashes and draws a lot of attention to how he behaves during his medical examination, but is quite humble when it turns out that he is the one he is supposed to be with greeting. He has said that Philip is a good boy, but he has one weakness - women. Mumblethunder and Philip went home, but their trip was continually interrupted by Philip, breaking a small dance every time he saw a woman, followed by a woman. Every time it happens, big crowds gather, not so much that he is wearing skirts, but because Philip himself also carries a skirt (slate). Finally, Mumblethunder will be able to force Philip to fit his trousers, but Philip will flee from there to track more skirts. There's a lot of laugh. It is also nice to see such a short one because the guys are not exactly the characters we know and love. Ollie is pretty ordinary, but it is such a joy to see that Stan is doing so with a normal human-child character. It shows that he was not a one-time pony and when he got the chance it was in another type of role. With a 19-minute ride, it is short and sweet, offering a classic one-liner that still has seams.
