Tromeo and Julia are perhaps the best Shakespeare modernization I've ever seen, not that there's a lot of competition, but anyway ... <br /> <br /> All in all, Tromeo and Julia are definitely one of Troma's best movies, one of the small pearls hidden in high manure. It is a funny, action-packed and powerful story of the world's greatest love, but still manages to follow the original story faithfully as well as any such film. Well, except for the end, where Tromeo and Juliet kill Julia's abusive father and live happily in his sunny suburbs all his life with his terribly mutated children. <br /> <br /> This is a high school literature class of the film should show that poor students read hundreds and hundreds of pages of Shakespeare scripts. Thumbs up!
