Having worked professionally with young girls, I found this film surprisingly authentic. I would never have found a friend borrowed their video tape. Here are the classic themes: age arrivals, mother / daughter estrangement, limited choice of underprivileged, good samaritan, tragedy in every life and many layers or relationships. The rebounds are meaningful (when Alice acquires a weapon, we know she has some knowledge about using it) and it doesn't end in a clich√©. Cast "sells" its roles. It is an adult material and the sound is a bit too grainy. Allow 15 minutes to bring you in.
