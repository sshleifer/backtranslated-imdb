Directed by veteran Hollywood director Henry King, who began his career in 1915, Love is a Lot of Splendored Thing was one of his latest great films. It was based on Han Suyin's best-selling name, which is simply called many Splendored Thing phrases, which the author had borrowed from a poem by Francis Thompson's "Kingdom of God", where many blatant words "love" were used in a rather different and rather transcendental context, meaning God's love . Made in the 50s, a film marked with the work of directors such as Douglas Sirk and Vincente Minnell, a renovation of a melodrama, its floresence, and once again a popularity. <br /> <br /> The story begins when the beautiful American reporter Mark Elliott, played by William Holden once more as one of his irresistible "playboy" roles, arrives in Hong Kong and meets young and beautiful Han Suyin (Jennifer Jones) there. a Chinese-semi-English origin who works in a hospital with a doctor and whose wife was recently killed by Chinese Communists. Immediately Mark is quite attracted to him, but at first his deep feelings are not quite contradictory when Han has left after his wife's death ("I believe there is only a doctor in the heart of man"). But very soon, he will give a lasting engagement to hell Mark and both will enter into a passionate relationship that apparently is nothing, even if Mark is unhappy with his marriage and his wife does not want to give him divorce and social hardship and prejudice caused by Han. But still, the fate of the last word in determining the justice of eternal loving relationships, no matter how long these two assume is a ruthless time waiting for a rather worrying form of death, is ready to prove its persistence at any given time. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, one of the most romantic films ever made, Love is Much Splendored Thing has great performances by William Holden and Jennifer Jones. Alfred Newman and the extremely romantic, touching, warm-hearted, but ultimately heartbeat story. Don't miss the many brilliant movies. 8/10 <br /> <br />
