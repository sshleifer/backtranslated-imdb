After a long-term perspective in West End, this charming film was chosen by Margaret Rutherford as head of Miss Whitchurch's financially successful adaptation in 1950. <br /> <br /> All the interiors took place at the Riverside Studio in Hammersmith, London. External scenes were filmed at a public girls' school near Lissi in Hampshire. During the 12-week shooting, both Margaret Rutherford and Joyce Grenfell stayed in a nearby hotel and often visited the school in the evenings, where they would enjoy a real school student company. <br /> <br /> Although the movie script contains only two original lines from the original game, the leaders and supporters are in good shape and you can feel your compassion, especially in recent scenes.
