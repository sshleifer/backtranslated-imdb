If this film is different from the usual Hollywood movie, it is the real depth of feeling. For example, in Europe, we have had a war that has been going on for years, and although one nation was never able to destroy you, the old enemies always ended next to each other or at the end of the conflict. In the US, immigrants almost destroyed the population near the white population. The US citizen would never have to live with his enemies. This, in my opinion, explains the often simplistic nature of the Hollywood film when trying to explain the foreign dispute. But in this film, the director and scenario did not get into this clich√©. It turns out that everyone has the right and the wrong. it is a great story of morality, hidden truth and compromise.
