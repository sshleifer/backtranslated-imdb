This outstanding film has the best example of what you will ever see, and that alone will make it a must-see. The whole cast is great, but then it had to be up to date with Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep. It didn't take me a long time to grab this movie, and besides just the chamber scene, it's top-notch entertainment. This is a rare film that deserves the full Oscar recognition. Look at it for yourself and you will not be disappointed.
