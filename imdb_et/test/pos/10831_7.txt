It's a war-time drama - World War II, French and Jewish and Germans, but it's somehow funny. Director Jean-Paul Rappeneau wrote the script for his well-received "Bon Voyage" (2003). Unlike director Bertrand Tavernier's "Safe Conduct" or "Laissez-passer" (2002), wd Rolf Schubel's "grim Sunday" (1999) or wd Claude Berri "Lucie Aubrac" (1997), "Bon Voyage" is the same as its title sounds - c'est la vie (whatever) - and we have a nice talent to thank Isabelle Adjani. This is his gratifying force for the entire entertainment center (and attention), for all the reasons and consequences that made the film as enjoyable as it is. Hell, which is another landing of his plan and expectations, is once again worried about it. The story backbone rises around a pair of young enthusiasts: Grégor Derangère like Frédéric and Virginie Ledoyen (Francois Ozon of 8 women) than Camille. The incomparable Gérard Depardieu, the witty Yvan Attal ("My Wife is an Actress") and the versatile Peter Coyote (French, English and German) are some of the letters involved. <br /> <br /> There are many characters in this movie, and how all this is juggled is a skill that doesn't need analysis - Rappeneau is just a genius. The story is based on itself, on one episode on another, or even on overlapping events, but never confused - it's all a pleasure, somehow all the details appear on the screen and we just spit everything like a delicious French dessert, literally. There is excitement, thrills, delicate hesitant moments, and tense ominous fleeing, all playing in front of our eyes. <br /> <br /> Rappeneau noted the director's note on Sony Pictures Classics' Bon Voyage official website, as it is his most personal and successful work. The depiction of Bordeaux 1940 in his childhood memories is very close to his heart and he "worked on the script for almost 3 years." This film is a work of love everywhere, cast and a team that complements the director's passion and the passionate script of collaborators with director and his son Julien - Gilles Marchand, Patrick Modiano and Jérôme Tonnerre. > <br /> Gabriel Yared's music (varied from his earlier movie point, such as "English Patient" or "Talent Mr. Ripley"), who gave a suitable subject that kept the pace and rhythm of the plot - almost like a train that goes unnoticed, reflecting Adyni Viviane's lively energy (even if he is tired), keeping him as he meets, whatever comes, walking with high and stylish clothes always, not looking back, not to mention twins. <br /> <br /> Ah, we must not forget the wonderfully translated, skilful subtitles by Ian Burley, who also made subtitles for films in Italian: "Bread and Tulips" (2000) aka Pane e tulipani, "The Last Kiss" (2001) ) aka L'ultimo bacio and Tom Tykwer "Heaven" (2002). <br /> <br /> If you find this too easy war-time drama, try Mdx Mäx Fäberböck's "Aimée and Jaguar" (1999, in German, with a real story, with Juliane Köhler as Aimée and Maria Schrader Jaguar.)
