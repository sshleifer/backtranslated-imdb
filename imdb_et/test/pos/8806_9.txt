Human traffic is a view of the average weekend of a group of friends, an alternating view of your life (and mind) that shows you how this fellowship relates to each other. There are many moments that anyone can associate with, as you are on the sides of the skull and talking about complete rubbish to strangers. Characters are all people you can associate with and they are believable in the role they play in the movie. The situations in which they are is all the situations we all have found and where this film succeeds. Gender and drug issues are perfectly addressed so that they cannot communicate between them. The story of the movie is not all that, but it is not a criticism. It's a movie about people. It is a well-written film for which there is a soundtrack. D.J's Pete Tong has created a great selection of songs for this file, all of which make it one of the best films I saw in 1999. After watching this movie, I felt like I had a party all weekend. Fantastic movie! Jo Brand as the Voice of Reality - You Need to Tell More! <br /> <br />
