Shuai is a clever and young young Beijinger, who has a punkish hairstyle who lives in a lively selling of cheap books on the stall in the domestic market. He doesn't seem to have anything in common with a researcher, a middle-aged, a future intellectual, Zhang - and these two will end up with a restaurant where the pro and con'd of the murders are discussed (perhaps the Chinese title may translate better than Talk It Over). If this makes it a pedestrian sound, do not be misled: this film has been invented abundantly on its plot and mostly runs at break speed (although the pace ends quite badly). <br /> <br /> If you only know Zhang Yimou's worthy historical dramas, such as Raise The Red Lantern and Shanghai Triad, or his latest martial arts epic, Hero and Flying Daggers, then you will be surprised; Whatever you have seen in your other films, you will be surprised to be pleasantly surprised - it is by far the most original, original and experimental work. It was fired within a few weeks from the minimum budget, almost entirely at Beijing's location (and a number of traditional Beijing members were used on smaller support roles - even by the director himself), and mostly hand held the camera, which is a nervous, hyperkinetic style that is a million miles of the elegant formality of his best-known films . <br /> <br /> OK, I live in Beijing, so I find all the joy of everyday life with unusual little details that I will recognize and enjoy (though it was '97, and things are changing so fast here), but i really think someone can evaluate this movie. I saw it, as I have so many other Chinese "comedies" in a movie club that displays versions of the latest Chinese films almost exclusively for emigrants; and this is the only one I remember where the audience laughs out loud. Some non-Chinese audiences may be somewhat strange, at times somewhat uncomfortable, because it includes some violence, and after opening as a mood, a dirty romantic comedy mutates much darker on the other side. But it is very, very funny. <br /> <br /> It has also worked perfectly for two executives, especially long-lasting Zhang Yimou partner Jiang Wen, who is probably the most important film star in Mainland China and has a whore screen presence that resembles a young Depardieut or De Nirot . <br /> <br /> Watch this movie - to prove that China is a sense of humor that can be translated into other cultures to prove that Zhang Yimou is much farther than one-trick pony ...... and thoroughly time.
