This is an important historical film because it was the first feature film. <br /> <br /> The film was only $ 23,000. <br /> <br /> It released over a million dollars from its release. <br /> <br /> This movie helped to define the gangsters melodrama that became the bread and victory of Warner's studio in the eighties. <br /> <br /> The popularity of this film ended the silent era more than its most famous part-talkie predecessor, Jazz Singer. The film deserves its place in history and not just a footnote. <br /> <br /> The only actor who remembers today is Eugene Palette.
