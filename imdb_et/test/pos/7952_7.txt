Korean "romance" camera store owner who has been diagnosed with a deadly disease. As she goes about her daily life and prepares, she gets to know a young girl who is a customer. Friendship and romance grow, the eve, though not expressing any other affection. A good movie, unlike what you probably remade in America, just because the studios would require the "couple" to act in the spirit of their feelings. He does not say anything because he does not have the time to live because he has not done so and he does not react as he thinks. Of course, this is much more complicated if I do it and, frankly, what you should discover for yourself. Is this a great movie? No, but it's good that moves you emotionally. The last lines of the movie still haunt me: "I always knew that love disappears like a photo - but you stay in my heart when you're at the last moment. Thank you and goodbye." This may seem uncomfortable in the context, but in the context of the film, it is very touching.
