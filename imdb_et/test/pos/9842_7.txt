This is one of the social dramas that WB knew about how to assemble and hit the boxoffice in the thirties. This early "dead child" is sent to a reform school where they are treated wrongly. Cagney, a gangster as part of the deal, is called a school commissioner. He does not take it seriously at first, but changes and makes the necessary changes to improve the lives of boys. The idea is to give boys to the government and manage their community. Whether it's a solid social reform, it's not my conviction, but it's a movie. It is much like a city of boys with a slightly darker tone. An inexperienced happy end query that affects the scene well before, but is still good. WB would later make these same movies with Bogart Cagney / father.
