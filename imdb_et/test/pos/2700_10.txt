I have been looking at the king from the beginning, and I felt it was neglected for awards. This show has the best humor that can be identified with characters, we're talking a lot about this job because I work a lot like IPS, (DHL), and we just love Teamster plugins! Carrie is my hero, he's the best, he just puts it out, no matter what the subject. Arthur well what can you say? He just breaks you down and really does things. Doug, well he's just so lovable and funny, three characters, and all friends make the show complete. This is the best television comedy! I'd say there with Seinfeld and hey, there's nothing wrong .... Great !! like Doug would say.
