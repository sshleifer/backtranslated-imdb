Chucky (deadly doll "Child's play" and 2 fucking sequences) is dead. But his former girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) gets her remnants and (using "Voodoo for Dummies") revives her. Then, because of the fact that her soul is being put on another doll, she is killed in SHE. Together they fall in love and robbing a nice pair (Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl) to bring them to Chuck's coffin to get an amulet that Chucky and Tiffany real people again ... <br /> <br /> Much better than it sounds. After the last two queues of the "Child Game" (both were terrible), I was expecting the worst, but it was really fun. The film does not take the second second seriously (seriously - how is it?) And the lines and situations are actually pretty funny. There are also some very nice murders that are throwing us to the horror fans and the movie never ends. The film also has some things that are usually not found in a horror movie - the best gay friend (Gordon Michael Woolvett) who is intelligent and did not play laughs and the sequence in which Stable has his shirt turned off to show his muscles to the body. John Ritter also has a nice firefighter like a sheriff. <br /> <br /> Actress is good - Stable is young, very beautiful and pleasant; He does not have much to do, but it is pulled out and Brad Dourif (Chucky voice) and Tilly are as fun as murder dolls. My favorite thing is when the dolls have sex (do not ask) and he asks for a rubber and he says, "But I am MADE OF Rubber!" Special effects are good (there are no Cous CGIs here) and it is one of the few horror films that interrupt humor and violence fun. Worth a look. I'll give it 9.
