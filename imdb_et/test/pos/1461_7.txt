This is a very strange series with Dean Learner. I really didn't understand the guests. I knew they weren't serious, but were they really unclear because ... I think I'm just that stupid. I don't know if such classes are a spoiler, but guests are not like Ali gis or something one man plays or I believe. I love the serious picture that he's going on. This similar program was on Sunday morning that I forget the name lol. I also like the suit and the mustache he has done. Its pretty hot. He's insensitive, one of the funniest features. I also like how he has a program subdivision. This makes it more sensitive.
