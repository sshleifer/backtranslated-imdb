I'm happily married to a 49-year-old woman who just happens to love this movie's death. <br /> <br /> The character of Geena Davis is strong, clever and tiring ........... I thought she did a great job in this movie (this is an underestimation). /> <br /> She is my alter-ego ............. when she starts firing this assault gun in an old hotel room ............ ....... I got chills ............... he did it the way he knew what he was doing ............ thats one my many favorites in this movie ........ <br /> <br /> I think he served the Oscar for his actors and physical roles ........ <br /> <br /> I have "CHARLY" tattoes on my back .............. I'm one of those girls who NEVER VICTIM ............................... .... I like her ............... (shhhhhhhhhhhhhh secretly ........ and it's not so sexy?)
