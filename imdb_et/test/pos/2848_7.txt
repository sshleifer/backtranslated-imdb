* spoiler * * spoiler * * spoiler * I found the movie amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it, I laughed a lot so the bottom line is that I recommend the movie.However, I have problems with what LaBute wanted to say. The plot is very simple.Betty (Renee Zellweger), a tough housing woman, sees her husband murdered and having forgotten all she had seen, follows the "true love" of the soap series character, dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Simple, but 95-minute movie storage is not enough. And here comes the big question. What is the film? The reference to "Ozi's Wizard" is evident.Betty and Dorothy are both from Kansas, while Dorothy has come to the conclusion at the end of this film that "there is no place at home", Betty does not come to the conclusion and at the end of the film we have wondered what she learned from her experiences is and the answer is just something. He doesn't seem to be affected at all. <br /> <br /> When the movie is a different reality and fantasy? could be, but the scenes dealing with this topic are short and not just a joke and not a serious plot line that can bring the movie to other places (and by the way, the "Truman Show" it was dealt with in a much better way.) <br /> <br /> The film may be about obsession. Betty is obsessed with the soap series and Charlie (Morgan Freeman) is obsessed with Betty.LaBute, who shows two obsessions and seems to forget that obsession, in any form, is dangerous and must be condemned. He seems to be a sympathy for Betty's obsession because he sees it as safe. <br /> <br /> The whole movie has scenes that could have been the subject of the whole movie in itself, but leave us to think without having any characters. <br /> <br /> The end is just a make-up that has nothing to do with what we saw before. It is a disgrace because the film could have been sharper if it was focused on one or two topics. a lot, but actually nothing says. <br /> <br /> What we have left is the feeling that we have seen a little movie, amusing and weird that could have been much more.
