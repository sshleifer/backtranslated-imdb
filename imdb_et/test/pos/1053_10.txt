Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast on what is in many ways a contemporary equivalent of Dickens' Christmas song in their sensitivity. The success of the film depends on the election of Sydney Greenstret as a character of Alexander Yardley. Yardley is a modern equivalent of Dickens' Scrooge in the way he controls his employees - until the Christmas change over him. This role is a "walk in the park" for Greenstreet, one of Luntsi's most famous Falstaff. Greenstreet had only filmed films five years earlier than 61 when he became a film classic, and the first and best film John Huston has ever directed "Malta Falcon." "Cuddles" Sakall was probably better than ever in his traditional role as an average European gemutlicheit. The attractive set used in most movies is a prominent pearl.
