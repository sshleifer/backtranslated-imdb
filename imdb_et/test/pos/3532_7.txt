I was postponing buying this DVD from buying this DVD? one thing because I was somewhat submissive of the two other horror texts of this director (SQUIRM [1976] and BLUE SUNSHINE [1977]), but also the fact that, according to the film itself, it is a bit of a clipped set of Media Blasters / Shriek Show 2 discs! I started to rent it now and I'm glad I did? not only is it better than previous efforts (at least for this initial assessment), but I also found that film is one of the better imitations of CHAIN ​​SAW MASSACRE (1974) in Texas. However, this factor helped me remind me that I have looked at another such example? Wes Craven Classics THE HILLS HAVE EYES (1977), 2-Disc R1 Edition from Anchor Bay I bought a while ago, but after all, the time for Halloween is approaching ... <br /> <br /> the background atmosphere (it was shot in Oregon's forest and mountain areas)? many effective rooms all the time, but fortunately not too much violence (even when the last villain is sent in a rather outrageous way!). The main young man here (one of those who was played by Jack Lemmon's son, Chris) is not as reluctant as we usually meet in offering this type of genre? despite being freely living in shenanigan, one of the teenagers is tied with staples that are generally up to date! George Kennedy seems like a sympathetic Ranger; although he does not have much to do, his characterization has been dramatically increased, making him a lover of plant and animal husbandry. It is remarkable among locals that the familiar character actor Mike Kellin has a beautiful role to play as a drunk, who for the first time comes into contact with the murderous duo of narrative? his warning to the teenagers, of course, goes unnoticed, but later he will be able to lead them to Kennedy. <br /> <br /> The hermetic family in which teenagers are exposed in the woods has finally discovered that it hides the skeleton in their closet. While one of the girls shows real curiosity in the presence of the intruders, are the rest of them hostile to the public? and in the case of moor and relaxed twins, this is appropriately creepy (one of them is even inclined to manic laughter during his ramps); At some point in the story, Ranger even offers an interesting explanation of the nature of their aggressive and generally civilized behavior.
