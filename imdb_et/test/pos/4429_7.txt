I think the title of the movie describes it well. if you are looking for a documentary in louis twain and his work, you have to look somewhere else. although some of this is covered with this film. <br /> <br /> Of course I eat a lot of what I feed, and I don't know much about family history about this incident. so I believed I was told Nathaniel and his father, and so on. <br /> <br /> About this movie, I thought it was pretty good. a bit slow and attention-grabbing time, I want nathaniel to be a little more focused on her father's work than his family's drama (although a lot of history was interesting, Louis was a little player). <br /> <br /> It is really a journey through someone's life and I had the pleasure of marking the experience. for me, and so the filmmaker seems to have a learning experience. <br /> <br /> Oh, and some twins work is a * stunning *
