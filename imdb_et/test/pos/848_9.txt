Gene Roddenberry will never let his fans down. His death ended with a Sci-Fi legacy that can never be matched. Earth: The ultimate conflict was proven! His pilot film and the first two seasons were well written and carefully produced, but somewhere along Roddenberry. The loss of lead, Kevin Kilner (William Boone) certainly seized the series because he was an important part of what he did. The story includes the fact that the human race is visited by Taelons, an extraterrestrial race that calls itself "companions". After three years, they have given new technologies, useful information about the Universe and much more. Many ask their intentions here on Earth. The main links between Earth and Race are Da'an (Leni Parker) and he is the most trusted Taelon for many. Questions arise: why are they here? What are their goals, is Da'an aware of all suspicious plots against people? There is an underground group led by millionaire industrialist Jonathan Doors (David Hemblen), who uses his millions to study Taelons. By the end of the first season, things are doing well, Da'an seems reliable, Boone assists in Doors research, working with Da'an and Taelon. In the middle of the 2nd season, things are getting rid of and once a terrible and exciting series of spirals down, mainly because Roddenberry was dead and was not about to run by manufacturers, of whom his wife Majel Barrett-Roddenberry was co-producer. However, the first season is interesting and fun.
