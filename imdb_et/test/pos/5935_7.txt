A reverent royal rumble event <br /> <br /> 1. Edge Vs Shawn Michaels <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 Very strong opener ... The edge wear was superb as it was during the thundering event. 2. Undertaker Vs Heidenreich CASKET MATCH <br /> <br /> 7/10 many people hated this rivalry, although I liked it, I thought heidenreich played his character well. The match was not an amazing excitement that was up to the rabbit and snitcky involved. It will get better if it continues. <br /> <br /> The 3rd Kurt Angle Vs Big Show VS JBL (WWE CHAMP) WWE TITLE MATCH <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 is an amazing game because there was only one exciting sound. .. very good title fits .. good pace .. though predicted end. But not all the royal thundering title predictable. <br /> <br /> 4. Triple H (WORLD TITLE) Vs Randy Orton WORLD TITLE MATCH <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 really not as good as the guys involved, too many dry spots went, orton sold its irritation amazingly, but ended up being anti-climax. <br /> <br /> 5. ROYAL RUMBLE EVENT ... btw other competitions had a couple of segments ... two that were really cool ... price rapping Christian and guerrero stealing flairs number 30 entry ticket. the event was good 7/10 would have been 9 if the price won, but unfortunately wins my biggest enemy batista (THOUGH I UNDERSTooD MIKS) ..vince comes and falls and laughs in the whole arena.
