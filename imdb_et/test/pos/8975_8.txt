Aaron Sorking raises the same questions as Shakespeare did or does. How could they learn so much about the inner functioning of the palace. Sorkin opens up surprising doors here, hardly shocking, but it seems to confirm our worst fears. Everything is so casual and at the same time directly responsible for the lives of so many people. Swollen Tom Hanks speaks in one way or another that things can be manipulated with a semi-pure intention, but without weighing the consequences, and Julia Robert's blonde in the southern hairstyle reminds us of the abandoning abilities. The subject is serious, but the treatment is light, smart, but easy. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as an invisible middle man, steals every scene he has, as Charles Laughton did for every movie he had. Dialogue is fast, but not fast enough so we can't catch up and find that it's not an ordinary comedy. The seemingly casual pace, full of ghosts and provocations, gives Mike Nicholi another honor.
