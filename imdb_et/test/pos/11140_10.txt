I'm awed by actress Bobbie Phillips and her great skill as an action star! This movie is driven by his wonderful actor and terrible action. I'm a sci-fi fan, but I have to say that this movie goes beyond the movie movie and mostly the actress whose presence replaces a plot that's good, but nothing new. Although this film seems to have been made for television, I think it is better than most of the theater's films.
