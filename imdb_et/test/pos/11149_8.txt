Having recently purchased Universal Marlene Dietrich's DVD collection, I was somewhat reluctant to look at the "golden earring". The idea of ​​a 40-seat Marlene Dietrich in the Romantic Wartime Romance seemed unusual and unlikely. I shouldn't have worried. It is really hard to stay with the professional talent that has come to these old films. The film was a joy to watch; it's classic. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this movie was Dietrich, who pulls out the role of the Roma. Makeup, lighting, photography and her performance all give a truly amazing and memorable character. I've never seen Dietrich playing an unprecedented "good" woman - but she's here! He played a lot of heartless vamps in these big Sternberg films, so it's refreshing to see him in a more downward, relaxed role, playing an exotic but very human character. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a very nice romance. The love story is a credible, optimistic and happy ending is extremely satisfactory.
