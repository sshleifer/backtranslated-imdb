After 7 films with Mickael Curtiz (Robin Hood's adventures are their best achievement), Errol Flynn was tired of his dictatorial direction and decided to work with great Raoul Walsh. This reunion is a happy thing for cinematography. THE BIRTHDAY REQUIREMENTS is their first and best film together. Raoul Walsh depicts General George Armstrong Custer (Errol Flynn) from his debut at West Point, the Civil War and finally the Battle of Little Horn. It's true that the film has a hero portrait of Custer, but that doesn't matter. What matters is that we are being transported with literacy and writing skills. Who can forget about California Joe, the great "Queen's own Buttler" with her song "Garryowen", about Mrs Custer (Olivia de Havilland), a diabetic Sharp played by Arthur Kennedy? <br /> <br /> An eternal blow to this epic and tragic fresco.
