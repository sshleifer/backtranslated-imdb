This movie was definitely written for FF VII fans only. I'm someone who has never played the original game and watched it with a friend who was a serial fan. From a visual and technical point of view, this film is as good as "Ghosts inside", if not better, but from the point of view of the story I was pretty lost. One of the great weaknesses that seemed to me was the scene where the three Yenovites brought "all" children to the healing of geostigma. Everyone said there were about 15 children everywhere ... Hmmmm ... I thought that Geostigma was a disease of pandemic diseases ... I understand why they did it (time, budget, CPU), but it just seemed after all explains how bad guys gathered all those who had Jenova cells so that Jenova could be reincarnated. The version of our subtitles we had on the Internet was a pretty direct translation, and so my confusion would probably be added. <br /> <br /> It was my interest in FF VII and spent a few hours reading the FF VII wiki about the main characters and the plot. When I read the Adventist Wiki, things made much more sense. If you are a video game or a Sci-Fi fan, this movie is a pretty good flick, but as the previous review said, it comes out as a 90-minute fight. You never know any characters, and the story just seems to jump from scene to scene without much explanation, although some explanation may just be necessary. Thank you for the goodness of wikpedia.
