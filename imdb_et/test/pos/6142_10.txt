I like the earlier description of this movie as a poem of life. Last night, I got this movie on the channel completely randomly, and it was fascinated enough to keep all the way there. For the film, there is really only a unique voice, a poem of narrative that is meaningless without failure. There are also many fun moments during the Wirey High School days that are raw without potty humor. It is sad that this movie is so low. The fact that there is so much 1 makes me think that the numbers are boiled - I don't see anyone seeing the movie as being sad. Of course, this is not a typical romantic comedy, but it is a very unique sight of a very unique life, a man whose appeal is his isolation, the departure that he must destroy before. Give it a flick chance. It came out for me and I feel richer.
