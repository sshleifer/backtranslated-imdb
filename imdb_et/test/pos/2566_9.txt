then you are a big fan of this movie. Its almost the same basic concept, a nice mix of music, soul and drama. I admit that I was a little frightening about seeing this movie, I only saw previews of the white trash bundled in the radiator, but I'm a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I liked Hustle & Flow so I thought I'd give him a chance. <br /> <br /> I'm very glad I did. It turned out that this was the story of the sister of the nymphomania's southern girl, imprisoned for more than 60 years. The story was in the heart and was very influential. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie also added a nice touch. Craig Brewer mixed his style with Hustle & Flow into this movie, except for the new spin and used Blues. His musical scenes are still at the top of the charts. He also has a very interesting setback set and it gives you a feeling of madness during some of the most controversial scenes. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, if you liked Hustle & Flow, you'll love this movie and if you are a blues fan you should definitely see. I give her 9 out of ten very interesting movies and it's highly appreciated. shame. <br /> <br /> Go out and rent this movie.
