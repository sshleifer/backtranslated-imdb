Don't let any comments (critics, IMDb users, or mine) affect you when you see this movie. I only read the plot's premise and was interested. After watching this movie, I think it's definitely worth it. It gives a perspective to life that many have probably not considered. It is not, however, as Leland himself says, a film that "can be packaged in clean packaging with a belt and everything." Other reviews of the users of this website claim that they have a psychological background and that this means that the story is not feasible. Obviously, they were stuck with the whole point of the movie, which is disappointing. At least say. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a well-functioning, well-directed film. The story is not a good feeling, but I feel that you do not feel away from the movie if you do not feel well. To characterize it as an "art house", I find it unfair, but because our society likes labels, it is probably the one that suits it. If you find that you know everything you need to know about the world, I would recommend skipping it. If you feel that movies should be a "world" escape ... ... you won't find it here. But if you look at it ... you can just find something about yourself.
