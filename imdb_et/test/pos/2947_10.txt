A fantastic documentary. Movie in the movie. I'm as glad as Block was lit after his mother's death. Makes one wonder of the time and money spent on treatment. What could have happened if he didn't have this outlet? Did the therapist help him or just supported the addiction that kept his bank account? The audience must understand that divorce was less in these days. She was a housewife - instead of treatment she went to college or workplace training. He seemed to be stuck with the situation. I don't know if the therapist has tried to think about what he could have done to change his situation and get free? Meanwhile, woman # 2 was just the opposite. He was there, working with his father; finished his bad marriage, supported himself and seems very confident in giving to man. Regardless of the state of the marriage, the blocks did something right, raising 3 children who could look at their parents' story, be well connected to it and share it with us, and maybe lead us to start chatting with their parents and spouses.
