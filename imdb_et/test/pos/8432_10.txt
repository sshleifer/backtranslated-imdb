Highly politically charged drama, biased, is very well handled and one of the most intelligent films. It does not contain almost any preaching, but follows a naive TV reporter who will gradually realize the imminent threat of nuclear power plants, not because of the inherent threat, but because the shredders are more interested in the bottom line than their safety. Many hated the movie because they saw it as a political affair made by ultra-liberals like Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas, but if you look at it just as drama, it is thrilling, exciting, full of well-developed characters, and finally a really tight modern thriller that hits home. <br /> <br /> Historical remark: For some, especially in the energy sector and the residents of Harrisburg, PA subway, it may have hit home a little too close, as less than a week after the release of this film, a devastating explosion of three million nuclear installations took place. <br /> <br /> Update, 04/08/2007: Over a decade after this, I wrote criticism, I've heard a lot of comments about the movie. One thing that I think is really necessary is that this film is not an "ultra-liberal" anti-nuclear weapon that is often labeled. <br /> <br /> Although creators and stars are (or were) significant "Hollywood agency" liberals, this film is not about the idea of ​​nuclear power, but rather about the idea of ​​human greed, corruption and fraud, which questions the potential dangers of nature, what nature has already made dangerous. Anyone who accepts reality cannot claim that human exposure to nuclear radiation is at least quite likely to be lethal. My close friends, who have worked for a number of years at a nuclear power station, even told me about the official policy of their employer about the maximum safe exposure levels that his employees can handle. <br /> <br /> You don't have to believe that businesses are evil in nature to accept that individuals are greedy and often corrupt to gain wealth and power. And even if you refute this statement, you can't argue that all people are prone to make mistakes. When it comes to getting innocent people into nuclear radiation, we cannot afford to make mistakes, and that what this film is trying to do is more than anything. <br /> <br /> Condemn it if you need to, but try to be few. We are currently dealing with war, the current results of which are quite different from those originally predicted. And do you feel that the war was necessary to fight global terrorism, you cannot challenge the fact that the length of human life, financial costs and, most importantly, the loss of human life have exceeded many levels that "experts" confirmed so even if no one is greedy nor corrupt, then "mistakes were made" and quite serious mistakes. Similar serious mistakes, if allowed in the nuclear sector, can make most of the earth's surface uninhabitable.
