LATE SHIFT was interested in the HBO film, which looked in detail at the power struggle between David Letterman and Jay Leno, when Johnny Carson announced his retirement and both wanted to replace him. This fight is now part of Hollywood folklore, but for those who don't know the story and know where Letterman is now, it may be interesting to know that David Letterman wanted Johnny Carson to replace TONIGHT SHOW as more than anything in the world, but Letterman found that he was Dreams were rolled out as frequent guest receivers, Leno, was one of Hollywood's most powerful representatives, Helen Kushnick, and worked tirelessly to get her client to work. It's not often that we can see behind the scenes Hollywood machinations revived the entertaining value, but for the fans of these two late-night superstars, this film gave an astonishing look to the very late night television. According to this movie, Carson himself allowed Letterman to work, while NBC promised to work for Leno and Helen Kushnick came in. The film presents Leno as a milquette who promised to manipulate his career with Kushnick. ignorance of some of Helen's strong deliberate manipulations by some of NBC's greatest power players and presenting to Letterman the wise and meaningless businessman who, despite Carson's support, was NBC and Kushnick. John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck reliably create Letterman and Leno, but this is Oscar's winner Kathy Bates's sharp-edged Helen Kushnick, who captures the film. Bates commands the screen in one of her best, if not so well-known, performances as a poisonous Hollywood agent who eats TV studio leaders for breakfast. It also has an impressive impression of impressionist Rich Little Johnny Carson, but it is mainly an exciting story and Bates' powerful performance that makes it worth the worth.
