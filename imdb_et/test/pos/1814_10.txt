We still really love the movie "Valley Girl". I have owned the eons for its owners and released the original soundtrack. I have several friends with whom I get together, and we have "80s Raves" parties where we can play and play 80s music and launch "Valley Girl" on the big screen - and we're all in our 30s. We have AWESOME time. <br /> <br /> It's all fun, as you know?
