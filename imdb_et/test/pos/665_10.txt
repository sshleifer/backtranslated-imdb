It is in the 1980s and teenagers are ready for a party in a frightening old house that is declared to be a mockery of the ghost of McGee. After the children have erroneously surrendered the unfinished conversation on board Ouija, the children are forced to fight death by fighting the revenge of a ghost who owns and kills all his friends one by one. Sound familiar? It should be. It is clearly marketed to respect the classic 80s slasher with the label "Excessive violence. Voluntary nudity. Zero budget". <br /> <br /> Not enough; It's pure entertainment! I liked the humor and the way it made fun for all the horror customers, but at the same time it was fun for the movie. With this movie, you get something you never got with 80-year-old movies: good actors. The whole cast was very talented and you don't see it with very low budgets, recently or otherwise. There were many chemistry between the characters. I was very entertained throughout the film and I am fully convinced that the writer / director and the directors will go a long way in their career. The script was very well written and the dialog flowed naturally. </Amend> I know it right now. This movie makes its mistakes politely overlooked and simply sit and enjoy. Although this is not an Oscar-winning opus, he never claims it is, and props to it. This is fun. If you like slashers, you really appreciate this movie. If you like blood and boobies, you will appreciate it too.
