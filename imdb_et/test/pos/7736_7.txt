William Shakespeare apparently did not imagine Stephano as a gay doctor, Antonio's incredible wife, or Caliban as a Trinitron guitar, but Bard had a worse job over time, and maybe even enjoy a vital lifestyle that's his "Tempest" that has been redesigned Paul Mazursky and co-author Leon Capetanos. <br /> <br /> This time Prospero Philip Dimitrius (John Cassevetes), a Manhattan-based architect, tired of designing Atlantic City for casino-friendly Mafioso Alonso (Vittorio Gassman), especially after discovering Alonso with Philip's husband Antonia (Gena Rowlands) . With her daughter Miranda (Molly Ringwald), Philip Miranda and her new mistress Areth (Susan Sarandon) are escaping with a nice Catholic girl who struggles with Philip's celibate lifestyle. Will a sudden storm bring you to the end? <br /> <br /> Here's the idea of ​​a Cassevetes career: how many other participants could make the film so confusing? The film critic's sweetheart for his earlier work, often with his actual husband Rowlands, presents him with a central character who really carries his art here, but seems to enjoy him and make us enjoy him. It is not Prospero, but something rich and strange that makes it a terrible sea changes all of it. <br /> <br /> "It's all here," he says to one of his loyal companions, the Aretha dog Nino. "Beauty, magic, inspiration and serenity." That's it. "Tempest" goes to London in 1611 in Manhattan in 1982 and finds some nice resonance in Philip's displaced life. "Show me the magic," he calls the rushed city of skyscape and the Mazursky version, complemented by Donald McAlpine's purple sea forests cinema and, of course, the sunny Greek landscape, doing so. <br /> <br /> It's not an ideal movie, any way. In fact, the big finale, the only part of the film that follows Shakespeare's story with any faithfulness, is a mess. The character of Rowland is difficult to take care of in this film, and after Sarandon's visit to his entire brotherhood, it is difficult to understand Philip's continued concern for his wife, not to mention his left-wing desire to make an unhappy "sacrifice" to restore the natural order of things. <br /> <br /> But there is a lot of love for "Tempest". In addition to Cassavets, the Ringwald film debuts as his loyal but restless daughter, here as the object of a primitive rustic "Kalibanos" (Raul Julia). Ringwald is here a privileged adolescent teenage museum that inspires John Hughes, but with the emotional depths of those Hughes films did not come. Ringwald and Julia never got any Oscar attention, but both won the Golden Globe for their playful work. She tries to separate her on her island with her "Gunsmoke" television in Greek by harassing her 15-year-old body. <br /> <br /> "I want to let you get my bonny johnny," Kalibanos declares aside, but has won anyway anyway, especially after "New York New York" with goat bark. (When the "Tempest" hit the screens, Julia Broadway's toast was the "Nine" leader.) <br /> <br /> This is Mazurski's show, even though it sometimes seems that Cassavesi is working with improvised lines and emotional division. (Philip introduces himself to Areth, telling him "I am in the midst of a nervous system breakdown.") He plays his character as a friendly obsessive struggle to crystallize his happiness with a theater on his otherwise uninhabited island. /> <br /> The addition of fun is the rich result of Gassman as the other man who is as perfect as Julia, saying to Philip, affirmed to the youngsters: "The boys don't have as much foundation as we have. nervous ... and they love the old "Despite the fact that the spots are too long and conscientious, like so many art films," Tempest "is entertaining in its excess and traveling, very similar to Shakespeare, even though his dreams did not include the back of the smoking pot at the Go-Gose concert .
