I have to admit, thanks to this movie, what I'm afraid of mannequins. hahaha. <br /> <br /> Yeah, first of all, the operation of this movie, at least, my standard is pretty swollen. most of the participants are quite decent in their roles. The script also seems to be pretty good, sure there are some cheeses, but also some well-written characters and some fucking scary scenes. EYE EYE AFTER RECOMMEND that one scene with dude and dummies. yes, i say you should review this movie, it's pretty good and very fun. good clock. 8/10
