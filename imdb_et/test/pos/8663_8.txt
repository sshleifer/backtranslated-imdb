The bus drops to an unnamed person outside the empty Standard Oil petrol station located in the middle of the middle. We never learn where the bus came from, or why it is there or who it is. Why is he the only traveler? Is he a prisoner? Is he the "intrusive man" referred to in the movie title? Has he died and gone to heaven or hell? Like our man, we can't get a chance to stop and wonder. He has met with a goalkeeper and moves to a non-binding city. From the first day, all his choices are made. The apartment is rented, work is found, the agency is appointed. In fact, his life is not completely different from the virtual reality of an apartment and a suburban apartment. Women are heartless, dinners are dragged, office work sucks. But some pieces don't fit in the puzzle. Silently effective gray-clad goons run in the streets. Are they some kind of paramedics or a secret police? And why are there no children? Is the story even in the real world? If we think we can get some answers, new secrets will open up. The "conceivable man" leaves you half-eased that it's over, the parties want more. I hope they will quickly make it into a computer game.
