Almost none of the cinema experience is able to win a good thriller with a sense of humor. Geena Davis is a housewife teacher who suffers from amnesia. She's even a PTA! But then the car accident awakens the woman she used to be, and it's hot! Samuel L. Jackson is fun because the low-rent private eye who is trying to help Davis find his past just to find out he's over his head. Davis also has some fun features, and the communication between him and Jackson works surprisingly well. <br /> <br /> Search for Brian Cox, the original Hannibal Lechter, and finally David Moorse for his St. The film is directed by Davis' wife, who almost seems to have built the whole movie around her, but it works. <br /> <br /> I pull out this DVD and often download it again. I still love the makeup scene. Is Geena Hot or What?
