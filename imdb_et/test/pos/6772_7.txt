Good Lord ... How did it reach our DVD player? I never know ... my husband thought it was a new edition that he was missing ... Never been a couple of years old and Danish (I think ... ... He was looking for an English soundtrack ... <br /> <br /> All in all ... the movie wasn't bad ... Good product values, better performances and a smart story that's not too far for clean and dark tickets across the sea! The end will make you smile ... The movie is incredibly strange, which we really care about, makes a movie that can be worthy of you ... Without breaking the plot, the title of the movie and the DVD jacket will give you a good idea of ​​where it goes!
