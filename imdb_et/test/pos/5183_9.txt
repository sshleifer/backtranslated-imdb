Rosie Perez is in this very interesting case a leadership that is Mercedes, a young Brooklyn woman who has decided to become a film artist, although her situation is not favored by living in a sort of part in East Los Angeles and fighting many infertile hearings. Mercedes has agreed with married and washed actor Harry Harrelson (Harvey Keitel), who at one time had been on television in the Western Series in the 1970s and rarely after he was a lover, partly because of loneliness. and also with the hope that the film parts will come due to his "contacts", but these latter have little consequences, as Harry is simply in his deception in his quest to restore what he perceives as earlier cinematic recognition. In order to provide financial support, Mercedes is a taxi dancer at the Los Angeles Skid Row Dance Hall, where he continues his efforts to make a successful film business, and while in the dance ball, a young emigrant in Mexico, Ernesto (Michael DeLorenzo), falls in love with him and most of his narrative is his effort to ask him affection, even if it may mean losing it. This mostly traditional melodrama is quite moderate, despite a good number of well-known players, including Steve Buscem, Anthony Quinn and Stanley Tucci, and was held for about a year before its fairly widespread distribution and marketing activities on its behalf, more damage than its solid production features are firmly complemented by Alexandre Rockwell's admirable leadership, the consistent influence of his work, and the openness of the scene that is the address when opening this film. fitting behind a credit that includes Perez Skid Row on the fifth and main street. Rockwell has often shown that he is doing very well with his pain, and this is also true in this case, as he allows his participants to create their own roles, while the ads have been nicely executed during the editing process, resulting in the director's artistic success. despite some negative comments from some major evaluators. The film is aesthetically appreciated on the spot with a lot of Tito Larriva, who also plays a taxi dancer band as a boss. Awarding here must go to vital Perez, though nary is the result of a sub-parameter. The quality of all movies is fair when the viewer watches it twice in a short time. For many, this undervalued work is a great joy.
