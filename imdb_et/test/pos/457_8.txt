I've seen several Yul Brynner movies - but it's his best power because the camera captures his emotions close by, smiles and laughs. Brynner could have equally arrested ten commandments: Taras Bulba, Great Seven, Brother Karamazov, and Chaillot's crazy woman, but none of these films have hit their talents in the vicinity. He arrests and tantalizes to watch every shot. <br /> <br /> Equally exciting and sexy, without removing your clothes, is Deborah Kerr. The script allows him to express a sensuality that is not visual but hints - he repeated this role one year later at Iguana night. The film does not suggest that he sleeps with someone to help the group release the Russians, in fact, to show that he is away from the Russian major (unlike the story of Maupassand or the story of Isak Denisen). But the film breaks the character of Kerr, with the suggestive but real physical temptation. <br /> <br /> Kerrit, in my opinion, can never be considered a beautiful actor, but he is a great actor. He puts his soul to value his images, which often come into contact with the spirit of the character. This is a contradiction that makes her roles in Quo Vadis and Iguana memorable at night. <br /> <br /> Why is this an unusual film? In Hollywood, it is not easy to see that Russian characters depicted as good people - Dr. Zhivago was an exception. Abraham Polonsky was once again Brynner's horse thief Romance, but he never admitted it because of intolerance to the left in the McCarthy era. French actors Gerard Oury and Anouk Aimee - rub Jason Robards Jr and British actress Robert Morley on shoulders. The film is in many ways international as American. All four are great actors and entertainers. <br /> <br /> Those who have read the works of Maupassant and Denisen find that the film is not true, either work. But the film can be independent because its sanitary (censored) version has its own dignified charm, which is provided by the reality of the night that led to the release of the group. I think Litvak deserves the last laugh, offering an interesting and plausible twist story that led to the film making, including the bit of the story written by both (eg the last bus ride and the final kiss) <br /> sources that inspire stories? Until recently (eg Insomnia), original works have been highlighted as credits.
