Robert Florey and James Wong Howe gave this scary, expressionistic look. Scenes are shot at strange angles - especially with the scene and the written lady-killer Zachary Scott. His sociopathic behavior requires more than two decades of another great, medium-budget movie, The Stepfather. <br /> <br /> Whole cast is excellent, though its own guilt is not hard to think of as Joyce Compton as someone else, but the singer "The Awful Truth".) Scott, Bennett, Emerson, DeCamp a woman looking for pride) - they couldn't be up. <br /> <br /> A funny female woman's story behind a psychiatrist is a risky trick that costs beautifully. Nothing sounds at all. Nothing at all. <br /> <br /> The resolution is, unfortunately, little. Not Emerson with Bennett. That's logical. But Scott is being sent too fast. I see him more than Mr Ripley's character, who could have all escaped - botulism, murderer, jealous sisters - and lost that story to the big world. It would not have prevented the secretary and his superiors from having a happy ending.
