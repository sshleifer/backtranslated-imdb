I found this film to be one of those big-hearted warming gems. The story is tightly knit and fantastic! I'm still a big fan of non-US movies, and that's right there: "Happenstance", "The Closet", even "Hearts King". Vlastimil Brodsky as Fanda is fantastic. This is a love story in the sense of a true loving life and the turns that make the viewer understand / enjoy the view of Fanda's life (which almost costs him <br /> <br /> more than he is ready to give) are wonderful. His co-star Stelle Zazvorkova is unforgettable when she is a woman of her own. I recommend this movie to the whole family - my kids loved it.
