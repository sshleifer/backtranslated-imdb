I did it too. When I first saw the band, I left them immediately without listening to music. Then I bought one day when I knew curiosity, cd and fell in love with it. So I bought the video. Hold your lunch with the kids, it's not pretty beautiful! the video was great - a great way to listen to music, see some promo videos and meet the band ... though i still * don't know how they can handle these masks all the time! it must be for band fans and alternative music fans
