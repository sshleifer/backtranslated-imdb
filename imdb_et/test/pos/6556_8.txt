Uzumaki is a visually amazing film, but I felt that some of the songs could have been sacrificed. It is hardly a character to develop, which continued me personally separated from the movie, which is ironic, because all the plugs are discarded, this film really attracts you with its many small spiral effects and stunning scene transmissions. First, the general cinematography kicked me off, but when you get used to the overall look, you start to see the beauty of this twisted film. This is a great movie if you are looking for a viewer with too many substances or deeper meaning. It's a big horror movie that's not really scary or tense, but somehow ... eerie.
