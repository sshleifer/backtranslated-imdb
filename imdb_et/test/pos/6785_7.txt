Teenage girl gets her dream horse and is trained by former Jockey to attend London's Grand National Steeplechase. Perfect customization of a classic children's book, with a great, start-up Taylor as an energetic but polite young man. Rooney is OK as his coach, although he has some too melodic moments. Crisp and Revere are pretty good when Taylor loves parents. Filmed at Technicolor, it looks pretty. The problem is that there are bright elements, nothing very interesting and it drags a little too long. Race is exciting, but it could have been much more.
