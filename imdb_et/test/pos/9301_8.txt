The film seemed a bit slow at first. But it picked up and got right. It showed exactly how the government and the scientist claimed against humanity, and the reasons for the "gadget". I enjoyed it. It is very close to reality, like every movie about the Atom bomb that came down from Japan. I recommended it to friends. I was particularly pleased with Dwight Schultz's ability to act.
