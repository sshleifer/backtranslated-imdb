Ben Marshall, a religious servant with a religious background, is aware of the financial situation of her dominant mother Laura. He suggests that he find a temporary job in the household. In fact, the family has taken the widow to accompany them. Father Robert Marshall is a pastor of the local church; he would be in a country where they look at the birds as they tend to the souls entrusted to their church. <br /> <br /> Ben's work is related to the older actor Evie Walton, who wants her to do things around her. "Dame" Evie, as she calls herself, is a woman of a certain age whose career is dead because she was not so big. In fact, it seems that the only memorable look is the soap opera, which was popular, but he forgot about it. Evie, a compulsive liar, tells Ben that he's dying to just forget about it, later on, when he gets rid of the boy. <br /> <br /> Ben is clearly scared of his employer for a greater life. He has taken driving lessons. Evie asks her to take a camping trip, which she does for a better rating. He knows it provokes mother's rage. Not happy with Evie's decision to go to Edinburgh, where she is invited to read at an art festival. It is this trip that strengthens their bond. Ben can meet and taste the delights of meat with a sympathetic Bryony. <br /> <br /> When Ben gets back, everything will crumble at home. His mother, who has been a member of the church, decides to leave the family for the young man with whom he is affiliated. The relationship between Ben and Evie remains in the test of time. He will also see his father in different light. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Brock, the "Driving Lessons" and other memorable English movie writer, is taking his first production with this inclusive comedy. Working with the screen explores a mix of business and religion, loyalty and friendship with the exhibition that makes the movie a fun time. We have seen a similar situation before Billy Elliott, where Julie Walters plays a caring role for the younger man. We had read the film based on Mr Brock's own experience working with Dame Peggy Ashcroft when he was young. <br /> <br /> Julie Walters, who plays Evie Walton, is probably the best excuse to watch the movie. He always gives. Ms. Walters is a welcome presence in the movies she appears, and she miracles "fake". Laura Linney, a self-enlightening player, does not get her dual mother alone. Rupert Grint, famous for his Harry Potter films, plays Ben, a young man who sees Evie's kind soul. Nicholas Farrell is a betrayed father. Michelle Duncan has a small role to play.
