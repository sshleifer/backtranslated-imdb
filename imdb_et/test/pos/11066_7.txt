Saratoga Trunk is a 1945 film starring Ingrid Bergman and Gary Cooper. It is based on the great book by Edna Ferber in 1941. He could unconsciously bring the wind aside; part of the story reminded me of GWTW. <br /> <br /> In the 1890s, Clio Dulaine is an illegitimate child who returns from France to New Orleans with a flutter (Flora Robson) and a miniature name with Cupidon (Jerry Austin). He has given himself a county title and claims to be a widow. Her mother killed her father by accident and her family recovered her. Clio takes over the old farm with the idea of ​​torturing his half-sister and father's wife, which she does with great attention to herself. His plan is to marry someone who is very wealthy, who can give him the assurance and respect. Then he meets Clint Maroon (Cooper), a Texas player and falls to him. Both have a smooth relationship - and he has no money so he can't get married - so he leaves for Saratoga Springs. Finally, Dulaine's family is enough and their lawyer gives her $ 10,000 out of town. He does. He goes to Saratoga Springs and goes to Bart von Steed, the owner of the railway. But Clint is always around. <br /> <br /> Bergman is beautiful in dark hair and wears period costumes, and Cooper is this enchanting 300-watt smile. How he can resist him is over me. And love scenes - who, what chemistry! Supporting cast is great, Robson and Cupidon are creating interesting characters, and Florence Bates is a great result as a socially prominent woman who takes Clio under her wing, knowing she's a big fake. <br /> <br /> The film runs for a long time and some actors may seem outdated today, but it's a wonderful story full of atmosphere and lively performance. The end does not come as a surprise. It's a fun trip.
