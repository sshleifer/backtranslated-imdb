Just watched my hair after 20 years. It hit home. To those of us who tried to stand on the shoulders of civil rights and to fight for the rule of privilege and power; who opposes the fascism of the Johnson / Nixon administrations; who, as veterans of the civil war, fought the Vietnam War every day until the US beast died and fled; to anyone who didn't say in many different ways - it's remarkable when we failed. How big was the actual table where the Treat danced. How did the wizard drive behind the curtain. We were 20, 22, 24. We didn't know the nature of the enemy. Monster size, who counts and continues to eat the world for the next thirty years. How did we get? Even with smoke and bat (bat!) In our hands, like Treat, we were too young, too middle class, too invested, too much of the activities we hated. <br /> <br /> But there was a moment. As Andre Gregory watches at my dinner. . . In the late 1960s and late 1970s, there were a few moments or two where we might have found something other than the road of yellow bricks. There is nothing supported by Bechtel, prisons, Enron and Dick. Something to work with. Something innocent and critical at once. Something dancing. <br /> <br /> But we left it. Similar to Kong's curving, the "revolution" turned itself into. Sexism. Racism. Homophobia. And class breaking policy. Up to "W". Treat would have hated "W". And Iraq and pathological lies. If they were in this movie. Then. But the moment passed and "W" was almost inevitable. Comprehensive incompetence of intoxicated, robbed bulls in river estuaries, children's lives and Chinese stores. <br /> <br /> We should have done more. Something better. But we didn't know for sure what. <br /> <br /> What now?
