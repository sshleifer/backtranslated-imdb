The Milkwoman's story is simple, which can not be satisfied with love, despite the fact that, despite decades, it is still strong. Now 50 years old, Minako Obha (Yuko Tanaka) lives alone and works in two jobs ?? one as a cashier in a supermarket, another in a milkladine, doing your daily round in the Nagasaki Mountains. One of her stops is the house of a national official, Kaita Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe), who tends to remain her ill woman, Yoko (Akiko Nishina). Minako and Kaita saw each other as school students, but after the death of Minako's mother and Kaita's father, who seemed to be together, their relationship had been destroyed. However, Yoko in the sick bed knows that his wife's feelings of milkladite have not completely disappeared and, after Kaita's death, tries to construct tools to bring them back. While the story can be simple, the emotions it deals with and the tools it expresses really are where the heart and beauty of the movie is. The film takes time to show the simple daily routine of each character, recorded by an old lady who writes her story for a book, taking care of her husband with signs of dementia. In the process, it represents the social situation of people of different lifestyles, how they communicate with each other every day, how relationships develop and how the past and the present can come together. The director works on this excellent structure and visual style. It is only later in the film that the story begins to follow a more conventional and inevitably melodramatic path, as if it were indeed constructed to fit into the narrative structure of the book being written. It's all validated by the emotional depths of the film, which is most effectively represented by Yuko Tanaka's extraordinary performance.
