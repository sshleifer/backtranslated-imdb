This is one of those movies that I can watch over and over, but not tired of it. This is still one of the best comic books. I liked it even more than the X men. In fact, this film is perpendicular to the X-Men and Matrix, and it came out before. Wesley Snipes does a great job with Blade's character. He's not just an emotional super hero. Also, this film is not family-friendly to get the rating pg-13. Of course, comic books are mostly for kids, but I like some more in my movies. Let us be honest when we were in these situations so that we rushed to the storm to make it more realistic. There is also something in this comic book that many don't do. Good fight between evil and good boy. Let's face it, no Batman movie had a very good ending fight.
