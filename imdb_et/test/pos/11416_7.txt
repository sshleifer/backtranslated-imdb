Im a great horror fan and i pretty enjoyed this remake. By switching all these horrors, I believe this is one of the best attempts. <br /> <br /> I watched it with my two little sisters and I think it made it even better because they were pretty scared. Also shouting on the screen "Don't do it!", "Not so!", Etc. I thought there were good little moments and it built the tension well. <br /> <br /> Camilla Belle is an absolutely stunning leader and a very good actress - So she keeps your attention well. <br /> <br /> Generally a decent film.
