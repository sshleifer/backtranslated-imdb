I liked this movie. Except sister. He reminded me of Janice's friends. I could never really believe he was anything but reluctant. <br /> <br /> My main problems with the film were the delicate and brother-like end and the performance scene. Boy who fell out of an explosive car? Perhaps, if his hand were blown out and he ran to help silence and kissed him and hurried him to the hospital, maybe then I could have stopped. I think somebody needs to be killed. Mainly brother. She was just the ass pain. Or maybe the sister had to kill the man who silenced. I could even have bought a hero for killing a brother and ended up with two sisters being put on snuff. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching again and as I always say, it is much easier to be a reviewer than an author.
