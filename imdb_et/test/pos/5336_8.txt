Although it is not half as fun as "Chicken Run", the new Wallace and Gromid comedy "Cursed Rabbit Curse" (*** out ****) will laugh more than most live comedies. British director Nick Park, who created the characters of Wallace and Gromid and co-organizer Steve Box, relies on the old-fashioned, stop-motion method, best known as claymation, to create several visually charming characters more than enough side-splitting scenes for a cholestically mutant rabbit, to eat every visible vegetable. Fun, fun, is the heart of fun in an imaginative way that Park and the company have carefully constructed signs and gags with a clay called plasticine. Basically, every stroke you see in the "Curse of Dirty Temptation" demanded the patient's souls, which made small changes in the clay marks for a series of individual shots that joined with true joy. Hollywood began claymation as a form of animation as silent films of the 1920s, before the industry reversed the complex process. Aardman Studio animators managed to use only three seconds a day. For the record, "Curse of Rabbit" took five years to do. The little looking characters, with their thumb traces that are clearly visible in their clay compositions, can be seen as incredibly funny with their eyeliner and eye. Interestingly, Gromit is the funniest character, a lovable mole without a mouth, but an expressively expressive face that says more than most of the talking signs. <br /> <br /> Wallace and Gromit are Captain and Pooch respectively. The duo's human side is the moron looking for Wallace's mule without a rain that can somehow build machines that do quite incredible things. One of the funniest scenes shows the master and the pooch, which have aroused the system of rolling stock, hatches and spring handles that dress and eat them. In the meantime, Gromit is the animal side. The current joke is that Gromit shows more intelligence than his host genius. As good as his ideas and inventions, Wallace was unable to succeed without loyal to Gromid. Our heroes run a pest control company called "Anti-Pesto". Basically, they need to protect all herbal patches around a mile using an unpleasant-looking device called Bun-Van 6000, which literally sucks rabbits from their ground and into a large glass container. No, Wallace and Gromit didn't kill the bright ones. Instead, they keep them as pets and Wallace experiments with the "Mind-O-Matic" of the invention, which aims to make the rabbits carrot-angry. This "Frankenstein" meeting with "The Fly" approaches the poor Wallace in deep difficulty when he exchanges his brain bits with a rabbit. Not long after that, the mysterious high-rise terrace hides vegetable patches on full moon evenings and creates chaos for everyone, as the village's 517th vegetable vegetable approach is beginning. <br /> <br /> Initially, Wallace and Gromit Park's Oscar nominee, film school project "Grand Day Out" (1989). Since then, Aardman has released ten more animated short pants, including "Wallace and Gromit: Open Shaving" (1993) and Oscar Winning Wallace and Gromit: The Wrong Pants "(1995). Not only because it is a duo on the big screen The first two-thirds of "Were-Rabbit" are better than the last three, but Park and the company never miss an adult joke that children can't, but the attentive adults appreciate. " Wallace and Gromit: The Ghost of Ashes is a rabbit fun.
