One of the best romantic classics, teen deviyaan is a film that is all about the choice that equals your softest emotion, love. It is a simple story of a medieval man who came to his poetic talent and charming personality. She is interested in three women and vice versa, one Hindi film star, another rich lady and the third who lives in her neighborhood. <br /> <br /> The situation made him confused because he had to decide one of them. Ultimately, he goes to an astrologer and asked him who loves him the most. His confusion is no longer, and he knew a living lady in his neighborhood who really cares for him and loves him as his true love. Devanand played a leading role and has fully justified his contemporary romantic image.
