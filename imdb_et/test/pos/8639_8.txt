Wow, what a strange movie. This is David Lynch's movie, so it's no surprise that it's strange. <br /> <br /> I don't want to explain anything to this movie. I can't do that. After some research after this second movie, I feel a lot of story, but at first glance and without the help of other observers or external help, it's hard to understand. So if you're in this boat and confused, you don't feel bad; it is normal. Let me just say that the key to the movie is the nature of Naomi Watts. <br /> <br /> I find the film exciting. I love great visuals and rich colors and I find every character in this movie very different and fun to watch. Camera work is great and the music is creepy, la Lynch's "Blue Velvet". There are also some good sound effects to help with some dramatic scenes. All in all, this is a very good result. <br /> <br /> Like Lynch's "Twin Peaks" in the TV series, this movie ended up with a gap, because Lynch thought it was a long, drawn-out TV. If that didn't happen, he created that end at the last minute. This may cause some confusion at the end and no explanation of the characters we see in the movie before, but who mysteriously disappear. <br /> <br /> The theme of the story is said to be a negative comment about Hollywood and what he does to people, especially those whose dreams of an actor have been broken. <br /> <br /> Both Watts and the other leading lady, Laura Eleana Harring, are very interested in watching, especially their marked lesbian sex scene. Thinking of both women are chameleons who looked at the average time, stunning at other times. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie when I was watching it first. It's not just curiosity; it's a very intriguing movie ..... just don't feel stupid if you don't understand some things.
