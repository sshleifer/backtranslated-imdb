Peter Segal's 1995 commercial-classic Tommy Boy is a fun movie, an evergreen entertainer. Chris Farley is a talent we never forget! <br /> <br /> 'Tommy Boy' is a simple story that can be said in the most fun and smart way. Farley & Spade takes a trip full of unstoppable laughter, even Rob Lowe's part is funny. As a child, I remember Tommy Boy again and again. It has been my childhood favorite and it will always be. Even today, when it comes to T.V., it remains a tough hard fan. I am quite overwhelming about this movie. <br /> <br /> Segal's direction is super. Chris Farley may have died in 1997, but remains at least alive. What an actor! See her work "Tommy Boy", she is so pleased. Later he made fantastic performances in films such as "Berverly Hills Ninja" and "Almost Heroes", but his work here is still the best to date! Love you, Farley! However, Spade is as good as ever. He's a great actor in every sense! <br /> <br /> Tommy Boy Rules .... 100 thumbs from this writer!
