At the end of Cache's review, I wrote that I was interested in Hanek as a filmmaker. This led me to La Pianist's DVD, which I just watched half an hour ago. <br /> <br /> This is all expressed in IMDb and many external reviews - gruesomely twisted pathology that "creates" an individual, such as Huppert's Erika, who, after years and years, still tries to calm his mother and at the expense of all other life, starting with him. He has repressed everything that would liberate him from self-evident slavery, including, of course, his sexuality, which has literally fallen into insanity, where he can no longer even understand what a real loving impulse is like. <br /> <br /> This is a graphical portrait of a serious emotional scratch that has never been able to get out of childhood and become an adult. I think this is a subject that concerns us all - we are all trying to achieve autonomy, but there are needs, so many conflicting needs, most of which are not even on the conscious level. It also works perfectly with the contrast between the sexual and the reality of their fantasies, and the consequences of sharing sexual fantasies with other people. Huppert characterizes what he asks in the film, and it is hardly possible that he would have portrayed it. <br /> <br /> As for the much-discussed scene in the bathroom: I really appreciated how this section had all the possible erotic rewards (for the viewer what I mean) because of pulling it out of the previous scene where he put a glass in the girl's pocket. By the time he has his own vision-it-this-man-on-worthy scenario in his bathroom, we have already found that he is dangerously disturbed and that it is not turned on, his little dominance session among our poor I think that the unbelievable achievement of the movie is how I forgot that it wasn't halfway through the fact that it wasn't in English and that I read the subtitles. It has never happened before, in any foreign movie, and I've seen quite a few. <br /> <br /> In a movie like cache, the end hasn't ended with a nice little regular bow, but unlike Cache, we get at least some finality, even though we don't even know if Huppert is his alive or dead. After La Pianist's experience with Michael Haneke, it goes without saying that more than a little bit of interest.
