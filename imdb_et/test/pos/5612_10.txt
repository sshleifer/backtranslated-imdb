Hal Hartley from the European Film Series is one of his two or three best efforts and luckily one of the few available on DVD. Only 63 minutes of driving time would be my only number with Hartley. I always leave more to wish, but never as much as I do today. Martin Donovan is amazing as Jesus. PJ Harvey is beautiful and interesting than Magdelena, but for me the highest point was Thomas Jay Ryan (Henry Fool) as Satan. Hartley provides him with an excellent dialogue and the opportunity to use his full voice. Look for three scenes where the microphone is waiting for her as if the devil were to win the poem. I have read other comments about this movie and I had to add a mine because there is not enough praise. If you like Henry Fool, Martin Donovan (against sex) and / or very smart comedies based on biblical ideas, get it as soon as possible.
