I had never heard of this movie, but I like Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown and the story sounded interesting, so I thought I'd give it off. I found it very enjoyable. Heath Ledger is a 19-year-old who works with some outrageous work and wants to start doing a serious dough, so he goes and asks Bryan Brown for a job. I'm not going to go into details, but things get very bad for Ledger and get into great trouble with Bryan Brown. The film gets better and better, with one scene that includes the Ledger bank robbers. And don't forget the beautiful Rose Byrne, who plays Ledger's love interest. I definitely recommend this movie.
