Judith Ivey as an old whore is amazing. Emily Grace is a young girl. It is innocent and exciting because he learns what goes down. Great direction and camera. The story is dark and disturbing. Support is good. Shows what happens and can happen with bad luck. Great independent film. Small cast. At first, the pace is slow and then moves well. A good movie to show off your teenage daughter who wants to leave home early on for an open road and adventure. This film, the film, has this little feeling, but it works because of the low life and the people that these people move. I'll never stop with the rest, thinking about this movie and checking my tires before they go.
