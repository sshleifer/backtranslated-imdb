This show is amazing! I love every episode. Carrie is a laptop and Doug is lovable and at times pointless. Arthur, Spence, Danny, Deacon and Carrie's Boss just add a nice ending to the show, linking all the funny pisss in their pants for a moment. In one season, Doug tries to get Carrie drunk because he's more beautiful than he's drunk. Nice wife right? Carrie is not much better than his boss needs an IPS driver, who in a small case would admit, Carrie hesitates because he looks at Doug as a slut and doesn't want him to be ashamed, so he hires Doug's friend instead. A woman of the year. But whoever I think is more funny is a rather casual Arthur. He's fallen out of fun and angry. Hey, you would be too much if you had to live in a basement where the boards have a funny smell and it makes you dizzy. This exhibition is fun and if you haven't seen it yet, you haven't lived!
