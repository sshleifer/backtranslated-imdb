In April 1947, the New York epidemic was in crisis. Eugene LaBar, a carpet importer arriving in Mexico, had arrived in the city, bringing a deadly pox virus. He stumbled out of the bus, complained of fever and headache, and soon died in Midtown hospital, but not before he had infected a dozen passing. The damage was already done; For the first time in decades, smallpox looked on the streets of New York. The city health authorities acted quickly to isolate the patients and contain the virus by introducing a free vaccination campaign that saw over six million New Yorkers immunized against smallpox. Due to their rapid response, the virus had a minimal sacrifice. Nonetheless, the outbreak must leave an indelible mark, followed several years later by two similarly themed movie thrillers, where doctors in millions of cities have to find one infectious carrier: Elia Kazan in the panic streets (1950) and Earl McEvoy with lower budget "The Killer That Stalked New York" 1950). " <br /> <br /> The McEvoy movie appears in an amazing docu-drama style. Reed Hadley's narration sounds like it was stapled directly from the newspaper, citing facts like reading an official police transcript. This technique sometimes seems to be somewhat inexpensive, but fortunately, narration is largely limited to movie bookenders, as well as providing some explanatory fillers during breaks. The story of a "killer" lurking in New York is not an importer of Mexican carpets, but a beautiful diamond smuggler Sheila Bennet, who has just arrived from Cuba. Within a few days, Sheila has two independent actors: a Treasury Representative (Barry Kelley), who wants her to be arrested for crimes, and a team of doctors (led by William Bishop) who has identified him as a source of smallpox outbreaks. As with "Panic on the Streets", otherwise, the usual dummy will be given a high degree of urgency, especially if those who are acting do not initially know the identity or appearance of their suspect. <br /> <br /> Killer That Stalked New York is able to greatly reduce its low production capacity. In addition to having selected a series of dialogues ("we have to stop it!", Dr. Wood cries at one point, as if it were difficult to make a decision), filmmakers and cast members allow the story to open in a realistic, binding way. In this regard, the intentions of a low-budget film will most likely contribute to a documentary style that adds immediate urgency to the outbreak scenario. Evelyn Keyes is a great leader in showing leadership in extremely tough imagination; At the end of the film, she feels so brutally powerless because of her illness that her face is almost painful. In addition to the virus, Charles Korvin's main offender, like Sheila's greedy and adulterous husband, is sure to get everything he comes with. And if all the sisters saw Dorothy Malone, it might not seem like catching smallpox.
