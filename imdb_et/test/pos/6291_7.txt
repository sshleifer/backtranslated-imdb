I didn't expect much when I decided to watch this movie, so I was surprised when I thoroughly enjoyed it. In some scenes, I had a laugh almost uncontrolled. The characters were busy (no red); but the story is predictable. It's fun to watch Crawl (Shore's character). A collective girl who is a college girl brings home thanksgiving, trying to fit her lifestyle in her uncomfortable (but former) way. I was also surprised that all this was a message. If you have a chance, watch this movie!
