A sentimental, compassionate family film set in England in the 1920s. Young Elizabeth Taylor wins a horse in a lottery and decides to enter the Grand National; Luckily, former Jockey Mickey Rooney has given Liz help. Director Clarence Brown shows some remarkable control of the material that might have been overwhelmed by someone else. He and scriptwriters Helen Deutsch and Theodore Reeves take care of creating a true character and creating nature. True, there are one or two scenes that seem a bit forced, but in general it is quite influential and filmed at Technicolor. The competition itself is quite exciting and, like so many great classics, is a fun, three-prong at the end. Liz proves that from the start he was a real soldier and Rooney - whom I usually quite annoying - is surprisingly modest and very good. Donald Crisp is a terrif because Lizi's cute father and Angela Lansbury are delighted by his older boy-crazy sister. Most of the actors, however, belonged to Anne Revere, who won a richly-earned supporting actress, Oscar, who played Lizi's smart and caring mother.
