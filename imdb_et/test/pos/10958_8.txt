Seven months after the appearance of the face, I finally found a rental copy of the first feature of Cassavets' first feature. Shadows was the culmination of a month of improvisation samples in the shelters dedicated to the Manhattan Flower Pot and its exhibitions, where (mostly amateur) participants developed links, invented their characters, and polished their technique to give their filmed performances the right tenor of spontaneous acquaintance. This intimate approach led to some incredibly bold faces in the Faces, ie Seymour Cassel slipped his hands under Lynn Carlin's throat, trying to restore him to overdose, as the actors' perfect conviction gives blisteringly honest moments like Lelia and Tony's post-coital assessment of their The relationship and Ben's revulss the black woman's touch as a manifestation of her racial confusion and self-expression. Home production in the best sense, unsynchronized dubbing and voice recording, and granular cinematography and cameras close to the camera create an ambient atmosphere that fits perfectly with Cassavets' nuances of a human relationship as a constant constant work. noticeable emotional fluctuations and poor attempts to communicate and understand. Charles Ming's largely improvised jazz score is the perfect complement to the film's vision to live for a moment, the mantra through which Cassavetes worked and apparently lived.
