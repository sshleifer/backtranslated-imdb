In the middle of the open, I sent an email to my friend to summarize it. Not sure if the movie would break into submissive gestures, I felt a little un-easy suggestion, but then I saw the end. It's perfect. I have lived in Korea for 6 months and this film can just as easily summarize the strange predictions and frustrations of some Asian metropolis as it takes here in Taiwan. He uses the myth of Hong Kong musicals as Godard or Hartley use Western music, but takes it to the extreme, it is a sharp world and occasionally makes Kafka logic better. I feel that Hole's closest comparison is Hal Hartley's Surviving Desire, but has a little edge, which is hopefully a hopeful and strange metaphoric film. Anyway, that's what I wrote to Esther. I hope you also like Hole. <br /> <br /> Hey, <br /> <br /> watching a gear called a hole. Taiwanese I think it seems a bit strange to China if it's not Hong Kong. it's worth so far. it's a boy and a girl in an apartment building. The man's cave caves and the girl are starting to disturb and well, the strange metaphor is a rather intense destruction for simultaneous joy, degregation and pain. there is also a little sub-plot of zombie virus and a lot of strange little scenes where the girl acts through her desires for the innocent and fun 50's doo-wop sequences. worth a look.
