In 2002, Bourne's identity is one of my favorite films of all time. but many of the fans in the book have complained that the film had very little to do with the plot of the book. <br /> <br /> The task is a real deal. It is strange that no "Bourne Identity" thread has ever mentioned this film at all. (Well, I did.) <br /> <br /> In addition to a great plot, I personally found this movie as good as any movie of espionage I've seen, except Bourne <br /> <br /> Identity itself. <br /> <br /> Action is absolutely realistic. I especially liked the main character training mode, which was very inventive. <br /> <br /> Feeling dark and sharp. There are a couple of surprising plot twists. Operation is great. <br /> <br /> If you like this genre, I can't recommend this movie enough.
