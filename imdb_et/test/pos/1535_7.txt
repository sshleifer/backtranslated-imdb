This two-character drama has worked very well and has a valid message and some really shocking moments (not shocking because they're not graphic, but because you're not ready for them when they come). But in the end, it becomes oppressive, as is the somewhat similar "Pure Formality". But Alan Rickman would have had to carry the Oscar nomination with his multi-dimensional presentation, no doubt. (** 1/2)
