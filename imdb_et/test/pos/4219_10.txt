I know this movie is not for everyone, and I do not reject your opinion, but what I have to say is the truth about how many people know this movie ... It was the best I've ever seen ! !! It was so funny, and although it wasn't the most frightening film I ever saw, it kept me on the edge of my place because I didn't know what was going to happen next. If you like funny scary movies, you have to see it!
