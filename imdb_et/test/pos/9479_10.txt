If you like Cagney you like this movie. It has the pretense of American integrity at any price, personal or social level. Cagney plays weight and measurement heads in NYC. Cagney rises against crooked politicians, criminal land, a well-known philanthropist, and simple food items that add a few ounces to the price of chicken. The Chicken Scene is fun where Cagney finds the weight of a malicious butcher in the bird's cavity. Chicken is thrown around the store in a fun scene that controls "evidence." If you like old phones, there are interesting choices, phones and even strange wires. Compared to many contemporary films, this is pure entertainment and includes the concept and message of comedy that honesty should be the guiding principle of humanity. Made in simpler times, it reflects a world we can't find today. Fashionable (especially hats) clothing and cars play an outstanding visual role in defining this small film.
