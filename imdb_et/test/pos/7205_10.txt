Making a movie into a cartoon is hard to do. Creating a good movie with comic is very difficult to do. A good movie about Asterix & Obelix. <br /> <br /> This movie shows that French can do: a) funny, b) fun, c) beautiful, d) great movie. The action is not only great, but the whole film's sunny feeling is perfect. It must be the most funny thing since the beginning of the millennium. 10/10
