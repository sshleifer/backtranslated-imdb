I don't think there are people who didn't like this movie! I thought it was a more fun movie I've ever seen. It's my biggest fan c / c I'm the biggest fan ... I know almost all the words and very discouraged when they censor it when it is played on the family channel. :) this is one of my favorite movies, so I don't know why no one agrees! thanks to Kristina
