I was quite terrible to see that this movie was rated here, personally considering it's a fun family price. She turns around the young teenager, Sandy Ricks, whom her mother sends to the Coral Key to spend the summer with her uncle Porter. Although he encounters his dolphin called Flipper. A lot of adventures will result in a predictable brother / uncle bonding, as well as a little romance with Sandy's local girl. tough and comic uncle Porter. For starters, he keeps an endless stock of Spaghetti-O in his house to be his usual meal, heated to blowtorch! Elijah Wood, Frodo from the Lord of the Rings, appeared to be a very competent young Sandy who was the first boy who was not too fond of his forced summer vacation. some great underwater scenes. The film in Florida Keys was probably filmed in the Bahamas. This Flipper customization makes for an excellent family entertainment, sweet, sentimental and fun movie that is infinitely better for many of the contemporary cinematic art offered to youngsters.
