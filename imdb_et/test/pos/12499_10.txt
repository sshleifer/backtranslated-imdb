In my childhood, I got into nightmares related to Sesame Street and Muppet Show. I loved programs, but when I slept, I would dream of muppets that aren't on TV but not on TV. <br /> <br /> They talk dirty and laugh and sing while eating each other and killing each other. They took the bite from their cute felt and teared, followed by arterial bleeding. NICE! But it was a past ... I love this example! I saw Peter Jackson'S ACTION SINCE years ago and wondered why there wasn't a job there. Well here it is a sick, twisted and somehow socially strong old Hobbit vision. <br /> <br /> If you like this exhibition and you haven't seen FEEBLES, take it on Amazon or on some of these movies. You're a treat. <br /> <br /> By the way, Clarence would beat Triumph's dog's ass completely.
