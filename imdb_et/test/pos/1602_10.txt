Visconti's masterpiece! I admit that I don't know much about my work, but I can't imagine his other work that goes beyond this fabulous movie. Last night, after about 25 years of absence in Venice, I was dying and I was completely excited about what I saw. This occupation was a pasty composed of several elements: extraordinary shots led by Visconte, in particular his love of eating long, evil people, swimming, walking and essentials; visual interpretation of cinematographic films from Visconti's image selection; adhering to the principles without passing the over-driving dialogue and passing on the complexity of the scene alone through face-ups. <br /> <br /> It is true that the young people who watch this movie for the first time must know that they are watching a unique film that cannot be done in 2006. The film, the time of the sixties and seventies of the last century, in the short years when the artistic license was given to film directors and moneymen, played a second role. As many IMDb commentators have recently written, this film is long, boring (too little) and pretentious. I think, according to Hollywood Priest Standards, these comments include merit. Unfortunately, they tragically minimize the amazing beauty and depth of this work and other similar years. <br /> <br /> Please, if you have not seen death in Russia, rent a copy and immerse the film and story from another time. You will be rewarded.
