First of all, you should only look at it if you do not mind the absence of subtitles, pornography, kinky war, and perfect, terrifying and truly shocking exhaustion. I mentioned kinky sex, but to call sex on the other side of the movie would be a big underestimation of "kinky". It is more like a face if you are not ready for such a disease. Nonetheless, I can go back to reviewing the diseased pseudo-snuff dance genre that our fellow citizens have given us. perform in amateur porn movies. Don't wait much for the first 30-40 minutes. There is some dialogue - if you don't speak Japanese then it doesn't mean much to you - it seems to be an occasional conversation between a daughter and a team and a performer, then some porn (straight sex) and after that scene, the performers and Team breaks. And then ... it's gonna happen. <br /> <br /> The girl seems to be talking about another scene - this time she's tied to a rope. Abuse begins: whipping, beating, hot wax ... Finally the girl breaks and shouts. Then we see the performers and the team sitting at the table, as if nothing had happened - except for the girl. He is visibly shaken and looks like he wants to leave. He walks to the door, sits on the floor to put his shoes on ... and that is when hell breaks open. <br /> <br /> He hits the baseball head, his wound is treated, he's tied to the bed. What can be briefly described (I'm not going to ruin everything for you) than rape during the breaking. Think about "meat and blood flower," mix it with porn and get an idea. It takes about 20 minutes. SFX is very good, also makeup. Everything is shown without mercy for the viewer. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> I thought "Visitor Q" was a very sick movie. After watching "Niku daruma", it seemed to me a fairy tale. This film is so sick, so exhausted, so twisted, so nasty that the harsher words are bad compared to the finals. Too bad it is released only in VHS, so no subtitles are available. But the film still works without them. So, if you're against the beauty of ultra-disease, extreme sadism, and other beloved genres, check it out. I hope you don't have a nightmare .8 / 10.
