I loved this movie! It was divine and funny. Finally, here is a story of people who are experiencing some challenges, a little flounder, and then just decide to be themselves and happy; when was the last time you saw the movie? Addressing the fluency of life, love, and sexuality is faced with real problems (though often in ridiculous situations, such as hiking a group of men on a trip and explicit real co-operation), and succeeding to learn and grow without preaching a movie, in a dark desperate or too unrealistic. You love and care about characters who are far from hollow stereotypes, but represent real people who have a real touch behind their true labeling. <br /> <br /> Good romcom on Saturday afternoon, and the only movie I've ever seen, where sexual flow ends happily, and no one is forced to be something they don't want to be. A better choice than kissing Jessica Stein, a good choice if you're tired of watching gay movies with some painful lessons and a bitter lesson. Or maybe just like a good British romp? James Purefoy looks like always, and Tom Hollander is funny. So go ahead, look, enjoy; you will not regret it!
