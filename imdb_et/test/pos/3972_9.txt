From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar! The film took time from the beginning, at least for me, because I was expecting it to be a running American pie flick. But it was a bit different - a fun loving slacker who graduates from high school and does his OWN college and works accordingly. As you can expect, bikinis have lots of parties and hot girls, but this movie tried harder than your average teen flick. Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) encourages his students / peers to learn through freedom of expression and ultimately push this system away. Humor varied what I loved. All the casts made fantastic performances - hire it with a friend, it's bloody debris!
