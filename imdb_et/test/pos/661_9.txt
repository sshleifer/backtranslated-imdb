Cheezy? Yep. Poorly Filmed? You betcha. Zero Budget? They proudly claim it on their posters. Excellent anyway (or because of it)? Certainly. <br /> <br /> This movie marks (and amuses) everything that was classic about the 80s fear genre: characters of absolutely no depth that fit in a stereotypical roll they never get; teenagers try to survive some mysterious power that they disturbed by doing something flat to the young; totally free nudity; the amount of impossible blood coming from the victims; slow moving zombies; big liners ... and our hero even wearing Michael Jackson jacket! <br /> <br /> It's not all kinds of scams like scary film, but the frightening film of the lost innocence of the 80's fears can be scary and silly, sexy and funny!
