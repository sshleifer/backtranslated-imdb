This is one of Eastwood's many movies that interfere with intrigues, activities, and romance, with The Gauntlet, Firefox, and so on. Clint is now quite familiar. It is quiet and a bit outrageous in this, especially women and bosses. There are no surprises in his work. But the film itself is something surprising; it is above average. <br /> <br /> Clint is Frank, a secret service representative who may have killed a JFK at some point in case of doubt. He then took a drink that drove his family away, and now he is moving in bureaucracy until John Malkovitch contacts him, calling himself a "Booth" who strikes him with a common and frustrated conviction, which in turn is uneven that everything is useless except impulse, to escape grief and predictability. Now, this is a rather uneven attitude for the artist, such as Clint, but he does quite well, less robust than usual. And it seems that he carries with him, like a stone load, the memory of that moment in Dallas. He has been reconsidered for this movie. He hangs from the roof of a tall building, grabbing Booth's hand and pulling his pistol and leading it to Booth, who asks if he's really ready to shoot. If he understands this, of course, he will save President CIA in a murdered murder murder attempt, but he will do it for his life. Booth spins him from the situation when they hold in the air. And Clint even has a short speech, telling Renee Russo that he will not save President Dallas. "If I had responded quickly enough, I could have taken that picture ... and it would have been fine with me." It is undervalued, but his voice falls lightly, his eyes are on and his lips are shaking. This is one of the few scenes in any Clint movie that could be rightly called "mobile". We know from his new solution that he gave a new chance that he would take the ball. (The irony is that she doesn't like the current president. Who could? She gives Colorado's breathtaking speeches on how they "carved the nation in the desert." Did they not do the same thing in Las Vegas? Often it is said that the film is just as good as It is not true, nothing is so easy, but the argument can be about the value of this truth. Reptile John Malkovitch, with his Tatars eyes, is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Tell me frustrated. grab, smile, smile even when he puts two innocent hunters in the eye, but he's exciting on the screen. Renee Russo is a little. Fred Thompson, who is the head of the White House headquarters, is now in politics for the film's visitor. is limited, Thompson has something less. In every movie he has been, he carries the same solemn and dissatisfied expression as being constantly afflicted with some kind of volcanic digestive disorder. <br /> <br /> Wolfgang Peterson's Direction is as good as Das Boot, "which is pretty good. There are many regular stops in the final race. And if Clint and Russo get in their hotel room and get back into bed, like two warmths, Peterson shows us his feet with the following items that fall to the floor - not just traditional clothes, but handcuffs, weapons, beepers, palm pilots, Dick Tracy watches and other obstacles. Cut off, Clint is back on the bed and sighs: "Now I have to put all these things back." <br /> <br /> Well written and worthwhile.
