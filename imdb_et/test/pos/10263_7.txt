Dr. Sayer (Philippe Leroy), a spiritual doctor with psychological problems of the opposite sex, abducting a free-thinking liberal wife, Maria (Dagmar Lassander), who believes that men must be "fixed" women. Sayer retreats to his palace monument, runs a series of humiliating moods, threatening to intimidate him and kill him. It seems that Sayer's desire is to dominate his body, mind, and soul by making him a sexual slave, following his commandments, following his every wish and whim. After the beginning of resistance, Maria slowly begins to pursue her goal, but she has plans according to her own. He says he wants to help Sayer to give up his sadistic behavior against women so that he can love and do not feel such a desire to suffer. It seems that Sayer has his handle, agreeing to some rather embarrassing scenarios (such as toasting the toes, "love" with a bursting knife, which is his own rest, often spent topless and even getting hosed down when he bounces him hard over his face, bringing blood from his nose ), which almost blows her, but something happens when a worrying doctor slowly falls in love with Maria ... and through what seems to be a desperate attempt to end madness, Maria gets her upper hand playing Sayer's body against her body. <br /> <br /> More willpower, a kind of sexual warfare, where one seems to be responsible when the other has a really upper hand. Much of the film treats Sayer Maria, forcing him (.. seems to be) to present a series of psychological games of his sexual nature. His attempts to escape are unsuccessful because his home is a well-designed fortress, a typical European art deco-type palace designed and organized by a man who has gone down this weekend with a pretty spell (.. it's the walls and doors that open at his command where Maria is quarantined for her victims, but when Maria seems to have a bottle of pills for her eyes as a result of her vision, the tables are rotated and she has her wherever she wants. She thinks she really wants her and Maria uses it for her benefit, playing hard to get when Sayer wants to receive him and destroy him (..and I understand his disappointment because he has the temptation that can lead a man to crazy) <I felt that the film ultimately acts as a warfare for women, their empowerment and resurrection against men who has the idea that they should always have a sexual and mental control. "Twist" ends this ideal. swallowed ascetic activity and exercise regimen. We'll see how he develops his tonic athletic figure and how this mode is part of the usual routine every weekend before he starts with his victim's real games. If he has sat so well and spends such time developing himself for extracurricular activities that follow his curriculum, how can he suffer the fate of completing with her when she finished her advances? <br /> <br /> Maria, who later admitted, is the first to actually rob her; others from the past, called girls, were rewarded for their services, so that Sayer could feel the dominating power of a woman, even if it was all a fictitious symbol caused by a deeply troubled person who has no inability to associate with the opposite sex. The spontaneous decision to do so, to jump from the norm, will cost him more than ever. <br /> <br /> All this psycho-sexual subtitle is quite exciting to see disclaimer, but Dagmar Lassander Such Nami Sex Kitten was my reason to enjoy it ... without him, I wouldn't have liked it so much because he is a vital victim who wants to get. Perhaps the highlight of the film, the delicious dance like Lassander, dressed in gauze (!), Breaks the wardrobe that lets your breasts jazz score ... is such a sexually seductive moment that changes the mouth water and the tip of the sweat. Dagmar Lassander must be the joy of fashion designers because he carries these clothes as well as he has such a cool, refreshing and displaying presence with his beauty and seductive powers, Dagmar crosses that part to create an iconic character that would define his career ... if the film is not well known (.. i found it verbally). The provocative nature of the script and the risqu√© theme may not turn to a particular crowd because it deals with the treatment of sex (.. and pain) in many different forms, dialogue is illustrative and understandable. Sometimes I couldn't say Sayer's comments against Maria because she enjoys suffering women, and the excitement she forces them to force into slavery (.. trying to make words poetic), it all seems quite uncertain. But Dagmar is the real reason to see it, and the film, for me, works best as a fetish movie, with a potential male fantasy with a seemingly primary and right idealist who has been detained and wanted to be in a precarious situation, his fate may be complicated and likely to be a dangerous masochist. His performance and how he reacts to his aggressive behavior (.. there are times when he is opening up to the desire to embrace him, opening up a potential attraction to him who can astonish those who look at it in itself) among them is the most exciting highlight of this exploitation function. My second favorite scene, in addition to dance, is the piano concert with Sayer, who loves Maria when she plays a soothing melody.
