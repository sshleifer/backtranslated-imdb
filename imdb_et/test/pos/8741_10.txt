Since 1965 or around 1965, American films have been shocking and iconic, which was great for ages - a kind of seed that would pave the way for grittier, brave dramas. However, since it was the years when these films were born, so many of the films released since then were dated. CACTUS FLOWER is no exception. Its title refers to the "sunny" romantic comedy that occasionally comes out. This does not mean that it is a bad thing: on the contrary, movies about dirty topics have to start somewhere and America is a culture rooted in certain traditions that has deep hypocrisy, hitting itself to see the indirect reflection of indirect reflection. At the same time, European films deal with the same situations, walk out like a million dollars and have a longer shelf life, because what we find scandalous, loot, "Next" and move on. <br /> <br /> Toni Simmons (Goldie Hawn in the role of his attack), a young, very young 60's, will continue with many older dentists called Julian Winston (Walter Matthau) who have responsibilities. She can't marry her: she's already married. Toni decides he doesn't want him to meet his wife and "set things straight". His assistant, Stephanie Dickinson (luminous Ingrid Bergman, who returns to the American cinema after twenty years), arrives at the picture, a woman who is closer to her age and works as if she were and had perfect marriage and housekeeping. This is because he has found Julian with quiet emotions, emotions he does not know, even when he asks him to play with his wife, Toni, who does not want to further develop his relationship. And then he will step up when Toni's blatantly innocent actions lead to unexpected action and introduce Harvey's Greenfield (Jack Weston) to Stephanie's "lover." By the way, Harvey is also an older gentleman who interacts with many younger women (Eve Bruce) to whom he is also a very funny scene. <br /> <br /> It's funny how the person we are looking for is always there. What could have been grateful to Rick Lenz, who plays Igor Sullivan, Toni's neighbor, becomes a person who not only sees the true beauty of his colleagues' way out of Stephanie, but the one who first rescues Toni by killing himself. (Not comedy, suicide. And again, this is not your average comedy.) And it goes without saying that Ingrid Bergman's subtle, embarrassing image of a woman who has somehow responded to her love opportunities, who tend to tell her to thank her he will be a true person he always had to be. I can't imagine anyone else in this quiet but profound role. <br /> <br /> Such movies can be enjoyed in face value and viewed as an amusing fun that has been in the ages of time or can be seen with deep symbolism that, like its title, carries deep. It's a tricky film, just as Hawn's and Bergman's performances are just as complicated, because with such simple, no flourishing and poseful manifestations, they don't come out or announce what they are. Their actions change "not really", but play real people, warts and everything. CACTUS FLOWER is a story that never seems to be taken too seriously, but shows itself to be deep and very human.
