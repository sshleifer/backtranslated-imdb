Particularly pleasant for those who saw it as young, as it was ultimately for young people to look at - if you look at it again as an adult, it would be better if the pink-eyed glasses could hit you. It was the first of 16. Jungle Jim's films and later Johnny Weismuller in the TV series went on behalf of Columbia (the last three films had to use their name, even though they had lost their rights) after playing with Tarzan's Sol Lesser. Johnny Sheffield also gave up Boy's playing to become Bomba Jungle Boy in 12 movie series. <br /> <br /> Jim and the party go to a dangerous safari to hunt down the hidden temple of Zimbalu, led by the evil devil's tribe. doctors who seem to have a secret of poison, which can also be a polio treatment. Edgar Rice Burroughs has probably been approved. After 16 years of talking, Weismuller seemed quite uncomfortable, not that it was important. On a quick march, we meet many interesting, but generally playful, jungle deniers, preventing an accident on the crocodile by feeding a lady with a foot caught in a twig and a surreal elephant slipping (frame shots squeezed into the corner of the frame)). Skipper dog and Caw-Caw crowd had many adventures, none of which turned out to be important to the plot when you focused! The biggest problem with the film is the farce climax, which can be exciting, but unfortunately you will also be reminded of the end of the series? and the original great series was made 12 years earlier. Although it would not be worth it for another hour personally! <br /> <br /> The only thing that made it difficult was Weismuller; in so many ways as the enjoyable childhood of the old days - it is not recommended for serious adults, so I love it.
