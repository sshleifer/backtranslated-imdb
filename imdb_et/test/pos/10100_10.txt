Many horror fans complain that horror has hardly progressed over the last twenty years. I agreed to accept this up until the influx of Asian horror films, which has indeed grown. However, it has created some real classics, and at least two sisters, at least for me, stand out as an extraordinary cinema and perhaps the best horror film for a very long time. <br /> <br /> The Korean folk music is vaguely based on this sad story of two mentally disturbed sisters who live with their father and stepmother. After experiencing problems at home in the first evening, they decide to stay together and forbid their stepmother from being close to her. Tensions rise and are inevitable snap. But what happens after that requires more than a pair of eyes, because the story takes several twists and fears become more emotional and quite real. Finally, you may need to take a few moments to take it all off and knit it in your mind, but that is just what the horrors of mystery and mystery mean it goes beyond the definition of these genres and makes it a classic for the moment. One look again and again, just to do all this.
