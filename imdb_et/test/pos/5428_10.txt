It's a masterpiece. "The Big Snit" is a crazy, weird, fun and finally looking look at the old couple and their quiet lives, who argue over sawing and scrubbing while the nuclear war is driving outside. All this great animated short stands out as memorable: a woman's eye shaking, a vacuum cleaner, a husband saw a fetish (keep an eye on their backgrounds!), A very verbal cat, a demented game show, an "informative" news anchor, a "beautiful" accordion serenade and a moving and memorable end. I'm so glad I found "The Big Snit", one of the biggest films ever produced.
