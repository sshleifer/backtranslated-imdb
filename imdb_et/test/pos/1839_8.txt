This film has no pretense to be a great art that is good. But this is a well written script with well-developed characters and firm action. I think if I were to write this, I could do without the drama surrounding the woman, but it was not enough disturbing to reduce the main story of Minnie's character. I think Hollywood often abandons the effort to write real quality to try and inject visual drama when an adult thematic movie is all that is really needed - and probably more credible. All in all, this is a very good offer and it is worth noting.
