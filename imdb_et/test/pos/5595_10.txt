Broken Silence or "Race Against Fear" 1998) starring Ariana Richards, William Bumiller, Susan Blakely, Tracy Ellis Ross, Teryl Rothery, Scott Vickaryous, Marissa Rudiak, Ken Camroux, David Neale, Bruce Dawson ... Director Joseph Scanlan, Scenario Sara Charmo, Jean Gennis, Phyllis Murphy. <br /> <br /> This is another film of a lifetime channel made exclusively for television and released in 1998, directed by longtime TV director Joseph L. Scanlan. It is inspired by real events such as the majority of lifetime films, the warning story of women, raising awareness in the family (mother, father, husband, husband), and the predator hidden from the mentor (teacher, in this case, coach coach)). Young and little-known actor Ariana Richards (she played in a small girl at Jurassic Park) gives very convincing results as a high school leader athlete Mickey Carlyle, who is raped by Kurt Ansom (William Bumiller) and has to suffer quietly no one believes her story, except of course her own mother (Susan Blakely). Together, mother and daughter Kurt Ansom fight behind bars. The movie drags quite a bit, is finally predictable, sometimes too melodramatic for its own interest, but in the end it is really powerful. Ariana Richards's performance is with daily soap, but she is the strongest cast. His facial expressions, body language, and general action are realistic about how he, as an aspiring athlete, idolizes his coach, is in turn violated by him, and must now live with shame, trauma, and further, to fight him in court. William Bumiller plays a part of disgust with ambiguity, although he is far from subtle. He has previously abused other constellations who have been silent and made it up, and seemingly innocent. William Bumiller, less well-known actors, like others, has never done this role, but he does a generally incredible and strong result. She is particularly disturbing to see her in this role because she is a sexy leading actor in all other music, including some of the lesser-known movies and the so-called Guiding Light. The only real problem I had with this film is how the film is built. When the movie opens, we look at coach Ansom to rape Mickey, telling us immediately that this guy is not good. However, this changes the development and story of a weak character. If the first scene had been consecutive with the opening credit in which we see Mickey's running / running city by the lake, we would have a better character because we don't know that coach Ansom, while seemingly interested in success with his star athlete, is really disgusting. work and we would have seen Mickey idolize the person he thought he knew and then he got a rude awakening when he realized he was wrong about him. Director Joseph Scanlan is not a stranger to television drama (Knott's Landing, Star Trek, Quantum Leap, External Borders, Lois Ja Clark, Earth's Final Conflict and Movies Like La Femme Nikitta. In 1996, Scanlan staged another lifetime film similar to this, "Stand Against Fear "(1996), succeeds in communicating the gravity of the event and is really disturbed by the trainer, who lies in the shower, where he rapes his pupil, the audience, but its message is clear: sexual predators and rapists are not always strangers and can take different forms and their preconditions This film supports the cause of preventing violence against women and invites women who have been silent victims to acknowledge and fight that the rapists do not harm others, despite the negative judgments that make this work an excellent work of expressing the message and giving mothers , daughters, hi gh schoolgirls (including both male and female). the fact is that silence, if it happens, is even worse.
