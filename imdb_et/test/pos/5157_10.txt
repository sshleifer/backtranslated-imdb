Small spoilers follow. <br /> <br /> This movie is even more bizarre and unusual than "second floor songs". The main character is not followed. There is no "plot" in the usual way. There is no emphasis on a happy ending. There is no crowd. In other words, Roy Andersson is behind revenge. Instead of reducing the agreement and fixed formula, Roy Andersson converts his film idea. I'm not going to this idea, but even if you don't, I promise you will see the greatest visual depth ever put on the film. The majestic scenes of "songs" are bright here. The work of visual glory. <br /> <br /> So be kind to your companion because after "we are living", and only you and I have the right to change our lives. This is at least what I was thinking of when I saw the last scene in the movie, where inhuman bombs flew across the city to take away our lives. <br /> <br /> And, of course, do not forget to see this movie when it comes to you with a limited release. This is one of those films that are actually capable of making you a better person, like de Sica's "bike thieves". Very warm and humanistic film.
