If you are looking for a non-serious mobile phone with a female driver, you are in the right place. Pfieffer has done much better. You see, she's matured over this picture. <br /> <br /> When I first selected this movie, I was expecting Pfeiffer to have been badly unsuccessful, but he was playing his role as a mob woman. Baldwin is not a bad force either. <br /> <br /> If you don't pay attention to your hair, you can enjoy this movie. But don't take it too seriously ...
