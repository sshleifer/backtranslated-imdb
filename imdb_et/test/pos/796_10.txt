I hardly know where to start writing this pearl, except to say that it represents the young Buster Keaton at the top of his mandate and must definitely have one and a half of the best short comedy ever done. FISH is 20 minutes of smooth, expertly captured, beautifully executed gags; two non-lunar comic coil rollers driven by the unexpected downstream of paranoia, but somehow leading to a happy ending - not always with Buster's comedies. (See one case of COPS where Fatalism finally got a better result, or one week defeat Defeatism.) If I had to describe this movie in one word, I would call it "effortless", but if I had two, I would call it " seemingly stress-free "because there is certainly a lot of hard work to do with the comic opus that opens up with such greatness. But they didn't call her a big stone face: Buster didn't let the public sweat her. <br /> <br /> The Sardine Heading Card tells us that our opening sequence is set "along the line of millionaires", ie the bread row in a gloomy urban environment where Buster is patiently waiting at the back of the line and will not hurt as a result. he is currently in for a sin, Buster has our compassion, but he never asks for it. Before long accidents, coincidences and absurd misunderstandings, Buster is thought to have escaped a killer named Dead Shot Dan, and every policeman tries to catch it, but while he is obviously frightened by the course of this event, never being a self-illness or even a surprise, we feel that he always knew it was the life he would have for him and that he had no time to excuse himself, he had to figure out new ways how to get to the police and get out of the last trap As Buster refuses to play with compassion, he never seems to laugh, which is especially impressive, because GOAT must be one of the most ridiculous short comedies. This is the film that contains the Buster iconic image that drives the cowboy on the train to a camera lens that is not exactly, but confident that it laughs to provoke in its strange way. Meanwhile, there are guns, dogs, police, incredibly furry mustache and a horse's clay that melts under Buster's weight (a truly surreal vision), but some of the biggest cafes are saved for the finals when Buster is trying his first fear, Big Joe Roberts, the rotating police who also happens to be the leading woman of Virginia Fox. In Big Joe's dining room, Buster trapped him and sailed through the transom, turns the phone cab into an elevator and pretends to disappear, and finally uses the lift himself to get rid of his scavenger and win the girl in time for one of the last fade-out gags. <br /> <br /> To say more, it would be inaccurate for first-time viewers. I just want to see this movie in a theater full of people who would never have seen it and smiled. Live music broadcasting would also be nice; and by the way, Kino's musical result offered by GO GOAT's home video / DVD version is first-rate, which is already working on the icing of the delicious cake.
