This is the undervalued role of Kellie Martin. Based on the actual story, this Fusia attempt to save the members of the Diamant family and other Jews he meets over time. One of my favorite movie scenes of all time is linked to Fusia's little sister hero. All children should see that such a scene model is very small and far away. The film is well written and worked. I am a movie lover and this film appreciates the rating system of 10 imbd. This is my 25 best films all the time and it should be put on the video. <br /> <br /> Mike Porter
