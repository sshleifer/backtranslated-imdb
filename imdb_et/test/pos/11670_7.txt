First of all, be aware that I came to this movie not for music; in fact, I find it contradictory. In fact, I was interested in Punk subculture psychology. The documentary did quite well on this issue. One unpleasant aspect was the numerous scenes in which the songs are played, and the hypothetical band and the warring crowd are shown on a rolling basis. If you've seen the first such scene, you've seen them all. This redundancy is a party written for some songs. With them, the audience is able to connect to the band somewhat. Words are much more interesting than sounds from speakers. I don't know why all the lyrics were not printed. Words without lyrics slow (ironic eh?, Considering many references to music speed) movie stream. Interviews with fans and bands were also interesting, although there is a break if the last band interviews are not nearly as attractive or humorous as the first two. All in all, there is a good film I was happy to see. I'll check the follow-up if I ever get a chance. <br /> <br /> Favorite quote: He tried to hide the fact that he was unable to play peanut butter on his own and break the glass. <br /> <br /> General Punk Generalization: Although their disgrace, lack of vocabulary and hygiene and drug indulgence are often fun, it is finally understandable that pants are just pathetic minors who rebelliously rebellion the sophomoric lyrics and naive attempts to philosophize and politicize (ignoring the Black Flag, which is a little less misleading than their peers).
