NOTE: If not Mick Molloy to work, then Judith Lucy. He brings to his role the inconvenience of ordinary stylish unlimited, and steals in parts of the exhibition. is Samuel L. Jackson, the other 2 are in this movie: Tony Martin and Mick Molloy. Altho Martin only makes a cheeky look, Molloy not only writes letters, but also wrote and compiled the flick. I've been a fan of these years (probably I was the only one who smiled at the first episode of the Mick Molloy Show, so I went with that great expectation. I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed. With Mick doing a lot of work on this, there are many of his usual brands. Words like "mouth your ass" and "these pots are s *** house" are all over the place, as well as lots of Winnie Blues sucking. It is also a kind of stupid, original story to be expected from someone. It's like one of those clicked, American, sports comedies where they make baseball team prisoners or something. But instead of trying to make interesting American sport like a baseball or gridiron interesting, this film focuses on the ordinary army: Lawn Bowls. But the main difference between this and other comedies of other types of sports is that it is really, really funny. Even better is that even the theme of this movie is a young lout who joins the old people's game, it is never offensive to the elderly and it never gets badly fooled or anything. It's just good to laugh at true 1972 prices. Mick is the first real acting role I have ever seen him, just like Judith Lucy and the rest, but most of them have had a lot of practice ... This is the best Australian comedy I have. you've seen for a long time. Go look at it and learn the joy of the lawns! <br /> <br /> This is the big league? <br /> <br /> SCORE: 8/10
