Plot: Michael Linnett Connors has done everything in movies, but directly and is looking for his first great opportunity. He discovers Molly in the game and knows right away that he is a big movie star. He signs it with a contract that he must look for. The manufacturer agrees and their great careers endure. The following is a silent movie era and an early sounding movie that emphasizes comedy. And, yes, yes, there is also romance and a bit of sadness. The performances of Don Ameche and Alice Fay are top-notch. Music is also a real plus for listening to old familiar stories. The 2008 release, which was released in 2008, also features many DVDs. It should be emphasized that this film is a story, not just a respect for silent films. Later, similar films, such as Singin 'in the Rain (1952) and Dick Van Dyke-Carl Reiner, The Comic (1969). However, this film is special about the re-creation of silent films in 1939. We see their parts because the cinema audience in this past era (although some of the sound effects are) glorious b & w, while the rest of the film is pristine colors. One of the biggest silent timings, Buster Keaton, who was uphill climbing at this point, is perfectly used in two silent movie playback scenes and he is on his own! It has been said that he also had his scenes input. But the real reason to watch a movie when your movie fan is is that Hollywood Cavalcade is all the rest of Mack Sennett's film heritage. It doesn't understand the genius that this film is a "positive" reprocessing of the life of Mack Sennett and Mabel Normand. Character Michael "Linnett" Connors is Mack Sennett, whose real name was Michael Sinnott. And Molly, of course, is Mabel. Sennett had pies, baths and Keystone Cops. She worked with Buster Keaton, Ben Turpin (a coat of arms), Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle (double body) and loved her leading woman. Not only all this, but Sennett was the technical advisor for this film and also in that. Since most movie viewers prefer audio features today, those who were concerned with short topics and silences are left on the pasture. Because Mack Sennett falls into this category, luckily there is a Hollywood army! Sennett was, of course, very important in the development of comedy in films. His career began in 1908 as an actor, then as a writer, director and producer. He retired in 1935 with about 500 films for his credit. He had worked best, like Charlie Chaplin, Gloria Swanson, Bing Crosby, W.C. Fields, Keaton, Harry Langdon, Arbuckle, and even Roy Rogers (Way Up Thar) .The comedy of art is an extremely difficult way to continue the entire career, Mack played it sensibly and only made selective work for the next 25 years. In 1931 he received an academic award in the short term and another in 1937. in full-time work. In the 1940s, his presence was still felt, eg. Here are the cooperatives (1945) where the scene of oysters used by Mack's Wandering Willies (1926) was made. In 1947, some of Sennett's Crosby films were used in Hollywood. Two years later he brought down nostalgia with Down Memory Lane in which he participated. With the ability to always associate with the right people, the role of guests in the ever-popular Lawrence Welk and his radio program came later in the year. In 1950, his greatest triumph came out again, Tillie's broken romance (1914) with sound. In 1952, he was honored for television shows, it's your life, then his autobiography, the comedy king (1954), was a great companion to the Hollywood army. In 1955, Abbott & Costello brought a more concrete link because he had A & C Meet Keystone Kops. Finally, in 1957, one more prize for the compilation "Golden Golden Time". So if you look at a Hollywood military, it's a legacy of a film pioneer. In the banquet scene, the camera is placed over a long table of guests. When we reach Mack with a silver coat, he turns his head alone on the camera as saying, "Here I am!". When he speaks in a short time, he is his weakest, playing the words he has given, as he mentally passes, "I know my influence on comedy will never end, but will people forget Mack Sennett. Maybe this movie helps. "
