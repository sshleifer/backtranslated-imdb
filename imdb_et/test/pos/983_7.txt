Okay, I admit that if I had no children, I would never have seen this movie and would never see it. Considering all the rotten children movies I've seen (like SPY KIDS 2 or BABE: PIG CITY), it's an important improvement. And it was enough that I wasn't quite bored of my skull or intended to commit suicide (something I did repeatedly in two other films). Of course, the performances are quite wide and the plot is pretty silly, but it's a children's film. And compared to other genre movies, it's definitely better than average. Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bines actually seem to have some talents and are likely to continue their careers after puberty - at least on the information market or when making voice transmissions. <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for a movie to see with your kids, you would definitely do a lot worse!
