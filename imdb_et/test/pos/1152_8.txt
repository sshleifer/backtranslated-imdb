Now, lissen you guys, I loved this movie, though not quite as much as FAREWELL THE KING, another beloved John Milius epic. It was fun, much more than it was based on the Tennessee Williams drama. This is a great yarn with political correctness. I love this movie for criticizing my beautiful photography, humor and weakened Bad Guys (Berber) and REAL Bad Guys, who have acquired the "civilized" elbows of the world. there in the port. <br /> <br /> A separate scene is the Berber Camp, featuring blue-gray smoke from fires in baked deserts. It's visually obvious, very memorable. <br /> <br /> In 1904, Morocco has a helpless American woman (Candace Bergen) in WIND, who has hosted a terrifying, though immodest, Berber bandit (Sean Connery-a very Muslim nomadic model). An exciting story is based on a couple of historical facts. Photography is beautiful by Milius, according to Jerry Goldsmith's outstanding score. <br /> <br /> Ms. Pedicaris and Raisul are long acting in the foreplay and colliding with the oases in the desert. Though Raisu chases his genealogies back in the monkeys, he is the perfect gentleman - he even lets him keep his head after he won him in chess! The sea unit rushes to the Bashawi Palace, pulling out the fires of competing hegemonies with gasoline. Don't mess with the body, Abdul. <br /> <br /> There are many fun stereotypes: <br /> <br /> Despicable sultan - like a scattered ferret. It is certainly not liberal. <br /> <br /> Brutal German Officer - A big, bell-like taxi who sports a monocle. He decided to vigorously fight Raisul with swords instead of putting him down in Indiana Jones. Does Noblesse Obligate Through Von Clausewitz? <br /> <br /> Dashing Marine Officer - Kicks Tangier Army out of Bashaw and rushes his palace into tobacco while chewing. His speech is slightly aphasia. Bashaw asked him not to breathe. <br /> <br /> Berber - Horde of flaming cycophants led by charming megalomania. None of them take a bath, except maybe camel urine. <br /> <br /> President Teddy Roosevelt has been violently depicted as silent and with guns, toys and stuffed grizzly bears. <br /> <br /> Beautiful American widow - gives men the courage as well as her two children. Obviously, she has big clean, starched clothes and rarely has the hair in place. <br /> <br /> Raisul sends a message to Teddy Roosevelt, thanking him for Remington's win-win gift, announcing <br /> <br /> "MASTER ROOSEVEL, YOU ARE WINNING LION AND AYE." <br /> < br /> How true. <br /> <br /> Please do not take your acerbic remarks, which would mean that I didn't like the movie. I was almost as much fun as I wrote it as da Pitcher.
