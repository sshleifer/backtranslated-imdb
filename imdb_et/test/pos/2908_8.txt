This Fox speculation was a big hit in 1954. Highly produced, with great music and kits, intriguing, it moves slowly but interestingly. Edmund Purdom is an exceptionally beautiful Egyptian who becomes a well-known physician who juggles three stunning women: the servant Jean Simmons, who passionately adores him, the tempter Bella Darvi, who lives in his life, and Pharaoh's sister Gene Tieney, who wants him to be HER's. The popularity of the film has not diminished as it has been shown again in AMC (preferably on a widescreen). Purdom is especially big, his character is probably ridiculous and never married and "thinker". Darvi is amazing and embarrassing in his femme fatale role. Victor Mature, Michael Wilding, co-star of Peter Ustinov. Look at it.
