It's been a long time since such an original, quite funny black comedy has appeared. If "Iron Eating" is on your top 100 list, take your preference and look for "Bettying Betty" right now. Death has been a funny topic before (see Paul Bartel and Mary Woronov "Mortuary Academy"). Although this film has some black moments of comedy, "Bettying Betty" is much more stable and better cast. Who could imagine that an entrepreneur's business can be a fertile ground for original, exalting and affectionate comedy? I was surprised and you are. I highly recommend "Betty's Commitment" - MERK
