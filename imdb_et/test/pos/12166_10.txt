This little short absolutely fascinates me. <br /> <br /> The only thing I've seen so far is that it's part of Sam Brakhage, the creator of Star Man. But when Brakhage tries to get nervous, "making us learn how to see again", and we give us the innocence of headaches that bring out bright colors and flashes (which I still dig and embrace like high art) ... this movie, which I I describe it as very relaxing and hypnotic. Man Ray's general use of spinning objects / camera does not create so much dizziness, but a warm flow of mind that mixes and moves with the gravity of the world around us. <br /> <br /> An interesting idea of ​​this very short work is that if it goes wrong, the objects will become more and more recognizable until we stop with the nude torso (which I know the least feminine round breasts I've ever seen) ). Shadows and light circles and spirals over the torso make it an object of surreal beauty that you can hang on your wall and go forever. Because of this and other pictures of this movie, I had to watch it over and over again (eventually seven times) just because it interests me very much. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
