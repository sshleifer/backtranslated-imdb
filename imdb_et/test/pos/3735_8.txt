Being a middle-aged mother per se, I very much appreciate that adults see romance that tells many of the problems that affect us. <br /> <br /> Diane Lane depicts the beautiful sacrifice and conflict of Adrienne and her mother who wants to make her children right, but still has a happy life. <br /> <br /> I am not a big fan of Richard Gere, but he always does a good job with a man who is a kind of jerk but learns about himself. <br /> <br /> Their romance as unrealistic is hardly justified in comparison to most other romantic movies. When Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman fall in love with riding in Australia, in the meantime, they are very romantic. We get so much more from Rodanthe. He redeems him. He makes him free. It's beautiful. <br /> <br /> The intimacy they create by sharing their deepest uncertainty, fans are a flame of passion. How long it will take is irrelevant. Perhaps the film was a bit thinner in that it was a letter distributed over the next year that deepened its relationship - again, another real respect for getting to know the person. <br /> <br /> As far as I enjoyed the plot and the themes, the dialogue was not good. Some lines pulled both true and other lines were embarrassing stunts and flat. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the relationship between Adrienne's teenage daughter and her best friend, reminding us that there are many types of love, not just romantic love. <br /> <br /> This is not a light romantic comedy, more romantic drama. This is a very relaxed pace that some may consider too slow. <br /> <br /> The beach house is a wonderful work of art. Watch the driftwood bench on the front porch of the house - very beautiful. I also liked the music and landscapes that united to create the effect of this location as the third main character. It was this place away from their normal life, which allowed them to see each other and each other in different light. <br /> <br /> If you're old enough to understand these topics and have a good mood to get out of Kleenex and enjoy this movie.
