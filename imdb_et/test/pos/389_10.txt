It might have been assumed that Hitchcock's return to the big studio movie production would be careful to eat. Certainly a few were expecting his most striking, unlimited film, funny black comedy, exciting tension, mock manipulation and amazing pictures. But that's exactly what they got: trains on the train. <br /> <br /> What is remarkable is how much Bruno's transgression is disturbed by the film world. Much has been done masterfully on the cross-sectional motif, but its immediate effect is to completely prevent the straightforward advancement that Guy makes from his life and thus from the society he represents or wants to join. Guy is an archetypal American, a working class boy doing good, moving in influential circles, athletic, successful, beautiful. Bruno is his destructive reverse, gay, decadent, "European" (he lives from his father, a big house, and just from salons about dreams of murder). Bruno's life is repetition, circulation, while the Guy is moving straight ahead. Bruno's accomplishment is Guy's movement in his possession (represented by the merry-round) and forcing him to transgress (violate the law, hope for murder (Bruno)). <br /> <br /> Bruno is literally a fight against the Patriarchate. All the authors of the film are criticized - Bruno's father, the man whose bravery we look at, but the real horror that is constantly referred to in the film (especially in Clara's aunt painting - that incredibly intense negative energy must come from somewhere); Give incredibly Machiavellian, a self-serving father; an unknown judge who does not think anything after lunch after filling; tennis commentator whose insidious comments are always wrong. Hitch, like Robin Wood, is not a mother-hero of the legend, but is deeply hostile to the fathers and the patriarch. <br /> <br /> Bruno's transgression changes the world overflow. This is Hitch's most surreal movie. When Guy is on his plot, he is usually filmed with romantic music. But when Bruno intervenes, the atmosphere becomes carnival, odd, fun. This is Hitch's first truly American film that will appear in the primitive detective of Americana. Adult men stab small boys balloons or try to throw them out of the sea. Recognized professors of mathematics sing from the goats on trains. Matrons of the elderly society are strangled in elegant genders. Washington has been filmed as shuttle lines in a large desert under a huge heaven, like a haunting country in Dali. There is one of the biggest and most fun scenes in all the cinemas when we see the motionless, smiling Bruno tennis game with rotating heads, a picture worthy of Magritte. Just look at any scene where Bruno is, and see how it steals the odd. <br /> <br /> Phalluses are very ridiculous in permutations - check all of these balloons (Hitch was probably seen by three) - as in more environments: Washington never sees the same again. STRANGERS is also VERTIGO, despite Hitch's most open sexual film - just like phalluses - is a permanent homoerotic, remarkable game of "riding" horses; Gobsmacking fellatio joke when Hitch's daughter leaks powder to a policeman. <br /> <br /> And yet, Hitch won't miss the good old one. In a very good endeavor to show what a great artist he was, critics tend to forget what made him famous. Bruno has been made a lot of Norman Bates prototype and Hitch is happy to find the audience wishing Bruno's murder. There's a fun hurry where Bruno loses the lighter he's going to waste on Guy. The impact of tension and relief by the audience, who was part of the mad murderer support, is, by nature, funny, slightly distracting, and very revealing of our true reactions to compliance and success. And Hitch dashes it harshly - listen to ridiculous music and exaggerated compositions and hit yourself so seriously. <br /> <br /> STRANGERS is one of Hitch's top five films and is therefore one of the biggest things in the cinema. The dialogue is so strange and brilliant, I can't believe it was not written by Chandler. Patricia Hitchcock is a wonderful imperson for her exciting fathers when she deplores Guy. The finale of the exhibition park is a remarkable, exciting set of exciting fusion, black comedy and symbolic site. When Bruno's last words condemn Hell (according to Catholic precepts, Hitch should embody: compare the similar end with KILLERS), we praise his integrity, which is endlessly preferred by Guy's abducted self.
