A great drama about 2 alienated, corrupted bunkers who go against the federal government, each for their own reasons. One, the drug, just wants to score a few dollars for his next fix, but the other has a much more unfortunate agenda, partly supported by his father's outrage. A good performance and a hot script make it a winner.
