The beautiful movie.John Garfield's character is a distant relative of "Les Miserables" from Jean Valian, while Detective Rains recalls Victor Hugo Javerti, which is a ruthless hand of law. <br /> <br /> Like many movies, noirs show evil, while the state and nature represent shelter, redemption, and a second chance for those whose lives seem dead forever. But even in the light of daylight, the danger may suddenly emerge because of the magnificent scene at the reservoir exhibitions. John Garfield's actor, as Leonard Maltin remembers, should be rediscovered: I am never disappointed with my films except for his supportive "gentlemen's agreement", but this it was not his fault - it gives the heartfelt sensitive result and the audience half to him as soon as he is accused unfairly (the first sequence shows a rather insecure hypocritical person, but all his studies redeem him and how we feel him during the scenes related to the last detective Rains. grandmother and kids) add a lot of joy to what is needed .Humor is also a strip in poker because Dead End brats fleece is a rich boy. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie.
