There was a time when not all animations were Disney or Pixar. It's so nice to see this wonderful movie again and I actually have a good and reasonable copy of the DVD. Be careful because it is in the public domain and has some very bad copies. I got a very good copy of Flashbacks and its pretty good. In old times, I watched it on black and white on TV. It would be much better for some of you to think. The songs are wonderful and the color is great. Interestingly, the characters are well developed, which are strange in animated movies. I loved Hoppitit and the villain Mr. Beatle is a real frame. Its incredibly imaginative. It is great to have non-living objects such as cotton rolls, old cans becoming part of the environment and new features. The anthropomorphic use of insects is astonishing given the many evil creatures that most people unfortunately think they are reluctant to. Hopefully, we will never be able to take the insect again! The insect enemy is the man. In fact, of course, its insects that survive. No matter how hard we try to release ourselves from the ants in Australia, they will come back. The battle is gone and we have to live with them. There are several scenes that stand out, for example, when Hoppity and Mr Bumble are caught in a drinking pot, a great flood and a journey to the top of the building is all wonderful. It's rather anthropomorphic, but so charming. Human characters look like Gulliver and its incredibly effective. The wedding is beautiful. The crime of this movie has not become a classic. The only jarring note for me is the events in the movie when characters in the verse are moving. Speaking of the verse, it breaks the story and it was not necessary; the verse is terrible and violates another smart good script. Her big and kids love it. His pleasure to watch. There is also a very smart ending.
