I was very happy to see this film at Melbourne International Film Festival 2005 only a few days ago. I have to admit that I am very involved in films that focus on human relationships and especially those that focus on the tragic side of life. I also love most Scandinavian cinematic offers, often with deep quality, how the story develops and characters are drawn. The characteristic building of this film is extraordinary in its detail and depth. This is despite the fact that we encounter quite a number of signs that have very special personal situations and locations in their community. At the end of the session, the audience was very quiet and meaningful. I still play some of these scenes in my mind and I'm still surprised by their power and meaning.
