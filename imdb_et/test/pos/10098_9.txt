This film definitely deserves to be placed in the genre of fear, but not for obvious reasons. "The Story of Two Sisters" is not horrible with the sudden shocks or the great tools of the CGI guts and gore; it is a psychological horror film that sprays the viewer's curiosity from the beginning, and creates an aura of reasonable secrets and questions all the time. The best thing is that the end does not give a clear answer by pushing the viewer to analyze what they have seen and make up their mind about what actually happened. <br /> <br /> The seemingly slow pace at which the movie starts, and don't wait to jump out right away. This is not an ordinary hack and slash whose orchestral section is designed to intimidate you. "The Story of Two Sisters" slowly builds fear into the atmosphere, the unknown fear and fear of things that avoid explanation until the end. Even if the final conclusion is revealed, it is not so difficult and obvious that the whole film will fall into place. The film requires the viewer to think back to what he has seen, and try to bring it to the scary revelation of the final scene. Some things are still open to interpretation, and it's one pleasure to watch a movie like this. <br /> <br /> True Fear of "The Story of Two Sisters" is not in shock or in striking fears; it is a psychological, intestinal horror that violates the convention and extends the genre to proportions that the traditional horror film has not yet explored. It is no exaggeration to say that this film even differs from the so-called Asian Horror genre. Indeed, it would be a mistake to make "A Tale Of Two Sisters" movies like "Ring" and "The Grudge". This film can be understood from a number of perspectives, some of which do not need to suspend belief, others who have a supernatural conscience. <br /> <br /> No matter how you interpret this movie, it is one that requires an open-minded approach, rewarding viewers, regardless of their previously understood perceptions of Asian cinema or horror in general.
