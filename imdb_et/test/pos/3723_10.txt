Poetic study of human condition without dialogue. The Hero, The Man, is building a contrast to get out of the marauders band that was once a waste of civilization, the ruins of the city, to destroy their survival. There, he crosses Brute, the fame of Jean Reno, The Professional and Mission: Impossible. The man is saved by a crazy old genius who lives in his design fortress. By using their way of thinking, man and the old genius can keep Brute and his beauty open, but they realize that this is only a matter of time before their defenses are compromised, so they break it. It is a very underestimated story of the inevitable struggle for life, great scenes and smart humor. Of all the distinctive films, such as "Road Warrior", "Omega Man" and even "Ultimate Warrior" (featuring Yul Brenner as a horse knife fighter), "Le Dernier Combat" is the most artificially designed. It is hard to find video copies, I would give one of my left eye ball. If your local art house has ever revived this film, I would suggest that I heartily break down any work ability so that you can see it big.
