Speaking of competitions at the Split Film Festival, we have titles all over the world. China, Korea, Canada, USA and Australia, and many of these stories show that the world is really a tear-off. Modern love ... that's for sure. In this film, Alex Frayne, two younger married people and their boyfriend travel from city to coast to visit the man's uncle's grave and house, who had long brought him out and who died in a mysterious situation. The beach village seems to be an American horror film where the village is strange and people are rare mutants. However, Alex Frayne's pastorella episodes cannot be described in a normal way as a horror. In fact, this is an extremely interesting drama where we see setbacks and a lot of other relationships and horror. In this story and through the obvious psychological aspects of the actors, we are shown a film that is charmingly eccentric in Australian filmmaking. So this is the Frayne case. Always something new and fresh. The visual intelligence and unique sensitivity of some Australian directors is amazing. The Frayne movie is super. There is something in the Australian landscape that shows their films as special as we have seen in FRAYNE's modern love and RAY Lawrence's films Lantana and Jindabyne. </p> Frayne.
