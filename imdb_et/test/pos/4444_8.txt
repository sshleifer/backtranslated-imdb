I'm not a big fan of Lucio Fulc's movies. Most of his 80's gore films were moments, but they often came in second-order Dario Argento imitations. Except for the fun "Zombie" (which was George Romero's imitation), I didn't really enjoy them. I know that the Italian horror often ignores the plot, but the story and characters of his films were just too fast by standards. That's why I was surprised by "Don't torture the duckling". In fact, it is a very well-made film that contains the secret of the attacking murder. Its possible the best giallo ever made, but the seriously rivaled Dario Argento entries in the genre. And unlike Fulci's previous giallo "Lisko wife's leather", it never pulls. <br /> <br /> Fulci's direction here is pretty good. He keeps the story at a good pace and keeps the viewer's interest all over. The conclusion of the mystery is also surprising to the audience. In addition, he adds some clever touches, such as amazing soul music especially during the disturbing graveyard beating sequence. Generally, the violence here is limited and will only be used if it is necessary for the story. It is also a good thing to do, familiar with the Italian Italian cinema of the 1970s. Both Thomas Milian and Barbara Bouchet are very cool. The only weak link is Florinda Bolkan, whose performance is too far away. Its the only ridiculous aspect of the film. "Don't torture a duck bird" will definitely accompany my recommendation and it can be a good introduction to the giallo subheading as a whole. (8/10)
