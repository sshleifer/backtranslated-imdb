I remember it a long time ago, and I knew most of the concept, but not the details, so I'm glad to watch it again with director Frank Oz (The Muppets Take Manhattan, Bowfinger). Basically, the new star Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon) recently won the Academy Award, where he plays a gay warrior and he does the usual "thanks", even mentioning his past school English teacher Howard Bracket (Golden Globe is called Kevin Kline). Howard has decided to clear his name and focus on media as a negative gay man, especially since his marriage to Emily Montgomery (Oscar and Golden Globe is Joan Cusack) is on the way. So it comes on a wedding day, and when it comes to Howard saying yes or no, when he gives himself out and confesses himself and everyone that he is gay. Of course, he will be dismissed as a teacher, but everyone will stand out (supporting) on ​​the day of graduation, and Cameron will even show things up, so everyone, especially the school leader Tom Halliwell (Elfi Bob Newhart) knows it's okay to be gay. Also featured are Tom Selleck Peter Malloy, Debbie Reynolds Berniece Brackett, Wilford Brimley Frank Brackett, Gregory Jbara Walter Brackett, Glenn Close, Whoopi Goldberg and Jay Leno. The film should be highlighted when Kline cannot help Diana Ross' I Will Survive's version, which was to convince her of her sexuality. Kline is always good, Cusack is a surprise Oscar candidate, and all the supportive members do it in a very funny comedy. Very good!
