Because most people are tired of being numbered by Hollywood movies. There is no creativity in Hollywood. Businesses only want to spend money on back tests that are built-in. <br /> <br /> This movie is a welcome change. It may be classified as a romantic comedy for this genre, but don't let this movie turn it off. This is a very original film that doesn't like most of Hollywood's productions. <br /> <br /> If you read it, you already know the basic piece, so I'm not worried about it. The only movies to remember with this in mind are "Interstate 60" and "Art of Travel", which are little known gems that take a different path from most Hollywood garbage. <br /> <br /> It is well worth seeing if you are tired of watching the same. <br /> <br /> Dean
