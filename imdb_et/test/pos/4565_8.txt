During the 1970s, what we know as "Blacksploitation" movies rose and fell. This term refers to a wide spread rather than a true film genre. In short, any comedy, drama, adventure, western or city councilor and robbers will shoot up, both built and so cast to turn to the great city color in the middle of the 20th century. It may indeed include the widest range of films if they were inclined towards the inner city black population. <br /> <br /> It seems that the idea of ​​creating films of particular interest to black Americans was to generate it with the release of 100 RIFLES Eastertime (Marvin Schwartz Prod./20th Century-Fox, 1969). It had an American-American footballer from the University of Syracuse and several times with All-Pro Fullback for Cleveland Browns, Jim Brown. Having already appeared in several films such as RIO CONCHOS (1964), THE DIRTY DOZEN (1967) (ICE STTION ZEBRA (1968) * and others, it started to think more about Studios' suits "that Jim was a hot asset. <br /> <br /> Now this 100 RIFLES brings a record number of black patrons to middlemen in the metropolitan business on Sunday to see Mr. Brown, why not start shooting more adventure shops and other movies with more black players and stars? that we saw eleven Cops & Robbers, Bad-ass Private Detective movies, comedies, all the way along the way. CLAUDINE (1974). <br /> <br /> CLAUDINE does not have any stigmatization or simple classification as "Blackploitation" because this story is universal and easy to do as a story about people. ny descent, anywhere and not only in the 1970s in the US. <br /> <br /> That story was made by one of Claudine's mother (Dianne Carroll) who tried to keep the family together. "two marriages and two almost marriages." has come a long way from Harlem's style. The problems that break the daily lives of our citizens are faced and studied under the sociological microscope of the ols. <br /> <br /> But we also consider Claudine's psychological and physical needs of a female. "A woman needs a man and a man must have their own MATE," and we recognize this point. (This is SEX, which we are talking about, Schultz!) Claudine will meet a very masculine, broad shoulder, sporty type Private Scavanger Garbage Man, Ruppert B. Marshall (James Earl Jones) and they will go on. <Br A large social welfare institution intervenes when Claudine's welfare worker, Miss Tayback (Elisa Loti), goes around to see who is involved in it, who suddenly pays so much attention to Claudine's family. <br /> <br /> After a humiliating experience of auditing the Welfare Office and "deducing" that would be the norm for the family, the two will decide to marry the Big Brother blessing or not. Meanwhile, Claudine's eldest son is involved with some great speakers, but doing little with a group of black activists. But with the help of Ruppert, they get them all through. O.K. <br /> <br /> It ends with a happy, joyful and hopeful note. We know it may not be exactly "... fortunately ever after!", But rather it will do it all together! If there is one criticism that we have to say that in such a film, there is sometimes a misunderstanding of much of Urban Blacks. And that means that the obvious indirect myth that all whites are wealthy, with no need for help, at work or with disabled people. <br /> <br /> Not True! NOTE: * At one point, Jim Brown's career was a real hit as a tough activator. He was even accused of "... John John Wayne." NOTE: ** The idea of ​​All-Black Casting filmed by All-Black Casts was not a new idea. In the 1920s, 30s and 40s, we saw people like Noble Johnson, Spencer Williams, Jr and Rex Ingram. <br /> <br /> NOTE: *** This is "as time goes by", you know, Schultz, it is from CASABLANCA (Warner Brothers, 1942).
