The 80s are largely considered a decade when horror decided to have fun. Sometimes it was behind the brains (such as "Evil Dead II", "Creeps Night" and "Dying Back of Life"), and then there were movies that were meaningless, but had a solid low rental capacity and were ideal for evening and friends . Movies such as "Pieces" and "Blood Diner" have been stored on the shelves in the 80s and 90s, offering little intelligence or craftsmanship but plenty of entertainment. Kevin Tenney's 1988 "The Demons Night" is part of this tradition - silly, ill-acted, and not original bone in its body, but destructive if you don't have the good time. <br /> <br /> The plot is so simplified that it was supposed to come from the 80s: a group of dark teenagers, played by a number of actors in their mid to late 20th century, decided to go to Hull House, which was missed by Angela ( Mimi Kinkade) and Suzanne (Scream Queen Legend of Linnea Quigley.) Well, Angela and the cover. decide to throw s√©ance. It turns out that Gob would call it "Huge Mistake", as characteristic of Will Arnett's "Arrested Development", because the demonic power will soon have Angela and will begin to reach out to others. <br /> <br /> Take "The Evil Dead," "Nightmare's Elm Street," and your average stupid dead teen flick, throw them in a blender and "Night of Demons" is what you get. Film is something other than original and it is not a good movie. The whole thing is an unpleasant derivative, the action is terrible, the jokes often go flat, the characters are annoying (especially the character of the Stooge) and there are many holes in the plot. It's on the road, it's still fun. Why? <br /> <br /> One thing is that make-up and gore effects are top-notch, some truly memorable moments (especially the nasty and just an odd lipstick tube) that really stay out. It also rarely plays if it takes itself too seriously, but except for some terrible bumps, it plays straight and doesn't waste time on the audience when they become aware of it. In addition, the whole company has a solid energy and enthusiasm that is almost impossible to resist. Yes, it is nothing special, but he knows it, and it cannot be proud of this fact. This is a horror movie of a fun party, and it never represents anything more. <br /> <br /> It may not be classic, but "Night of the Demons" is a good example of junk junk food. It may not be too memorable or original, but sometimes you don't want an ancient beer. Sometimes you want Budweiser.
