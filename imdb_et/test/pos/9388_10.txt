I watch a lot of movies. A lot of movies. Completing the curriculum in the film forces you to watch 2-3 breads in one year. It's all very tiring. Mostly because I feel I've seen it all. It is so rare to be surprised that I usually see something as good as I expect. <br /> <br /> The Death Bed is so different from what I have ever experienced that I have had a DVD to hear about my genius. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of the piece is psychotic. It is structured in a way that forces the viewer to stay outside the frame. It's not like anything like Halloween, with all the delicate edits and POV shots; The death bed rises as dreamy. The most intentional way I express it is: it's Samuel Beckett, who makes a movie about a haunted house. I mean it's a manic depressive bed that eats people! And fried chicken! Off somewhere in the middle! And there are bone hands! I can barely express my feelings about my movie. And yes, it likes it to make you ridiculous. But things become real for some time. Its hard to be a cinephile and a persistent deal. I can honestly say it's a completely unique movie up and down. What is it, how to put it together. We need such films, films that shake us out of our dissatisfaction. Note that this is an existential camp. it is fun and it is stupid, but also wonderful in its strange little ways. The slowest horror villain? Maybe, but at least it's not a mask man.
