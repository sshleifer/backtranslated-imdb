Obviously, Pony may be seen as not just a new stupid animated film that the studio could just survive. It's far from it, and it's easy to describe as a fascinating, beautiful movie experience. <br /> <br /> Miyazaki is indeed another masterpiece. For many, this has been said to be the least of his achievements in making films, because some of his "certain miracle factor" was not there. This is true - the morals and perceptions that are not so obvious in his earlier films are very much in this picture. Ponyot is not too difficult to understand or understand. I think his idea was to prepare a children's film that was as suitable for adults as their children, and that it would not be too difficult. He did it perfectly and he didn't lose any substance along the way, which is why he gets 10. <br /> <br />. as his presentation is so beautiful, it was frightening from time to time as I remembered how all of them were drawn by Miyazaki himself. After seeing the film, I haven't been so enlightened and happy when I saw it once (the second movie can't be skipped). Everything about Ponyo was absolutely stunning and breathtaking; even this music was pure perfection. The only bad thing I have to say about this was copying his English. Don't do me wrong, they were good too, but I had seen Pony about two weeks before it came out nationally, and I believed that in some respects I would have kept some of his Japanese dialogue (not all) this but there was "english" too). All in all, everyone should see Pony; it is completely flawless and in the second film making genre. Finally, do not hold me, but I would not be surprised if Ponyo got the best picture because there are currently 10 movies available. It's just so good.
