I've never read Bard's original work or seen it, I can't compare it to my story. So I don't want to. Instead, I just say it was a very fun story with some very special special effects (and some that seemed slightly lower in the budget but still enough to enjoy). I thought all the main participants did a good job. The style of magic seemed to be blacker than white, and it was almost certain that it would offend anyone who was easily upset by such a thing, but I thought it was well done.
