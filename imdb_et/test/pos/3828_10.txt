I thought I would add another observation here. Although in this episode, there are a few visual sub-references to unpublished opportunities between Jim Kirki and Yeoman Janice Beach; at the end, there is a special, physically present, moment. When a company turns to the emergency speed, trying to overcome a potentially deadly Romulan plasma ball, Janice, perhaps, will map her life to a dramatic end, looking for comfort by placing her head on Jim's sympathetic shoulder as they watch their imminent death viewer. I thought it was sweet (and of course Janice is beautiful!). <br /> <br /> (P.S. Goof: - On several occasions, when phases are alleged to be burned, the film has been triggered by torpedoes)
