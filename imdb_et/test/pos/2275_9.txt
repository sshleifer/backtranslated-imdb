I walked into the cinema without waiting for a movie I was witnessing "Everything is Illuminated". I was delighted with what I barely felt about American films. The actor, Leiv Schreiber, film director debut is followed by a by-pass man, accompanied by an eccentric group that consistently dances an English-speaking bar from Eukraine, his grandfather who believes he is blind, and their crazy dog. The first part of the film is funny and intelligent, with a very small, but superb character, a very European taste, while the other side of the film is a bit of a story of discovery and the Holocaust. This little film brings out so much emotion and so many colors that have such a wonderful conclusion and what is more than just lighting, but also relationships and connections. The actor is incredibly powerful, the story is mysterious and interesting, and the artistic appeal of cinematography for death. With some amazing and absolutely touching scenes, I managed to beat all the hearts.
