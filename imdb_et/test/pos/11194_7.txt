My interpretation is that the term "distant" is used as a "warm" opposite; people who are not warm to others. The film reminds me of the Dalai Lama's teachings in "Happiness in Art", where his main point is that the key to happiness is related to others. Not only are movie characters isolated, but also humorous, charming, shy, quiet and friendly. These features prevent them, among other things, from designing and enjoying relationships and being able to talk and deal with their problems. And that's why they're terribly unhappy. I see it as a strong confirmation of the Dalai Lama's teaching (I am not otherwise Buddhist). If you are one of those people who think their behavior is a natural response to living in a metropolis, I think you may be right, but I recommend the Dalai Lama's book. City life doesn't have to be like that. <br /> <br /> I see why some people find it boring - it pulls up a little and the characters aren't very nice. And this is in contrast to Lost In Translation, where the island's characters are much more pleasant and connect with each other, even though they don't connect with people in general.
