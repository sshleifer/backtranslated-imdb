It's one of my all-time favorite, cheaper, vampire B-movies. <br /> <br /> Calvin Klein's underwear model ... oh, I mean, Stefan, a good vampire, will return to Transylvania to rise to Vampiric Royalty, but the manicure-reduced and ever-devastating brother of Radu has other plans. Having killed his father Vampire King, Radu now assigns Stefan's new Stefan's new mortal friend Michelle and his two real friends and a powerful Bloodstone. <br /> <br /> Okay, the scenery is beautiful and it should be as it was photographed on Transyl-frise-vania to be gosh. The actors are not big shakes and Stefan's hero vampire is about as charming as the freezer, but who cares? There's only one reason to watch this movie and it's called RADU! He is fixed to Nosferate and has the best features in the film, all spoken with a man's middle voice, smoking 10 cigarette packages a day. The scene of the cemetery festival is one of the best scenes in the film, because Radu is slowly approaching the camera and opening his ridiculous face that the world sees. I found myself rejoicing and sacrificing my perfect brother. But maybe I'm just sick. The questionable taste for men, I recommend this movie to vampire enthusiasts. It's original, it's fun, and Radu is one of the best vampires I've seen for a long time ... much more fun than the rigid, tragic, whirling Undead brats that endlessly grace the horror screens these days. Radu enjoys his sadism and never apologizes. He's a vampire.
