An example of genius filming. An epic story of the three main stages of life for a young boy who was spoken beautifully and raw without fear. There is rarely a film that causes me to say loudly during most of the viewing, "it's really a good movie ...." That's what happened when I watched this movie. I really do not understand how someone did not like it. I found myself in moments, crying and laughing at the same moment because I couldn't control how I felt about this scene. Operation is not working. Eric Mabius - why isn't he on the whole movie screen? He was very extraordinary. His seemingly relaxed test on the screen affected me deeply terribly. I thank him. In my opinion, Eric Schaeffer is one of the best filmmakers and I hope he will continue to face the challenges he faces in trying to give us art in the face of artificial filmmaking. <br /> <br />
