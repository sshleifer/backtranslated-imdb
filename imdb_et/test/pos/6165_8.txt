Compared to the British battle, it is a real film with real characters and a real plot. The British battle is basically a documentary with random Lawrence Olivier and Michael Cain, but the real main characters are saliva, hurricanes, and so on. On the other hand, you have two well-processed characters (actually three) and a real storyline. I recommend it to every person, even those who do not like war films in particular. It's well filmed and I don't know what a director could do if he had big capitals behind him. And I don't think it's too sentimental. It's just that the fighters you have are real people with real feelings and real life - both real and any fictional life in every great movie.
