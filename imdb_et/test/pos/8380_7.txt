Operation Scorpio (AKAThe Scorpion King) does not slip to the top 25 minutes, but when it hits top speed, it offers truly amazing martial arts scenes that require the attention of the viewer. This does not mean that the first hour is worthless? just that, compared to the final fight, it seems a bit constant. <br /> <br /> Plot revolves around Yuk-Su, a talented comic artist who dreams of being a hero? his drawings. When Yuk-Su rescues a young girl, Siu-Yu, who is sold for prostitution, carries her evil boss's hatred. Sony, a scorpion-style kung fu leader, gives Wa minions to Yuk-Su and maid servant. Yuk-Su's father intervenes but is injured. After some friendly bodybuilders have rescued, these three end up hiding their friend's Master Yat's noodle snack restaurant. <br /> <br /> Yuk-Su learns to bake noodles, but also regularly sniffs to secretly build his strength and learn kung fut Jean, who saved them under the guidance of a rescued muslimlebound teacher. When Captain Yat has to leave the business, Yuk-Su remains behind the kitchen; but he goes out to practice his skills with Jean, leaving Siu-Yu to serve his clients. Sonny and his men visit the restaurant and worry about the noodles they serve in the trash restaurant. <br /> <br /> When teacher Yat learns that Yuk-Su has been sneaking out, he tells him that he should have learned kung fu; It turns out that Master Yat was formerly a Triad assassin until he decided to change his way. Under the guidance of Master Yat, Yuk-Su improves his skills, even by learning the hidden kick art. Yuk-Su finally gets a chance to try and become a true hero when his friend Fatty says his servant has also been sold for prostitution. With Jean, they visit Wa, who wear French brothels looking for new women. If they are presented with a fatty servant, she randomly blows her fist and eventually strikes a great style. In spite of his best efforts, Son sucks very badly and he and Yuk-Su are forced to flee. Returning to the restaurant, Yuk-Su finds it despicable; and worst, bad guys have found Siu-Yu! Yuk Su, accompanied by Master Yat, returns to Wa to try and save Siu-Yu ... <br /> <br /> Despite some pretty fun training, the Wa House House's slow structure is too drawn and without without any serious fighting scenes. It is a shame that tedium was not crushed in the middle of a decent residue, rather than saving all the fruity things to the end. <br /> <br /> The last fight is a worthwhile end; Won Jin gives the jaw a fall when the surprising Sonny, who amazes, strikes and spins with great skill and skill, and Chin Kar-Lok gives a solid result as an artist-turned fighter Yuk-Su. Particularly good is the old school kung fu star Lau Kar-Leung (AKA Liu Chia Liang) as Master Yat, which proves that this old-timer has still got what the ass needs! Although Scorpio is not a perfect film, it has a lot of eye-catching action in its finals to make sure you watch it. <br /> <br /> NB! Maybe some names are wrong. My DVD calls different names than IMDb.
