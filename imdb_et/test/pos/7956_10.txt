If you want to see a movie that has no weapons, blood, sex, cries of angry people, heroes, bad vocals and girls, or even clumsy love words, and you want to see a movie in which every shot has the meaning of "LOVE" then this one has to see the movie. For me, I've been waiting for a movie like my whole life.
