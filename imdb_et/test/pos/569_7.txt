This is an exciting documentary about a 15-year-old black guy accused of murdering tourists in Florida and the following case. What this movie shows is how the American police system is broken and how easy it is to convict the innocent man and how the old man stupid who thinks a black man looks like the other, and in prison because he said he was a man who murdered my wife. The asterisk is a defense lawyer who not only has his own court in court but also what the police should have done all the time. Exciting things. 7 out of 10
