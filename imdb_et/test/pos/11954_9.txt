80's comedies (especially with John Cusak) are fantastic. Almost everyone is mountainous and instant classic and this film is no exception. Lots of youngsters to other films (i.e., Godzilla and Jaws) through a movie that is so mountainous that you laugh at hours. Some may complain that the film is sometimes a bit cunning, but hey it was 80's and things were always a little cheesy. Throw a young Demi Moore and even a stronger Bob Cat and you are ridiculous for your fans. If you haven't seen it, you will soon be !!!!!!
