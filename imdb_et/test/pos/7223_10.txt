ROMEO AND JULIET had been interpreted in so many ways, but very few versions took part in the game. Those I think it really is the spirit of nail romance were the NEIGHBORHOOD and, believing or not, Troma Movie TROMEO AND JULIET. At first glance, this is another scandal, and many would think it would violate Shakespeare's classics. However, the film has a fair feeling. Updated to naturally appeal to today's sick young people, but not without it. Yes, frequent breakages, body piercing, car accidents, lesbian sexual scenes, masturbation and incest are bad tastes, but what is wrong with having a sweet love story like a foundation? As bad as most of the people in this movie are (I mean, it's IS Troma, after all), the two guides are the real chemistry, the more so with the big budget TITANIC and STAR WARS EPISODE TWO. There is a lot of modernization, but much of the original text is in tact, especially when Tromeo and Julia are together. There's a big scene where Juliet speaks of the famous: "Departure is such a sweet sad," and tromeo follows quickly, in the mid-nineties. I think it is really regrettable that this film does not achieve recognition or widespread release, which it deserves. I hope that those who see it on the shelves of video products will not turn the film off because of the brand because they would be quite subversive to exclusivity.
