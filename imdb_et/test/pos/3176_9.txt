This is one of those films that was never made public, and so it was stuck when it was originally played in theaters. <br /> <br /> I found it at the time of switching TV channels, and I was immediately caught up in the aging ring, whose carelessness and lack of responsibility damage everyone around him. I've often wanted to see the movie again, but I couldn't even remember its name, and I've never seen it in rental stores. <br /> <br /> James Coburn and Slim Pickens were great in their role and the rodeo shots were the first. When it comes to the feature film and the western theme and theme, everyone can enjoy it, regardless of their taste in the movies.
