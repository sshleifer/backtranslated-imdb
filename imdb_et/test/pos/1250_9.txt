Really great movie. Bruce Willis gives his message-film his ever-outstanding comedy-romantic actor power and the film gives hope to the losers many of us know. A gift for all the medieval people, whose time seems so perfect and empty: the next curve is more, and it can be great, enriching and romantic. Leave the recent past back and go back to the lessons of the past and then take your favorite flight to your better future. If we could re-live our youthful experiences, if we really remembered the events that shaped us, would we find no special freedom? Watch the movie, open the gift.
