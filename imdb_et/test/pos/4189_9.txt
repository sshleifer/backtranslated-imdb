I can't believe it's not a big golden hit. Perhaps people in 1968, who thought of Monkees as a Beatles foolish factory-made pop band attack, refused to see it. This cynicism is probably covered since then. Don't make that mistake. _Head_ is an amazing movie that most people with open-mindedness appreciate. It's very funny and very intelligent (and very trippy).
