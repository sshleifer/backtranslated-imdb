It is a shame that perhaps the viewer who found the film is the most useful when collecting a limited rating, probably not seeing it. <br /> <br /> The imaginary heroes follow a teenage life after the suicide of their brothers. Of course, this is not the most original story in the world, but it spends a lot of time on the humanization of its parents, the "imaginary heroes" who couldn't live in their sons' eyes. <br /> <br /> For young people who tend to be responsible for their failures with their parents but still refuse to accept their actual responsibility, the film sends a strong message that we all have the concerns we need to deal with and that we all we do our own. <br /> <br /> But unlike other films that tend to claim the independence of young people, it solves the problems between parents and the child and becomes a stronger entity for it. The oldest suicide of a child is regrettable, but no attention is paid to the film later, and the responsibility of all parties for the tragedy is thoroughly explained. <br /> <br /> Though the theme has already been covered, it hasn't been so covered - the movie shoots very little. Now that it's earned its R rating, it's confusing - you probably can't reach teenagers without being realistic, but limiting reality limits this very audience. <br /> <br /> Whether my younger high school class has shown this movie, two suicides may be hampered. In this case, the censors seem to have made a very bad assessment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
