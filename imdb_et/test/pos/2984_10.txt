Well ..... I wouldn't want to talk to anyone, but I feel like saying a few things that I consider important to this BEAUTIFUL movie. I saw it for the first time in 1976 (I was 14) and then one more year. It was so. The rest was the pink LP of Elton John's soundtrack, which made the music and story deeper and deeper into the heart. How deep? A week ago, I was given a copy of a cousin VHS. (There are no DVDs yet). Boy .... I was surprised! Poets have always advocated that deep experiences of childhood and adolescence about beauty, love, God, idealistic endeavors would remain with you forever. Because they occur mainly at the heart level (no intellect yet!), Then they define the contours of your soul as the sculptor makes a stone. If sometimes we have forgotten how right they are, we could better understand the meaning of every minute, every decision, every turning point. So, I admit I know nostalgia. But its exciting part is to watch the movie again and keep it back in time, enriching this understanding of why we, the people of the 60s, grew as we did. The spirit of these times is here: Genesis, created far from the official consumption and economic world, does not love war, beautiful pop ballads, the poem of words, a completely romantic view of adolescent rebellion with awakening of sexuality is carefully packed in delicate and good love, these two lonely the spirit that is still full of childhood innocence, grow together as they learn and become "adults". <br /> <br /> I showed the film to a group of schoolchildren and they got a lot of simpler and cynical comments about it as naive and stupid. Guys, be serious! Cinema is art and art does not only reflect human emotions but historical moments. That's what "Friends" do masterly. It reflects an idyllic idea of ​​rebellion and a new beginning, of which we all dreamed when we were 15. I am now a musician and I feel that some of us, the artists of the subject, are still dreaming of it! How else can we live? It's "friends", this is "Brother Sun Sister Moon", this is "Hair." These were times that were still alien to AIDS, direct and vulgar texts of strangers that were not melodic in pop songs, pornography that was presented as "sexuality", this barbaric "world regime" that grows after September 11th. <br /> <br /> What is the experience of heart warming to see Paul and Michelle again, wisely and gently exploring new fantasies of your romantic world. The journey to the heart of our heart: Paris, the best of Elton John, this urban scenario surrounded by 2 CV Citroëns and VW Beetles. What fresh air is in Camargue's peaceful house, surrounded by fish ponds and natural horses. They made us who we are, like Serrat in Spain, Brel in France, Peter Paul and Mary, Joan Baez, Luther King, Beatles, early Bee Gees, Belafonte's spirits, Gandhi, Elvis Gospel. <br /> <br /> People still hope to get this picture. Start with the innocence and grow up there. You know what it is. And from there you have a solid and true foundation; some ideals to look for in life, a way to deal with personal and world affairs. We need it so much today! Give yourself a chance and maybe one day the cynics will end. (I have an extra copy of VHS) <br /> <br /> Santiago Zuleta. Bogotá, Colombia.
