In Mississippi, the former blues man Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis, leaving his wife who just left him. She finds that the town's slut and nymphomaniac Rae (Chritina Ricci) was loaded on her small farm near a road that has been stunned, beaten and almost dead. Lazarus brings his home, giving medicine and nursing care, and nourishes him as his father, keeping his chain in check for his heat. When his boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is released due to his anxiety disorder due to his army, he misunderstands the relationship between Lazarus and Rae and tries to kill him. <br /> <br /> "Black Snake Moan" is a strange story of faith, hope, love and blues. The talented Christina Ricci is an impressive force in the role of her father's youngsters who have been abused by childhood and had sex in the whole city where she lives. This is the amazing versatility of this actress, and probably the most mature work I've seen with Christina Ricci. Samuel L. Jackson also has a fantastic performance in the role of Lazarus. Soundtrack is one of the most beautiful I've ever heard on film, with great blues. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Entre o CÃ©u e o Inferno" ("Between Heaven and Hell")
