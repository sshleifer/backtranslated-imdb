Okay, I say that. This movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt. This statement can offend some of you who think this movie is nothing more than a waste of film. But the thing most people don't get is that this movie was to be bad and funny. Did you think people thought the killer snowman movie was a masterpiece? Just look at the "scary" hologram movie jacket and you'll find the answer. Instead of the original Jack Frost (which I thought it was just as funny), this film turned out to be a splintering journey into the depths of tough dialogue, bad linings and terrible special effects. And all this has been made to laugh at the viewers. It certainly worked for me. <br /> <br /> For example: Anne Tiler (for her husband in difficulty): What makes you so dear to sweetheart? <br /> <br /> If you don't laugh at this dialogue, you have serious problems. Who in the right mind would say these words in real life? Of course, someone because it was meant to be ridiculous! Just look at this movie with an open mind and low expectations, and hopefully you'll see Jack Frost 2 as funny jokes.
