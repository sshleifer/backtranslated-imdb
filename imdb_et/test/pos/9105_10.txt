I was fortunate enough to win free passes to the POD sneak preview. Let me just tell you, in this preview I was very interested! The film is absolutely shaken! What I really liked was that JB was in his element. With other movies, such as "Rock of Rock", he makes fun music for kids and families, but this music is obviously all about him. <br /> <br /> I took my brother and sister with me to see it and we laughed basically all the time. There are a couple of places where I don't know what the hell they meant, because some things are a bit separated, but mostly it was great. A lot of time that didn't seem like a low budget movie, so it's a plus. <br /> <br /> What I was most surprised was Dave Grohl Satan. This is fun! You don't know to see the movie he has. <br /> <br /> I say if you are a rock fan and you are in JB, KG and / or Tenacious D, watch the movie. Be prepared for LOT drug references, many four-star words and some skull-breaking stones!
