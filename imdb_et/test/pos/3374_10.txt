I'd give this movie honestly 7.5, but I clicked 10 to try to compensate 5 pages of immaculate, unjustified 1-star comments. This is an interesting story, all the actors are good for the very good (even Mrs Diaz, who is here a normal grinning-bimbo role, but she plays it well.) The sets are perfect and cinematography is always a crappy. This is a subtle moral game and * there is no reason to explain the origin of God / supernatural / alien / what is "the course of the exhibition", so I'm glad the movie isn't trying. For the story it is really irrelevant, which is relatively long but quite convincing and concise to the end. <br /> <br /> Before you decide that this movie is terrible (or something below ~ 7.5), read a few dozen 1-star "hated" comments that are widespread, lack of punctuation, and capitalization and juvenile criticism. Perhaps the trailer was misleading or something - I didn't see it - but some of these appraisers were probably waiting for Terminator 4 or Saw 5 (one reviewer compared this movie to Saw! How totally inappropriate and independent!) <Br /> <br /> Seriously, most of these reviews read like your-tube comments - according to these "critics", this movie is too confusing, but too predictable, not enough action, but there's too much, too clever, too clever, too stupid, too much to explain , but leaves too much inexplicable ... oh - and it's probably a "waist (sic)" of time. Before taking them to your heart, consider the quality and source of the reviews. I am afraid that these 1-star kids could not understand the phrase "altruism coefficient" and were therefore perfectly capable of understanding the premise of the film (despite arguing that they would "get it" before explaining how confusing it was!) these two words mean you have no trouble understanding (and enjoying) this movie. <br /> <br /> I really want to have a reviewer reputation system here, so I could definitely ignore the rating of this movie for 1 star forever. <br /> <br /> Take a look at it yourself and enjoy the interesting moral "test" and its consequences in a subtle presentation. I think it's a good time.
