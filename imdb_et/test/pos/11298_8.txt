WONDERBIRD, definitely an incredibly refined comic that is made in a tastefully obsolete manner, and is almost sensationally old in every respect, takes place in a kingdom dominated by an average and terrible monarch; respectively, the kingdom, or at least what we see around the king's palace, seems incomplete, uninhabited. <br /> <br /> Some of the inhabitants are a city away from the sun wading away from the sun. <br /> <br /> Tips call it allegoric, call it parable, not just call it fabulous. <br /> <br /> Because IMDb encourages reproduction and maybe also for other reasons, I add that this work is a great work of Paul Grimault.
