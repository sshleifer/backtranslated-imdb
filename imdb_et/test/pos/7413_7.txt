There wasn't much effort for this movie, but it was pleasantly surprised. A very well made film, very well cut, does not really reach the height that Human Traffic did, but it is a very good effort. Well managed and I thought the leading player made great performance! In fact, the only bad power of the movie was from Tim Curry, who should be the name. <br /> <br /> Cool Film surprised that it hasn't done better. I would never have heard of it until I saw it with my companions. <br /> <br /> I am not a robber, but I imagine people who really like this movie.
