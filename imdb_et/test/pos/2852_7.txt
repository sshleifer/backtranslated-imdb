This is the story of a man who went to comedy and became a horror film. A true story about a man who has admired and frightened with pictures when he suddenly found himself with one of them. An incredible story of A GUY, which became more terrifying when a female hero was both mistaken and male. Gosh, is that what made us life? People deceive the perfect face, imagining how this face should be perfect inside? "Toto, I think we're no longer in Kansas."
