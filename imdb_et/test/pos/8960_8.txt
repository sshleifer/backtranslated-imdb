Yes, this movie has many gay characters. It also has straight characters, characters who are not certain in their sexuality, people who are looking for the truth about their existence. <br /> <br /> This is not a sexual orientation film. It is about loneliness and the difficulties people often experience in connecting each other. In a film, Denys Arcand balances between relatively different dimensions and contrasting, ever-changing relationships. The serum killer element is a bit less successful (it seems to be a way of packing different plot points, and unlike the rest of the movie, it is thematically difficult). <br /> <br /> The center and base of Thomas Gibson; it is a silent performance, but behind a beautiful, arrogant exterior, he slowly shows a frightening soul who is afraid to show or receive the love of the people around him. Supporting casting is strong, especially Mia Kirshner as a friend of Gibson. His role is more metaphor than literally - strangely innocent and at the same time covered, he represents the light and darkness of the sexual consciousness of the characters. <br /> <br /> Film inclusion and often surprises in your character development. The effect is somewhat similar to Robert Altman, who runs the David Mamet script --- the dialogue does not diminish from some of the observations that begin in a few moments. We often ignore the love that exists around us --- in our friends, family, those who can see us, as we are, in search of our love and our usual "relationship". Arcand and the writer Brad Fraser make some tips on the different ways people try to escape and deny their loneliness and how this denial returns to us in so many unexpected ways. <br /> <br /> This movie is a rewarding experience. It may not be for grandmothers who are unable to circumvent the sexual orientation of some of the characters to see a greater, transcendental message of hope and redemption. Loneliness is a universal experience. Such a film, which dares to explore the darker side of our lives with smart and attentive, deserves applause and open thinking.
