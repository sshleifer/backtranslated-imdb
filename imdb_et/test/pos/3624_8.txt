I hope that Spike Milligan can enjoy and enjoy this movie from his place to the heavenly comic throne, because Terence Ryan and Ken Tuohy have taken a book that the author himself said he wrote this "almost crazy" joy. <br /> <br /> The film speaks about the story of the Irish town of Puckoon and the ensuing problems when the partition between Northern Ireland and the Republic is built, cutting it through the center of the village and still harshly, in the middle of the churchyard. It causes some of the dead buried in the Catholic churchyard, now in the northern part of Protestants - and so with the help of many eccentric locals, the local priest tries to move the bodies into the shadow of darkness and avoid the bureaucratic British Border Guards inspired to conquer the Irish comedian and poet Sean Hughes to play The part of Madigan. He brings part of the innocence, especially to his camera pieces (which is usually where he interacts with Richard Attenborough's voice, allegedly playing the film's writer / director). Daragh O'Malley, who plays for his father Rudden, is also worthy of praise; and the rest, such as Elliott Gould and Griff Rhys Jones, that people who are commonly referred to as "bit sections", such as Spike's daughter Jane, who plays Madigan's wife, give 100% for that. is not a small part of the excellent characterization of Spike's original book. <br /> <br /> I can say that the film is a little too long or that Elliott Gould's Irish accent was a bit unwanted, but that it would be just a few points and wouldn't take anything to the top of this movie.
