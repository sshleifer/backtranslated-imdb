I was delighted to see these two chairs at the Atlantic Film Festival (one), which was interesting because he laughed at very different times than us. <br /> <br /> Filmed in Atlantic Canada, the film is about three teenage girls who spend a lot of energy on their youth in their last summer to sleep with a married 30-year-old despite great protest. <br /> <br /> It is definitely worth a look, but humor was directed to a completely different demographics than what I live (Male 18-25), so I shook my head instead of the laughing gentlemen. Nonetheless, this story is strong enough to keep yourself alive, so it would be fun without so much laughing.
