I looked at it again. I wanted to show it to one of my friends and we had the best time. That's why such movies, people entertain, and Zombie Bloodbath 2 do it for me and for everyone to whom it is shown. <br /> <br /> The story concerns a group of teenagers who are driving a group of escaped prisoners who have taken over an old farmhouse. If the scarecrow (which is actually a demon that I think) gets distracted, it comes to life and revives the bodies from local cemeteries. This only leads our heroes to flee only to land in the hands of two mad killers who are tortured in some small towns. Soon it will be a zombie fight for people. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie! From different formats (black and white film, video and digital cameras) to very fast and great music, there was always something going on and it will never leave you! Of course, it is cheap, but you can say that this film was a lot of care and hard work. I've read other comments and I can say that these people have forgotten this point. If you want a 35 mm full moon fluff or if you're in a modern stuff like Urban Legend, I'll tell you that. If you like low budget stuff like Gell of Hell and Evil Dead, I'll tell you to buy it right now. is pretty good and editing is very impressive. There are two more movies to fill in! It's actually one of the best b-movies I've ever seen.
