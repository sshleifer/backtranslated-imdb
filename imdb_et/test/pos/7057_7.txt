I saw it for the first time in ten or fifteen years ... maybe almost 20. Sometimes it was better than I remembered ... in the second, it was much worse. <br /> <br /> First, there is music. It's just terrible. There are only 5 songs in the movie, most of which are used more than once. The opening song deserves the irritation of the choir and the disco-y title is created by Rick Dees. It won't get worse. Even the background music is terrible, much of which repeats the themes of other nausea stories. We get some really hips, mostly opening credits. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Bill Murray is common on the ground, as usual ... you have to think about whether he put the whole thing down or if the writers just gave him all the funny features. Or maybe he's just what makes a weak script into a comic gene. The best part is his surreal PA messages. ("Lobsters ... get out of here ... you're in danger!") <br /> <br /> You'll get much more character development if you have the right to wait for this movie. At least half of the characters seem to be real people ... and mostly real people you want to stay around with. Even "Spaz" can do more than any other Eddie Deezen-type character, and when she gets a girl, it is plausible. (She is not absurdly hot, but she is not automatically odd with one joke girl - see "Nerd's Revenge" for both cinematic phenomena.) <br /> <br /> And if the plot looks like clichés, you have to wonder if there was no cliché when they did. Though it was not the first summer camp movie, you have to go back at least "Parent Trap" - this is definitely the movie that made it into its genre. In fact, I was surprised that there was no Talent Show scene ... "Wet Hot American Summer" is such an excellent summer camp genre, I just assumed that everything was found in meatballs. (I was also half waiting for Jon Cryer to pull a chimp with a chimp, thanks to the "Monk Academy" epic camp competition "Mr. Show". <br /> <br /> Anyway, it seems to have been comedies in the late 70s or early 80s disappearance - it is no longer a cable clamp, and certainly it has no Caddyshack or Animal House culture. I was glad I got this Showtime today and high definition! Of course, this is terribly awful, but in the 70's / 80's teen comedy you can do a lot worse. And again, Murray is a genius.
