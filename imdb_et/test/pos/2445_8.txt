Foreigners are undoubtedly the classic Australian TV series. Well-defined characters, narrow scripts, diverse and interesting places, great stars and a cinematic atmosphere that all combine to make this series special. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Andrew Keir from Germany, Sascha Hehn, has not shown (unfortunately) a small screen in his home country. ABC repeats the series several times, but the DVD edition is not yet running. <br /> <br /> The series is timeless. It's as likely that it will hit the audience with a resonant chord as it did on its day. Come ABC ... free The Outsiders from DVD !!!!!
