I'm surprised by the questions and questions that this documentary brought in the comments, especially since they are really interesting questions. Certainly, those who could do the best would be the filmmakers themselves. Nonetheless, I think I can think of light, which I think is neglected, which, in my opinion, is the purpose of the film, what it is and what it is trying to convey. What is this message? There was a very clear danger of becoming manifest, and I am going to say that filmmakers have an intention. They try to tell the story, understand it and get a point. With this in mind, we can shoot many critical points, especially those concerning what people expect differently from what filmmakers really tried to show. Causes and Consequences of Violence? The film doesn't talk about it. Isn't Brazilian favelas a "non-Brazilian audience"? Well, who wanted to do that? Does AfroReggae support or support it? This is not important in this context. Isn't there enough tastes in the movie? It does not mean equality or feminist reason. About Anderson's life, mother, son, family, and all aspects of AfroReggae's movement and functioning? Well, don't be so picky because it's not important. There's just such a long length that the story can be before it ceases to be a movie. If the authors should show everything they expect, they should make a 6-month TV series. If you expect all this, you will be wrong in the film. <br /> <br /> Film is actually two people who started moving. Two persons full of ideals. Two people changing. Two people are trying to do something about the crime around them. Individuals who went to the bottom and wanted to get up again. It's all about finding a goal in life, creating inspiration from misery, changing fate, and changing something other than what they were supposed to be - criminals and drug dealers. It is related to achievements and hope, and not to the cruel reality of violence in Rio de Janeiro, although it is an integral part of this film, which is characterized by constant surrounding. Unexpectedly, and for some reason, the film gets much more to Anderson's course through the difficulties of life. This is because they were confronted with Anderson's accident while filming the film. I'm not sure about this, but they could even seriously consider filming out there, leaving behind all efforts. But Anderson wanted to continue. And so they did, threatening to lose a movie with a bit of identity crisis, of course with a sudden change, but winning to show someone over such a devastating event. It is very obvious who follows that the film starts with AfroReggae and rises around Anderson. It is very unique in this sense (shifting the track). Perhaps their only sin does not help to manifest itself beforehand, which may initially raise expectations that remain unfulfilled. <br /> <br /> As for Anderson's importance or organization, I would say that everyone does not want to change the world, stop all violence, eat all the hungry, be like Mahatma Ghandi, be as well-known as Mother Teresa, or other well-known personalities. It's much easier to associate and get inspired from someone who is actually all who are actually trying to change their tough life, raise problematic children, cope with persistent injuries or illnesses and even be able to pay bills. at the end of the month. To understand the film, you need to see that you leave behind the drug and crime past, taking responsibility for it and trying to convince others not to go the same disturbing path. While you may criticize whether the way they chose it is effective and suspects the ideology of this method, you cannot deny your intentions. <br /> <br /> Similarly, the perception that Anderson is special or chosen may have something to do with the fact that filmmakers participated very well in the life of these images. As much as getting friends with them. There's no way it would bring the whole movie to Anderson with a more favorable light. When an expensive friend paralyzes an accident, it's not just a fact if you make it big. And it may not be bad. There is not much that they would treat him as "chosen" as much as they go very long, trying to show him seeds for transformation and a source of inspiration. <br /> <br /> Finally, don't look at this document containing the realities of poverty and the reality of crime, see what this is a much more inspiring story. <br /> <br /> Nike-Ad-like? It just seems damn good and professionally done to me and does not affect or diminish the intentions of the film. Romanticized? Specify your proxy as a documentary if you want, but why not, when it should respond and inspire? Don't try to make people's lives better through music and dancing - the nature of the topic they are trying to do - romanticizing their reality? Excuse me, but just showing the usual facts is what journalists do and you can watch it on TV every night. <br /> <br /> If I wanted to become a filmmaker, I would also like my first film to be great.
