Kate Gulden, one of the most famous in the last decade of this century, and one of the most talented actors, Meryl Streep (out of Africa). She is wonderful in every part she plays. Yale graduate is the pride and joy of American cinema. <br /> <br /> Kate's health is deteriorating and her husband, George, has a well-developed role as a great actor and also an Oscar winner William Hurt (smoke, kiss). Spider Woman) has a hard time with one of the most serious things in her health and looking for her daughter's help. Poor daughter Ellen Gulden, Ren√©e Zellweger (Jerry Maguire) is waiting too much for her. No pauses! The story takes a very realistic view of the older disease. In this film, the only daughter has to keep her life to take care of other needs. There is always such responsibility in every family. Ellen is angry at the beginning of the film, but over time she understands her mother's lifetime commitment to her family. She even asks her mother: How are you doing, every day, in and out and no one noticing it? That's what women do, a lot I call invisible work. In addition, we clean, repair, repair, stretch, celebrate, we are the best friends, we are trustworthy, mistress, introducer, discipline, sensitive. Some of us, like both women in this movie, have perfect education, are the whole family's psychological pillar and do the invisible work! This is Kate Ellen and many women in our society. Many of us have already passed this stage of life when our parents are older and dead. I've been there. They just went too young. I have thanked my parents, but I did not understand them, but when I had to play my roles, I had to walk in my shoes. This film reflects the reality of life. Maybe it's sad, but that's how life is at times. George is a Harvard professor a complex person who seems to think his work is more important than everyone else and has a very "master / maid" mentality towards women in his life. He's not strong enough to cope. If you want to see good action and the reality of life, don't miss this movie. Favorite scenes: Kate Restaurant, Violin and All. Making a table broken from China. That I so symbolically! We're all broken ships! Favorite Quotes: George: "Only uphill will you realize that you are really downhill."
