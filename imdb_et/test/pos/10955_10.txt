Improvisation was used in this film in a breakthrough, but it only works as a novelty. There is no greater truth about the situation, asking the participants to improvise. Performances do not improve improvisation, because the participants now have twice as much concern, not only whether they deliver the line well, but whether the line itself is good. That's why in many Robert Altman films, the productions are often really hypersensitive - because the actors aren't really sure they say which lines have been created and so are not sure if they are good. <br /> <br /> And quite frankly, it is often not very good. Often, the dialogue does not speak from one line to another or surrounds the surroundings. <br /> <br /> It fractures with unpredictable, youthful energy - but frankly, I had a hard time monitoring and focusing on it. Nevertheless, it is an interesting raw film and a commendable 100% thanks to the power of green light. <br /> <br /> That's it. This joke, for example: <br /> <br /> I'm a dancer. What a dancer like a ballet dancer? Oh no ... exotic. <br /> <br /> And the whole party's scene inside it, the next trip to the park and the scene where the boys go see the shape. <br /> <br /> 2 / 5. I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time.
