Watching Armored Preview I thought the film was either a very bad or a very good movie. Fortunately, this movie was entertaining, suspicious and realistic. There is never a perfect crime and Armored showed why. The film is excellent when people get into a stressful situation where they behave like animals. The last hour of the movie is very fun. Matt Dillon is still a very good actor. It's hard to believe Dillon is 50 years old. I'd buy this movie. I'll give Armored eight out of ten. Not a Christmas movie. Did I write another ten lines? No! Anyway, there are not many animated films. There is a lot of excitement in the armor that gives the film user the opportunity to choose another comedy.
