I can't really criticize this movie. It is literally the first film I ever remember and which bring about the life-long love of science fiction and horror films and prehistoric animals. Fortunately, he saw it quite well again years later. Rod Cameron plays a big game hunter whose last safari swept the mammoths. Nobody believes him, including his best friend, played by Cesar Romero, whose brother was among those who killed. And Rod Cameron was the only survivor. The film was taken out of India and there are some good landscapes. Operation is at a high level. I don't think Rod Cameron, Cesar Romero and Marie Winsor have ever been bad. Mammoths, when they finally arrive, are quite effective. The end is also unusual, especially in the 1950s fiction. Definitely worth seeing.
