Take a topic I didn't know and make it exciting, why don't you? It happens that in 1979, director Robert Altman said he didn't think he'd ever made a real movie and that he assumed that one of those kids was running a skateboard - if he didn't neck his first movie. Well, I don't put Stacy Peralta in this expectation, but he's a skateboarder who has made a good movie. Of course, because of the nature of the film, he was forced to use existing material and it is certainly good that there are so many archival materials. Peralta edited it well with the usual talking shots of his regular colleagues, as they are today. The whole effect is postmodern in the best sense, but it's done. Altman's prediction is not quite accurate. But what Peralta has done is capturing the energy of the dark days we can appreciate when Z-Boys has found a modern skateboard. It's all good. I highly recommend "Dogtown".
