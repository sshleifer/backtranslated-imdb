The depiction of marinese in this film is on the spot. Action scenes are some of the best ever produced content accuracy. The uniforms and weapons of both US and German troops were perfect. Berber costumes and weapons were also accurate. This movie can easily be used to teach the militaria period and has been used by the USMC Academy for this purpose. The scenes depicting the rosary and the rifles used were beautiful. Buying so many periods is so good for weapons to pay attention to detail and presentation. What is a genius.
