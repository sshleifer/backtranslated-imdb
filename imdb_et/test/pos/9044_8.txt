It's a 1972 Disney movie. Right now I was 11 years old and I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. In a nostalgic way, I bought three series of DVDs for Dexter Riley and even today, at the age of 46, I still enjoyed them. It was fantasy, magic and pure fun. And it's still! I wasn't sure which of these three films came first and second. Now I have official dates. On December 31, 1969, computer tennis shoes were worn - on July 12, 1972, you now see Him now if you do not do so - on February 6, 1975, the strongest man in the world. I still think the average movie was the best. The special effects in 1972 were amazing for our children. I definitely recommend it for all ages.
