I've been looking for this movie for years. I have great memories of the first-class action and singing of this film. I never knew that the reason why the film was out of reach was because of the activities of the Gershwin family - SHAME ON THEM to try to suppress American classics! I can only hope they release and allow this movie to be released and enjoyed by the American public. <br /> <br /> Sammy Davis, Jr. is the best in this movie. The only other task of her is that it was "Anna Lucasta" - another terrible movie I would like to publish on DVD. <br /> <br /> Porgy & Bess included premium cast. Hopefully one day you will see yourself.
