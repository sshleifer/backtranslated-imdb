Although it was just less than forty minutes in length, it is one of the best and most behaved stories I've ever seen. It achieves in less than 45 minutes what most movies don't get in more than 90. <br /> <br /> This is the story of 10 of two brothers, one 18 and another. Both have fallen into war and conflict rules that love the family. <br /> <br /> This brought tears in my eyes especially because the whole movie has worked and directed so well, and it speaks so many wars where one serves, and the other on the left. <br /> <br /> I can fully recommend this movie as great!
