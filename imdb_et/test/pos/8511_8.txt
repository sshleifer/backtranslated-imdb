While Never Say Never (NSNA) is a weak sound, it's much better than its contest, "Octopussy." Never Say Never Again is an updated and improved version of Thunderball (Connery's least popular bond flick). The NSNA is rich in smart dialogue, intelligence, intelligence, sex appeal and one of the best and most convincing bad guys in the entire bond series. In addition, NSNA has a very talented young and beautiful Kim Basinger. British comedy fans also recognize the actor (Attwood), known as "Mr. Bean". I'm not trading any Moore pictures for that. But earlier efforts by Connery / Bond (except Thunderball) are better. <br /> <br />
