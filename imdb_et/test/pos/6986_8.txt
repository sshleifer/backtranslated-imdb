It opens up too long for a ship that runs through your cliche and runs through the room. I thought there was "Spaceballs" at this point, and I hope there would be a sticker on the back that said, "We'll break no one." The film then shows some cryogenic freezers with Vin Diesel. I've always thought that his voice seems to sound after a quick and mad look. When I discovered he was a criminal, I thought this film was a cliché. It was. It was a very cliché and fate seemed in every direction against them. Black out every 22 years. Lucky for them, they will land on that day. Aliens can only be in the darkness, hey, this is sunshine. As far as I thought it was too easy and just a cliché, the movie pulled out and threw a big @ss. I even went out and bought a copy of Pitch Black after that. I can't really expect Riddick's chronicle.
