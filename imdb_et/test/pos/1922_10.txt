Have you ever found yourself watching a movie or documentary and had to yell back at things like "No! Don't do it!" No? Well it's time to do it. And no doubt it's DEEP WATER that started you. <br /> <br /> The story is based on Donald Crowhuri and his first race in a single race in 1968. This word "individuals" is important because the men who get away with this almost suicide alone. <br /> <br /> Most men are known in the English marine communities (where they are one of the "unknown dark horses" and its name was Donald Crowhurst.) Crowhurst is financially struggling with a supporter who can take him away if he doesn't at least try He could take his home, his property, everything. <br /> <br /> Crowhurst now finds it a stone and ... well ... a deep water: try a non-certified ship and or to lose everything you have (what was important because Crowhurst had a wife and several children.) Here the notion "unverified captain" is also mentioned. He has not only proved that he has never been offshore! I mastered suicide before and after the race and between Crowhurst's friends, family and acquaintances archival material. His ship is leaking. Psyhh extends to a breakpoint (and beyond). Crowhurst finds himself in a lost internal struggle without a successful exit. It is also interesting to see what psychological interruptions are for other competitors when they work on their own boats on their respective ships. <br /> <br /> A wave of similar emotions that you feel when you watch this amazing documentary can make you a little sick (not to try differently to get your navy). And you're probably disappointed with the choices; maybe just as disappointed as the poor Mr Crowhurst. <br /> <br /> The end is also amazing, as we see the real ship Crowhurst drove off the deserted and rotten Caribbean beach ... unlike other things that seemed abandoned and rotten at the end of this poorly thought-out race. <br /> <br /> Unbelievable.
