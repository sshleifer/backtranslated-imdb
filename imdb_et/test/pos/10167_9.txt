A movie that tends to be buried under its predecessor and predecessor - it's a remake! Doris Day is in it! He sings! - Hitchcock's second slit "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is his most prized film, and allegedly he is a full-fledged masterpiece. <br /> <br /> It's more than one Doris Day movie. Not only does he give the best results in his career, but he keeps himself against James Stewart, but the whole film is rather delicately structured rather than his character. After all, this is a movie in which music is both a motive and a plot device. What better casting than her generation's most popular singer? Think: The day Jo McKenna has given up her career on stage to live with her husband and raise her son. It seems to be a reciprocal decision and it doesn't seem to be unhappy. But look at how Stewart battles him in his horse carriage for his concern for Louis Bernard, which means he is jealous that Bernard didn't ask him about his career. It is obviously a recurring joke between them - he answers the "har-de-har-har" that denotes the knowledge of this gag, suggesting that he has a certain hidden resentment for his birth and that both understand it. br /> <br /> When their son is kidnapped, Stewart requires his doping before the news. This is a brutal scene that both actors have played perfectly, illustrating the inequality of their marriage - he tries to control and lower his reactions by basically using his professional knowledge to push his voice into marriage, as his medical care is the strength of this voice is demonstrated by Ambrose's chord order, He must rule his highly educated clarity and volume to mix with the female drudges church - they are almost acting as a warning of what it will become of when it continues to suppress its talent. Albert Hall has his need to cry, use those impressive lungs that save a person's life, and in the embassy finals he will allow his son to find his talent and reputation. By contrast, all Stewart's male activities are detrimental - his visit to a taxoderm is a dead end, he is left behind in church, while all others are moving to Albert Hall and his efforts can only be killed by a murderer, thus losing potentially useful information from the police. It is only when his actions are related to the voice of a woman, when he is rescued from the embassy, ​​that he can actually do something useful. <br /> <br /> Being forced to sing a day away from the movie, "Que Sera Sera" is the first musical instrument in the movie that requires a nightmare around McKennas; "The future is not for us". It also properly prepares the finals, where a close mother and son share the time with music so Doris can save the day. <br /> <br /> The most famous station in the movie makes music a central feature - to collect a murder attempt at Albert Hall. This long-term, non-verbal sequence can be one of the most extraordinary things Hitchcock devoted to the film, which is the ultimate expression of his beliefs about visual stories. We see people doing conversations in that order, but we never hear what they say. We don't have to - the pictures say everything. It is also his finest relationship, the pieces of which are moving slowly when building music. Editing is incredibly tight, perfect for music. There is no frame, because what is not directly related to the murder gives the viewer an environmental feeling, the geography in which it all takes place. It builds slowly, but eventually the intercourse is almost intolerable. When Jo screams, it's not just a relief for him, but an audience. <br /> <br /> The Ambrose cable sequence is witty and especially effective for anyone who has had to sit through a service with a particularly muddy non-conformist church. The queue of the Embassy seems to be a little flat after Albert Hall, which was before the first sight, but the second time seems to be more effective, with the final walk in the gun really enjoying the beautiful use of the song of the day in the background, reminiscent of the Music-like ambient noise in the rear window. The total volume is subtle, allowing you to prioritize music from on-screen sources. <br /> <br /> Bernard Miles is a low-key villain, a little banal, but dry. His wife is Brenda de Banzie, who walks a fine line between evil and sympathy. Just look at how she smokes a cigarette when her husband prepares an assassination - her attitude is a pure gangster mole who is the exterior of the Middle England, but she has a clear soft side and possible mom feelings about Hank. <br /> <br /> Stewart is great, though if Hitchcock really puts it "Everyman", as the director's daughter seems to think, then it confirms that Hitchcock had a cynical view of his audience. Stewart played a hypocritical intellectual who supported the fascist ideology of Rope, a Thriller who mistakenly treated her girl's rear glass and obsessive necrophilia Vertigo. The day is not phenomenal. Just look at his reaction to the news that his son has been kidnapped - he has never overstretched anything, but also does not sell it briefly. This is one of Hitchcock's most emotional films. He never lets us forget what the stakes are for McKennes; they know best all their central signs.
