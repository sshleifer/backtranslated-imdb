This is undoubtedly one of the funniest and fun movies I've ever seen. I really enjoyed the characters of the movie. They are all strange. It's something I've never seen in the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is almost endless to end. There are no boring moments. I was completely caught up in the movie. And I thought the actor was great. <br /> <br /> So if you want to see a fun movie. You should look for The Green Butchers. Great movie. <br /> <br /> I will give it a 10/10
