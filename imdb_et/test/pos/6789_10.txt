I hope we will never become a cynical society to understand the simple beauty of this film: look beautiful with its romantic English painting and the beautiful message of faith and loyalty. See it with your children, especially your young daughters - Velvet Brown is a great role model for girls. It was one of my daughter's favorite films. <br /> <br /> The story is based on Enid Bagnold's best-selling book of Velvet, whose whole life is his horse, Pi and his unanimous dream of "impossible". I'm not talking less about the plot anymore. I'm breaking it for first-time viewers. He lives with a great loving family in a small coastal village. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that made Elizabeth Taylor star and watch a movie to see why. He is a natural actor who radiates inner beauty that fits his outer beauty - trusting, passionate, innocent - he is the emotional core of the film. <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney gives excellent performance Mi, a young man arriving at his doorstep one day, staying and helping Velvet on Pi. This is one of his best performances. It is also a challenge for Anne Revere as the award winning Academy of Velvet's mother. His strong, loving and wise character understands that life is not much valuable if you do not dream of your dreams: "We are the same. I also believe that everyone should have the opportunity to breathe life once in a lifetime." <br /> > I sincerely recommend this very sweet, very inspiring classic from the Hollywood Golden Age.
