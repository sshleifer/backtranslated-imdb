Since they first came to foreign banks and filmed a movie (I've lived here all my life), I've been waiting for this movie to come out. And I mean I waited and waited and waited more than half and half for this movie and for me, it was worth it. <br /> <br /> The film is different from the book, but in my eyes it is a beautiful work, like a book. I both shouted, there were moments that tore me up. I laughed and smiled as much. It's a great movie with a great story. <br /> <br /> It never means giving up, it will change you forever. That will shape your soul and awaken you to a whole new life. <br /> <br /> I have to say that it is possible to meet someone and let them change their lives forever, which is Gere's character. did to Lane. I met the love of my life and immediately I was totally excited that I never forgot her or how I was with her until I met her again after a year. For me, I could communicate with this whole heart about this movie. I think when you listen and watch a movie with your heart and you create, you see what I'm talking about. It is never too late to find your true love, great work by Mrs Lane and Mr Gere!
