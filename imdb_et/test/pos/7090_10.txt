Meryl Streep, who is a dead woman, carries out her role in a marvelous way. No wonder he was for the Oscar. In part, she proves that caring and caring housewives are as important to the business world as their sisters. And the lesson he teaches about life expectancy and lack of life as the relationship grows is the most important thing he teaches his daughter. We can expect too many of your companions. Understand that much slip and forgiveness or understanding are the main ingredients of a happy life. This is a terrible movie and an end, though sad, shows reconciliation between father and daughter. I'll give this one ten.
