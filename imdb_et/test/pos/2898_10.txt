How do these men continue? They are about 50 years old and act as if they were only 30. They play 3 hours of music at each concert and hardly break. This DVD is their first concert in Rio, Brazil. Although people don't speak English, they try to remember the words of the most famous Rush songs and try to sing a foreign language with their best friends at the concert. <br /> <br /> Tom Sawyer The Spirit of the Radio, this concert DVD keeps you in the chair who doesn't want to stop or move from the classics you've listened to as young. This is their 30th assembly (started in 1974). I went to my Scranton PA concert and it was just as good, though they didn't play Freewill in PA, so I was upset. <br /> <br /> They're with Freewill, they have trees, they have trees, they have YYZ, The Pass, Driven, Dreamline, Red sector A, Limelight, Roll the Bones, 2112 and more. 10 out of 10 because nothing compares. If you never go to Rush concert, then at least buy this DVD.
