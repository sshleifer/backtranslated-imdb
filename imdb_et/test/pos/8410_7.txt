<br /> <br /> It's common knowledge and has been said before: no one can ever play Scarlett and Rhett like Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable. Joanne Whalley Kilmer (no longer Kilmer divorced ex-hubby Val Kilmer) plays with his Scarlett and although it's a sequel and not re-done (God-forbid !!!) he can't still get up in case (ie his voice sounds several times evil, he has brown eyes [Scarlett's eyes were green in both novels and even Vivien Leigh's eyes were green] and his vocal power wasn't working, Scarlett is the southern Belle, so he has an incredible talent for flirting (as he did in SCARLETT's novel and GWTW) and to be a great flirt like Scarlett, you probably need a higher voice than Vivien Leigh. <br /> <br /> I think I will compare Kilmer Leigh a little too much, but if someone has such a masterly role as Leigh Scarlett did, then you just can't help but criticize the new future Scarletts, Timothy Dalton would not have had any emphasis, due to the fact that both Margaret Mitchell Rhett and Gable had nothing. It has never been truly remarkable (except, perhaps, his depiction of evil, the uniting King of France, Phillip LION IN WINTER), and he gives his Rhetto very little (if any) freshness or vitality. <br /> <br /> Specifically, the sampled professions are Tina Kellagher (born actress who has a lot of authenticity in her release) as a tragic victim of Mary Boyle. And then, of course, Sean Bean is cold, to calculate and not to mention, almost demonically evil offenders of Lord Fenton, Mary's nobility and Scarlett. One thing I could not forgive the writer was that Scarlett was raped in this film (a fact that never appeared in the novel; Lord Fenton is cold and not well known in the Irish literature, but he is not nearly as heartless as the second novel, but for the film Belle Watling's character, which Ann-Margret played in a terrible role, was the most terrible thing we could all have done without life, seeing how the book was such Predict a bestseller without Watling. <br /> <br /> SCARLETT very good, but not quite in this arrogant place where he is used with WINDS Another actor was very much needed for both Scarlett and Rhett. <br /> <br />
