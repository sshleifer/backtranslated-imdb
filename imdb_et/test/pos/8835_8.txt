The history of TV and movie adaptations is full of aberration, which almost proves that tradition should never begin. However, there are some examples that can easily pull it. Rising Damp seems to be the last sitcom, which is suitable for large screen treatment, because this fun series was based on the small range of the northern variety. Also, writer Eric Chappell was not given enough time to spend time creating a completely original scenario, so he picked up TV shows and sewed them together to form the film body. This in itself does not necessarily mean that the script fails. David Croft and Jimmy Perry did the same thing with their father's army scenario and it worked great. Although the early father's army episodes, along with their slow pace and bow racing, lent much more to the film's adaptation. However, the Rising Damp episodes were high energy highs from the first scene to the breathless peak. As a result, when one story is finished and the other one begins, the scenes in the movie will change. The second line of the TV series film version is inevitable comparisons. In this regard, the film is compared to the brilliant series of Rising Damp. Despite everything, Rising Damp, the film's success, can be fun and occasionally terrible. Perhaps it is not surprising that the best moments appear during the sequences specifically written for the film. It also includes a rugby game where Rossiter does well-timed workouts. Indeed, although all the cast hands fulfill their roles perfectly (hiding behind the late and truly superb Beckinsale's usual substitute actor), Leonard Rossiter is the most logical. Indeed, Rising Damp should have been made as a film so that Rossiter could have been eligible for the Oscar, which is great for his talents. He was not even criminally appointed. Ultimately, the film does not fit into the tent of the television series, but is able to have its own comedy with some beautifully played moments. Recommended viewing. <br /> <br /> One last thing: opening and closing music is the worst thing about film history.
