I saw it recently at the 2007 Palm Springs International Film Festival, where it was one of the audience's favorites. This is a French summer industrial attack of the 50's and 60's OSS 117 films. The first OSS 117 film based on Jean Bruce's novel was released in 1956, long before the first James Bond movie, watching Ivan Desny as Hubert Bonisseur De La Bath and six subsequent adventure wars were made until 1970 with Luc Merenda, Frederick Stafford, Kerwin Matthews and John Gaven all bought Oss 117th Jean Dujardin is the title of the comic in this series. Since the film begins in 1945, it has French mustache and is similar to Desny, but when the film begins, it set up Sean Connery in 1955. Jean Fran√ßois Halim wrote about this spy scenario that was sent to Egypt to investigate a friend's murder. She borrows the foolishness of Naked Gun, Get Smart and Pink Panther and uses fresh humor for current events that can be enjoyed by international audiences in a joyful combination, and I'm sure it's the only one to come out of revived OSS 117, being comedy adventures. Michel Hazanavicius leads. I'd give it 7.5 and recommend it.
