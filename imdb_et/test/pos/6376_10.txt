Teen Deviyaan is a great movie. A very windy entertainer and a very modern film in the 1960s. Music and songs are amazing, although the words of the Mayor are meaningless in places. Dev Anand is a huge star and, as usual, his role is fair. Kalpana is sexy and Nanda is fine. Simi is also almost OK. The film has a terrible dialogue by Vrajendra Gauri, who wrote most of Dev Anand's films, such as Mahal, Duniya, Warrant, Jaal's Note, Manz, etc. This is the story of Devis, who is interested in three women - mod Kalpana, Simi, and Nanda. Finally, he chooses Nanda. The story is about OK, but it has been talked about and the dialogue and songs and the big Dev Anand is highlighting the film. Must watch a movie about all Dev Anand fans.
