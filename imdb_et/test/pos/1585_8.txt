After the death of all senior officers, Craig-Scott, the Laundry and Moral corps, says the chairman is being led by an intergalactic spacecraft belonging to Starcups Corporation. Its main task is to look for habitable planets and, of course, long-term coffee markets. <br /> <br /> Craig-Scott and his second command, the main pair, find themselves poorly prepared unless they are able to keep the crew's underwear clean - which does not diminish the importance of clean baseball, especially when incompetent drivers cause the same panties well, dirty regularly. <br /> <br /> Episodes are reported as short 2-3 minute reports provided by the Army Commander. Humor is a confused hungry body and outrageous physical comedy. Think yes The Minister will meet with a red dwarf, but with a shoe string budget. All common sci-fi plot devices are here - aliens, nuclear weapons, computer malfunctions - but each one is enhanced with the fresh lemon scent of a high-quality laundry detergent. <br /> <br /> With a low budget, but somewhat chewing effects and props fit the absurd assumption of the show. Do you remember the fun hockey helmets they wore on old Battlestar Galactica? What is the name of the "Jofa" brand still visible? Okay, that's a lot of Commander's, but it's cute. <br /> <br /> The Commander log is not a high art, but it is not what it is trying to be. It's just a little fun. That's good to be.
