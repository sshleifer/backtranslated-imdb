If I haven't seen this story in 1936, I can't compare it. However, I can say that the musical treatment of Stephen Sondheim for this story is entirely genius. Only Sondheim could come up with music and lyrics that are unique, but perfectly suited to a very strange theme. If someone needs clarification in dark comedy, they should see it (and also Dr. Strangelove). When Mrs Lovett goes to London for the "worst pies" for a high-profile business, we're not talking about "Soylent Green" - but the ingredients are similar. Particularly brilliant is the song where Mr Lovett puts his idea on Mr Todd. Even in the introductory number, the line "... they went to their Maker to shave impeccably ...", which gives an excellent overview of the premise, drama and future comedy. Outstanding!
