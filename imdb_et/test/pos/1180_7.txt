Although this film is not the most entertaining in the world, I think it is better than most. I mean, it was a little laughing and just a good feeling. It's not too often to see two old geezers just having fun with their age and honestly having good time jokes. Walter and Jack had such great chemistry with their friends / brothers. Just looking at these women romanticly, it was fun and you drunk the whole way for them because we have to admit it or not, because of their age they still had a game! : D I just loved the whole plot to be able to move and have fun, no matter how old you are. I want to laugh this movie nice if you want it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
