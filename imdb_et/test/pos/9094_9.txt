Only worth the price of Rock-off entrance !! All D fans love this movie (although it's short) and John C Reilly, Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, Meatloaf, and Dave Grohl (almost recognizable) lights prove D is pretty much anyone. Even the Dio ... sasquatch / mushroom scene is quickly becoming a classic (I no longer want to say and blame the spoiler placement here). Fans of the original HBO series will see a couple of notes on D's early screen performances such as Lee and the host of the open microphone. I just want them to have played the first song of the album, and the shame is also the omission of the "government's miracle" POD album. Apart from this, the movie stones. Listen to D!
