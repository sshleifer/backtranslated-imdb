The primacy of the second feature of Ramin Bahran is that, like the work of the poet, he depicts the soul of mankind and lets him flourish on the screen. In addition to most of the indie films that live there, the CHOP SHOP is a wise expression of the great cinema of the ages; We can look back on Bresson and Pasolini's works and compare Bahran's work with theirs, and yet the CHOP SHOP is fresh and urgent for today's society. We see a master work here? The idea of ​​a certain beauty, style and content connects to a film that reminds us of what it means to live. Instead of focusing on the side of NYC, we often see that we live and breathe in our young hero, Alejandro, in poor Willits Point? our fascinating quasi-world of culture? and yet this is a very, real place. In trying to stay on the surface, Alejandro must support himself and his older sister. Watch this movie and feel the raw spiritual understanding that Bahrani is taking us? all with deep and short realism.
