This fraudulently inverted, low-key, random Aussie criminal thriller speaks randomly and with relaxed confidence that is a pleasure to see. An interesting beaver of working class child Jimmy (tempting feathless Heath Ledger) yearn to do something about his usual lifestyle. Jimmy gets his big break when a local criminal Pando (prominent Bryan Brown) assigns him a simple courier, which means that the old lady should be offered $ 10. Jimmy finds himself kneeling deeply as he loses Pando's money. Writer / director Gregor Jordan is an appealing simple story of how things are not always what they are cracked, young love, all the activities that have consequences, and that old water is about how crime doesn't pay, like charm wonderful richly observable small peculiar details, a strong subtext about the human duel potential for both good and evil, the feeling of irony of compulsion, the cooling of violence, and the reality. sophisticated pulled warts in low-life characters instantly recognizable and fully believable in everyday reality (eg, Panda has played with a Scrabble flunky and at one point interrupts the company's conversation with a portable hood on their son's phone). Judging by his subtly shaded and double imaginative insidious, not a little Pando, Bryan Brown will undoubtedly qualify as one of the best actors ever in love with celluloid. Strong and satisfactory little sleeping place.
