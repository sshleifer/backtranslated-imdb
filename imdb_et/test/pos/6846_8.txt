Loved this movie !! Great Carla Gugino Action. An interesting story about robbery, which goes awfully wrong (not all?). Some surprising twists in the film and in the plot were easy to follow without being so complex that it would be incomprehensible. It was a totally unexpected joy. More "Quentin-ish" than most movies try to be.
