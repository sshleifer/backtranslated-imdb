It's early for boys, but some people may not be happy with it, like everyone else. I found it somehow different from your average Stooge slapstick. It was fun for jokes rather than applying to the eye or blow. Follow the fun part when Larry grabs a stethoscope from Moet and sings it. Fashion gives her a good smell. That part made me good in ten minutes. Another hit on Stooges.
