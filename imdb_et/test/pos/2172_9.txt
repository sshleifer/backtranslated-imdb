Unfortunately, this is a forgotten classic. <br /> <br /> The look is great, design, costumes and the like are flawless, postage scenes and cavalry are both cool and exciting. <br /> <br /> The characters are vivid and truly human. The lucky one is right and Fabrice Luchini, like Derville, steals the film with his clever, pedantic similarity, rejoicing in the ups and downs of other failures. Depardieu is good for this role, but maybe too big. <br /> <br /> When the movie is really different, it is a story and its changes from Balzac's short story. These changes are editorial, as Balzac has many discussions about society and this film breathes characters. Yves Angelo, however, has retained the main ingredient, not only the lost person trying to regain his society, but every sign has to find its place in society: Comte Ferraud is trying to buy each other, his wife (Ardent) is from humble birth and when he was married to a colonel With Chabert, they achieved their position in the turbulence of the revolutionary France. Everyone has something to lose in terms of status, and it gives a good drama because their goals are contradictory. <br /> <br /> It also looks very modern: money is crucial to gaining power to gain status, but someone can go as fast as they get up. Derville enjoys this strategy, he has seen the worst person he tells Chabert when he takes the case. This original place of speech is at the end of November when Balzac takes the human comedy with great irony.
