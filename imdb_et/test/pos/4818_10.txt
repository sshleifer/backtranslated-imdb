The success of "rebels without reason" was the tide of "teenage" films. It is said to be one of the best. Very young McArthur stands out here if not too complicated. The story focuses more on perception of crime than on any traumatic event. Supporting cast is memorable, Frankenheimer drives like an old pro. Just a story about a young man who thinks others are taking their actions too seriously.
