Boogie Nights was undoubtedly the best film of 1997. I can watch this movie over and over again and still love it. I'm not in a hurry to see this epic Titanic again, the overwhelmed romance / disaster. The fact that Boogie Nights did not even get the best picture, but proves how the Academy is predictable and narrow-minded. Only Atom Egoyan's The Sweet Her after and Robert Zemeckis's contact was almost as big as Boogie Nights. No other filmmaker has even come close enough to make a film as Tarantino Pulp Fiction in recent years - so far. Paul Thomas Anderson rose to the challenge and succeeded. Just like Tarantino gave John Travolta a career, P.T. Anderson has given Burt Reynolds a career that his career needs. Boogie Nights undoubtedly also makes Don Cheadle, Heather Graham and John Reilly stars. In general, it's a great movie. Best from Pulp Fiction. Maybe even better.
