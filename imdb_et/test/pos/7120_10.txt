There are a few films that deal with things I would consider myself an expert, that is. <br /> <br /> After a few years of fantasy role playing, I am divided on the fact that I do not leave the stigma of what you see, that these things are really canonical, it happens to everyone. <br /> <br /> First, you create your character fairly and it will die after the first attack. <br /> <br /> Then you will help a little with the Constitution and, if you are, why not help strength, intelligence, intuition, charisma and dexterity? This in turn violates the captain of the game, who does not know how to deal with this invincible force. After a while, it will be boring for gamers as well, so they will start creating more exotic combinations of races, regardless of how ridiculous it is. <br /> <br /> I created a Druedain warrior monk, yes, not so far And that's not all about telling the destruction of this fucking game (which is hunting for experience points), but just watch the movie, it shows it all - and, of course, the stupidity of its most basic assumptions. <br /> <br /> There is no better profession than a bard to achieve this goal. I do not understand exactly why the bard first became a character, ultimately the blacksmith is none. But when it became one, it had to map the flow of the game, that is, it was supposed to be at least indirectly deadly. Having fun will never end rightly. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not just a professional production, but I have never seen a better satire.
