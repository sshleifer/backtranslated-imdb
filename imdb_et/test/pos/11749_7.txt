"Love is a Lot-Splendored Thing" is set in Hong Kong in 1949-50, and tells the story of the relationship between the American white journalist Mark Elliot and the half-Chinese semi-European doctor Han Suyin. This story of combined racial love was a bold theme for the fifties, and as he often did, Hollywood tried to soften the blow by casting a white actor as a supposedly non-Caucasian woman who falls in love with a white man, something that is considered politically wrong today, but was then quite acceptable .. (Consider, for example, Ava Gardner's "Show in the boat" or Natalie Wood's "West Side Story") Configuring the story in the British colony was probably also an opportunity to explore racial issues in a way that would cause less controversy in America. Suyin loses his job at a Hong Kong hospital because his British bosses are exceptions to the fact that he is acquainted with a white man he is unable to marry because his foreign wife does not give him a divorce. As it sometimes happened, European colonialism was the son of a bitch for some of America's own shortcomings. Imagine that the fur that would have fired would have been made with a similar film by a black or mixed race female doctor in a hospital in Alabama. <br /> <br /> In addition to racial issues, the film also raises issues of international politics, referring both to the confiscation of communist power in China and to the outbreak of the Korean War. Han Suyin was a real person and a well-known journalist; he actually supported Mao's communist regime, but here he is firmly shown to be communist. However, it is not primarily racism or politics, but rather romance, but a good example of what would have been during a "woman's picture". Such films were mostly male directors, but mostly directed to a female audience. They dealt with love and romance - often unhappy romance - from a woman's point of view and played a leading role in the female character. The genre often played a role in the novels of the heroine of the novels. Previous examples were usually monochromatic, but in the fifties they were generally used as a lush, gorgeous color. <br /> <br /> Although a Chinese or Eurasian actress would be more convincing in this role, is Jennifer Jones a great job than Suyin. I found that William Holden, like Mark, is quite ungodly, but that doesn't matter, because Suyin is a very dominant figure. He's more than a screen and Mark and his film look much more at his family and work than he does. Although Jennifer was still strikingly beautiful, she was in her mid-thirties, quite older than the most romantic heroes of that time. Holden was about the same age, unusually during the fifties, when "boy meets girl" often meant "older man meets girl". <br /> <br /> The film is not very deep, but it is well made for some attractive photography, especially in Hong Kong, which reflects the growing trend of the fifties in the studio rather than in the studio. Hong Kong can be so beautiful; The view of the city on the field of view has a special meaning, as it is the place where Suyin and Mark go for their romantic tasks. The overall mood is pleasant, destructive romance, atmospheric photography, and a musical result featuring one of the most memorable film themes. 7/10
