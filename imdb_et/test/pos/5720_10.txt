After John Leguizamo saw this routine, I finally understand why he is such a talent. I enjoy a great production and it's best to work on stage. I can't label it as a stand-up routine because Leguizamo is so intense when playing different stars. The only time he breaks is when he needs to play his part in doing so well that you can't help but appreciate his talent. I wasn't quite sure how I felt him as an actor, but Freak secured my recognition. For those who have not been able to see this exhibition, I know you. Be sure to check it out. This is one of the baskets I've ever seen. Eddie Murphy, Bill Cosby and Chris Rock. Four stars and more.
