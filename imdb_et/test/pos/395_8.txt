Victor Mature, as hardly a civilized and mostly controlling mountain man and a trap, can be a poster, but Robert Preston, a colonel of a failed union who led his men to "cut" his Confederate artillery in Shiloh, and is being sent to Oregon for his incompetence, is the most interesting part, married young and hard to recognize first at Anne Bancroft. Un civilized mature lusts of a civilian woman, which give the film an interesting and even dark sub-block that extends far enough to refer to the husband of another man at one time by James Whitmore, who plays Mature's older and wiser mountain-like father. Anthony Mann's film has disappeared with his most famous western peoples with James Stewart, but even so you do not really think of India as a threat to see this film, although Preston can prove his bad judgment as a chief executive again on an unsuccessful expedition to finally bring the Indians well , staged an attack between a forest that quickly becomes a route.
