The shine of this film is not hidden in the film-making process, which is the usual but dead story of three military men after the Second World War, but the fact that this story was spoken at all. Samuel Goldwyn deserves credit for chutzpah having to live a film for his leaders for a handicapped vet, a handyman, and an underdog.
