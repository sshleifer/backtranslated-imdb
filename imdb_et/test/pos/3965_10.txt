if I watched this movie when I looked at the bottom, I would probably have fallen into the deepest depression of my life and could have tried it almost in despair, the only thing in the real world, if you robbing millions of dollars of unsuspecting people won't all roses (unless you're an investment banker) or government company), so how is it important? I was refused from school after school and it persists, so it's a brilliant subject of the movie and if you give yourself an imaginary to let it be applied without any real consequences, it can really touch someone and let them know they're not not alone. The superfluous soliloquy breaks the well-established educational system as we know it. Indeed, all I can say is that I am now in college, looking back where I was, and watching this movie, I can really understand it in a way I could never have otherwise. it is a minor and unfortunate yes, but it is an emotional and exhilarating fantasy about freedom and I do not think of the right way to finish at night.
