Don't let the rating of 5.9 (at 12-8-02 at the time of writing) fool you, it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> I cannot understand how this kind of assessment is so important at all levels. Direction, Function, Cinematography - All Good. The story is interesting and original, and my only dancing to understand why the rating is this is that it is probably the type of movie people usually don't see. <br /> <br /> It's 80 years old to play modern rock. You can be young, grown up and love it, but it hasn't been and is not different from time and taste - it doesn't care about it. <br /> <br /> If you like movies and can deal with more real people-based movies than those with frantic activities, huge budgets and mediocre talents, try it next time you see it ... <br /> <br />
