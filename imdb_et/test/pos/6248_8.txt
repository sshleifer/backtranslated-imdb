Slausen's lost oasis. . . place for food, fun. . . and MURDER! After the boy's disappearance on the way to the gas station, the group drives his friends on a trip to look for him. They experience a wax museum where they think their friend would have come. Unfortunately, for friends, the roadside attraction owner has power to control their wax dummies and use them for evil. One by one, tourists are standing behind and killing the legion of Slausen and his wax-mannequins. Can friends escape or remain the same fate as their lost friend? In the footsteps of large classical wax films (wax house, wax museum mystery) (and turning them around), the tourist catches an endless genre to a completely new strange and exciting level with its strange story and style. As far as character formation, action, dialogue, flow, etc. are concerned, it seems to be the only basic slip. But it goes beyond the director controlling the plot and moving it to a supernatural thriller. They work from an acceptable (main) to a very good (backwoods showman from Mr. Slausen (played by Western legend Chuck Connors)). Writing works well and the dialogue is well structured, but there are some mistakes in the logic, as the film moves deeper into the story. Also, some scenes are a bit stupid, like a damping-dummy attack on Becky. However, this does not damage the film's effect. As one would expect from a film from a wax mannequin, it is full of endless serenity offered by dummies. It's strange that a (mostly) inanimate object can just sit down and be somehow disturbing. . . maybe it is a human similarity or an empty foam or the fact that you know it is an attack in the spring. . . Whatever it is, the dolls are extremely spooky, and this effect is used very well throughout the film. For Slasher, this is one of the best, and it is one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Mandatory Sliding Elements: <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: The movie is full of cool deaths. Gore is not excessive, but it is well done and leaves it realistic. <br /> <br /> - Gender / Nudity: An extended skinny-shiny scene with very attractive female women (though very attractive) "hardly begins to describe the delightful future-angel Tanya Roberts", but it is all a nuisance because girls are mostly underwater. But they're a little clad over the entire film. <br /> <br /> Cool Killer (s): Creepy is just the beginning of Slausen and his dummies. One of the best killers in the slasher subgroup. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Stops: The movie opens up the openness of the dummies, the intimidation of attacks, and the strong relationship between the scenes. . . It's all very well done to make a really scary movie. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: Well, the mystery wasn't really the idea of ​​the movie. . . all of its meaning is what is important. <br /> <br /> - Awesome dance scene: all those cute girls and not one dance. Shame. <br /> <br /> Final decision: 8/10. Look at this horrible slasher! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
