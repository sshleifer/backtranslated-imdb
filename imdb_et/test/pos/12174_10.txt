These two main characters, Erkan and Stefan, are munich comedy. I was wondering if this is one of the typical shock campaigns where the story is not important or just doesn't exist. But when I saw this movie, I was very happy that there was a cool story and the main characters actually fit it. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very fun and not ordinary German movie.
