I was never all impressed by the gallery at night, but this one episode stands out. <br /> <br /> The commentary on the television network is a strange act - a young, nerdy boy who continues to predict. The training leaves the whole thing a terrible waste of time until both bets come true next morning. <br /> <br /> The first seemed to be a cabin hit when the child's predictions turn out to be consistent. <Br /> <br /> One day he refuses to show. Faced with imminent showtime, everyone's wit will end, even if he threatens him with court proceedings if he does not fulfill his contract and makes his daily predictions. <br /> <br /> A young boy will rejoice and predict the utopian tomorrow. br /> <br /> After the show, intruders ask for an explanation to find out why the full truth is too daunting.
