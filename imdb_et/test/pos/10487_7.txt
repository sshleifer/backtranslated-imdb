PRICE OF POWER is an ambitious Western melodrama that shows the old western version of JFK's murder. In 1881, President Dallas travels and strikes the window while carrying his city in paradise. Corrupt officials have committed murder and have a modest slave. Our hero, serious, but boring Giuliano Gemma is trying to break the conspiracy. An engaging story that is cruel to his subject but interesting despite the lack of shooting possibilities. The film is from 10 out of 10, despite the poor performance of the DVD, which is too dark and bad. Look for a good copy.
