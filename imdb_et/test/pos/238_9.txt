Long ago and far they knew how to make musical and "Cover Girl" is no exception to the rule. <br /> <br /> A story about a dancer in a nightclub, who will be a covered girl and famous. Here the old wording applies - that happiness and fame are not always mixed. <br /> <br /> Dance routines are superb choreographic. With dancing and chemistry between Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly. <br /> <br /> Otto Kruger is an older gentleman who discovers Hayworth when he sees his image showing a strong resemblance to a woman who left her away â€” Hayworth's grandmother Maribel. <br /> <br /> Kelly's jealous reaction to Rusty (Hayworth) in the hands of Broadway's Lee Bowman. <br /> <br /> The picture is mainly at the end of history. <br /> <br /> To add this subtle film, Eva Arden has always been a movie and Phil Silvers has fun.
