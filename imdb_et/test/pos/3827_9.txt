To get started, it's ST ST's favorite. <br /> <br /> In addition to StuOz's critical comments, I still had a few things to say: technical as a corporate fire creates a blind target, they need to be able to get close to the direct hits (I believe) to make Romulan ship much less damaging to the vacuum . <br /> <br /> I had a somewhat romantic problem with Romulan, who questioned his belief in Romulan's "protocol" or their leadership, except when it comes to attacking vulnerable targets (sites in the neutral zone) that are not in war. I also do not believe that the commander would fall for the basic or simple tactics Kirk played, such as "dead", or because of the fall he puts on him to attack the company when it is playing dead. <br /> <br /> About the company: I'm surprised to find Sulu saying, "Will they give up?" when he attacks the company for the first time. <br /> <br /> Funny how Spock can control weapons only when the emergency is over. <br /> <br /> Also in the last attack I thought that the Romulan ship was too long (so long as Spock could pass a couple of times and back into the arena and activate and shoot the photon reader. I would have used phasers at this point, but I'm sure that it was related to technicians and the budget). <br /> <br /> On the positive side: this is a good drama played on the Romulan ship to introduce us to the junkies. Large styles with Stiles, which tell a lot about the human knowledge of the wreckage. His conflict with Spock is also there. I wanted Stiles's character to stay in the exhibitions for a while if nothing more than what he added. <br /> <br /> It's just fun to draw attention to negatives and goofs, (I'm sure I am still). But for me it's as good as it gets! "Terrorist Balance" is always what I put into my ST rankings.
