I see the ratings of this movie are not so high for this movie, so I have to like that movie so much. Well, I'm right and everyone else is wrong (just joking). I think I like it because I'm a psychology teacher and I really liked Ryan's playable character. Although he is really dangerous and very dangerous, you cannot hate him because he is clearly mentally ill and apparently suffers from some kind of brain trauma. And wow did this great job, depicting this man! In fact, you feel to East Lupine when he destroys his life. So with such intense action and threat, why is the film relatively low? Probably because it's not exactly plausible, but the boy is entertaining and creative. Try and don't believe 6.4 points - it's much better!
