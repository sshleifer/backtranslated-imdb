... scratching. Like the African rhythms with the ass jaw and Virgin Islanders' welded oil drums for the ears that liked the steel bands, the city also made itching for new methods of creative expression. "Scratch" is a totally unequaled documentary that takes you to the center of hip-hop / rap movement and explores the development of turntables, the art of vinyl art and the ultimate DJ / MC contempo entertainment expression. The film shows some of the surprisingly intelligent and formulating "Scratchers", which have amazingly unique abilities at the concert and competition where the competition matches the street. Good stuff for anyone interested in moving from grass or ghetto to the hobby. (B)
