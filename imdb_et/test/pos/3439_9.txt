"Jaded" adopts a complex abuse issue: criminals and victims. Less hands would degenerate into an erotic thriller made for direct video. However, this director has managed to clearly differentiate the textured multilayer survey. <br /> <br /> Considering that the director / writer is a woman and a major detective and D.A. there are also women, it could have become a very male film. This is not. Sexual predator is gender neutral. The nudity of this film is not erotic. Rape is not sexual. We look at the victims and not at the titration. <br /> <br /> Talented cast rings are real. For so little known film, I was surprised at the quality of the performances. They're good. Carla Gugino and Rya Kihlstedt are incredible. <br /> <br /> This movie disappeared somehow. Maybe it's too good for your own. It's "should see". Highly recommended. An imaginary human sexual thriller.
