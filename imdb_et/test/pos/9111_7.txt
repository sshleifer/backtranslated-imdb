When I first heard that Jack Black and Kyle Gass made a movie from my band, I was amazed! I love my music and I was hoping this movie would be really funny! Now that I watched it, I can't really say these hopes were not satisfied, but I think I hope more. The film is full of great music by Tenacious D and I loved listening to it all. There are many great jokes and I just love this story, at least for the first time. I don't like how the movie ends. The end is very steep and I think they could have extended it a little. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it's a good movie! Anyone who loves rock music should watch it! It will make you laugh!
