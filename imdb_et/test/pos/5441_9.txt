Robin Williams is a genius. One of the best comedies in the world. She really shows it, it splits fun to the left and right, like the talking comedian Tom Dobbs. Previously, it seemed like a laugh fest side by side. And it was funny. But there were many serious parts in the movie that I didn't expect. I'd describe it as a drama / comedy. But it's still worth seeing, and I found it to be almost everything I expected. Robin Williams is with his famous Christopher Walken. They play a very good team in this movie and I was really shocked to see how well they both worked together. I recommend it to anyone looking for a white film.
