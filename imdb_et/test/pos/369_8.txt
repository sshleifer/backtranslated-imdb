I was fortunate that this movie came to TCM so I had the chance to see it. It is quite difficult to find, although it is Hitchcock's classic. Unfortunately, it also has some shortcomings, some of which have been repeated by Hitchcock. First, the end is a bit too clean and "perfect". The last scenes have a surprising voltage up to the last five minutes; then in just five minutes, everything will be deleted very well ... very dissatisfied. The end is also too dramatic for the Hitchcock movie. He is, was, and always remains a master of arrest ... why should he end something as low as a cheap sequence of action? Apart from a few shortcomings, the film is very good. The plot is great; one of the best and most universal. Topic? Easy. You meet a stranger. Perfect stranger. He offers to kill someone for you ... you know you have someone you want (if not anything else, unconsciously) dead. Prey? He asks you to do the same to him ... do you agree with this strange but brilliant arrangement? You are no doubt, and so he is ... no one knew the victim. And you don't know each other ... are you just "strangers on the train". Brilliant concept and one that almost every person can relate to. Stimulation is good, you never lose interest or patience. Cinematography is good, but not nearly as good as in other better Hitchcock films. Operation is flawless. The characters are well written, reliable and realistic. Hitchcock uses some of the same elements he often uses; dominant mother, mum boy etc The film is very good, but it just seems a little weakened. It didn't go to that famous extra mile that would have made it big. It stopped before crossing the border between what is normal and what is bold. This is the main reason why the film can't be big but mostly good because it may be bigger. The end leaves you unhappy and disappointed. But everything that leads to the end is very good, so there will be 8/10 of the movie. Good, but not great. Every Hitchcock fan should see it because it's one of his best ... somewhat further from the list, but still there. I recommend it to every Hitchcock fan. 8/10
