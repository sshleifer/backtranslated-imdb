"Challenge Free" was one of the first films I saw as a child. It was also one of the first VHS birds I belonged to. I didn't see the movie for years, so yesterday I decided to stick it in and watch it. Wow. This story is now as powerful as I saw it for the first time. I think now that I am older, I can better evaluate the implantable values ​​in the film. (Self-confidence, value of freedom and love of nature) This is a "B" movie to be sure, but that's what you remember for years, especially when you see it as a child.
