Be sure to rent! Good clean family life. My 4 and 5 year olds (and I) loved it. Keep them on the edge of your seats. I recommend that the parents sit with their younger children to look at it, as it may be quite tense for them. It is not too often possible to find movies that you can watch with your children, and so it is rare. Some actors / realities do not exist at times, or maybe it is a bit daunting, but the children do not seem to notice or care, they love it. Some are predictable, but the other parts are not - like trying to figure out who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. The film does not really have any terrible things, so I doubt that it gives children a nightmare. It encourages children to dream that is something we need to encourage and promote in our children. Rent and Blessed!
