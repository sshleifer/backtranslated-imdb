Dr. Stephens (Michael Harvey), head of a seriously inadequate institute, takes a "progressive" approach to treating his patients, even if his lions allow complete freedom of the building during day and night; however, he pays for his cautious thinking when he foresees to cut the tree with his ax quite foolishly for the treatment of one of his patients, and consequently his neck can be confused (he serves as the right hand, not to recommend basketball knitting). <br /> <br /> Soon after this tragic incident, sister Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives at the hospital to become a doctor's assistant, and discovers that the facility is currently run by many sterner Dr. Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick). Despite not knowing his deceased predecessor's decision to work for Beale and not particularly eager to hire new employees, Dr. Masters agrees to let the real wicked start work, but after many harassing experiences at the hospital, Charlotte begins to wonder if it could have been better if he was turned away. <br /> <br /> This does not understand the genius what is actually happening in the hospital, because "ransom has taken refuge" because it is a prerequisite it should be familiar to most experienced horror buffs, but don't look at the fun fun fun in the basement of SF Brownriggi thanks to its well-defined set: lobbying, popsicle-sucking Sam (Bill McGhee); Judge Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Ross), who mumbles the court sentences constantly; old Mrs. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams), who says William Allingham's creepy poem The Fairies and warns Charlotte of the impending doom; Danny (Jessie Kirby), who delights in bullying other patients; Harriet (Camilla Carr), who thinks her doll is a real child; Army nut Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin); and best of all, the King of Allyson (Betty Chandler), whose rejection by many men has left him with love for love (ie he is trying to jump from any man who goes near him). <br /> <br /> This convincingly crazy number of stars, plus a bit of gore and nudity, a reasonable direction from Brownrigg (who also gave us an impressive white trash of horror) and a definite turn of the Playboy cat girl, Holotik, all go for a fairly predictable, low-budget part , which is a very observable psychological shock.
