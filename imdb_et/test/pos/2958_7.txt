This second full-length Lone Ranger feature does not measure up to the 1956 classic, but is a good film that is rough enough and tumble-dry and moves with a good clip. Ranger looks at a series of mysterious murders with a dirty pattern for those whose peaceful Indians are the victims of the gangs of capsules. Lone Ranger's adventures are associated with more killings and violence, and the film has an underrepresentation of racial ignorance, whose comments are scattered throughout the scenario. Ranger uses disguises as only he can put clues and expose outlaws and bring them to justice. Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels represent a colorful presentation that shows the great advantage of the old Tucson desert and the cactus country. The music score is good, but the familiar William Tell Overture theme has been left out of the vowel of interest that lacks the prosperity and beauty of Ranger's traditional theme.
