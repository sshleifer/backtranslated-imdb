I should strongly agree with the previous flat comment. I watched it not expect too much of it. The fact is that the cast was excellent, especially The Lead Teen Female. All their dark sides came out, all confused. There was a base that ran through a teenage and sexuality movie. The role of serial shooters was also played well when you felt that he had passed through what these children had. This movie is a strong drama / thriller. Yes, I agree that they do not make it obvious, but you could relate to the confused teenage heads they did, and that is plausible. Also a decent dark end, which could have just been so happy. The detailed attention of the film was also fantastic. I'm very good at 7 out of ten. From time to time, it is a bit slow, but lets an imaginary person see where the characters come from.
