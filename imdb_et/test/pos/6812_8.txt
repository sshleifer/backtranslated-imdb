It was so much better when I waited for the film's sprouting professionalism compared to other B-moive for such a budget. The script was good as a little formula, but the action was surprisingly good for everyone, including Lorenzo, and you always expect good standards from Scheider and Buseys. As well as good plot and action is good, especially car rides and accidents are class A. All in all, this is a rise in front of other B-movie thrillers and does not have to rely on constant nudity or a stream of cheeses to make up for budget and script inaccuracies.
