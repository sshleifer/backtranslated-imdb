If you love the Japanese monster films, you love this action-packed battle that captures the alien invader, plans to win over the ground and "Giant Robot" with super weapons. An alien, "Emporer Guillotine", on the Gargoyle planet, is an army called (of course) a "gargoyle gang", as well as an endless array of hostile creatures that are usually crushed to the ground to crush buildings, make a loud noise, panic population, etc. A toddler, named Johnny Sokko, is his giant robot during his speech and, if necessary, sends the robot a beating and then blasting their creatures. Johnny joins the group "Good Spies", called Unicorn, and tries to help save the world. <br /> <br /> Despite the comb-like nature, involuntary humorous dialogue, and the fact that the target audience was probably kids, this film has non-stop action, colorful characters, decent special effects, and just happens to look straight. Battle scenes are well executed and often, as the storyline requires. The good guys and the bad guys ensured that they had an inexhaustible supply of bombs, lasers, ammunition, and schemes to attack each other. Despite the fact that the film is based on edited episodes of TV series, the plot actually develops and reaches its final conclusion. <br /> <br /> The film has a positive outlook and turns to all (especially children). a desire to destroy evil in its many forms. Children can be a target group, but it is fun for anyone who laughs at it with comic stupidity; at the same time, the roots of good boys prevail and "save the world". Action is sometimes positive, but it is a charm: there are several lines of dirty dialogue (perhaps filmmakers can translate into mistakes or perhaps deliberate jokes), and you will find yourself consistently later. <br /> Indeed, this film is not high in production quality or budget. But what it is, campy sci-fi, is enjoyable for nice laughs. I recommend it to someone with a sense of humor.
