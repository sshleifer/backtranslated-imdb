Crispin Glovers' way of acting (and not just her) is huge. You really want to believe him because his body language and performance is perfect for a perfect person. He gives Layne the extraordinary personality that makes this film a cult. In addition to Feck, Dennis Hopper plays a very important role. It is the right or wrong choice of a scene without logical thinking. Friendship is more imported and that is exactly what I think it makes the choices difficult. Rivers Edge lets you experience it with serious hues and hosts. I really enjoyed watching it. I saw it for the first time a month ago, but if you like the nice 80s, that's what you see. I'm the same thing I didn't know before.
