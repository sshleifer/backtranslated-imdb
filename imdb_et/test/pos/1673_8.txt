This movie is a clean class creation from start to finish, for a moment forget the famous 28-minute dialogue that you don't like, forget it is in Paris and forget about Noir. The film itself, the premise and the execution make it a pure gold experience. It's sharp intelligent and thoughtful, just like herself. It represents real signs that are not only believing, but also with whom you are. This is a film that does not rob the concept of robbery, but shows it for what it is ... theft. This shows that they are hard work and ultimately not worth it. Now, all the things that are being held up are a bold 28-minute sequence with no word and what was considered proud in Paris, where we pay great attention to detail and fantastic cinematography and this last scene ... when you look at and see these trees. great use of raw and basic filming techniques ... this is, in my opinion, a master, and I am pleased to see it.
