In this role, like an inadvertent and boring husband, he is a decorated air force officer who is bored with his predictable suburban life and decides to make a radical change. One evening he meets Karen Sillas, an attractive woman younger than her current wife. Relationships are evolving and Cole decides to take it to the next level. <br /> <br /> He not only fails to do things, but also fakes his death in order to escape his family responsibilities. Lies is becoming more and more a pattern when she starts to rob banks to keep her new woman (Silla) happy and to shape the image she is successful. Apparently this is a fictional error. <br /> <br /> It was also based on a real story that makes it even more interesting. Cole is credible and excellent in these roles. Recommended. 8/10
