The trailer of this film focused so much on the chain (of course, because it is so sensational) that it stayed in most of the film, which is about to evolve, though rather simply drawn between Lazarus and Rae, as they try to recover their past pains with each other. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is no surprise that nymphomania is in chains, that is, there is a lot of involved sex. But at its core, Black Snake Moan is the main product of redemption and healing that helps another person contribute. Maybe it is for me, but I think poor Lazarus should have focused more on his story. He is a hurt person after his wife leaves, but we never see how Rae solves his previous pains. It just means that he - basically plays a wizard that helps the young Rae overcome the curse, through the big ol-chain and some blues. <br /> <br /> I like this story, but I wish it was a little more homogeneous and didn't have to be based on sensational. The side marks were quite decent as simple and I liked the music. Operation was good enough, though I can't be sure if Rae's character is completely plausible. But it may be just my naivety. <br /> <br /> All the film liked me, but it is not forced. Perhaps this is that I'm too critical, but the story seems a little too comfortable to be completely believable and so, although it all seemed really cool, I could never really buy it. The chain thing was a bit too far for me. Nonetheless, it can provide some entertainment for those who are looking for dramatic redemptions with blues. 7/10
