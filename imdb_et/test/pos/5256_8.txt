Women are a lovely movie of women of all ages (but mostly 30+) and their lives. Not only men and infidelity, but also relationships with friends and family, time for communicating with other people, image problems, threatening values, life achievements, and finding what really makes you happy. <br /> <br /> This is also right for you. Many times people advise you, but do not actually follow it. Sometimes they have created fraud for you and should you really follow the same path or react to your feelings now? I liked this movie. In this case, he sometimes tried to be like Sex & City, but it helped me like that. The difference here is that similar to such discoveries after the life stage that the Sex and the City were the stars - here, most of them are married or have passed since they were trying to find a man. Now they are trying to find happiness in their marriages and lives. <br /> <br /> It's obviously not an Oscar competitor, but it's fun and serves its purpose. <br /> <br /> And for men there was an equal share of men and women in the cinema (most were with their women / girlfriends) and the men were actually laughing. :)
