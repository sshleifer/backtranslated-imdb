Peter O'Toole is a Latin teacher, Arthur Chipping, who follows precisely the detail and thoroughness, helping young people in the meaning and definition of Latin words and phrases. He is considered cold and unfair and has not been in touch with time. But when you meet the stage actress Katherine Briskit (Petula Clark) not only late in the afternoon after London's London performance, but the Greek amphitheater, her world of closed thinking begins to open up. <br /> <br /> Gentleman Chips is MGM's musical remake of 1939's MGM. During this time, the musicals were out and the Hollywood studio system was hit. When this premiere in New York, Los Angeles and London, the musical numbers remained intact, but when they came to the local street theaters around the world, they made sans songs that made the film shorter and bigger. <br /> <br /> Thanks to MGM / UA home video, Ted Turner at the end of the 1980s, when VHS and Laser Disc were the main home video formats, started to restore musical numbers and closed the gaps. However, Laserdisc was the only form chosen by Goodbye Mr. To view Chips in Widescreen Letterbox format. <br /> <br /> After a while, the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was only available in the original Vinyl and Cassette Tape. still found on eBay today. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the great people at Film Score Monthly.com in 2006, the soundtrack is digitally remastered and trimmed with 3 CD sets that have a completely reconstructed score, original 1969 album album and source of narrated sequences of music and music. many interviews. You'll also get 1 unused song that is a real lost pearl, "Tomorrow with Me" by Petula Clark, which would have been chosen instead of "You and Me" before hand. <br /> <br /> This movie is both a classic musical and a real respect for teachers everywhere. I would definitely buy this movie when Warner Bros.MGM and Sony put their money in the mouth there and could retrieve this movie from any source of the film and put it on both DVD and Blu Ray with all the bells and whistles that have been taken back with all the extras you find and things are released.
