I saw very little of this movie for the first time. I was born in 1985, so the cartoons of the 80s were big. My mother recorded it one day to think I might like it. I've never heard of the Rainbow Bright TV show before I was introduced to the movie. When I saw it (one of those old BETA tapes), I loved it. I became addicted to it. There are people who say it's badly written and all that, but it's a child's film and such things don't matter to their children. I loved this story and especially liked songs and all female characters. Of course I was pretending to be them, and in the scene where Rainbow first met Krys and they were rejected, they had to work with the opposite sex, I can totally relate. The story was the main good and evil children enjoy, and there were enough happy moments to balance the scary. The world is a fantastic place that stimulates the imagination of every little child. I am very glad that I had a small chance of seeing this movie. This has had a great impact and looking at it now brings pleasant memories of childhood. I recommend that each parent hire this movie. It triggers their imagination and offers a lot of entertainment. You are just one child, so don't let them leave it!
