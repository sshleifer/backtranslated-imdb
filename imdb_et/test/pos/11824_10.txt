For unknown reasons, this beautiful masterpiece did not get the well-deserved recognition and many American film critics have appreciated them very little. So it's easy to understand that I've come across a lot of trouble finding this movie. Finally, I looked at it and it was so beautiful, sincere and embarrassing that for the first time in my life I watched a movie five times in one week after receiving the tape. The story is focused on twelve and twelve years old friendship between two young boys, Erik and Dexter, who are very different from each other, but are becoming the best (and only) friends. The beauty and sincerity of their friendship in Cure has been shown as sincerely and naturally as it has never been before. There are so many beautiful, heartfelt and embarrassing scenes (especially on the river) that hit the heart and can't leave those people indifferent. The film is full of incredibly powerful and emotional symbols (especially the strong Erik shoes), which also enhances the beautiful work visually. The story written by Robert Kuhn is well written and, in contrast to most modern Hollywood products in almost every scene, every film phrase and sentence is meaningful and brings something important about the characters and their relationships. Peter Horton, who was not known to have much experience in film management, has shown great talents and talents in this field. Cinematic art is also great for the locations of a well-chosen movie, but the most important thing is perfect action, which for all the above-mentioned reasons makes Cure one of the best films. Both Brad Renfro and Erik and Joseph Mazello as Dexter created an excellent sincere friendship and excellent chemistry atmosphere between the two main characters. Only one of these films (I haven't seen most of my works) is enough to call them one of the best actresses of their generation. Annabelle Sciorra also gives Dexter's mother an excellent result. It is terribly regrettable that such talented actors did not receive widespread recognition, while numerous overpriced stars receive huge advertising and high pay. Finally, it would be unfair not to mention the amazing music written by David Grusin and the terrible song of Mark Cohn (one of the best songs I've ever heard in films) My Great Escape. So what can I say about Cure is one simple word? great. At some point, this film is a beautiful, cordial and inspirational work of all the people involved in making this masterpiece. I have to credit all those people who put their hearts and souls in the film and the universal pictures that have found a way to make such a beautiful film among numerous commercial projects. But such a film has so rarely come to the cinema that very often the studios do not understand what they have done, that they cannot offer a marketing campaign. The only shortcoming for me is the short length of Cure (only 97 minutes). <br /> <br /> I don't want to write more about the movie because it's just impossible to put the beauty and sincerity into words, so if you have the opportunity to watch Cure, rent it or buy it and you wouldn't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Of the 10 in 10. Sorry for my bad English.
