Although not mentioned very often, "Don't look in the basement" is a very interesting movie and it is definitely worth it. The story follows a young sister, Charlotte Beale, who has been hired by Stephen's Sanitation to replace Dr. Stephens after the patient's murder. Many patients start torturing Miss Beale and her boss, Dr. Geraldine Masters, works as if she were hiding something ... <br /> <br /> , which does not happen in horror movies very often. The musical results are great and reminiscent of "Dark Shadows", Rosie Holotik, Rhea McAdams and Bill McGhee's staging is all great, the story is very interesting and very difficult. This movie has a horrible atmosphere around it that no other film I've ever seen has been able to capture. Many horror fans have never seen or even heard this movie because it could have been a horror classic. "Don't look in the basement" is definitely worth a look at all fans of the 1970s fans.
