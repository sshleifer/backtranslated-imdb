(Synopsis) Bartleby "B" Gaines (Justin Long), a senior high school graduate, finds himself without a college. He has been able to speak and quit any problem he is facing, but he has failed to lead his way to the eight college college admissions committees. His mother and father are very disappointed that Bartleby has not been admitted to college. His parents think that if Bartleby doesn't go to college, he has no future. Several of Bartleby's friends are in the same position that all of the colleagues they have requested have been rejected. To satisfy his parents, Bartleby puts forward the idea of ​​starting his own college website. They transform the abandoned psychiatric hospital into the South Harmon Institute of Technology. They're the only students. But the website confirms that we accept someone. On the first day of the school, they suddenly have a large number of recognized students, who were also rejected by all the colleges. With $ 1 billion in tuition, Bartleby has to make his fake college work. He hires Uncle Ben (Lewis Black) as Dean of the College. The fun begins when they design their curriculum, make their own rules and the whole night. <br /> <br /> (My comment) Starting a college without a teacher is away from a small wall. Because it was a fake college, Bartleby didn't really need a worker. The film reminded me of the classic film "Creative House", college settings, brotherhood, many gags and pretty young women. These new college refreshers had a different understanding of what the college experience was. Not only does humor have a lot of humor but also a good life. People should come to their dream and create a passion for what they want to do in their lives and do not live what other people want to do. The end was a little unreal, but it's just a movie. The film was made a little fun for the young crowd. (Universal pictures, duration 1:32, rated PG-13) (7/10)
