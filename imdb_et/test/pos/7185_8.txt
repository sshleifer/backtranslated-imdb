This movie is just great ... It starts with a really slow and boring, but as the movie progresses ..... fun also keeps going. The power of the film is probably a fine reference to many other films. For me, the best part was Bruce Lee / Crouching Tiger, the Hidden Dragon scene. How two participants from French to Chinese refused, or from any Asian language, was fantastic. Then jokes with the names, they're fun, but maybe you don't understand them all as your American (crime). Generally a great movie
