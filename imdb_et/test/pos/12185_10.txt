okay ... first Anne Rice BOOK fans .... <br /> <br /> sure Lestat's eyes are not blue ... is he not blonde in this movie, but even though Marius is not a mite ... although they changed the whole story ..... <br /> <br /> how to say it's not a good movie .. <br /> <br /> this movie ... is the best vampire movie I've ever seen ... and the mite is perfectly captured in it .... maybe not his qualities ... but I don't think he can find a better shot ... how he's talking ... and how he looks just mortal ... his arrogance ... and the love of fame alone is portrayed flawlessly. <br /> <br /> Once u think this is just a movie ... and don't try to associate every scene with a book ... u love the movie as much as I do. <br /> <br /> Now ... not for readers .. <br /> <br /> Be ready to fall down This movie is totally in love ... She has everything ... and goth music ... is like extra therapy ... dialogues ... are beautiful ... and are trying ... and even though his vampire movie ... you find yourself smiling ... with characters ... and u find yourself with compassion for vampires .. <br /> < br /> generally ... one of my favorite films ... !! 10/10
