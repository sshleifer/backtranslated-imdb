Since the frame number 1 you know that boy and tie are a good boy? He has no luck ("Sorte Nula"), or he believes in the dubious conversation of this music car and his best friend and companion who leads him through parts that are through the desert. Alberto just wanted to stay alone to fly abroad the next day? Well, someone we think. <br /> <br /> The film goes far? is it short? where the man listens to the same music in the cab at the airport. Sometimes many happy people have found different ways, some are dying, some are born, others fall into harassment. This time he is actually doomed? Or is it? The film is a kind of directed by Fernando Fragata, who left the sound recording and special effects only to other competent people. Those who usually refuse Portuguese movie sound problems and unclear voice recording must look for other topics to criticize this time. The car collision (this is not a spoiler, it's too smart a movie) makes a great scene and probably it was made with cheap equipment. (US studios take note: you can release a dollar or two, hiding competent Portuguese directors!) <br /> <br /> The rest was made by Fragata, from scenario to dialog, from camera to editing. If part of the dialogue was ad-libbed, then he must congratulate him again on acting and most inexperienced actors. A large number of non-spoken parts are credited, but most of these people were used to make a music video clip and a movie that was widely used in a movie advertising trailer. Dozens of actors and actors are cast, ten of whom are involved and a lot of relationships? that appear step by step, in an exciting, varied way, reminding the best authors of the genre. "Alfred Hitchcock" (qv) and "Claude Chabrol" (qv) recall the cat and mouse between the driver and his public and the nature of his characters. <br /> <br /> I recommend this thriller and comedy to Portuguese speakers and, if the film gets a proper translation of their conversational dialogue, to all those who enjoy them in the genre.
