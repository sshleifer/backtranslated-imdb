Having seen it without knowing all the waves around the wires without even knowing that it is based on real events, I have to say that I am impressed. "Murder in Greenwich" is a higher than average production for a TV movie - the actor is evenly large, especially Christopher Melon, who highlights exceptional performance and teenage actors stand out in difficult roles. The idea of ​​a dead girl who has announced a film is a genius that simply makes the film look good. The script is exemplary of what is essentially a week-fodder crop and cinema is beautiful.
