I got free tickets through Times to see this little Irish movie "Inside I'm Dancing" ... I didn't know anything about it, so I had no predecessors before I went. <br /> <br /> The film is about two men who are confined to wheelchairs and live at home. Michael (Steven Robertson) is suffering from Cerabal Palsy and Rory (James McAvoy) suffers from muscular dystrophy (please excuse the misspellings!). They form a bond because Rory seems to be the only person who understands what Michael says. They leave home to live in Carrigmore's apartment. They immediately use the help of an attractive girl (Romola Garai). Both friends finally love the same woman. It's a story short, but there are a lot of laughs and tears along the way ... actually ... being ready because I was .. I found tears flowing too often! Actually! I don't think I've looked so much at watching a movie from Elephant Man !!! This movie is an enormous anxiety for emotions ... both in fun things and in sad things. Acting is absolutely on the ground! James McAvoy is my big tip ... he's a great Irish actor and I think he's got a big future. Steven Robertson, who plays Michael, was also great ... and only today I found out he was not suffering from Cerabal Palsy and that was just a great act! Brenda Fricker is also in this movie and plays well at home manager. The other big part must be Romola Garai, she was great as an interest in love, and I think we'll see her more on the big screen in the near future. <br /> <br /> The thing that makes this movie work is not only synergy between two leaders, but a script ... that is just so #### funny it literally is a fire! I still can't help repeating some of the lines with my head even now. <br /> <br /> Photography is good, though very dark, but then it is trying some type of Ireland. The music is also excellent in this movie, as well as the choice of songs ... The use of the Johnny Coated Nine Inch Nails Track "Hurt" is inspired! <br /> <br /> If I had to write one word for this movie ... it would be "emotional." This movie is very funny ... and then the coin is very sad! I still can't believe that two days after seeing the movie, I look at it so laugh and almost cry! This movie is amazing ... and I hope it goes a long way! Although I can't see it because its advertising budget is probably very small! So look at it! I ask you ... you won't regret it ...
