I think Samuel Goldwyn tried to do two things in this film. First, the film is a tribute to Jascha Heifetz, which is considered the best violin virtuoso of the last century. Secondly, when he had brought the children of Dead End to the same title and seen them celebrating with Warner Brothers, he tried to create another attractive urine. Although the film was good, there was definitely no requirement for the children of this film to work out again for another feature. <br /> <br /> The gang leader is Gene Reynolds, who played the violin at the same time, but now he takes the dignity of the gang. His stepfather, Arthur Hohl, interrupts the violin that his late father gave to young Reynolds and threatens to send him a reform school over his mother's Marjorie Main's weak protests. <br /> <br /> Young Reynolds gets to the music school headed by the old music maestro himself, Walter Brennan and his daughter Andrea Leeds. They take it in, but they have financial problems with many of the creditors controlled by Porter Hall. <br /> <br /> This movie is mostly seen nowadays as it is a chance for classical music students to see and hear Jaschat Heifetz, who you collect, is the solution in one way or another for everyone's problems. Joel McCrea is also in this movie but has a rather colorless part as Andrea Leeds boy. <br /> <br /> Next to Heifetz, there is one thing the film does is to touch, albeit gently, child abuse and frustrated spouses. Arthur Hohl is an average man and Marjorie Main is a very clearly exhausted woman. <br /> <br /> Kids are good for the baby, Reynolds, Tommy Kelly, Terry Kilburn and the young girl Jacqueline Nash. who grew up and performed as Nelson Eddy's night club partner at Gale Sherwood. She also had a nice soprano as a child. <br /> <br /> But this is Heifetz, whom you see in the exhibition.
