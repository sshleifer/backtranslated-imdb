I was younger in high school when "Flesh" hit big screens, but was lucky enough to see it at midnight in NYC just two years later. <br /> <br /> Flesh is the first part of the so-called "trilogy" of films containing the wish of Joe Dallesandro. It has the name of "Warhol", but it's more of Paul Morissey's work. Basically, this story is about using one's own, surrounded by one day in the life of a street-wise man-hustler (played by Joe Dallesandro). Joe is a young, beautiful and a bit naive, but she succeeds in bringing bacon to her wife for reasons that cannot be explained to understand the film completely. <br /> <br /> Film fans are that this movie (along with the other two trilogy) was not a script in itself. Warhol's superstars were simply assumed ... and the words and actions the viewer sees are quite natural (even sometimes ridiculous or insensitive). But all this works ... "Rolling Stone" noted in his review that the film was better than "Midnight Cowboy", the same year's film polished by Hollywood (Best of the Academy Award Winner), a big name for talent (I'd also admire the film). .. but FLESH was improvised but was somehow more intestinal and realistic without the need for complicated sub-plots and any reason to cause. at all! <br /> <br /> The film rose to over $ 3 million and was an absolute feeling, especially in the German market (which ironically thought they were censored for the film after editing .... see below). <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, the movie is "cut and pasted" with "jumps". "clicks", "blinks", and the dialog literally. It is almost the same as Warhol / Morissey would say the simple truth that it is a superstar "day in life", extracts from your voyeuristic trends. Better than earlier Warhol's work, which is 8 hours of bedtime, and the shape of freedom as a 20+ hour film. <br /> <br /> FLESH is, in my opinion, the first of Warhol's films that are actually digestible (on a wide palette) and Warhol's / factory's first legitimate response to the Hollywood phenomenon "stardom". <br /> <br /> The first "trilogy" is a young, desirable male icon, naive, desired, responding to the wishes of his family. The following films would show "the same character" with a set of different values. (See "Trash" and "Hot")
