"Crossfire" is rightly a famous 1947 noir, a strong message. He celebrates Robert Young, Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan, Sam Levene and Gloria Grahame and is strongly led by Edward Dmytryk. We see at the beginning of the murder in the shadows, and for the rest of the film, Young, as the leader, the leader, tries to find out who the three soldiers are responsible for death and just as importantly. The victim, Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene), is someone the soldiers meet in the bar; they will go to their apartment to continue their visit, and Samuels will die. <br /> <br /> I don't know since 1947, but I saw Crossfire today, someone who did it and why the minutes look at suspects. I don't think it was so obvious because these actors just started. Nonetheless, the film has a great punch with a powerful actor, good direction, violence and unsustainable anti-Semitic language. <br /> <br /> Testimonials are vivid, including Gloria Grahame's small role - she is a woman who meets Mitchell (George Cooper), one of the suspected soldiers in the bar and can offer her an alibi. The great power of the film belongs to Robert Ryan, but everything is great. Especially Robert Young is an effective but intelligent police detective. Mitchum is very much like a soldier who is trying to help his confused friend Mitchell, a lonely man who is not sure if he still has his wife's feelings. <br /> <br /> Really great and must see.
