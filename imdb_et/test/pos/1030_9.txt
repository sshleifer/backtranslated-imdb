Oppenheimer was a big line (this was the first thing I saw in Waterston) and it's too bad copies not available. A similar situation exists for "Glory Enough for All", a British series that is about the same time insulin detection. I'd pay a good price for both DVDs. Is it really so hard to get Oppenheimer on a DVD that can be played in the US? Another very enjoyable series, again around the same time, was "Danger UXB". A series of UneXploded Bombs deflation, so the name. You can get it from your local library. <br /> <br /> Pete
