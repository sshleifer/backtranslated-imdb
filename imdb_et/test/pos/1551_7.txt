After some time in the air displacement, Columbo returned some of the new television-made secrets that are not as good as the original series, better than the exhibitions made in the 90s. <br /> <br /> "Murder can be dangerous to your health" then (and I think now that you think about it) used real crime as a murder. The murder has been committed by George Hamilton, a very successful, self-imposed, real criminal show player. Her chain smoking, who lost her job, played by Peter Haskell, tries to blackmail Hamilton when she discovers a porn video of Hamilton with a minor actor on her salad days. Hamilton uses Haskell's cigarettes to give a blow to death through poison, giving himself an alibi. <br /> <br /> Columbo has been introduced to find out what happened. You know the rest. Very fun.
