Just before dawn is a great horror movie. It's atmospheric, full of tensions made from nature's wildlife, where few young people meet their punishment, two mad, fat bastards who kill them. Jeff Lieberman is a very talented and intelligent driver, unfortunately underestimated. He was under tension, not by gore, but by displaying a threatening natural environment. Lieberman has managed to build tension in a very linear, simplified way, which is also the best way not to show the gore to the viewer but to let him imagine the worst thing that happens to the characters. Just before Dawn, Texas Chainsaw was always compared to Massacre, Deliverance and Hills. It's just as good as the Deliverance, better than the Hills, I mean more frightening and better designed, and it's scary like Texas Chainsaw Massacre. <br /> <br /> JBD is one of the best horrors of the last decades, eventually living on DVD!
