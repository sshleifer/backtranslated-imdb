ENGLISH PATSIENT is not just (destructive romance, tragic war, big characters), but it does have no other film. This is a promising story that is being spoken through all the involved, amazing visual images, the characters we care about and what has ever spoken of the most pleasant story. Cinematographer, the best film of 1996 and one of the best of the 1990s.
