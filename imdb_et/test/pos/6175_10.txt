I had switched on this "my tutorial" and now I don't know how the hell was there for nearly five years before I finally discovered it. If you have any kind of love to fly at all, especially to World War II aircraft, it must be an absolute vision that is much better than the pathetic "Pearl Harbor" and rivalry with the famous "British Battle" filmed more than thirty years ago. There are moments when you feel like you are driving with a hydrofoil, literally getting into your driver's shell when you roll on Me 109 or He 111. <br /> <br /> Since this film was deeply touched by the historian because of the tens of thousands of gallant Poles, Hungarians, Slovaks and Czechs who fled their homeland from 1939 to 1940, they fought hard for the survival of Western civilization, they were so abandoned after the war when the Communists arrested them when they returned home. I have been in Italy at Monte Cassino and the tomb of the Polish forces, which the British and Americans could not take, moved to tears. I have also traveled to Prague (the most beautiful cities) and learned their history. Their story of abandonment should, in my opinion, be the lesson of today's galanic allies. <br /> <br /> But back to the movie. If you love flying, look at it. If you are interested in a World War II aircraft, you can definitely see it. Undoubtedly, the most brutal, more direct, and most terrifying, radiant anti-air scenes that were once replayed on film. And yes, if you want even touching romance, it is also the detail of the heartbeat. <br /> <br /> Bill Forstchen Professor of History, Second World War replica "warbird" P-51 Mustang "Gloria" co-owner Ann "
