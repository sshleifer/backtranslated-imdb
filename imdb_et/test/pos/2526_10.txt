Pixotet is barely controlled by sentimentality. And I imagine that, with this film, Hector Babenco owes some of his cinematic art to the neo-realistic style of Vittorio De Sica, especially Shoeshine (this film, like Pixote, takes place mainly in a child prison). And while I could still prefer the De Sica movie when he decided to decide between the two, it is so close that it is, there is no red, like two children. They are both excellent raw drama works, and Pixote has the extra output of Babenco and the harrowing quality that it has to do is not being filmed in conditions that will lead after the war. It was so in Brazil - one would see it a little more with noises and awe in the city of God, perhaps in the same place - and these children were on the streets before and after the movie. Some do not live about 20 years later, because everyone knows. <br /> <br /> "Star", the pre-teen street boy Fernando Ramos da Silva plays the character of the title, a young father without a father or really any family who takes care of him and puts dozens of other street children and criminals in the rebuilding of boys. The conditions cannot be much worse and become even more intolerable because two children are killed one after the other for some reason. There's rebellion and escape, and on the side of the film we find Pixote with other young people, including Lilica's practical transvestite, not even 18, and they become handkerchiefs, drug mediators, whatever. None of what I should repeat is not shown with any kind of tooth-fist - certainly never a million years, when Ron Howard or Paul Haggis directs such a picture - and yet emotional honesty is all exactly, because nothing Almost every scene is important for this to show how fragile life is to Pixote, and how it could kill or die in some way to die, and thus without puberty, but it must be around those who are a little older (though not at all) and become things that this person is haunting forever. Despite the use of Babenco, a gentle and grieving musical score and one or two scenes where people cry a lot do not feel forced. As with De Sica, perhaps even more so, given the consistent conditions of the children of San Paolo and Rio Street, he is the natural director of the children and is attracted to Ramos da Silva and Jorge Juli√£o et al. "cinematic" drama (which is not so realistic that it becomes a documentary that is not a bad thing) and even a nuance of some scenes. <br /> <br /> Pixote may not be as well known as it is later in the 21st century Brazilian movies that look back at the horrors of Rio or even neo-realistic movies, but it should be. Anyone who wants to have a good and hard look at what it was should look for it in a library or other one and enjoy the best foreign film of 1981.
