Instead, look at this great age story of African American men in the mid-1960s at Chicago Chicago Ghetto. For all those under the age of 50, "What Happens" was a slightly cordial, rather peculiar sitcom that had very few serious moments that lasted four years (1975-1979) with young Afro-American high school children living in a working group neighborhood. I liked it a lot - this movie doesn't really have any real connection. "Cooley High" started with "What Happens", but its serious nature did not register well with the test groups, so it became a comedy again, although "What Happens" credit was still considered to be based on this movie. <br /> <br /> This film starts with light, but it touches many lives that are unique with the uneasy and some other timeless aspects of the 1960s. Boys are engaged in sex, betrayal, unemployment, hopelessness and even early death. The end is quite powerful and serious and the movie has a great Motown soundtrack. Highly recommended. Unfortunately, this movie is not new enough to be played on premium cable TV channels and is not considered old enough to be considered a classic film and play in the few places in these films.
