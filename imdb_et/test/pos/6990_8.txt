It was a great movie and the sequel should recognize our socks !!! The action is nonopop and I just bought a special edition DVD with an animated background similar to Animatrix. It puts Vin Diesel back in the spotlight and hopefully gets him an amazing role in Spider Man 3 as Venom. It would be the most logical choice for the role. Back to PB this movie, although it is an indie thriller, has a great story and characters that have a background that screams to make you want to know more. If they wanted to make books or comics, this would be a great reading. There was one thing I felt was a little under. The end he needed was a little work, but not every film has the best end.
