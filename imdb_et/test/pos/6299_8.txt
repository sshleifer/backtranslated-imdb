Someone on these boards has predicted that the whole thing has dreamed of being the best friend of the protagonist, though a friend he hasn't seen for about 20 years. I do not want to dismiss it, but it raises some viable questions. Why would a telephone advisor - or a shoe salesman or butcher - want to create a mythical world and worship a friend who collects it in the process, equally with mythical supporting letters. With the imagination that a good friend should be WRITING NOT Dreaming. A dream, or not, and the obvious candidate is director Paolo Sorrentino, has created a very observable world where Tony Servillo makes beauty art. We are asked to believe that forty years before our meeting, Forty La Girolom ("Servillo") "mafia" is upset by her and will be taken to a virtual prison in a Swiss small hotel, where she rides a suitcase of nine millimeters each week in a suitcase used by a local bank. Apart from this weekly trip she wants to do and what she wants to do is smoke, play cards with a man who cheats, and a woman who reminds men how far they have fallen socially, and ignore Olivia's friendly discoveries with Magnan, who is two years old. trying to get her smile and / or evening. For the most known reasons, which is against a person who does not care about anything or anyone, Servillo spends a stethoscope on his bedroom wall for a certain period of time and listening to the private conversation of his card - playing partners. Eventually he responds to Magnan - he has to do it or they are not a film. This is plot 6f: what is associated with Destry, who never suffers a weapon, or Sean (Duke Wayne), a "quiet person" who refuses to provoke and fight up to a mandatory scene where a gun is captured and fists ruined - but its Instead of politely accepting it, he removes 100,000 of his suitcase and buys a car. The final contradiction arises when Magnani tells him that he will pick him the next day at 16 in his car and drive to the mountains to celebrate his birthday. We've found that he lives on the ground, why he's driving a few miles away, ignoring the police's roadblock for driving on the road and somebody's guessing about rolling over the car. Moreover, such contradictions remain fine film art with excellent leadership and excellent support.
