In the 1960s, martial arts films received tremendous proportions in Asia, but due to the growing popularity of the notorious Shaw Brothers films, America had to be detained. This film was the first to be featured in America under the Warner Bros label and actually started the madness that over the 70's flooded with martial arts films. Many of the following films would be sparse, but some were big and many like Enter Dragon (which soon came out) became huge success stories and made these fighters superstars. <br /> <br /> Fast 40 years later, and this movie is still up. Most of Shaw's brothers' films are as good as they were today and the truth is that there are no films in this genre that would compete with Shaw Brose's day-made games. <br /> <br /> I like to think that martial arts are like porn and nobody watches porn for the plot, but it also goes to masterpieces and most of them are just a few great struggles with little story, this is an exception. It has no amazing story, but there is one. <br /> <br /> Lo Lieh's main man actually stands out among the karate heroes. He never encourages and he never fights just because he can, he is often seen as a weak and less fighter than most, but when he has to fight, he is very big in life. I really loved this sign. Many bad guys were memorable and the fighting scenes were just as amazing. Even a small role with Bolo Yeung can be a great Mongolian, and Bolo is the star of my 5 biggest martial artists, he was also the Enter the Dragon mentioned above. <br /> <br /> The production, as I have said over and over again, is wonderful, you can't beat Shaws, the direction was different when I saw a lot of movies in the 70s, the use of color was well placed and changed this movie alone and the rise above others. When the light shines out of Chi Hao when he makes Iron Fist, its pure beauty. <br /> <br /> Music was also great. The martial arts films were in Asia, which the westerners had in Italy, two separate art forms so much in common. The countries that made these films had all the genres, but the Japanese films made waves there, as western spaghetti was in Italy. With these many differences, the styles of these two genres were neck and neck. As in films like 5 Fingers Of Death, the struggles were easily comparable to Sergia Leon's cowboy, and the music linked the genres so well. The music here borrowed a bit from Ironside, but it was still very original. <br /> <br /> Many movies were inspired by it and when I watch it, I see everything from Master Killer to Bloodsport. The most obvious film affected was Kill Bill, which for me is the biggest ever. Many of the kits used by Quentin are complete copies of what is shown here, and he used the music of this film, although he used music from borrowed music from Ironside. And the fight scene at the end of Kill Bill vol. 1 with Bride and O-Ren is sometimes accurate, compared to fighting Chi Hao and Japanese thug at the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> I've seen many martial arts movies, some even better, but it's fans of the MES-SEE genre. You can't go wrong here. The film starts slowly but within 15-20 minutes it starts to rise and does not slow down.
