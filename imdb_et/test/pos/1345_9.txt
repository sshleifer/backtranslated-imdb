OhMyGAWD !!! MAGIC GARDEN is perhaps one of my living memories of the 70s childhood. Two hippie chicks with ponytails, Carole and Paula would swing, say jokes that they chose a plaque patch, dressed in the costumes they found in the giant front of The Storybox, and argue with the annoying pink squirrel called Sherlock, who lived with their trees. They could also hit an average acoustic guitar and sing a real melody. It was a great childhood. Very 70s feeling. But this is a problem: they don't want to show it anymore. Too bad that. You could say that these two girls really had gold hearts and beloved children, they were really sweet. MAGIC GARDEN is one of those that shows that when they came out of the box, people would like to buy it because his MELLOW would walk through Memory Lane.
