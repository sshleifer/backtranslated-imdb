I haven't seen it for years, but when I was about 6 years I saw it for the first time in VHS and I had to watch it at least 10 times. Now as I said it had been for some time that I could screw up the plot, but I remember some Columbian terrorists having prep school hostage demands on head terrorist ("Wishmaster") father released from prison. Now I can just look at the IMDb plot, but I'm pretty sure. in some way, the school boys decide that they just don't sit and wait to die so they decide to come back. this movie has always been in my mind. There are so many pictures that I have not forgotten, like Joey (I think?) of a death scene or billy spitting on terrorist sandwiches or one of the kids (not knowing their name) a fake asthma attack. just a great movie. it can be films that have given me their tolerance to the violence of the film because when I remember, this movie is pretty graphic. The boys get the helicopter machine weapons, the special forces that the grenades are about to burn (not sure about it, but it seems to me that it resembles the end) and most bloody is the main terrorist who can get down the head exactly. great action, great humor, good actor, great movie experience. I have to look at it after these years!
