I testify that I've never seen "Guffman's wait", a critically acclaimed comedy of 1997 about a small town that is staging the competition. When the Best in Show ad tagged "Guffman's waiting for a team", there were numerous critics in their reviews that only people who know the film or its filmmakers and are cast. saw this movie in time. Because shame, critics, shame two! Any critic who means something that doesn't want to share the richness of the movie with the rest of the world, but that's one movie I hope people will now experience with their video / DVD. "Best in Show" is undoubtedly the best comedy of the year 2000. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a nice style, featuring the main Mayflower's Best In main competitors (not to mention the screws). Exhibition "Contest where dogs of all breeds compete to see who is the best dog. We have a cute and curly Harry Pepper (guest) with his bloodshed, a simple Gerry & Cookie Fleck (Levy & O'Hara) with his landscape, nuts Hamilton & Meg Swan (Hitchcock & Posey), gay dog ​​caretakers Scott Dolan & Stefan Vanderhoof (Higgins & McKean), and air-headed millionaire Sheri Ann Ward Cabot (Coolidge) with her trainer Christy Cummings (Lynch), all with one simple item: blue ribbon What is given to the best dog? And ... I have to tell you the rest? <br /> <br /> Director / writer / star The sense of humor of the guests is one that confirms that there are comedies worth laughing and that " American Pie "or other meaningless" teenage "movies do not take the idiot out of the world. His idea is simple: make your comedy not only funny, but SMART funny. But instead of following the brilliant movies like" Zero Effect "and" High Fidelity " trace, he used a rather unusual approach (and as I understood it used this approach for "Guffman"). Whether you notice or not, a great part of the film is improvisation. In other words, what the actors say and do, was probably not a script written, maybe not even a dreamed guest and co-author / star Levy. With a gentle hand, he and the actors pulled a fun theater file that would probably have floped when handled by other, less adept actors. Now it's smart! <br /> <br /> Of course, this is the one that improves improvisation best. All of them are (comedic) admiring, especially the guest like Pepper. But the real challenge is to be Fred Williard, who is Buck Laughlin, a competitor who can bring out the most terribly funny stories and comments that no scientist even dreams of ... that is, when the announcer tries to be funny. Williard may go on talking about the dog and how much she can push. There's even a part that he's giving out the idea of ​​a new marketing strategy: whether sexy women wear dogs in tight shorts and shorts and that means something like a "time period". It is invaluable, as is its performance. The film deserves so much recognition. It became the best picture-comedy in the golden globes of the candidate but could not. I don't understand why. I mean, the comedy department is the best in the show. <br /> <br /> GRADE: A
