Vigoroso, Mexico's Viagra Stolen Shipment; a beautiful girl who tries to restore her life and leave her husband, the mafia boss of Italy; a young sheriff who falls in love with his old gold. This is a plot of "shipment", a national comedy located in the small town of Paradise, Arizona. Despite his simple and classic story, the film (directed by Alex Wright) has some fun moments: when Elizabeth Berkley (like Candy Porter), watching Vigoroso's green whistle, says, "What is it? Coin candy?" Or when a girl enters the sheriff's house and or if Vigoroso shipment reaches this lake, in the final order ... Cast offers some nice performances: Matthew Modine as the sheriff of the Paradise Valley, who still loves his old girlfriend, and Elizabeth Berkley, who is still dealing with her old boy. .. A supportive majority, including Nicholas Turturro, Paul Rodriguez (if Mexico Jos√®) and G Michael Gray (which teeth ...), make it not a pleasure to have an Oscar material, but not so bad.Happy comedy without pretense.
