You know, it's very interesting looking at it ... half of the people involved are now dead ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's been a long time since I watched something related to Muppet, but this stuff is pure gold . I'm a big fan of punches and they are pretty well placed on this film, but one of the most amazing aspects is its pace: it's not really a fast pace for children, where filmmakers decide to just randomly move the story without giving it a depth, it's just one that moves together with the characters they want to go to. <br /> <br /> Kermit Frog is just an awesome character. His voice and expressions on his doll surface are fantastic. But above all, he points out why he is popular - "he can also sing and make fun!" - But more appropriately, why it is so appealing - it encourages all efforts to look for your dreams. In the meantime, he must also deal with himself, which is an unusual topic in family films. <br /> <br /> It also includes quite a few comedies that perform performances here and there, some to a great extent, others a little less (I think Mel Brook's part was just a bit over, did it?). Some parts of the film are odd. But it is very imaginative and takes you from the very same direction to the same destination. <br /> <br /> Go to the right ... <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
