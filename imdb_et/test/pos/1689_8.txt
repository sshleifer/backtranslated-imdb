The film was certainly a real life story on which it is based. It was hard for me to find newspaper articles about actual facts, but when I found them, I saw that the truth was in this case unfamiliar to fiction. Judith Light was terribly evil in the role of the mother of this film, so it was difficult to distinguish it from her role as a sign of what I think is great performance. Rick Schroder was appropriately a husband, when his son, who also defended himself in court, was an example of how difficult it is in some cases for a child to accept parenting activities, regardless of their crime. In the film, you can find an error, but not how to deal with the reality on which it is based.
