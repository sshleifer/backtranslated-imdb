This Aussie flick, filmed in 1999, is an OK piece of work that is a small time at Kings Cross in Sydney. At the center of the plot is the situation of future crimes of young people whose lives are in danger after they have worked for their future superior. Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown worked very well. The plot is quite incredible with some very humorous moments in one scene that revolves around the bank's thrusts. Creating natural themes is quite well done. E.g. When one crim searches for bullets for his weapon. Personally, I don't like the movie for free because of unacceptable violence, and the film didn't offend it. It tried and managed to show us the human aspects, like Bryan Brown. The rest of the majority did the OK job without remembering the actual views. The direction was very good when we managed to create an incredible movie that gave good entertainment. The main main feature that makes this good movie is Heath Ledger's behavior and direction and his successful image of a naive young man who makes foolish mistakes for short-term joy, thinking he is indestructible and does not realize that it is an unexpected person to hit the mistake. Special mention is made by director Gregor Jordan. Rating in my book - 7 (out of 10).
