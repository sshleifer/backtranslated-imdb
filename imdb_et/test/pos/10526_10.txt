Unfortunately, this original way of doing things and laughing is for the movie film fans because it sits in Colombian vaults forever. Shame because it can be Jack Starret's strongest film and has the young Terrence Malick's funny script and his two leading performances by Stacey Keach and Frederic Forrest who turn to crime to get money for a seafood restaurant. Many standout scenes include interrogation with a bath and electric razor, and intense shooting in an abandoned building as it is broken by a crushing ball!
