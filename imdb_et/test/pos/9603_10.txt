.... would ITV not want to release this absolute classics because it would show its current Mike Bassett series, what is it? While discussing Mike Bassetti's work with some colleagues, I mentioned the Bostock Cup as a much higher offer and was surprised to see that I am the only person in my entire office that has actually seen it. It can't be the right movie to be the funniest thing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> To be honest, ITV does not have the most recent record for comedy production, so you think they would jump at least to repeat something really funny. Perhaps, if it could be combined with a lucrative phone call where we think the trainer is getting closer, they may be interested. <br /> <br /> Come to ITV, there are some of us who would like to see original, high quality comedy / drama. Is a decent thing. Repeat this, then get it out of the DVD.
