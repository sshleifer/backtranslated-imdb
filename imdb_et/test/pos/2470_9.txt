Yesterday I made this movie on television. I had some curiosity about this being led by Emilio Estevez and starring him and his real father, Martin Sheen. I love to see a movie about a father-son relationship that involves a real father and son. Of course, there is immediate chemistry between Sheen and Estevez, and the scenes of these conflicts are even more intense, knowing that they are actually involved. Of course, it will help both to be such a terrible maker. I used to see Martin Sheen in intensive roles, but I think it is Emilio's most intense role, mostly to remind her of the "Mighty Ducks" series - and I was very impressed. Talent is really in this family. And Kathy Bates steals the movie in Oscar value. He pulled my heartbeats with the words of each dialogue. Kimberly Williams - a beautiful actor from "The Bride's Dad" movies - is also very good, keeping her among the talented veteran actors. <br /> <br /> The film is a bit on stage, the dialogue is obviously on stage, but it didn't bother me. It's not meant to be an action movie; this is a character study. And for a movie based on the game, it's never too claustrophobic. When Emilio's character Jeremy resembles his days in Vietnam, we actually see his harassing memories. <br /> <br /> Film is extremely powerful and realistic without being sentimental. After all, I was expecting all the conflicts to be resolved and the family would become hunky, but that is not so. The ending made me cry without using the usual Hollywood melodrama. This proves that reality is much more engaging than anything Hollywood can build. <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for beautiful and powerful dramas with great performances that will hit your socks ... please check out this underrated pearl. Hopefully, one day Martin and Emilio Charli will join and they will do a great movie together. <br /> <br /> My score: 9 (out of 10)
