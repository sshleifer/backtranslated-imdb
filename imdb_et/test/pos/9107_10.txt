Waiting for this movie for so many years! The best part is that it lives with my visions! This is NOT for any Tenacious D or a real Jack Black fan. It's just so big to see on the big screen JB, KG and Lee! It's not a real story, but one who cares. D is the world's largest band! I had a movie strip last week and listened to it non-stop. To see the film, I and my husband had pure bliss. We've both met Jack and Kyle after two different Tenacious D concerts and we saw them even when they went with Weezer. We left this concert after D had played. Nobody can start their show! Long live D! : D
