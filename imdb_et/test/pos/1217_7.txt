Kung Fu (1976) "The Hand of Death" or "Countdown" is the undervalued work of the director John Woo. The movie stars Dorian Tan (Tan Tao-liang) and important supporting roles are Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung and James Tien. Many people believe or believe in deceptive advertising that it's Jackie Chan's movie. It's not Jackie Chan's movie, Dorian Tan is a star, but Jackie gives one of her best (most serious) early performances. <br /> <br /> The hand of death is about Shaolin's disciple named Yunfei (Tan) who is sent to a mission to assassinate Shaolin's traitor named Shih Xiaofeng (Tien) and defend the revolutionary name Zhang Yi (Woo). During his journey, Yunfei meets a young woodworker named Tan (Chan) and a shamed sword fighter (Chang Chung), known as a "traveler". Both men have suffered from Shih and want to get hold of it. The three teams won the Shih and his eight bodyguards to win the revolutionary safety. Dorian Tan uses his trademark very effectively when "North-18 style kicks" with some "South five-style boxing". Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan also offer great martial arts performances. James Tien is not Jade's biggest martial artist on the screen, but does a decent job. Some of the early struggles are a bit slow and seem choreographic, but the final showdowns of Chani, Tani and Hung are very good. <br /> <br /> Director John Woo offers a lot of interesting character in the film that is refreshing. Leung Wing Kat's cinematic art is very stylish, unique and beautiful for this kung fu film. Joseph Koo Music: The combination of soft flutes and 70's "Shaft" orchestral works is the best of kung fu cinema. The hand of death is not Jackie and Sammo's usual kung fu comedy. The hand of death is a serious, understandable story of revenge. <br /> <br /> Kung Fu's Death Hand, or Countdown in Kung Fu, is an underrated classical old-school kung fu genre. The film is one of the best artistic of its time and a preview of the great things that come from Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung. Hung's great choreography is shown here before his debut, and Chan's early charisma and talent can be clearly seen. <br /> <br /> The Death Hand is a solid, stylish old school kung fu movie and an excellent early work legendary John Woo. <br /> <br /> The Kung Fu genre Rating 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Wanderer Tanile (refers to his new weapon): "Little Eagle Wing God Lance." Tan: "Just knowing."
