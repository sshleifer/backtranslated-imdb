This is a film that every child should see before they grow and distort, which is often passed down from generation to generation. I grew up in two different places, though only 20 miles away. I went to school and for the first 8 years of my life I had friends of faith and religion of every color. Then I moved to a mountain area (though not anymore) where it was very unusual to have even one African American boy in your class. My graduates had 2 or 3 African Americans in high school (God, why can't I just say Black? You can call me cute or white! All this political correctness casts me like most others!) Anyway, get back to the movie, try it See what happens when people get a distorted view or just what ignorance or lack of understanding of culture or state does! This is a great movie, everybody should see the kids in particular.
