After reading this movie previews, I thought it would be hopeless, but after I got my DVD of my region (the DVD was available before the movie came to the cinemas), I was pleasantly surprised by the strong presentation of all the cast members that makes it a very enjoyable movie. The fact that the script is rather weak means that you don't hit the story and therefore the recurring view factor is higher. I recommend this movie one and all <br /> <br />
