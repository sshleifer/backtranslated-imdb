Oscar winners: Hutton and Penn are exceptionally good in the film. The film is sometimes funny and quite disturbing. David Suchet almost steals the exhibition as a man working for the Soviet Union. In this picture, the supporting roles are familiar. It was quite undervalued when it was first released. Despite some great criticism from film critics. This image is based on true creation. There are some mistakes in storytelling, such as these two interface characters, but in general it is a movie worth seeing. Based on Robert Lindsey's novel. Oscar Winner Scenario: Steven Zaillian (American Gangster, Hannibal, Schindler List). (**** / *****).
