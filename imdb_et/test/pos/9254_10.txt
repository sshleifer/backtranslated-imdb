HLOTS was a prominent series that NYPD Blue never gets, HLOTs have real plots, dialogue is real, relationships are real. When HLOTS is behind the film, all the loose ends were put together, it was good to have all the gang come together, even some of those who left show up (wont say how) The story was fast paced, the emotional and spiritual series were a week and a week out. Killing, living on the streets, networking drama your best !!!! 5 STARS !!!! Thumbs UP and all that. Thanks to NBC for giving us Finally we couldn't!
