A great special effect makes this disaster very plausible. It can be seen that the manufacturers were somewhat worried that the screens on the computer screens were right - all this makes it very convincing. Sets are also very authentic. A good selection of music rounds the film nicely. <br /> <br /> The action is good and David Suchet's presence adds some, of course. Compared to other films in this genre, Flood is among the best. Fortunately, the "human drama" aspect is not superfluous, as is often the case with this type of film. People's suffering is represented in the perfect balance between the real flood scenes. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film that many of us suspect: weather forecasts do not do so often! :)
