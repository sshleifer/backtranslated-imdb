I am collecting movies from Super-8 and managed to print one full-length E-bay last week. It seems at least for now, this is the only way to see this movie in a NTSC country. I've seen it in the region 2 DVDs many times, but never in the region 1. <br /> <br /> I ended it a few minutes ago and I'm surprised at it. It is a powerful proof of freedom and a place in the world. Photography and music were wonderful, and I felt some of the characters' empathy. <br /> <br /> I like the idea that I was probably the only one in the US looking at "When the North Wind Blows" tonight! <br /> <br /> Lively Avakum !!
