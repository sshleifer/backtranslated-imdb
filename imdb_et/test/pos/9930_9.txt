The horror genius Dario Argento is one of my personal favorite guides, and his films "Suspiria", "Phenomena" and "Profondo Rosso" extend to my personal all-time favorite. The 1987 Opera is another amazing and brilliant film that no horrorist can afford and keeps you from the edge of your chairs from start to finish. Such stunning and ultra-violent Giallot can be described as the most sophisticated films by the masters, which is quite something, given that Argento's films are not the result of their violence. Violence is extreme and highly stylized in a great way that makes Opera a censor nightmare. <br /> <br /> - Warning! SPOILERS! Just when Betty (Christina Marsillach), a young opera singer, becomes successful, a murderous and incredibly sadistic psychopath starts to chase her ... The murder is truly cruel and especially sadistic. The killer adds the needles associated with Betty's eyelids, so he has to open and watch them when he brutally murders people who are close to him. When making Butchering, the killer releases Betty and the leaves, just back to his other friends ... <br /> <br /> As usual with Argento films, violence is extremely graphic and highly stylized. "Opera" is a truly brutal film and a stylish and atmospheric film. This movie is completely tantalizing and pure stop from start to finish. The performances are very good, especially Christina Marsillach is excellent in the lead. Stunning beauty and great actor, Marsillach is perfect for the role of her talented singers, whose fear and terrible experience slowly makes her crazy. Other great performances are Ian Charleston, a director of the horror film, who directs opera and director Argento's real girlfriend, Daria Nicolod, who plays a role in many of her films. The work of the camera is great, as in all Argento films, and the great opera house is a great place to contribute a lot to the film's beauty as well as to the constant horrible atmosphere. Also, the score, which is partly a classic music and partly a heavy metal, is also great, although I missed out on Goblin's great Progressive Rock Soundtracks, which is the distinctive element of most other Argento films. "Opera" is a truly frightening and absolutely breathtaking Giallo experience. This is an absolute vision for every Horror lover, and I recommend it to every other film fan who is not too sensitive to extreme violence. Excellent and absolutely tantalizing!
