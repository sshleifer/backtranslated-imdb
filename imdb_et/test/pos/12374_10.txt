This movie is just this masterpiece. Especially double exposure of cameraman Julius Jaenzon. It has been skillfully made even by the standards we are accustomed to seventy-eight years later. Director Viktor Sjöström also plays the main character, David Holm. On the eve of the new years, he is killed in a fight and the legend says that the first to die in a new year must work as a transparent ghost as a soul collector. Every year, a new heroine is called. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> p> </p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> > <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> The scene where the alcoholic, David Holm, rises from his body (as the soul leaves his earth body) in the church (where the fight took place) is a real prize for filmloving. Even when the current soul collector arrives with his horse and the carriage is beautiful but also scary. David Holm recognizes this soul collector as an earlier life. Now it's his turn to take over. Just like Scrooge Dickens' story "Christmas Song", David is shown what his life and deeds have led to the people around him. <br /> <br /> Film is a risk of drug abuse, in this case alcohol. It is based on the book of the Nobel laureate Selma Lagerlöf. Viktor Sjöström was still writing some of his books, but this is the best result, perhaps because the book is the most film-like of them. <br /> <br />
