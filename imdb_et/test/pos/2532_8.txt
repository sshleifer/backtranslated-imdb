I have studied Brazilian cinema since 2004 when I stumbled upon "Cidade de Deus / City of God". Let me tell you something, this film is probably just as good or better than the "City of God". <br /> <br /> Functional, cinematic and musical supervision make this movie a unique experience. I haven't been to Brazil yet, but this film introduces a tougher reality for SÃ£o Paulo citizens. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie when you enjoy a good movie. This movie is annoying and after watching it, you may feel a little confused. <br /> <br /> Something you want to watch, but something you want to sleep.
