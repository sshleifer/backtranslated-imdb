If you think a war movie will allow you to really feel the war, you must see "Letyat zhuravli" (called "Cranes Ride" in English). It tells the story of Veronika (Tatiana Samoylova) and Boris (Alexei Batalov) who love World War II. They walk along the waterline, looking at the cranes when the war begins. Boris will be sent to war immediately. Veronika hides with her family and comes to the marriage son she doesn't love. In the meantime, Boris continues to rob rural areas by fighting the Nazis and experiencing all the horrors of war until he runs out. When Veronika, who works in a military hospital, gets this news, he refuses to accept it until Boris's body arrives at one of the trains home. At the same time, the radio announces that Germany has given up and allies have won the war; The Soviet Union lost 27 million citizens, but it is the beginning of a new era. <br /> <br /> This movie did a great job of showing the impact of war on people not only on the battlefield, but also on how it affected the civilian population. This is definitely a movie everyone should see.
