"Don't Change Your Spouse" is another producer / director of Cecil B. De Mille's soap opera comedy. This is remarkable as the first film he made in Gloria Swanson's main role. I think you could also call it the queue of "Old Women" (1918). <br /> <br /> James (Elliot Dexter) and Leila (Swanson) Porter are forty ish pairs where James has gone to the seed and has become weak and lazy. he has a firm smell of cigars and raw onions. He takes his wife for granted. Leila tries to frighten her without being effective. <br /> <br /> During one evening at the Porters Dinner, Leila will meet the brilliant Schyler Van Sutphen (now a moniker), the lady of socialism, brother. Huckney (Sylvia Ashton). He calls Leila home for the weekend to make James "miss her". Then Schyler starts to put on his moves, allowing him joy, prosperity and love when he leaves his husband and goes with him. The sequences of Leila's imaginary new life are staged and predict De Mille's epic costume later in his career. <br /> <br /> Leila, who is bored with her marriage and her inseparable husband, divides James and marries playboy. Finally, Jacob understands that he has lost the only thing that is important to him and that he will improve his way. She shaves her mustache, works out, shines on the bulbs and gets some practice. Schyler seems to want to play and has taken gold digging in Nanette (aka Tootsie or some such name) (Julia Faye). Schyler loses all his money and steals Leila's diamond ring to cover his losses. <br /> <br /> One Judicial Day, Leila will meet "new" James and take her changes. James drives his home and becomes aware of his situation and ........................................ ......... <br /> <br /> This film marked the beginning of Gloria Swanson's resurrection during a career that would have fought with Mary Pickford. Old 20-year-old, he had started his career at Mack Sennett as two reel comedies as a teenager. Elliot Dexter was almost 50 years old at this time, but he and Swanson did a good team, although it is hard to imagine someone who is pretty Miss Swanson's tiring, as is the case with this movie. <br /> <br /> Dexter and Sylvia Ashton had appeared in similar old female spouses where the woman had gone to seed and her husband was wrong to blame. <br /> <br /> Most of the De Mille rule is Theodore Roberts as a bishop and Raymond Hatton as a gambler.
