First of all, I watched this movie for the first time and I also bought a LP recording for the soundtrack. I liked it so well, I went back to see it several times. Don't understand why it was considered a flop. Julie Andrews was cute in this movie, her voice was up and the costume was beautiful! <br /> <br /> The film contains a little bit of everything, and although some scenes were a bit heavy, they were still fun. <br /> <br /> I recently found that I got a copy of the DVD format and ordered it ...... I was disappointed that a couple of songs and movies were not in the DVD version I ordered.
