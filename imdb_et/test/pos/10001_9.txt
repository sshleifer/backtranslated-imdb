As a sports enthusiast, I was pleased with Disney's sensitivity to the early 20th century golf class issues. The film depicts the psychological battles Harry Vardon struggled inside of himself, from childhood trauma to displacing him from breaking the glass ceiling. Likewise, the young Ouim goes through his class struggles, being in the eyes of the Americans alone in the caddy top crust. <br /> <br /> What I loved the best is how this class topic appears in Ouimet's parents. His father is a working class drone who sees the value of hard work but is frightened by the upper class; her mother, however, acknowledges her son's talent and desire and encourages her to continue to compete against those who think she is worse. <br /> <br /> Finally, golf games are well photographed. Although the course used in the film was not the actual place of the historic tournament, Disney's small freedoms do not diminish the beauty of the film. There is one little Disney moment at the billiard table; otherwise, the viewer will not think of Disney. The end, like "miraculous", is not a Disney creation, but one that could only have been written by human history.
