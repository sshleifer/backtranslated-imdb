A nice, humorous mix of musical halls (mostly in the first third) and a police procedural mystery when the stories of the suspects begin to collapse. The final contact of the murder may come as a surprise if you do not look closely. History of Paris. The final scene can be ignored (Hollywood end). Louis Jouvet is the best police inspector who seems to be just going through but is really on things.
