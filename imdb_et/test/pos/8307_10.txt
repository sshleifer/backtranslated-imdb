This movie was another film that I saw in the cinema as a child. It frightened me of a living mess. So much so I asked my dad if we could leave halfway. However, I have pleasant memories of this terrible masterpiece. Doug McClure and Peter Cushing in the same movie! Great! Monsters made of polypropylene substitutes. Scary stuff. A rubber monster is when you mean it, even worse than a real monster. <br /> <br /> The amazing thing about this movie is how good the result is. Really stabbing things. <br /> <br /> There are also many prehistoric tights in the exhibitions. Nice.
