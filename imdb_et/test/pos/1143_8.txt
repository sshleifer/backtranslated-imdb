I agree with msinabottle; this is a great movie. Here are some excerpts from the dialogue: <br /> <br /> Sean Connery to Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen): "Do you see a man how he draws water? full of power, but you pour it, waste it and Islam is dragging drops when they run out of their bucket. "<br /> <br /> Rape: English has paid very well in the past. Pedecaris: Well, you're not American. President Roosevelt has a head for this. Rape: Roosevelt. That President Roosevelt - would he try to take it? Pedecaris: He would be! He is the man of fear and strong moral fiber. She doesn't rob women and children! Rape: What kind of rifle does he use? Pedecaris: Winchester! Rape: Winchester. Winchester. I don't know this rifle. Pedecaris: You get. <br /> <br /> Teddy Roosevelt (Brian Keith): American Grizzly Bear is a symbol of American character: strength, intelligence, wild. From time to time blind and reckless, but boldly and undoubtedly. Oh, and another feature goes with all the previous features. Newspaper reporter: And this, Mr President? Teddy Roosevelt: loneliness. The bear lives his life alone. Unknown. Unconquered. But always alone. He has no real allies, but no enemies, but none of them is as big as he is. Newspaper Reporter: Do you think it may be an American feature? Teddy Roosevelt: Definitely. The world never loves us. It can respect us. It may even frighten us. But it never loves us. Because we have too much courage. And from time to time we are also blind and careless.
