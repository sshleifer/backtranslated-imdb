Every time you see it, rare film gets better. Oh, brother does this and then some. The first time I saw it, I have to admit that I've never seen anything like that. Then I wanted to see it again, and now I have two-digit numbers for this great movie, the Coen brothers' best film they've ever made, so Fargo and Hudsucker Proxy came up with a second and third tension for me. br /> <br /> George Clooney gives his career to Ulysses Everett McGee, a fast-paced know-how for all the escaped convicts who really don't know. Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro are ideal for Clooney, especially Nelson and his portrayal of Delmar, a loyal, though uneducated companion. John Goodman is my favorite bitmark like Big Dan, perfect. It reminds me of his role in raising Arizona, he is the perfect actor for this role. Coen Brothers Holly Hunter and Charles Durning also offer memorable performances. <br /> <br /> Joel and Ethan Coen are masters of their trade. It's not like they're trying to win the Academy Awards every time they make a movie, they just try and tell the story that they want to say, and it's fun. It's an open-minded customization of Odyssey, and I'm thinking of all your Homer fanatics. It's just great. <br /> <br /> The most amazing part of this movie is coloring. I looked at how they felt the film was dusty and I was just thinking about it. Painting becomes an important part of the film. Great movie.
