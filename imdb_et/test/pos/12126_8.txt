a very surprisingly underrated film. very realistic. and authentic. being Italian, I can definitely relate to used situations and phrases. I thought Joe Cortese was great. how crazy the cell phone type and slots and Vincent were also great. I liked the actor Criscuolo, who played the boss. He was very authentic. I think director Ralph devito was on the way to big things, but it was too early, maybe because he knew too much. I thought it was great. it deserves more action and recognition. it was a sleeping film. great. very good. it was really good. it was well done.
