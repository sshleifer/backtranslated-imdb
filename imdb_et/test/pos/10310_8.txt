I think the movie was very good. Theme, actor and Nusrat Fateh ALi Khan's music was wonderful. Although the director has succeeded in demonstrating the situation of women in rural areas and how they suffer in the male-dominated culture, he has set aside some of Phoolan's character and focused more on the violence he is facing.
