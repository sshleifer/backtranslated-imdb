Hi! Speaking of Cantonese, I found it very funny and I managed to get all the jokes that might not get due to the language barrier. Fighting scenes are remarkable and it's a good movie. But I have my criticism. First of all, I find it not as good as the first project A-GO and see what it is now! :-) The reason is, SPOILERS AHEAD-DO NOT READ THAT YOU ARE NOT FILM !!!!!) because in project A, Jackie ends up fighting against his enemy; the man to whom he is sent, Sanpao. It has been trying to make the whole movie and the showdown is remarkable. But in A II, although he fights with Chan, the showdown scene between Jackie and his genius is not long enough and most of the action is against Caesar men. They are not quite "bad" and they have played only a small part of the movie compared to Jackie, although although their struggle is remarkable, they are not what Jackie is hunting about in the whole movie, so it leaves the viewer a little out of place. But this is just my humble opinion, so don't take that word for word and see it for yourself! It's a great movie in your own right! Take care and hope that your admiration for Jackie will grow! Sincerely, Ian PS. Do you know police officer A II? He's the first guy I know he's still strong!
