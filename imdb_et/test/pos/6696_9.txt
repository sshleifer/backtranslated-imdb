Like some of the best movies and series, I stumbled upon it completely randomly. It was late, the storm was in full force and I sat comfortably on the couch when I flicked along a channel that was almost one episode. I only wanted to watch for a few minutes while waiting for the ads to stop on another channel before returning to some or some other laptops. About a year and a half later, I remembered my decision and was so happy that I didn't. Needless to say, I am convinced that I saw all the other episodes. John Hannah has been in almost everything I've seen him, and he doesn't let him here either. All other cast members also work on the star. My personal favorite (except of course John Hannah) is Gerard Murphy. <br /> <br /> The only downside to this series is the limited number of episodes. Only 8 with JH and 1 other with someone. I'd like to see McCallum screen back, though it should be with JH!
