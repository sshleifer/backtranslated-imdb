Before I talk about the end of this movie, I'm talking about this plot. Some guys named Gerald interrupt their commitment to Kitty and drive to Craven Castle in Scotland. After several months, Kitty and her aunt went to Scott. Upon arriving at the Craven Castle, Kitty finds Gerald obsolete and has grown more meaningful. Gerald has certain rules for the castle (the rules are 200 years old). Gerald does not want them to stay, but Kitty insists that they remain in apologies. One night, he is looking at aunt's glimpse of a monster running across the hall. It scares her so much that she despises and (second apology) they have to stay longer. Kitty starts to worry about Gerald after she tries to go to the maze, but Gerald catches her and is even more cunning. Then Kitty sends her fortifications, she calls her doctor, who is actually their friend and her broad. When things are not suspicious, they invite a few other friends (who actually do nothing). Blah, blah, blah Kitty and her aunt come to the labyrinth where the story is the most. They somehow separate and they try to find each other. But the aunt stumbles on the creature ... here is the moment when we've all been waiting for what's in the shade? ... this is a giant FROG !!! OMG, what's better than this! After aunt's sight, the frog literally goes crazy and runs. The frog then jumps out of the opened window. Then we go off the ground and look at the frog's horn (oh yes this movie was 3-D). But you want to know what's funny is the frog that drops out of the window is actually a toy because it's 1/10 of the frog size before the jump. Then it turned out that it was all the faults of evolution, blah, blah and kitty and gerald married. Then the last blow of this masterpiece is the tomb of a frog in the maze, the only place where he was once very happy;).
