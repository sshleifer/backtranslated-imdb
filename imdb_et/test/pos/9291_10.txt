If you think the great Australian comedy doesn't think Skit is showing (though I'm quite part of the 80's and 90's full length) or even Sitcom's - you think SATIRE! Something we really know about the Austrians. (For example: Front Line, Micallef program) We know how to take a pi $$ and Chaser war for everything is a classic example of how to do it and how to do it really well. <br /> <br /> For a long time I have been a big fan of Chris Taylor and Craig Reucassel. I remember listening to them in Triple J in the afternoon. They were and will remain the two most funny comics. <br /> <br /> Although I was sad when they left Triple J, I was glad to find out what they invested so much time they had to leave. (At the same time, they made CNNNN and Triple J, so I thought it was much bigger) And what the amazing HILARIOUS show Chaser is. Biting political and social satire is the best. <br /> <br /> I am happy to say that he has recently received a much better time than Friday evenings and has moved on Wednesday nights right after Spicks and Specks. Thanks ABC! Finally I don't have to stick it! :)
