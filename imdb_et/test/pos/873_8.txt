On the island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean, Louis Mahé (Jean-Paul Belmondo) deals with Julie Roussel, the owner of the cigarette factory, and he does not know him. When Julie comes to get married to Louis, she's waiting for her in the dock, but Louis doesn't recognize Julie on the cruise ship and finds she's completely different from what she sent to Louis. They marry and Louis shares his bank accounts. When Julie's sister writes a letter to Louis asking her sister to write to her, Louis discovers that she is not Julie, who is missing. In addition, she finds that she has deleted her bank accounts and left the island. Louis and Julie's sister hire an effective private investigator, Comoll (Michel Bouquet), and Louis is driving to France, looking for a woman, but she's nervous in Nice and she gets intensive sleeping in the clinic. He recovers and finds that a woman, actually Marion Vergano (Catherine Deneuve), works at the Privé Antibesis club in Phoenix and lives in a low budget hotel in Monorail. Louis breaks in his room and when he arrives from the club he says he was happy with him, but his former dangerous lover Richard had extorted him. Louis is still in love with Marion and flees with him in the countryside. But Comolli travels to Marion in France, accused of Julie's murder. <br /> <br /> "La Sirène du Mississippi" is a big film by director / writer François Truffaut, whose usual love story is passion, murders and love that hurts. Femme fatale Catherine Deneuve is amazing, probably on her beauty and is happy to see her face and topless scenes on the road and in the room. Jean-Paul Belmondo is very athletic, and the order he increases on the hotel wall is impressive. Catherine Deneuve makes this movie worth and gives Louis the credibility of lust and lust. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Sereia do Mississipi" ("Mississippi Mermaid")
