This movie has so many things. The most obvious is that the film may be in front of the audience and how filming can be some magic. There is also a tense relationship between China and the West, as many Chinese (apparently rightly) saw "barbarians" trying to take over and pollute their way of life. Liu even tries to keep his lifestyle on the film because he sees it disappear one day. Likewise, their Liu's inner conflict between Chinese loyalty and tradition with the Western self-determination philosophy. All of these themes have been woven quite smoothly into a single and enjoyable whole by Hu. Very enjoyable movie.
