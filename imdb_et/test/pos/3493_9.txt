Ali G's show was really amazing - she was such a silly rapper, but someone she interviewed didn't notice she was just pretending. Sasha Cohen is actually a very intelligent man who pretends to be stupid, so he can really get honest answers from people ... And it's very funny. So I didn't expect the film to be good because it all worked - there are no real people or interviews. Thus, the main point of the exhibition disappeared. But I was wrong - I laughed all the time, it was one of the funniest movies I ever saw. Of course it was stupid, but who cares if you can't brake the car battery safely, as someone said? It didn't have to be a realistic documentary ... And it's not like a show, it's going to be completely different, but that doesn't mean it's bad. When I looked, I was completely impressed, but now that some time has passed, I realized that anyway it is not so special, but it deserves another nine - at least for what it should be.
