There are a number of movies that we say must be seen twice. In most cases, this is mainly a suggestion: you still understand the movie after the first viewing, and when you look at it the second time you can help the plot twists that you just didn't notice. For Mulholland Dr, however, it is different. The sequence that worked for me was: look at it for the first time - spend the day on the internet trying to find out what it was - and then see it for the second time. Otherwise, you probably won't enjoy this movie completely. Then you begin to realize that this piece is brilliant, the work of the camera is stunning and the aftertaste is followed by you for weeks. <br /> <br /> 9/10
