Very strange, disturbing, but intriguing film. I don't think I should ever see what a person can do with his ass, and I doubt I'd ever see it. This means that there are many amusements, such as taking divine Jayne Mansfield's classic walk "The girl can't help it" and put the meat in the grocery store. The sensation is very similar to that of Russ Meyer. In general, bad action is a significant exception to divine.
