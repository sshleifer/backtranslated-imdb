For the first time I saw this movie flying between Guangzhou, China and Los Angeles. It was a real hoot and made the trip a lot less inconvenient than a normal 10-hour flight. I tried to find a copy of it without success until I discovered a copy on eBay. Having been watching it twice now, I recommend it as good entertainment. My only real criticism is that the choice of subtitles for English translation is a sub-parameter according to the usual standards. Moreover, the subtitles are small or small, too often mixing the movie and often moving too fast to read well.
