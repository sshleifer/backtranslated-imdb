This is definitely one of the most frightening and spell-binding movies ever made. You're stuck in the movie from start to finish. Even if there are some holes in the plot, it remains exciting for the final display. In addition, "8 MM" and "Peeping Tom" is one of the best films "Snuff Movies", which is our cultural taboo subject. If you like SCREAM Trilogy, you probably love it.
