I find myself happy that I was able to watch a wonderful movie with two wonderful actors. "Kramer vs Kramer" was great for me because I think I could be involved. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, my parents are divorced. Although I was older than Billy in this movie, I felt her pain and confusion. The worst are the two parents with whom you thought you were happy and hate each other. Through this movie, I think it made me realize that my parents are people, and they had so much pain as my sister and I did. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie, it was a good one. Yes, it's dated and Meryl and Dustin are very young. But I would recommend it to many people because I think most of them may be somehow related. Funny, sad, happy and alleviating moments that these great actors are terribly taking away. It's a good movie and deserves more credit than 7.5. <br /> <br /> 9/10
