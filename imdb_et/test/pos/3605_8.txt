Captain Corell's mandolin is not an Oscar competitor, but it was pretty good. I have to admit that Mrs Cruz can really act. He's doing very good results. In fact, he's making our boyfriend Tom Drama. John Hurt was great as usual. Nicholas Cage seemed to enjoy himself. I bet he felt he was going back to his roots like Italian. But I learned something. Another chapter in the horrors of Nazi Germany, where many Italian soloists killed at a time when they abandoned their allies and surrender to Germany.
