The creative team of Jim Abraham, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker were rooted in Madison, Wisconsin, an improvisation theater, I believe it was. They had a group called "Kentucky Fried Theater" (or something similar.) They put a bunch of their bundles of celluloids like "KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE" (1977), long, uneven, sophisticated, and really funny. > <br /> They followed the very popular AIRPLANE! (1980), which really put them on the map. In it, they took Robert Stack and (especially) Leslie Nielsen's well-known veteran artists, and put them in prominent roles in the parody of every film cliché from the time of John Wayne's (Batjac) THE HIGH production AND Mighty (1954). * Money-filled pockets, which have now been noticed, were contracted by the trio to the Pramount Television and the American Broadcasting Company's TV network to make almost an hour of comedy about an almost countless police crime drama. has come and gone on our television screens over the years. Recalling the fine work done by Mr Leslie Nielsen on AIRPLANE, he was cast into the lead. <br /> <br /> Sgt / Lt / Captain Frank Drebbin (The rank-setting switch is one of their comics, led a large number of consecutive punches, eyesight, non-organizers and overcrowded police / crime clichés. All of them were assembled by some seemingly standard scripts This is accompanied by an overly dramatic opening, which is in contradiction with visual printed information, and they were always used to provide episode titles, where voice and printed titles never responded. <br /> <br /> They had a great musical score, which is a bit exaggerated , but would have passed the theme and random music in a straight drama. The music score, openings, and forms, divided into I, II, Epilogue, and similar episodes, were all part of the obvious but hearty QM ribbing (Quinn Martin) productions. the same announcer as a real QM) <br /> <br /> One thing that wasn't too short of the series was the technically expanded audience laughing. ss whom they certainly did not need any counterfeit. The nature of the fraud was that it required close and almost indivisible attention from the viewer and proved to be the main cause of the collapse of POLICE SQUAD. <br /> <br /> With a series of cancellations, ABC CEO explained that episodes "... called the viewer's attention too much." So, isn't that what one would want? <br /> <br /> So after only 6 wonderfully crafty, fun episodes, serial number reversals, POLICE SQUAD! was born, and NAKED GUN was born with a trilogy made in a big screen movie house. Again, they did quite well in Box Office. Well, TV loss is Cinema's profit, thanks to Mr Idiot TV Exec! <br /> <br /> * HIGH AND HIGH is produced by Duke's own Batjac Productions and released by Warner Brothers. It was not possible to use it for several years and finally, the Wayne family brought it to television and video.
