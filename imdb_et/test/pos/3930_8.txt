I didn't expect this movie much when I went to the theater, but I had been waiting for it for years. All in all, it was pretty good! Chad Michael Murray was pretty good, I thought he was going to be another Chris Flynn's wrong turn, but I was wrong. Elisha Cuthbert was also good, but the best results have to go to Brian Van Holt. He played too bad a boy, thinking he was sick, sadistic and very cruel. The story between the brothers was good, plus I liked how no killing took place until about 40 minutes of the movie. It gave you time to choose the character you wanted to live in and what you wanted to die for. Jon Abrahams was pretty good at CMM's best buds. I liked how Chad shouted when he found him dead, it was better when he was, "Whatever my friend is dead who cares". It showed how he really cares. So it was at all a divine goddess who had some great influences. Bravo!
