In the early scene, Luca (David Pasquesi) and James (Jeff Garlin) go to Chicago's neighborhood street, admiring the Bucolic architecture, when a woman who is angry in French on a mobile phone hates them, encouraging James to say, "Nothing is hotter than an angry French woman." Some blocks later pass by the old Filipino woman, who is also angry, claiming a mobile phone, and Luca notes that this is a reference, "there is nothing hotter than angry, elderly Filipino woman." <br /> <br /> Humor Jeff Garlinis, which I want someone to cook with cheese, is best characterized by the word quotidian. The film is a conversation. We could also listen. Instead of going out to the antics, the film relies on the lack of character and the curiosity of people to laugh. Although not innovative, it is far from banal, and even if James sees himself as unpleasant, we know that he is quite average and it can withstand him. <br /> <br /> Self-development is the main theme of the film. Sarah Silverman, who plays Beth, is a great catalyst for change; he revives James and reminds him to live a better life. However, achieving an idyllic dream is not the end of these signs, but rather something simpler: that they may choose what pieces they live there, what they love, to keep themselves at least enough to continue. > <br /> The film's lifetime can be suppressed because it may forget to connect with your audience. I want somebody to eat cheese, to be subtle and cunning, and although its morale may not be inspiring, it is still resonant. This is a low key comedy, but it will stay with you.
