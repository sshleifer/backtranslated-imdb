Certainly, this film, which would not transform the industry or introduce new film making techniques, is a very beautiful and powerful production. It's amazing that we can enjoy it today in a great quality DVD - most of the viewers probably saw a black-and-white copy about 100 years ago because the tinted de luxe edition of the template was only available on the best theaters. Even if you don't know the movie or its theme, you can't just marvel at a copy of Image Entertainment (along with another pearl, a cross from a migrant in 1912). It's almost impossible to see a movie that is over a century old but with so little damage. Stencil dyeing was very effective and the colors are crisp and well defined compared to the occasional blurry and dirty images of the colored film. Within the limits of filmed filmmaking, known already in 1902, when filming began, the static nature of scenes can be considered almost deliberate, meditative and festive today. The tablets are constantly moving into a paste, so the film is never annoying. This film may not be fascinated by the work of cinematography, but it is for sure the work of academic, picturesque art. If you are a religious person, the mystery adds significantly to the fact that you look at people who have played anonymous, long-standing characters. Seeing the right thing for Christmas or fasting. <br /> <br /> P.S: I have marked "contains spoiler" for fun only. As you can see, I'm not over.
