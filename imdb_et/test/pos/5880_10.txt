I was blown when I saw "The Best Years of Our Life". Actor, Script and Master William Wyler's Direction (Best Director Winner 1946) is brilliant. <br /> <br /> This movie is about three WWII veterans who come home from war and are reunited with their loved ones, but you have to deal with the difficulty of coming home from war. <br /> <br /> The first man Al Stephenson (played by Fredric March as his Oscar winner) comes home to find his wife Millie (played by Myrna Loy) and the kids Peggy and Rob (played by Teresa Wright and Michael Hall) are more grown and different than before the war. <br /> <br /> Another man Fred Derry (playing Dana Andrews) must find a good job and come home to a woman who was only 20 days before marriage. He starts to find out that he is not the same. <br /> <br /> Homer (played by Harold Russell in his Oscar winning role) has lost his hands in war and has to deal with his family and groom Wilma (played by Cathy O'Donnell) in response to the hooks he has in his hands. <br /> <br /> All these men and their families have been reunited in the film in different scenes. The stories of these men are intertwined beautifully. <br /> <br /> This movie really defines "classical" meaning. This unforgettable drama (winner of the best picture of 1946) is a movie that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> If I was asked to choose a favorite movie, it would be! <br /> <br /> Out of 10 so I'll give "The Best Years of Our Life" 10. <br /> <br /> So next time you go to your local video store, rent this movie you don't regret it! <br /> <br /> NOT a good family film about undesirable material.
