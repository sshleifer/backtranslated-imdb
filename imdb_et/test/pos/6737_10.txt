I love this movie. The cast was all very different when depicting these different characters. Judith Ivey was so well represented that he was a weak, frightening, addictive person who was passive aggressive in his complaint and self-related character, that it was a relief to see the character's metamorphosis. Blythe Danner was in the role of a somewhat decisive Jewish mother, a dedicated woman and a loving nurse. Jonathon Silmerman, Bob Dishy, ​​Stacey Glick and Lisa Walz did their job just as well. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy movies related to passing through difficult times without losing your sense of humor and hope, you'll love this movie.
