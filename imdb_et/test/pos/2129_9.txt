It is a beautifully made story with real music, a lot of dancing, a lot of great sister / little sister communication (almost all positive) and many wishes. There are funny moments that older children and adults enjoy, for example, when King Randolph shouts, "They're just shoes! Are they not?" And the delicate moments, such as Princess Genevieve after the younger sister Lacey, after the gap. <br /> <br /> Animation may not be as good as Disney, but it is still very good. Facial expressions are nuanced, especially for Genevieve, King Randolph, Duke Rowena, and his servant Derek, and little Princess Lacey. My only animation is in dance series, where dancing princesses become absolute copies of each other without a slight deviation - even the three youngest copies of the dance stages are perfect. I would have liked to see a little more individualism dance, given that these girls are not professional ballerinas or choir dancers. <br /> <br /> The story resolution is solved wisely to get rid of misery without actually hurting him. The story of the guards is made violence and the villainess monkey means other animals of the animals. <br /> <br /> My 4-year-old daughter loves this movie and has been watching it repeatedly, and I've found she has a fairly acceptable look.
