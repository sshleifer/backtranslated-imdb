In the 1980s, patriotism was, and in some cases, Jingoism was quite high. "Can we win this time" a well-known line from Rambo: The first part of blood II can almost sum up how many people felt at that time. The need for the style of the film they grew up, the flat balls on the wall "we are good, your bad ... now we beat up and go home" Although Rambo, Rocky and mostly Top Gun seemed more focused on attracting an older crowd. Iron Eagle went straight to the kids. The Canadian writer and director Sidney J. Furie highlights everything you love and hate during this time. Trouser Rings are attacking the 80's anthems (never say die, Roma roads, etc.) over the top and sometimes almost incredible adventure. Iron Eagle succeeded for one reason ... it was F.U.N - Fun. It's a movie type that can be turned on and sit and enjoy all the ridiculous 80-year-old moments. You don't have to think about whether this can really happen, or if the actor is truly credible, it's just fun ... and that's all you really want to ask in this type of movie ...
