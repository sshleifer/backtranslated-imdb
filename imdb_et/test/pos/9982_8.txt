Both Disney and Bill Paxton did a great job of conveying the story that is actually based. You don't have to play golf to understand the story of a man who is fighting over the odds. It could have been based on any sport or just about any other competition related to Golf. The only problem I have with the story is that I would have liked to see that every major character was a little deeper, especially. Mr. Ouimet. Francis Ouimet is a typical young man of his time, a centuries-old American era, where "class lines" are well-defined and trouble is for anyone who wants to rise above his "class". I did some historical research and my biggest question was satisfied. Although the situations are somewhat different than those depicted on the film, I came up with a sense of content. I enjoyed this movie thoroughly, I believe that too.
