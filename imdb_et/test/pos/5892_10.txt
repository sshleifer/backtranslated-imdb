The best years of our lives are the film that slipped under my radar for years - I had heard about it, but I never had the chance to watch it. Thanks to TCM On Demand, I was able to view it uncut and commercially free. <br /> <br /> What surprised me about this movie was how fast it was after the war. The film honestly deals with wounded people both physically and mentally. It drives nicely to encompass almost all war experiences within three characters. <br /> <br /> We have an Air Force Officer who was a veteran of the early European bombing campaign. Due to the frightening friction of the bombing teams, the air forces at that time enjoyed a good reputation for crowding out officials who quickly rushed over the ranks. That's what happened to the companion who went from civilian soda to jerk to his B-17 captain and bombarder. He also suffers from PTSD, called "battle fatigue". <br /> <br /> We have an army of non-com who served in the Pacific region and suffered the horrors of this campaign. His story is the opposite of the air force's colleague that he goes from a prestigious job to a banker to the humble work of the army and rises to a sergeant. It is clear from his sleeves that he is the highest level of sergeants, but he is still at the forefront. <br /> <br /> Finally, we have a naval sailor who is part of a faceless auxiliary. commonly referred to as REMFs (rear Echelon MFers) on the line. Ironically, he wears the worst physical wounds when he works as a mechanic on a naval ship, his ship is hit, probably a kamikaze and has sunk 400 lives. He pulls out of the water, but his ill-burned hands are amputated and replaced with prosthesis. <br /> <br /> BYOOL talks about how these three meet on the airplane to which they have come home, and how they correct what is most impressive about this movie, despite the obvious problems facing the three main characters it never shoots melodrama. The navy boy, played by the real amputee, is placed in situations where we may feel sorry for him, but the script doesn't let us feel that emotion. The Army Sergeant is obviously an alcoholic and the story points to it, but it never lives. The Air Force Captain is fighting for the loss of status when he is forced to return to the drug store he soda jerked (now bought by a big chain) and takes a humiliating job to support his ungrateful and dishonest woman. The script allows all these characters to have many opportunities for dramatic excellence in their situation, but it will avoid it properly. But for a too dramatic score, the director has obviously used it. <br /> <br /> In a scene that represents the whole movie, the army sergeant (Frederic March) develops a daughter with his father and mother in relation to the air force captain. Despite marriage, they are in love and have decided to break a marriage that is obviously disturbed. Now we have seen thousands of typical scenes where the father despises angry and the daughter tears into her room, stuck in the door and falls to bed. Later, her mother appears, the daughter of the consoles, and offers the words of mother's wisdom and everyone is happily ever after. <br /> <br /> BYOOL plays this scene in a completely different way than the clich√© described above. Of course, the conversation is warmed up, but all parties are reasonable, and there is a serious and timeless debate about the nature of the relationship that has some of the best dialogue I've seen. <br /> <br /> Finally, BYOOL is a very satisfying film with honest performances cast all over. Technically, it is a well-captured, editing and cinematic frame, but never overshadowed by a thrilling narrative. Despite a score that is cliche and too dramatic, I give this film the highest rating it deserves
