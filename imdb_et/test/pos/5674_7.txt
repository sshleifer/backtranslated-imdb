"Black Water" is a film that surprisingly surprised me and surely exceeded my initial expectations. "Black Water" is really a very well structured, unpredictable, exciting, well-managed, and very creepy movie. The plot is actually somewhat original and will definitely keep you interesting. One thing I love about this film is the direction, because it is mainly how it exceeded my initial expectations. My initial expectations for "Black Water" were that it was crappily made, acted, directed, pace and boring film. It wasn't really. Well, by acting, there's nothing to praise because there were times when I feel they didn't show enough emotions, and there are some lines that feel just that scripted. But I love the direction because all its shots seem predictable, but not. As you look at it, it says that the camera gets a slow picture of the water, and it goes quite well, you're like a croc attack. But the croc attacks are very unpredictable (which was bad for me, who doesn't do much about the movies) and it makes you jump. Plus I just love being one of those horror movies that don't rely on a sudden high sound pressure to jump you, but a real movie. I also like how the story of the people who are trapped in these trees has seemed very real and definitely keep their eyes on the screen. I have to say that I didn't think the 20-minute opening was well done, and I think they made the boat a little harder than it would have been in real life. Plus I didn't like how they tried their absolute best so that the characters would be completely hopeless when it wasn't. I just don't think some of the characters' actions were realistic. For example, I wouldn't have gone near the water knowing that it was a crocodile, not to mention a murderer. But these problems aren't really big and I still had the chance to enjoy the movie. All in all, the films are better, but the fear films of the animal attack (genre that I can easily scare) are one of the best examples. And sure it's not perfect, but that doesn't mean it's not worth it.
