This year's Royal Rumble wasn't really bad, but last year was definitely better. <br /> <br /> FIRST NOTE MICHAELS VS. EDGE Although this game was too long, it was still fine. Edge wins Shawn Michaels after using the ropes. 4/10 <br /> <br /> THE SECOND MATCH-VS IN THE SPECIFIC MARKET OF HEIDENREICH I do not like Casket matches, this game was boring and sloppy, but finally it rose at a pace when Undertaker created a tombstone and then rolled into Heidenreich's fight. 4/10 <br /> <br /> THIRD MATCH- JBL VS. KURT ANGLE VS. BIG SHOW IN TRIPLE-THREAT MATCH FOR WWE WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP It's not a bad triple threat. Too bad JBL wins again to maintain its title after nailing the dress ring on the corner of hell to win. 5/10 <br /> <br /> FOUR MATCH- RANDY ORTON VS. TRIPLE H WORLD FOR HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP A great game for these two men, the match was a bit sloppy, but it was still good and it was getting to the end. Although Orton lost the game, it was fast and fast at the end. HHH shifts the generation of Orton to win its world title. 5/10 <br /> <br /> LATEST MATERIAL - ROYAL RUMBLE This was the cool Royal Rumble {Every Royal Rumble is good}. After all 30 men had entered, the last four Rumble superstars were Price, Edge, Mysterio & Batista. Edge was able to get out of Mysterio, later Batista & Cena out of Edge. It was now up to Hind & Batista. First, after F-U rolled back, Batista went to Batista's bomb, but suddenly both men broke out. After a controversial decision & Mr McMahon is doing a round to settle the matter. The match was resumed when Batista & Cena fought against it, but Batista got a better price, laughed back-buster and kicked out to win the Royal Rumble of 2005 and go on to Wrestlemania 21. . 10/10 It was very good for Royal Rumble, but last year's peak is always in the history of Royal Rumble. <br /> <br /> Generally: I give it 8/10 & B +
