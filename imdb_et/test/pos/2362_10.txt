Two hard luck, but insidious women decide to act like HAVANA WIDOWS, driving to Cuba to meet and rob abundant gentlemen ... <br /> <br /> It was the ephemeral comic frippery that the studios made quite easily in the 1930s. Well done and very enjoyable, the target groups of depression didn't seem to be popular enough, funny photodrames. Joan Blondell & Glenda Farrell is perfectly cast as frantic, fast-talking women who go a little long to make some dishonest dough. Though Joan receives both top-notch bills and romantic scenes, both gals are as talented and observable as they are proud. <br /> <br /> Handsome Lyle Talbot plays Joan's constant defendant, but has been given relatively little to do. Chubby, cherubic Guy Kibbee appears as a target for girls. Whether he's waking up to find himself in the wrong bed, or being put on a Cuban hacienda roof in his long heaps, he's just as fun. Behind him is the rank of actor rank - Allen Jenkins, Frank McHugh, Ruth Donnelly, Hobart Cavanaugh, Maude Eburne, Dewey Robinson. James Murray as a counterfeit banknote with counterfeit checks. This very talented actor was pulled out from the vague to celebrate King Vidor THE CROWD (1928), one of the most prestigious films of the quieter era. Hopes were high for a great career, but his fame dazzled the sound with pictures quickly. After a long series of small roles and small parts, broke and poverty, his life ended in New York River waters in 1936. He was only 35 years old. <br /> <br /> Though the stars of the first star, Joan Blondell (1906-1979) & Glenda Farrell (1904-1971), revived Warner Bros's films in the 1930s, especially in the eighth place they appeared. Whether you are playing gold miners or working girls, reporters or secretaries, these blonde and brown women were almost always suitable for any leading person with whom you were lucky enough to share equal billing with them. With Wisecrack or glance, their characters showed they were ready to accept the world - and every person in it. Never was it as bad as Paramount's Mae West that you always had the feeling that they were as tough as they used their strength to protect vulnerable hearts, ready to break the right man. Although many of the seven decades of performances can be fast or mature today, these two wonderful women are still stubborn.
