I'm not an American, but meatballs still really hit me. Maybe because it's a sweet, sweet movie. Watching it today, I have been sentimental for some time because I can't really put my finger on and the place I can't remember. <br /> <br /> Meatballs are just a great movie. It reminds me of innocent days when nothing is really important and something was possible. <br /> <br /> If you read this, you probably know what I mean. <br /> <br /> All I can say about what I have already said is that meatballs have to be even more nostalgic than you are an American. <br /> <br /> I think you know what I mean.
