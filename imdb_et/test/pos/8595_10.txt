This movie is the best movie I've seen for a long time. It is also the best film used to tell history through drama, without speculation, such as JFK, Nixon or Hoffa. It skilfully depicts Belgium's links with Congo. It also easily reveals to us the European and American troops that were under Congolese power today. The film was certainly right in the United States, the murder of Lumumba. This movie can never be made in the US against a US film that rarely criticizes imperialism and murder. (Save Stone's JFK) This also allows us to deal with the problems of Congo's internal conflict between Lumumba, Mobutu and Katanga. We see how fragile states sit in the creation of new governments when their history is colonizing and those who were colonizers continue to pull the power and power strings. Eriq Ebouaney is a great movie for Lumum. Great is cast and they will draw you into the climate of Congo during this time. <br /> <br /> Again, this is a must-see for those who love the right historical background. See my notes on Quilombo.
