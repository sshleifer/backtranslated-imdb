It's worth looking at Reader digest. Or the time when it was the original source of the article, which was the supposed inspiration of Man Ratnam for making this masterpiece. Based on a true story of an adopted girl who is looking for her biological parents, Mr Ratnam paints a classic that rages as much as it attacks, so much as it strikes and preaches as much as it does. <br /> Where does one start? Growing darkness, preceded by fresh contradictions in northern Sri Lanka? A chaotic family led by a firebrand engineer and 3 divinely naughty children? Or is it a dark area where reality goes beyond comfort and becomes a monster of terrible and evil events and ideologies? Regardless of how you look at it, this movie is worth your collection if you like the dramas that Man Ratnam likes. <br /> <br /> Mr. Ratnam is a past master who mixes fictitious stories in real events and in this movie, rejects the class to adjust two real stories to one. I'm not going to the story because it's better to see than read. But what I mean is the effect that I had and why the simple but inexhaustible force called hope is not destroyed in the world of warfare. <br /> <br /> Innocence, in terms of purity, cannot understand the complex desires of adult decadence and greed. Nor does it recognize the danger if it involves an acute decision to seek what he wants. This is the kind of innocence that drives Amudha to seek out his biological parents, despite warnings that they may lose the roof of civil war. When Amudha has lived a terrorizing experience to talk to a physically challenged person to understand that he is a more deadly deadly entity, Amudha stays with his cause, tearing down the resistance of his goodwill. And finally, when the twin meets, mother and daughter, reunion is so tense that even a temperamental adoptive is a tear. A R Rahman's bright background point is the next scene that blends even with the most heart: this is a list of questions Amudha has to ask about her biological mother. The child discovers his mother, who is alive in the body, but has lost the spirit, both dramatically and afterwards. What an impressive notion that he has no hope of staying with him who carried him makes Amudha to his adoptive parent what this movie's title means: the peck is cheek. <br /> <br /> Trailer PS Keerthana has clearly watched the trail. Mr. Ratnam has a gift that gives outstanding performances from little-known children's artists, but this should not take Keerthana away from his award-winning achievements. With the support of Madhavan (Thiru), Simran (Indira) and the amazing Nandita Dase (Shyama), she shines scenes in almost every scene she is. Music may not be as memorable as other Rahman offers. did not stop him for another national award for best music. "Vellai Pookal" is as much as necessary to enchant human life as it is for nature. Dialogues are top-notch (choose the exchange rate from Amudha and Indira, just after the revelation that he is not Indira's biological daughter) and cinematography, great. <br /> <br /> This movie is a clear statement to bring down weapons as much as it is to respect people's lives and expressions. Don't judge it as a film making lesson; you will lose only one of the best Man Ratnam-A R Rahman.
