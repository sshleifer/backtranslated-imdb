Harold Lloyd has often overlooked the fact that he was an actor. Unlike Chaplin and Keaton, Lloyd had no background in Vaudeville / Music Hall and wasn't a natural comedian. He came to Hollywood to act; and he discovered that he had the skills to be funny - first the shorts, the functions. He named himself "Lonesome Luke", an attacker on Chaplin; Lloyd found the "eyeglass", which made him an American boy rather than a grotesque, found Lloyd his step and his films became the best of the quiet era. <br /> <br /> He developed his reputation for some of the shorts' "cruel" and maintained it in some of his best films ("Safety Last", "Heaven's Sake", "Girl Shy"). He was more popular than Chaplin or Keaton during the twenties and he became very rich before the sound. <br /> <br /> The first sound films were often disasters. To get the most out of your "sound", many movies were used in too many films. <br /> <br /> Lloyd's ability to act for two decades was focused on the silent. He had no bad voice; his high pitch fit his "glasses" character. And his sound films were not legendary catastrophes. Still, the silent films were lifted to high art (especially to Lloyd, which was not budgeted and well-designed); when talking, the movies had to learn again and they made some mistakes. <br /> <br /> Although he tried to move around and embrace sound at times, Lloyd's best bits were his early (too talkative) speeches. still visual - like the movie movie crazy, where he seems to be driving a little in the car, but he actually drove the bike. <br /> <br /> Trying to reuse bold words that made him famous as he did "Feet First" was wrong. (In "Safety Last", his best film and what's worth or not, Lloyd's box was "brutally comic", he played a decisive young man climbing up. , it was obviously frightened, but his fear added humor, he came to the "Feet First" randomly into an insecure building, his desperate help diminished. His character was pathetic and tragic, an attempt to save his neck - perhaps an exact statement from the 1930s, but not amusing). <br /> <br /> Harold Lloyd was no earlier than some Wacky Norma Desmond. He received the sound and tried to take his films in different directions, growing and changing with the industry. When "Feet First" failed, he left the brutal activity and gave a "Movie Crazy" satire to the talking film industry. Just as he had to mark many films such as the Lonesome Luke movie before shooting his place in the film history, he tried to sound the sound he'd done with The Catspaw in a number of ways. <br /> <br /> "Catspawis" plays a missionary son grown in China, who is inadvertently chosen as mayor for corrupt political interests. When he discovers the truth, he sets himself the task of cleaning the city. Only in his forties, Lloyd could still act against a young man. <br /> <br /> But The Catspaw had another box-office failure and Lloyd made three more films, including The Milky Way. His main competitors were still silent films in Chaplin and Keaton was hopelessly badly guided. "The Catspaw" and "The Milky Way" suggest that Lloyd could have been a good comedy if he was a little younger, or if the audience had questioned him after his early sound fiasco. <br /> <br /> Although the film has unfairly cleaned the city of Lloyd's character, it is suitable for him. Lloyd wanted to frighten his audience in his short days and The Catspaw's climax surprisingly reached it again; until the trick has appeared, it looks tough and then laughs. <br /> <br /> Looking at your time as a product, The Catspaw is charming and funny. Very well written sound comedy, well-acted by Lloyd. Directed by Sam Taylor, this curious mix of drama and strange humor makes it almost like the comedy of Frank Capra or Preston Sturges.
