Hey now, I've never made my eyes manga comic, but probably this movie is based on one. Ah, it's life. Anyway, it's pretty strange to say, movie, because things that are literally out of control of a small Japanese city. People have become obsessed with uzumaki (spiral) and this young girl looks at the snip of her friend's father with a video tape and later in the film people start to get into action? It also seems that this boy's father becomes so obsessed that he somehow commits suicide in a home appliance. Here are some strange humor that could be at home on Tim Burton's film, but there are some nastiness & gore just like the Japanese can do justice to. As with many Japanese films, the end is over, and has anything been solved? Well, not in my mind, it wasn't. There are some tips on why this is all happening, but they are not explored and there is a lot left to imagination or otherwise it was not considered important. However, there are many exciting things to look out for and if you are not obsessed with anything that is perfectly reasonable, it is worth it because it is just so original and weird. My favorite was Dad with spinning collectives. 8 stars out of 10.
