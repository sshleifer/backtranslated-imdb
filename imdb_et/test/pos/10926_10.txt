I've been watching many short films of my day. Often I find that they are too tight (too much information is thrown into the viewer in the short time they have to run), too "artistic" or lack of a clear vision. I can't say any of these things to Starcrossed. In this review I will make every effort to avoid dramatic spoilers, but I also expect the reader to understand that the subject of this film is a brotherly incest. <br /> <br /> Like any short film, the story is quite simple, simple and easy to digest. It is clear that the film is trying to shine the light of taboos in today's society. This film succeeds in every sense. Within fifteen minutes I found myself feeling. Only in a small dialogue will the viewer be pulled quickly into the most personal moments and thoughts of the crossed brothers of these stars. <br /> <br /> A very close relationship with your early childhood scene is the brothers have. When the film progresses to the next scene to this day, great actors and honest, cordial performances remind the viewer that love can come from the most unexpected and toughest. As the relationship progresses, the beginner's feeling that the beginner's feeling is quickly replaced by compassion and emotional stress, because the viewer suddenly realizes that only one possible solution is possible. And the consequences of this resolution are heart-shaped. <br /> <br /> Anyone with an open mind will do well to watch the movie and receive that message. If nothing else, it will boldly and honestly challenge the viewer to look at some of our deepest beliefs about a shameful and secret taboo. Although the film is only 15 minutes long, it will resonate in the viewer long after the credit rolls. This is perhaps my favorite short film I've ever seen. I can't recommend it enough.
