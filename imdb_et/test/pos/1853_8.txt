When I saw the trailer of this movie, I said aloud that someone especially "this movie goes on a bomb." I also said about MATRIX and see what happened there. Now, I'm not a guru of the office in any stretching, but I usually have a pretty good gut about what's good and what's really going on. In this case, I was blinded to my complete and complete apathy towards David Duchovney. Let me put it on a different path: I don't like her as a human being (from what I read in her interview, she is incredibly pre-Madonna and she's full of herself given that everyone has done X-Files) or an actor. GOD was really a bad film, but he had to figure out that, for some reason, he deserved a big bill on the big screen. But I am happy to say that although these things may be true for the human being, Return To Me is a joyful one and its heart is in the right place. Bonnie Hunt has led a beautiful story and has spoken it in class and grace. This is one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen, and although it may seem a little sad and maudlin in my room, it gives her a chance and you're hooked. <br /> <br /> It must be said (and it hurts me to do it) that the reason why the film works so well is the story and the cast. Duchovney and Driver are so wonderful here and believe that I wanted to cry with them honestly. There is one particularly powerful scene when Duchovney comes home after his wife's death and falls to the floor of her house. As always, the family dog ​​sees the door to wait for his wife to go in. He does not and his shirt collar is still stained with blood, says Rob (Duchovney) to him that he will never come home. He then calls the dog and they seem to cry together. The dog lets you dig and then shouts Rob. And this is one of the most realistic pain moments I've seen in any character of any movie. You may feel your pain and forgot that I look at an actor I usually do not like, and I felt like I was looking at someone I knew would lose his beloved loss. These are powerful things. <br /> <br /> Another strength of the film is the support form. Bonnie Hunt has combined Irish and Italian characters in an ethnic melting pot with a common bond. They share a pub called O'Reilley Italian Pub. It's all a delicious name. And by moving the diameters of opposing cultures, Carol O'Connor and Robert Loggia. These are two proud older men who love their homeland but love their granddaughter and niece (I think it is). And this is the character that Minnie Driver plays. This scenario is a mature comedy and Hunt won't miss anything here. <br /> <br /> Bonnie Hunt and James Belushi also share some funny moments together when a middle-aged couple and Belushi get to the top if they accept humility gracefully and show their abundance of belly laughs. With her family of three or four children, she and her wife have very little time for quality time. And again, Hunt starts with this great elegance. <br /> <br /> This is a great story of finding true love, knowing how happy you are with true love and the power of friendship and family. Back to me is wonderful romance and although I don't have much admiration for David Duchovney, I have to admit that he was perfect in this role and I couldn't imagine anyone else playing his character. She was sensitive and plausible, and the film was good for her, not just for her, but definitely added to taste. <br /> <br /> If you're strange with a good romance and you want a good shout, it's your movie. <br /> <br /> In 8.5 out of 10, I see something that Bonnie Hunt puts under the leadership of the director.
