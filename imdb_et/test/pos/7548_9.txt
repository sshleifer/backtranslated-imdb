So Udo Kier earned nine bucks and free food for it, so it's a victory and in itself. More importantly, this film tells a very interesting story about what rescue worker Demeter is attacking. I should warn you, I have to bounce really fast through this review, so it's put up. First things first. Coolio plays a man named 187. 187 likes drugs. 187 finds that there are a bunch of sauces on board and ... now I do not know anything about the future, but maybe they smuggle drugs into the sage. Not to say that this was the most crazy thing in this movie. Later, the vampire gets out of its fog coffin and then real fun begins. First, even though this film has the word Dracula, it is not really the movie. I have a theory. In the blue you can see that the rescue ship is leaving without them. My theory is that Dracula was on board with his slowed brother Orlock. Dracula told Orlock he would be back right away. Dracula got hell out of this movie before seeing Orlock leave to play the vampire within six minutes of being in the movie. The best part of this movie and for those who have seen it, you know what I say, after the birth of 187, embraced everything. He has this tremendous monologue on ejaculation in different parts of Elika's body and ... in other super-cool things. Coolio, seriously you are the best thing. <br /> <br /> There are other things in this movie as well. As Casper Van Dean gets the job. Orlock screams a lot and loses his hand and then we lose him MOVIE REST. And I really thank God. We find that Erika's character is a police bot. As the film ends, it turns out that the ship is in the sun. The police bot and another surviving character are doomed. Rather, avoiding certain death by the Erika police bot shows that he is also a whore and they decide to screw each other up and die. Before they die in the sun, they die without cause, yes, that's right ... their ship blows without real reason. <br /> <br /> This movie got an excellent rating for one reason, Coolio. My god, when they gave the academic prize to the black rapper, he would be the first to get it. The only reason it didn't get a perfect ten is that there was no nudity. Now I know what your thinking is, how the film can be judged, whether the ladies show their goods or not. Well simple. Such a film requires a lot of it. This part of the process. Gore, gore, monsters, nudity, gore, end of movie end. It's a formula. It had some gore, the monster was fantastic because he sucked so hard that he really made us shut off the camera. It was attentive to him and I respect it. Nudity, not a fall, although there was a long conversation ... well seeing the above statement and like shock / twisting ... I certainly didn't see the end. It counts. I hope Hollywood doesn't think Coolio gave this movie to everyone and nothing left. He deserves more work. Well, up to Dracula 4000, I'm out.
