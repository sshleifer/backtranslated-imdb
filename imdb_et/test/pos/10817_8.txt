I found this library book and the jacket notes seemed to be interesting: a black comedy set in France in 1940 as the Germans march. aisle ?? ") But this is not! It is a smart, original, pausing and funny movie. I don't remember seeing anything like that? Foreign or US that the writer / director can find humor when we know a part of the result (Germans occupy France for four years It is remarkable. Because it does this with such a charm, it is part of joy. What starts with black comedy and fluff, even a couple of serious moments? including the "heavy water" cache (which was part of the original A-bomb research) and the quick history 101 an introduction to the beginning of the co-operative Vichy's government, which led southern France to a large extent to the German occupation. * But don't let that scare you: the film itself is funny, charming and romantic and runs on a permanent clip. <br /> <br /> One of the best things are the combination of actors we have seen many times (Adjani and Depardieu) and others we have never heard of before. but especially Derang√®re. According to IMDb, was he ten films before that? but he also won Cesar for his role as "the most promising actor", so apparently he wasn't even well known in France. Is it a combination of romantic lead and comics? and it makes it all so easy. Cary Grant can be reminded of "Baby up up" and "Arsenic and Old Lace"? it is difficult for the film to do comedy because the risks are great, the actor can come out. But Grant pulled it away charmingly, and that man does. I think we will hear more about him in the future. <br /> <br /> Do you really like this movie for everyone? there is little violence, though nothing can be seen on TV every day. But if you're something original, you may feel that you've seen it, that you've discovered cinema. <br /> <br /> * "Spoiler" in this comment.
