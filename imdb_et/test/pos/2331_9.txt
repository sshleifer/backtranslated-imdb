Surprisingly good and fast-minded adventure with Kelsey Grammer (supposedly in his first lead) as a normal naval sub-commander who wants to lead his nuclear region; he has earned it by competing against the US Navy in several war games with untested, questionable and loving men (and also with a woman). <br /> <br /> Director David S. Ward ("Major League") and his writers have created a hysterically smart and surprising comedy that tries to make the movie easy to understand, which they do quite well. Secondly, in addition to Grammer's character, most of the crew gives the movie humor, which is treated with a double-edged sword. Three of the most supportive cast members - Harland Williams, Toby Huss and Rob Schneider - offer more fun scenes that include strange gestures, impersonations, and their personalities. <br /> <br /> "Police Academy" or "Dirty Ten" Navy Version. What the film does is doing the job right and I liked it.
