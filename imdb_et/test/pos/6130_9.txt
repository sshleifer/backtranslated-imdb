"Pink Flamingos" is a cult class. The challenge of this film plot is Divine's supremacy as a living dirty person. "Pink Flamingos" includes some memorable repulsive scenes, such as a sex scene with a chicken and a scene where the divine eats fresh dog feces. Yeah, the film is shocking and funny at the same time, but the biggest laughs come from the actors. "Kill everything now! Repeat first-degree murder! Attorney's cannibalism! s ***! Filth is my policy! Filth is my life!" In general, I enjoyed this movie. Movies today can be found in this pearl with a heavy belly.High recommended.
