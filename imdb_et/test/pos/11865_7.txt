If you have nothing better to do, go ahead and rent this movie, it's intelligent, funny that your attention has been busy for a while. <br /> <br /> I discovered this by browsing the channels dull Sunday, it was a cable, and to see the visions I thought it was worth trying, it made me laugh and film on Sunday, nothing else on TV, it was OK. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler looks amazing in the movie, although his acting is not what I expected, it is bad action and the rest of the team liked Reba as his dr. I found an interesting vision that saw a man from sitcom "What I like you" playing a nearly gay lawyer. <br /> <br /> For Mr Goodman, I found it as always a very good result, Michael Douglas plays a small role, but his character was difficult for me to identify. <br /> <br /> It's also a good movie with the company.
