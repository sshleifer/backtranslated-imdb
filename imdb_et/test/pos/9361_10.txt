*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** In the post-war years, there must be something in the air that made the towns attractive at night. At that time, not just in America, night city films were made. One of the most remarkable was Carol Reed's Odd Man Out, an English picture of a wounded gunman, who was amazed at the streets of Belfast. In America, this movie was noir high or noon, higher midnight. <br /> <br /> Crossfire is not really a movie but he has a noir but he uses them for his own purposes, which are related to brutality. Director: Edward Dmytryk, written by John Paxton, adapted by Richard Brooks of the novel. The book concerned the murder of homosexuals; in the film, the victim has become a Jew. Although filmed as a mystery, there is little tension in the film because it is quite obvious who is the murderer early. What makes the film so watchable and beautiful is the city of Washington, D. after they were just after World War II. Unlike many night movies, Crossfire is mostly indoors: in police stations, in rooms, and in cinemas all night. Soldiers are everywhere in the movie and most are itching to restore their civilian life. But most of us we meet feel that their personalities are so well-designed to return to their old neighborhood because of their military experience; some might even be impossible. They seem to be more related to each other than something or someone else. <br /> <br /> But some men are never involved with military personnel. Murder, Monty, is one such person. He also seems to have never been united in his civilian life. He is a lonely wolf who also needs people. Desperately alone, he is a sadistic streak of mile and always needs someone who is the back of his jokes. The man he kills didn't do him any harm and was really stranger to him. But when Monty understood the man's religion, it was enough. He didn't want to kill him because his will was "just" to humiliate him and just beat him. But because he was quite drunk at that time, Monty got his fists better. This is the act that makes the story move. <br /> <br /> When the movie is structured, other characters come quickly. Monty's opposite number is Keely, another soldier who, despite Monty, and somewhat separated, has no resentment and seems to be a reasonable, even friendly man. Detective Finley, the killer of pipe smoking, is dandyish and a tad effete compared to men in uniform, but proves it more than matching with the various and mostly terrible soldiers she deals with. These roles are played by actors Robert Ryan, Mitchum and Young, who perform great performances, each with a different key. Ryan, like Monty, is tense and paranoid, always looking around for someone to choose; and may feel anxious about becoming a victim. Like Keely, Mitchum is a low key, almost non-proprietary; he never raises his voice; and it seems to have more to say more to offer than it is allowed. Jouni's activities are often criticized as too soft, but I find this to be deceptively strong and fun. He cuts the hard-boiled police stereotype and makes Finley's character a little crime prince. <br /> <br /> There are few surprises in Crossfire, although the script is sometimes surprisingly well written, even brilliant. Bookmaker Paul Kelly gives one of the best short performances in films as a friend of a woman who takes up a soldier. Kelly may or may not be her husband; and she can live with her, although she looks relaxed in her apartment. The beauty of these scenes is that nothing is explained, and this man seems to be confused about what his role was, was or should have been. In some ways, these scenes form a thematic core of the film, which is anatomical. Except for the detective, all the men in the film are drifting, purposeful and basically lost, some more serious than others. In this context, Crossfire's end-to-end preaching is about the ambiguity of the film's identity and how easily it can be lost or twisted. Men are traveling from one bar to another in this movie because they are engaged in a kind of strange marriage, their personalities associate with a common American male model. Then something happens, something is nailed. The word "Jew" or "mountainous" is mentioned, and things that suddenly become tense and the concept of identity outside the group, anyone who does not like them, becomes deeply offensive, even disgusting. Then, after the tempers flare and whatever they are mixed with, they have left or forgotten, men return to the normality of their free, non-personal group and the procedure is restored.
