This desperate, horrible horror stroke begins at the edge of the castle, located on a cliff at sea, a great place for a vampire burst and a sliding doctor (Onslow Stevens). The skin becomes a man, known as Baron Latos, in reality Count Dracula (John Carradine). He is looking for dr. Edelmann's help in treating his vampirism. Finally, a good doctor also wants to help his hunchbacked sister-assistant (Jane Adams), Wolf Man (Lon Chaney) and Frankenstein's monster (Glenn Strange). But Dracula's cheating infects the doctor's blood and he himself becomes Jekyll / Hyde's vampire. This is somewhat better than last year's "Frankenstein House", which is less episodic and more exciting visually. There's a haunting scene where Dracula tries to attract another sister (Martha O'Driscoll) to her world, where she plays "Moonlight Sonata" on the piano, which soon gives way to scary music. Director Erle Kenton uses expressive shadow and frightening music to create many sequences, including an excellent editing sequence that the studio often used in their horror functions. Two speakers are remarkable: Stevens, with his excellent voice, is initially sympathetic, then convincingly threatening. Adams, his beautiful face in a worrying contrast to his twisted body, exhibits great sin and compassion. It all ends with the climax of the characteristic slam-bang of the 1940s. A universal horror, a bit steep, with a film borrowed from "Franken's Ghost" (1942). I hope Universal will release it shortly on DVD (it was omitted from double editions).
