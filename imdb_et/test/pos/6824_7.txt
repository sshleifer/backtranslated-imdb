The problem with the film is simply that Prose of Conrad is strongly verbose and cannot be adapted to the film. Marlow's story of the story tells you the first sentence and you only see what Conrad writes. It's different in the film, you see the visual, but the description and reflection that the novel actually does is scary. But if the custom book is customized, it's good. There are exactly the same scenes that are quite genius, but they never have the same effect as in the novel. The plot in the film is enhanced and it works very interesting. References to the old Egypt were well thought out. My end, read the book and hold it, there are better movies.
