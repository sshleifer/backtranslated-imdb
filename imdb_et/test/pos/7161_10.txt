I just got back from the GLBT film festival at AMC Loews on the 34th NY. A friend told me about this movie. The target group response was very positive! Lots of good solids laughs, but also some quiet moments of realization. Top lower part of each area. A movie that makes you think and makes you realize how happy we all would be if we got back in time and lived in shame or innocence. I imagine it is near the audience's favorite prize, if not win! The most surprising thing was that the film seems to be a satire at first, and then slowly hits a real comment about the negative and sometimes violent reactions that this group began to satirize. There is no meaningful humor at the expense of one group, but a slow understanding that we would all be better if we just went back to the delicate innocence we all started.
