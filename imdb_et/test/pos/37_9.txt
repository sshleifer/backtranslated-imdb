It is by far one of the best biographical films of the recent times. I go so far as to put it up with Ray and The Aviator. This is the story of young, racial boys living in the amazing Miss Rachael called "Nanny". You fall in love with Nanny, a woman who gives everything around her. S. Epatha Merkerson brings beauty beauty and other cast members do the same. If I would praise all the actors how they played their roles, I should mention all the cast. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie is perfect for the story, almost dictates how it goes. What's more, this movie is actually fun. It didn't carry you at all, not even for a minute! <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to spend the evening at home watching a very smart, very fun and high quality movie.
