This is a forty-minute film that introduces us to a butcher who is later studied in more detail in Seul Contre Tous. In this film, his life follows the early days of 1965-1979, but he focused on the late 1970s. The first pictures are the killing of the horse, the birth of the child, the daughter of Butcher, whom we grow fast every year. Butcher (playing Philippe Nahon in both movies) is a man's bitter world. He hates many things. His anger comes up when a man attacks his autistic daughter. The butcher then makes the wrong person and finds himself in jail. <br /> <br /> This movie follows the life of a butcher right after release, then Seul Contre Tous takes over. I was watching the movies wrong, Seul Contre Tous. Try and watch this little movie first.
