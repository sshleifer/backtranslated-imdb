Opera opens up close to the eye of the birds constantly, so one of Argento's most bizarre and enjoyable features (my second favorite is actually Deep Red) begins. Sometimes giving a movie is quite absurd (lack of real worries after killing, bird attack, burnt mannequin that ends?), But that's Argento's fantastic world and if you agree, it will work. However, I do not want to completely reject these mistakes, rather that the film is more artistic than it is for them. For example, the above-mentioned bird attack is theoretically completely up, but looks at its wonderful performance; the crowd travels in chaos, adding to their fierce lorry beating, panic crowd that looks around, the bird's eye-watching camera work, and then the focused attack; indeed terror. Argento's stunning, flowing cinematography is full-screen in Opera and clearly one of the film's highlights. I also liked the opera themes and rock music soundtrack, a nice contrast music that everyone used effectively. Sound effects are worth too, stabbing, scissors, beams and everything. <br /> <br /> Inspector Alan Santini: "I've seen a lot of my movies. I would be very interested in your opinion." Marco: "I think using a movie as a guide to reality is meaningless is not an inspector? "<br /> <inspector Alan Santini:" Depends on what you mean in reality. " <br /> <br /> Being a giallo, stylish murders are mandatory and Dario does not disappoint ("hit through the door" scene). is probably one of the greatest deaths if you are forgiven. Black-frosted, deeply tuned, pulsating (chilled shots!) The killer is cold and brutal, and has his heroes under his eye, so he was forced to follow the murders. It all said that Giallol didn't have Opera as good a secret as it should. The killer is kept well enough in public secrecy, but there is little film dedicated to the actual resolution of murders. This and strange end could have used more work. Despite these problems, Opera is still a worthy and satisfying horror film. <br /> <br /> One final remark: It was nice to see the movie at once, showing the right view through the binoculars (only the ring, not two circles together)! Nice eye to detail, Dario!
