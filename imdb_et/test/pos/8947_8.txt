From the very beginning to the end, there is great courage to deal with death with a smile, especially when two funeral departments are fighting for market control: a classic salon and a revolutionary, where every funeral is an exhibition, headed by Christopher Walken, the role of a visually impaired American mortgage. But the rest is excellent, and this is another success that only the UK can do. The ensemble's casting surprise is Naomi Watts, who captures another metamorphosis (including an accent). When always smiling at the face with a sport, it seems like a paradox that there could be so much comedy about the movie, which could be called four funerals and one wedding, but you understand when you see it.
