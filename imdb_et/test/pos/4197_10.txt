"Head" is one of those films that has many problems to convince their friends to see, but when they fall in love, they fall in love. I don't know how many times this has happened to me. This movie is just so funny and weird, really deconstruction of everything that the monkeys had at this point in their career. A lot of credit goes to Bob Rafelson, who has done a lot of his career with this film. I think he wanted to get out of television programming and the features he did after that. Micky Dolenz is absolutely fun. I can't believe he had another comic actor after another movie. This movie has a lot of great fire and many wonderful psychedelic crap. I feel the reputation of this film continues to build and it would not surprise me if it finally becomes a cult classic
