Consistency is perhaps the film's biggest problem. The film begins with a quick, stylish and simply fun political satire, but in the second half of the year, the film becomes almost serious, almost like Oliver Stone. Of course, this is also a very serious subject, but I would say that the film would have been better and more effective even if it was made in the same style as the first half of the film. <br /> <b / The biography and movie about the subject of this movie is also quite short, as it is only 102 minutes of driving time. That's why the film looks like it doesn't tell the whole story. Of course, the film has been followed up after the Soviet occupation in Afghanistan, but the film does not go deeper into it and it does not explain much that seems to be a cheap way to simply celebrate Charks without showing the other side of the medal. The actual events of the film also become easier, although the story is still being (unnecessarily) talked about. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film would have been better than not trying to be so serious and light in its style and atmosphere from time to time. For example, the film should have been more like "Wag the Dog", which was achieved to find the right combination of satire and sensitive political issues. <br /> <br /> These inconsistent styles and storytelling practices are also mixed. When Tom Hanks plays his character in a more playful and comical way, he's just great. However, it makes the film's character more difficult and sensitive / shocking for a moment. Philip Seymour Hoffman is always great because he is in all the movies he plays. He also became an Oscar candidate for his role in this film. Most other participants just seem to be moving around in this movie, just to be in the movie. This mainly concerns Julia Roberts, whose character I found too mysterious to have a clear purpose for the film. He made a superfluous impression on me and is very forgotten in this film. <br /> <br /> It's not that the movie is bad to watch, it's actually pretty good and enjoyable, but if the movie had dared to be a little more edgier, it would have been better and more important than what it was apparently tried to achieve. <br /> <br /> 7/10
