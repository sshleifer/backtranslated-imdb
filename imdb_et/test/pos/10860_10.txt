I have some praise for this mini-series. It's only a year and a half old, but I've already seen it twice; second time more enjoyment than first. I'm seriously thinking of seeing it soon, because I find it mentally lifting. <br /> <br /> This is a very delicate romantic drama that has such beautiful performances, sets, costumes, music and scenes that it has a resonance that puts it in the mini-series for almost its own league. Some others have commented on the difficulty of living as a lesbian in the UK in the 1890s. There is nothing particularly difficult about this; it was only male homosexuality, which was contrary to the law, because poor Oscar Wilde experienced his great price and the great loss of the literary world. Anyway, I'm grounding. <br /> <br /> I think it's important for television. This is perhaps one of the greatest tragic romantic dramas from Rome and Juliet, though not in the usual sense. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 of me. <br /> <br /> JMV
