I'm usually frustrated by what the media "lesbian" movies these days are copying: murders of bisexuals; psychotic murders lesbians; women who experiment with other women, but eventually men; ridiculously good looking women who get each other in men, etc. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, FINGERSMITH is very high on this garbage. It is a trustworthy love story that every cast member acted for MARVELOUSLY, the least supportive participants. In addition to being very tempting, the romance between the heroine is well developed and credible, thanks to Cassidy and Hawkins. both in character / conflict formation and quality of action. <br /> <br /> FINGERSMITH is both pleased and enjoyable to watch lesbians everywhere.
