Looking at the shaggy contemporary film (The Runaway Bride) with his grandchild (22 years old), he asked me, "Since you have been watching movies since 1938, what is your biggest movie?" Boy! What a choice! It took me all the thought of the summer and put some nipples before I decided. This is "OUR BEST YEAR". There are no errors in this movie. This is one movie where every element and dialogue of a juvenile character is essential for the whole story. The film has no part that could be left out. Fixing a young girl without the hands of her brothers, the man comes home to young adult children who have grown up without him and with different ideas, the young man's imagination, whose only responsibility was the sodium jerk, who was awarded the prize for leading the men and his groups. Women who now have to adapt to a spouse who has been away from life for years. The sacrifice of these people, who were in the safe homes of the victims, these ordinary men did on their behalf. Watch life-loving and living people without hands. Parents look and respond to their son's new deformations. The man who took the decision on life and death in a moment had to return to the way of the conservative bank's loan structure. It is not a sympathetic, tear-jerking, heartbeat act. It was a real life! It would not have been different. This, my friends, is how it was! It can easily be considered a documentary. On this day of color film, black and white must not be turned off as it is one of the best B / W modes for filming, editing and directing. The casting was perfect. If I could, I would be obligated to see someone who takes history, filmmaking, creative writing, sociology, family council, or psychology on the subject of this great acting.
