What a tribute to his father! He tried to find out more about the man he knew little, and at the end of the trip I believe that Nathaniel Kahn is pleased with what he learned and personally felt. The film is five years and a quarter of a century after his death, Louis I. Kahn's full commitment to his work - a consistent strong desire to build buildings that are important to mankind and timeless to the world. his life is proudly depicted in his documentary "My Architect: The Boy's Journey" by his son Nathaniel. <br /> <br /> The film is not an anthology of Louis's work. There are many books and archived materials that include Louis Kahn's projects and buildings. This documentary works like a mystery, writer-director and co-producer, Nathaniel Kahn, looking for a man he knew briefly as his father. <br /> <br /> The movie is in chapters. Heading Westis is at the La Jolla Institute for Biological Research in California. This is a spectacular vision - Kahn's integral concept of building and the environment, optimizing the work of scientists, is amazing. A former colleague who worked with Lou 35 years ago hears about his careful details, as well as how rambunctious he could be - certainly not criticizing his criticism. A memorable scene is when the camera pulled back and we see Nathaniel skating on the Salk Institute Square - a small figure like a child who happily plays with his father. The "Immigrants" segment brought us to meet Anne Tyng, who worked with Lou and also carried her daughter Alex. Now, in 80, Tyng's return to Nathaniel's New Jersey Jersey team was nostalgic for Trenton's Bath House project. In the "Go to the Sea", we see the American wind symphony orchestra barge - all made of steel and meet Robert Boudrea, who was surprised by Nathaniel when he finally told him he was the "son of Lou". Boudreaut was touched, he said he had seen Nathaniel when he was six, with his mother (Harriet Pattison), and he didn't have to tell anyone that Lou had a son. It was the "warm" emotional moment of the reunion. <br /> <br /> Like his father "Nomad", Nathaniel traveled to Jerusalem and studied the synagogue project his father started but did not realize. He visited an emergency wall and saw his yarmulks falling off / being "windless", he said he did not have to be "fully" a Jewish son of his father. We will continue with our two half-sisters in the Family affairs segment. We hear him talking to his mother in Maine, and talking to our previous office staff about his father's office, we know how his father worked hard and practically lived, sleeping in the office, on weekends and on all the carpets. <br /> <br /> "The end of the journey" brought us to Ahmedabad, India, the building of the Indian Institute of Management. Discussion with architect B.V. Doshe was a revelation. Finally, Nathaniel found her father's very lively Louis Kahn alive - her spirits lived on her. This documentary is a tear for me. I was mostly tears in the eyes - it was very touching and I am an amazing man, an architect and his son, and women in their lives besides their famous works and buildings. Louis Kahn wanted to give his love to the whole world, to juggling and to three families (you can say that there are three women in his life to continue his inspiration). Like Shamsul Wares, Bangladesh in the capital's capital city, noted the architect (ending it nine years after Lou's death), giving Louis Kahn a lot of time to Bangladesh, spending time in Bangladesh, understanding the place and people's culture - and giving them democracy what he has achieved, and for such a dedicated person, usually people who are close to him, who are often not seen. It seems that the cost of being great is accompanied by inevitable personal sacrifices. <br /> <br /> This film reminds me of King Vidor's "The Fountainhead" 1949 (a good dramatic story B / W with Max Steiner's music) based on Ayn's novel with Gary Cooper, an uncompromising architect who stands for his ideals and Patricia Neal as a parallel supporting woman in her life. <br /> <br />
