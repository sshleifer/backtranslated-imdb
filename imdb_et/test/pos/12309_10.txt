Probably James Joyce could write some of the best phrases from the English word, and his story "The Dead", which ends his collection The Dubliners, contains his finale? Perhaps the most complete section of English language. That's right, John Huston, who had to record this story, ended his career. Like Courage's red sign and a man who would be a king, Huston respected the literary source, but made an adaptation permit. And "The Dead" (which ended after Huston's death with his son, Tony Huston), we get married to almost perfect literature and cinema. <br /> <br /> Everything the cinema can do is one of the comments pointing out that it is not the Queen of Africa (it doesn't have to be), it's a movie that is uncompromising for the audience. We all hoped through the portrait of the artist at school and one needs to bring maturity, how to understand how words and pictures within ourselves and within us can touch us. Just like silent movies, Huston is looking for something clean and works with many years of confidence and leaves the world a masterpiece that is equal to Joyce's original. <br /> <br /> Many Irish theater world veterans have been recruited to bring out a self-evident (and self-evident) man's story, reinforced by the annual party hosts on Epiphany's festive eve. What is recorded for Gabriel Conroy is the celebration, the song, the dance, the poetry where he asked to give the annual toast two sisters and their niece who host. He has disturbed the task he wants to get to the event, and this confusion leaves him vulnerable to the burning experience his wife gives him. When his ego is shaken when he hears the story of his wife's past, it is also a gift where everything that seems to be important throughout the evening wipes out when it comes to realizing the impending mortality of all who live. <br /> <br /> Instead of trying to make the story of the last famous "cinematic" story, Huston brings the voice over and we hear the incredible words that are spoken when we look at the "snow that falls weakly through the universe and weakens . This is the perfect solution for filmmaker adaptation. <br /> <br /> All we hope is cast. Since this is basically a testimony to the written word of power and how it brings us together through shared experiences, each performer seems to be above their role. Anjelica Huston as Gretta Conroy plays a wide range and her account of a young boy who once loved her sears not only by Gabriel Conroy but also by the audience. <br /> <br /> When I think of Anjelica Huston, this is the change she makes in this movie; and when I think of my father, this is the movie I remember first.
