Think of it as a form of extrajudicial detention. Without commenting on and disapproving US foreign policy, extraordinary rendition involves the transfer of suspected terrorists to a foreign country, if you wish, to a place of extradition, a place where torture is not a crime, but an instrument. illegal information. Instead of painting your soil with the blood of potentially innocent parties, you do it in a foreign country where such tactics are acceptable interrogation techniques. <br /> <br /> Of course, given the seriousness of tactics and attempts to crush a person, Sometimes you get what you want when you pass resistance or get nothing or the worst thing to get a testimony just because the mind has broken so that the topic agrees with whatever you say. This is a ugly process, and what better way to do this is if you are a master of human rights, giving young people any tools they need to protect more people, in an age when information is the key to fighting terrorism, and doing it in a country that is likely to be justified record questionable. <br /> <br /> The presentation is Syria this year, although in the new year we will have several political thrillers who took this crown. For the first time, with Eduard, followed by Robert Redford's film Lions for Lamb, starring Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep (again, though now on the other side of the fence), and the Kingdom with Jamie Foxx and Jennifer Garner, although this is probably more action-based. Directed by Gavin Hood, who made Tsots and headed for a new Wolverine spin off, Rendition is a decent thriller with an upper limit that has become quite popular today in the narrative - a splitting that provides a sufficient difference to Anwar El-Ibrahim (Omar Metwally) , a chemical engineer, goes through the orders of the CIA top brass Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep). . Outside the US, Jake Gyllenhaal CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (so prophetic) is starting his first interrogation, undoubtedly the driving force behind not registering. Back to Home, Very Pregnant Reese Whitherspoon is looking frantically for her husband's disappearance and was looking for a former flame of Alan Smith (Peter Sarsgaard) because she works with Senator Hawkins (Alan Arkin). Throw J.K. Sinmmons, the investigation of a terrorist attack and the forbidden love story between Fhtima (Zineb Oukach) and Khalid (Moa Khouas) have a lot of work on the busy picture. <br /> <br /> Given the variety of choices, locations, schedules, and likes, playing was not at all confusing, and it plays the dirty handling of the material, never deciding quickly by presenting ideas and thoughts on both sides of the equation. Every character has its own agenda and opening this agenda is not enough and will not help you confuse. And the best part is how they really really bow to self-preservation in different forms and, ultimately, in various lost lost situations. He liked you too - whether he was or not, and he constantly felt that Anwar deserves what he gets. He used one extremely clever hand, which I didn't see until it was too late (so does the credit), although it went against the usual stereotypes of terrorists and without much time to thoroughly study their motivation. <br /> <br /> Maybe it wasn't necessary because so many movies there already touched on (Paradise Now, Day Night Day Night, Syria). Although it turned out to be rather one-dimensional (a personal tragedy for capturing bombs as a suicide bomber), I felt that Rendition did the right thing if it did not offer any sweet end to saccharin, that this fight against a negative, destructive ideology is nothing that can be dealt with in a two-hour movie, and I have a good time I think he led such fabulous insecurities. <br /> <br /> What we have is a well-designed story that sets the sights of the weapon on display and is likely to generate a debate when the lights come to which camp you belong - are you in for a strong pain interview? Yes or no? This is the key issue of our time. Yes or no? (OK, I'm already for the sheep)!
