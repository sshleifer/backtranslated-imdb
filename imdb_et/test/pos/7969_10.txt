Hard Justice is a great action movie! The whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting! For people who say they are not shooting as they use. Well, it's really the core! David Bradley is really good and his character takes the weight of the film. He hits the stick over a dozen times, gets to the back and is in a coma for three days and then wakes up and fights again, gets beaten, recovers and is ready for more action! His character is incredibly tuff! Charles Napier was also very good and he allegedly steals the show! Vernen Wells was good! Professor Toru Tanaka had a short and non-credit role in Hard Justice! As far as action is concerned, it is really fantastic to fight with all weapons, and in the beginning there is a tremendous stoppage like a scene where cars start to burn and blow! There's so much going on during a 95-minute working time. For action fans, all the fire and the struggle this movie offers is blowing! Hard Justice is a movie that is not easy to find and if you are in a video store and see it for sale, buy it because this movie is a big keeper and a plus box is cool! There are a number of activities that need to be seen as believing! Check out and see if you can find good deals on Ebay, Half.com, Amazon.com Z-Shops and Market Place Sellers! I strongly recommend that every movie fan who loves ems and fighting movies is disappointed with other movies that look like a real non-stop action, but can't get it to get Hard Justice!
