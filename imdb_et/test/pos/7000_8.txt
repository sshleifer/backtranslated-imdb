Let me waste a moment to explain how I turned to this movie. 1. I abandoned the trailer because the film seemed to be a transcribed version of foreigners, which I think is one of the weakest films in the Alien series. How foolish to continue firing the film after I heard about it from people whose opinions I trust, I completely left the theater. Then I started to hook up to Farscape, its 3rd or 4th season, and I found Pitch Black around the night, so I said, "Why not, at least it has Claudia Black." Soon I knew Keith David and I began to realize that Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser could all act (why should it surprise me, I don't know). I was fascinated. I've been stuck now for four years. I watched the movie for the third or fourth time and I still love it. <br /> <br /> It is not an art film, not an independent and not entirely original, but where it does not break many new areas, it is able to offer interesting, realistic characters, heavy driving through a weighty but simple plot and non-stop entertainment ; an absolutely beautiful environment with tastefully rendered special effects. Sound good to be true? Don't take my word ... look at it for yourself. <br /> <br /> The film also highlighted the somewhat iconoclastic Vin Diesel charisma that introduces Richard Riddick's character. Diesel continues this somewhat in the Riddick-ulous chronicles (which I also enjoyed, though I admitted it was quite a big mistake) and is now a legend. Diesel is so charismatic, so big and interesting to see that it is easy to ignore the fact that she is not only a talented actor but also smart. Checking the Pitch Black DVD version with audio comments can just kick you. landing where their captain was killed. The new commander is inexperienced but bright and heroic (Mitchell), but he has been caught between two dominant and dangerous personalities - a mysterious hunter (Hauser) and a dangerous criminal who has been surgically altered in the dark (Diesel). Is it all? Of course, no planet is inhabited and the inhabitants are hungry. <br /> <br /> As any unlikely and unlikely, Pitch Black is filmed, well-talked and very well done. Don't expect anything to learn and don't expect to think a lot, but wait for you to enjoy this modern sci-fi activity class.
