I watched this movie at the Santo Domingo International Film Festival. When I was watching the film, I felt like I had seen a movie with a similar story ... with Ray Liotta, but I don't remember that much. Of course, it is much more dramatic, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> This is a story: Emilio's life becomes a lie that she can no longer support. After 20 years that lied all his life to his wife, son and all the people he knew, the truth is to chase him and there is nowhere to go. after a while you tired of the same thing ... the relationship with a young girl had to advertise something but it is not. Despite the fact that the movie is still funny, exit and inclusion. Does it make you help Emily with her lies or help everyone else catch her. I liked analogy, photography and good results. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10.
