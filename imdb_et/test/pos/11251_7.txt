I'm from Texas and live very close to Plano, where the actual deaths occurred, so I could be a bit biased, saying "Wasted" is a movie you just can't get out of your head. <br /> <Stahl, Phoenix, and Paul all play their character very realistically. You believe they are everyday high school students who just happen to be heroin addicts. The drug content is also handled very graphically - although everything in the film serves the purpose, and every moment the characters spiral down, the heartbeat is. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone. If you look at it, it will stay with you!
