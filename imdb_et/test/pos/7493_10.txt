It's hard to knock this movie. It follows the Pulp Fiction tradition, but still succeeds with its unique style. The cast is fantastic, the script is great - and things like the odd (Pulp Fiction-esque) timeline are doing great. I especially like how the images behind the flash vary depending on who's telling the story ever since. If it is one of the indoctrinated criminals, everything is flashy and cool, but if it's a hero's memory, it's all terrible and disgusting. <br /> <br /> It's a fantastic movie - so I'm very annoyed that I can't buy it anywhere!
