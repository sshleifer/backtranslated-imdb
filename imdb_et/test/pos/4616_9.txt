At 2:37, a high school student suicides. Not showing who knew your life or reasons, time goes back to the beginning of the day. This is followed by six different students; Marcus, Melody, Luke, Steven, Sarah and Sean. Every student fights his moral dilemma, everything reaches the boiling point, hits one end. <br /> <br /> After losing a friend's suicide and surviving his suicide attempt, writer / director Mural K. Thalluri has created an innovative drama that focuses on teenage life and terrible suicide. Suicide has been a hidden subject, 2:37 is Thalluri's attempt to bring it to light. If you are touched by suicide or someone who is, then 2:37 becomes harder to see. <br /> <br /> With heavy and heavy issues, Thalluri is also dealing with everyday teenage crises. Sex, pregnancy, sexual identity, bullying, friendship, Thalluri leads and shows them very realistically. The Thalluri talent factor is his nuance. He respects his subject and the problems that everyone has sometimes suffered. Sometimes it goes closer to a documentary, with so painful realism; interviews with the spliced ​​characters in each movie only increase it. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is a distinctive similarity to Gus Van Sants with Elephant. If the essence of each film is different, then both are engaged in teenage life. Like Sant, Thalluri uses long tracking frames, leaving time back and forth to show the interaction of each character from different angles. Elephant's determining point was its essential atmosphere. With previous conversations, small character development and a long tracking frame, Sant created a haunting and mesmerizing atmosphere for future fear. Although this fear lives at 2:37, the emotional connection reaches a higher level with the characters. Sant didn't. As time goes by, every character will be out of uncertainty by dragging you with your emotional roller skater. <br /> <br /> The real hit of this movie is inevitably suicide, which is predicted from the beginning. The difficult part of this scene is the complete invasion and discomfort we have when the audience monitors that life ends in a frightening way. Although many movies that have committed suicide, shine or romanticize. Thalluri shows the pain and embarrassment associated with this act and is not the best solution. With unknown leaders and their first major roles; Teresa Palmereach, Frank Sweet, Joel Mackenzie, Marni Spillane, Charles Baird, and Sam Harris show enormous talent and promising career opportunities. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is a convincing and revolutionary film.
