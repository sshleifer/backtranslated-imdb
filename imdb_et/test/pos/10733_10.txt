Kramer vs. Kramer is a story about breaking the marriage and its consequences. They can be devastating to partners and even more to a minor child, which Justin Henry plays in this case. <br /> <br /> What I really like about Kramer and Kramer is the greatest strength as the film is the way parents Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep present themselves to the public as a whole who has many facets. Although the film is inclined towards Hoffman and more about his relationship with his son, he is not presented as a saint, nor is Streep a completely black dog. Hoffman is a career-oriented man in advertising. He ignores his wife's dreams and aspirations, but it is very shocking to her when Streep says that love is no longer there and she wants. He also wants him to be a mother, at least for a while. <br /> <br /> Hoffman and Henry are doing their best. Hoffman, which causes pressure from both parents, loses his job and has to pay a lower fee for another institution. At that time, Streep decides after a year that he wants custody. <br /> <br /> Both parents obviously make witnesses and publish their case beautifully, but in such situations it always stops for the mother. br /> <br /> Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep won the first two Oscars for this film in his supportive actor category. I'm not sure how these things will be decided, Streep will not get less time than Hoffman if this is a determining factor. The film focuses on Hoffman's relationship with his son and his evolving mind that he has a part in guilty of marriage failure. As for Meryl, his choice for him is because it is for many women to balance career and motherhood. The conflict in his psyche records everything to see the screen. <br /> <br /> Dustin Hoffman may have won the Oscar for the same reason that Spencer Tracy took his first job, making it impossible to let the child steal the scene by stealing the movie. Children with no obstacles are natural actors and Henry is great because he comes over as a real child, not a Hollywood boy. I don't know if Hoffman saw Captain Courageous and saw Spencer Tracy deal with Freddie Bartholomew. Dustin could have done much worse than Spencer Tracy in his work. <br /> <br /> Kramer v. Kramer also won the Oscar Best Picture, Best Robert Benton Leaders and Best Adjustments. It's a smart and convincing drama that adults have fallen out of love and are trying to do it as well as possible for themselves and their child. Don't miss it at all when it is ever sent.
