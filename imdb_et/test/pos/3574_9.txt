Intelligent and well-received movie worth exporting! <br /> <br /> In this exciting and truly intelligent movie, which has been filmed entirely in Bogota, you may feel the meaning of the word "Bluff" (although it is a Colombian movie, the title is in English); ! <br /> <br /> The story is by Nicolas Andrade (Federico Lorusso), a photographer who finds Margarita (Catalina Aristizabal), head of the magazine owner Pablo Mallarino (Victor Mallarino). after that, Nicolas remains without a girlfriend and without work. Nicolas's revenge on Mallarino lies in tracking and taking photos of his new affairs Alexandra (Carolina Gomez) Mallarino to get the money that Margarita's photos are not shown. <br /> <br /> The story is really intelligent and well-connected, so that you fully understand the meaning of the title, the movie shows a movie that has many comic scenes and characters, resulting in a real joy to anyone who enjoys a good script for movies. <br /> <br /> Here I find that this film is different from typical Colombian films that show our dark and violent picture of our beautiful country, which is something really refreshing. Some critics say that this story does not show Colombia a typical way of life, so it could be considered in any part of the world, I disagree with it: (1) The film is fully filmed in Bogota, so you can see the streets, and pictures of the true capital of Colombia (I hope that some American people and film producers look at it to stop showing the Amazon jungle or small towns of Mexico in Bogotal like some Hollywood movies), (2) characters, dialogues, accent (with the exception of Nicolas from Argentina), is Rosemary ( Veronica Orozco, a typical accent of Cali, (3) you can also see the social and cultural differences between ordinary people in Bogota. I hope that all that goes with the English title will move from other countries to see this Martinez masterpiece, Veronica Orozco, Luis Eduardo Arango (Detective Wilson Montes), Felipe Botero, as an excellent actor. Ricardo Perez and Mallarino, good actors from Catalina Aristizabali and Federico Lorusso. <br /> <br /> A movie worth exporting to people around the world to understand and enjoy! Don't miss this movie 9/10!
