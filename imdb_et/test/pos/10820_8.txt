I think the costumes were great and the hairdressers were great too. At this point in time this is a very authentic feeling. <br /> <br /> I don't know if it was a computer magic or was it real. In some big scenes, there are hundreds of additions in the background. Particularly impressed by this bridge scene. <br /> <br /> The main character that the actor also performed well showed us a nervous, witty woman who knows how to lure herself to attract the people she wants. <br /> <br /> Some scenes were fun. Although it was about 2 hours long, it was never boring. a very good entertaining film.
