WOW I love this movie. It's definitely added to my Ghetto movie list. <br /> <br /> Juice - Heading Tupac 'I Can't F ***' Threat II Society - O-Dawg 'I smoke someone I just Don't giva F ****' New Jersey Drive - Hey they steal Cars in Wide Daylight, They're probably not giva f *** <br /> <br /> New Jersey Drive is the best hooded film ever. This is at the top of the list, the threatening II society is another and the juice is the third, the watches are really stupid. <br /> <br /> The New Jersey Drive sound is Pwnage League's Mac Mall & Young Lay - All about my fett is heard through the movie. <br /> <br /> Underground Lords - Burn Rubber, Another Good Song, and so is Ill & Al Scratch - Don't Close Players <br /> If your GTA-SA fan loves this movie, AND an amazing soundtrack. Soundtrack is basically Rap about stealing cars ^ _ ^ SWEETTTT Film!
