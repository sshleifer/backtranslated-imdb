Chen Kiage has another periodic piece ... (don't remember her doing a contemporary movie!) ... <br /> <br /> A good character with a simple story of trust and broken promises. None of HK fighting scenes or Hollywood-type heroes, but that's good for it. The characters are strong, I really felt for them. <br /> <br /> Understanding Mandarin definitely gives English subtitles. The movie is 3 hours, but it didn't.
