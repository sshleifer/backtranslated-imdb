This film is a story of a Catholic nun as an adviser to a convicted offender. The film describes what he does as a nun who has no productive role. He might have had doubts about his real role. But in the end, he does a role that only a nun can do, not only having faith in Christ. In America, there are so many films that describe condemned criminals or prisons. These scenes, especially filling, are too different from Japan.
