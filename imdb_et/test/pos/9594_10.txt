I have it in VHS, but it's not a great copy because I've been watching it 2 or 3 times a year since 1999. I am also afraid that it will be thrown into its annual VHS cleaning in its "indoor" environment. <br /> <br /> My brother and I (at the end of the 30-year-old still laughing with this fantastic show.) Good Healys Lucky Cup Hat and tells the student that you can't do it (Shooting, Passing, etc.) and he turns out Peter the Beardsley. Like a Leeds fan, I have to laugh with Bostock's blank file before the cup final (or did I say S ** t?) <br /> <br /> Because I came today, my Bro wants it at Christmas so ITV bring it to DVD Come UnderFelt Men !!
