I couldn't believe the candy of the eye from beginning to end. Being a fan of movies directed by music video masters. I am pleased to announce that the photography of this film is the glory of the eyes. There are so many rich, complete pictures in front of me that every time I see this movie, I find something new that I have never seen before. As with previous films I've seen, such as Blade and Mystery Men, including former music video directors, the use of color to catch your attention is very well used. Although the characters could have been better developed, it was a costume entry cost. I suggest you buy it for your DVD collection. Even if you haven't seen it on the big screen, you won't be disappointed. I know I wasn't.
