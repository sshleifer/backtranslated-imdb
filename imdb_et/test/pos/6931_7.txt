I was in the premiere of this movie and I've even met with Todd a couple of times around town (once in Olive Garden). Todd is not a bad man, he is just a small time filmmaker with no budget and big dreams. <br /> <br /> It's a good thing if you like very little plot zombies and lots of blood and courage. You see some Kansas City places and lots of raw meat that could be better? :-) Look for the same 2 dozen people who play different zombies (just changing clothes or hats). With this movie, it's good drinking, take off every time you see the same shirt in a different shirt.
