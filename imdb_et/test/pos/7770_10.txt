This movie was full of good actors, great musical sounds that will completely unleash your mind. Larenz Tate (Darius Lovehall), "Waist Deep", "06" had sharp cats and soon met his Waterloo Nia Long (Nina Mosley), "Big Momma House", 2000. Nina put her heart and soul in this role and when she meets Darius, sparks first, and then there is some anger relationship. The whole range of actors made it a very fun movie with a lot of comedy, drama and lots of loving and deceptive. It is a film that is very ground-level and at the same time shows how everyone has a life of destiny and they are placed in the corner of their big world. Great movie, enjoy!
