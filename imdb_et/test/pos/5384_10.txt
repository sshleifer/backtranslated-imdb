Bwana Devil is said to be the first large studio, full-length feature that has been filmed entirely in the 3D process. Oboler allegedly went to Africa to shoot a different film, but after hearing the lion of two people who terrorized the railway builders, it decided. This is also a good story, almost like Hemmingway; fear, redemption, big white hunter and everything. This is a story that seems to be dragging, almost like filming a new movie to the team. Action scenes are rigid, almost too staged. But these technical problems are small in the light of the dramatic conclusion of the film.
