Whatever you do, don't stop watching if you think the movie is over! Hang on to the first credit batch or leave nothing! We saw this movie at the Savanaah Film Festival and thought it was the best in the bunch. Dreya Weber is really admiration, not only because of her performance, but because she can pull it so far from the ground. With questions and answers, he said that there are no wires or effects, so everything you see is really for him. Addie didn't get to the festival because she danced with Madonna. She was great and beautiful, so beautiful. I was surprised that the film went so well over the blue hair crowd, but there it is, Savannnah is not underwater.
