My wife and children are a good and funny series that really shows the worries and problems most happening in the best families. <br /> <br /> Michael Kyle (father) is a man who always tries to stop children from doing teenage things like partying, drinking, loving or loving. If they do something wrong, they have the right to repair them (how he loves to make bad penalties). Janet 'Jay' Kyle (mother) has a strong personality and rarely agrees with her husband. She understands that their children are teenagers and want to do "wrong" things, as opposed to Michael <br /> <br /> Michael Kyle 'Jr' is a stupid guy who believes everything that others say. At the beginning of the series, he is such a cool guy and is trying to be like a father, but lately, I don't know why he's getting stupid and starting to be a problematic man. At the end of the series, he falls in love with Vanessa and becomes a father, or I should say that this is a stupid father who does nothing right. <br /> <br /> Kady Kyle is a typical teenager who loves to party, kiss and drink. She has a lot of problems with her parents, because they get too much into her privacy. He has a boy called Tony who is Catholic and is afraid of everything so we don't understand what makes him. I remember one episode that they are ready to have sex, but Michael Kyle scares Tony's claim that sex is very dangerous and lethal so he decides to defend himself until he is married. <br /> <br /> I will continue to be the best in my life and I still look at it every three years, so I recommend you all - mostly teenagers.
