I called this movie because there was nothing to watch. The characters woke up immediately. <br /> <br /> Robin Tunney is nothing but remarkable in this movie. Her image of a woman with mental illness is both mobile and 100% credible. Really, such a thing is not easy to do. He pulls it out fantastically. <br /> <br /> We know that the beginning of this movie ends tragically, but you can't take your eyes off. The characters make stupid things, but unlike most Hollywood movies, where people do stupid things because the plot requires them, these people do stupid things because they aren't at the right end - and the things they do are completely in line with their characters. /> <br /> It's just a great example of making IMHO movies. Great writing, great action, great leadership. A movie for people who think film can be more than meaningless entertainment.
