Nothing is better than the android and the aging strategy of the 80's technologies, which pulls your thoughts deeper into the front and center of your mind so you can admire it with beautiful loving pain. Growing up in the 80s gave me an invaluable opportunity to see many “extraordinary human events”. Considering that my parents were never present during the visits, I think I should probably not be as close as the child. So, perhaps, this film, which digs your VHS collection and reaches your children, can be found on the same tape as "Apple Rubber" and the episode "Obedience", that is, you saved the LP mode of course.
