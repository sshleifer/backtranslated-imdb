After watching the film, it is not difficult to understand why the silent Soviet cinema is considered so little in critical respect. Don't do me wrong. COLDS ARE EXCEPTLY at least on the first half, which is extremely entertaining but completely unexpected from the country of origin. fresh, agile, spacious technique that ultimately irritates as much as originally charms; two stunning subjective sets; and a romantic veil that slips, but never quite, into Lelouch's territory. It's just that, in sharing great social, national, and world events, the love affair does not differ fundamentally from the usual Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> In the Soviet Union, which emphasized the country first and during the era (World War II), which inhibited individualism and freedom to protect the murderous symbolism, it is the relief of the predecessor of the two attractive young lovers. And the thematic similarity - everything that consumes love for renting with war - along with the two most amazing films (SEVENTH HEAVEN, LES PARAPLUIES DE CHERBOURG) also increases its potential for love. <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough. Boris, a young factory worker and Veronika, a student, have wonderful relationships at night, their only free time. Boris's cousin Mark, composer, is also eye-catching on Veronika. When the Nazis invade Russia, Boris voluntarily volunteers, into the passion of his family and lover. He promises to write to Veronica, but he never does, I thought he hadn't struggled with it, or maybe it was just unreliable. Veronika's parents die during an air strike and he is moving with Boris's family, helping in a hospital where his father tends to injure soldiers. <br /> <br /> Because of Boris's silence, Veronika also strikes Mark's attitudes, who have received a bribe from a local official. She has finally gone worn out and marries her family. Meanwhile, Boris has been killed. Veronica, who is herself and adultery Mark's nasty, refuses to believe it and expects her return by supporting the name of the young orphans with her name. <br /> <br /> The title refers to birds that a couple sees at their height with love, perhaps its transcendental, epiphany power. But it's illusory - cranes are flying in V-shape, and this shape passes through the film through buildings, interiors, exteriors, human groups, composition, camera corners, heroine name, or editing, where legs in the southwest of one foot are filled with legs walking southeast of another . <br /> <br /> It serves a deadly trap for lovers who have no control over their fate and also recommend a Stalinist power that is never specifically mentioned in the film. Although the couple seem to be free in the space, literally in a direct environment or in privileged generous close-ups, they are always ironized, minimized, broken - by circumstances, families, crowds (see glorious, obvious, sequences where Veronika is captured by tanks or a couple cannot cope with huge crowds) or simply because of the structure of the film, which is constantly distancing through paralellism and their proximity. Although at the beginning, the style of lightness and brightness refer to a beautiful romantic idyll, it stops constantly due to strange edits or camera angles that disrupt music. <br /> <br /> The most remarkable thing is how these blocks of romance are achieved instead of emphasizing historical forces. The whole film, but especially the war itself, is strangely unrealistic and dreamy, we have never shown our harsh, brutal reality, but its effect on lovers. In fact, it turns into a majestic point of view that has no nasty Germans. <br /> <br /> On the web, air strikes produce delicate effects of light and shadow, or the ruins of almost gothic decadence. In Bunker, the threat to the Soviet empire is less important than Boris's indifference. Empty, united Moscow leads at first to lovers, as Veronika with his mother, the walk is less real places than emotional spaces. <br /> <br /> When Mark tries to force himself to Veronica, the air strike is a less destructive reality than the symbolic release of sexual and emotional disappointments. This is a bright and silent, expressionist-sequenced film, where the screen appears to be hysterical and violent, and more importantly, the weak fragility of earlier scenes. <br /> <br /> Also in front, where girls' struggle for honor is more urgent than tactics, Nazis or despair. The movement of Boris and his wounded comrade into the final space is the further deprivation of war experience, its setting in the forest, which gives him sexual dynamism; and Boris's final, pre-death setback is an extraordinary blend of dream-desire fulfillment and heightened anxiety, seeking to become dangerous and grotesque. <br /> <br /> From that moment on, the film becomes a little less interesting, a little clearer. Another understanding of Expressionist overload - Veronika's suicide attempt and his rescue for a child - has been terribly handled; and his evil guilt puts a parallel shadow over the whole film. Using a deep focus on first pampering will soon be worn off, with no moral force or meaning in Welles, which has been introduced in CITIZEN KANE. After it seems that the criticism of totalitarianism is silent for the benefit of an individual, it is finally brutally mistaken when individual suffering, as so often in Russian art, becomes a symbolic (i.e., sexual, dehumanized) hope. Damage.
