A true story of the Spanish paraplegic, Ramón Sampedro, who fought for decades for the right to eutenize. This film, together with the winner of the best year of the year, Million Dollar Baby, caused confusion this year about the images of people with disabilities who wanted to die. Both supporters of the handicapped and (unfortunately, the disabled supporters) protested both films and their Oscar candidates. Candidates also came across Terry Schiavo's attack, just to bring it all out in a historical perspective. Protests, especially against groups of people with disabilities, Million Dollar Baby, make sense in some sense? the film clearly depicted the life of paraplegic without stigma. The central character of the film, Maggie Fitzgerald, becomes paraplegic, it seems she does not get any advice, no help, and wants to die right away. The film is honest, pretty stupid and complex. A true story based on the sea is certainly much more thoughtful. Probably it was probably the same category as the Million Dollar Baby, without his protesters even seeing it, an incredibly common phenomenon. The film gives time to different sides of the argument. And it immediately confirms that the desire to die is only the protagonist and protagonist. It's a blame for a couple of crimes, but I still understand why people with disabilities have problems with it. First of all, the protagonist's meeting with the paraplegic bishop. I can't see how he depicts. His orally guided wheelchair is depicted absurdly and the almost comical sequence in which his feminine, boy-toy servant drags him up the stairs. She doesn't even get to the room where Ramón is, and one of the boy's toys is forced to chat between them. I had to think, gee, maybe when Ramón lived a little more in a wheelchair accessible household, he didn't spend all his life in bed and could find life more perfect (who knows how the film represents reality). Director Amenábar (others) also includes some ridiculous scenes that try to make this film more suicidal, such as the cross-sectional sequence in which Ramón looks thoughtful and the child of his lawyer was born. But after a few ugly moments, the movie is very good. It is painful that someone can die if they have the ability to bring so much joy and understanding to other people's lives. Finally, our lives belong to us. Should we not have the right to choose? The strongest property of the movie is its supportive characters and the players who play it. It depicts how Ramón's struggle and decisions affect the beauty of the people around them. Family members are especially big and Ramoni's final departure from them is absolutely heartbreaking and tears. In my favorite film, Lola Dueñas is a film I knew best in Almodóvari Volver last year or at least underestimated.
