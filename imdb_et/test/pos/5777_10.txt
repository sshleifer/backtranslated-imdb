This film broke a lot of ground and got much less credit than it comes. This is an issue that is becoming increasingly common in our daily lives, but it is considered a phenomenon so common that it does not deserve discussion. This phenomenon is for carers (whether they are doctors or senior social workers) who abuse their position to harm those they are protected. <br /> <br /> Promise, Patty Clawson and his family give up their parents; they have been quickly adopted by local law enforcement agencies. Faced with certain prospects of childcare, Patty prays a young social worker to keep him and his brothers and sisters together. This social worker approaches an older member of another department, but his application is rejected. <br /> <br /> Children are sent to separate homes, following day-to-day opinions and ensuring a clean holiday. But it is this event that is "a broken promise" that gives the film a name that causes a dramatic tension that must continue throughout the film. Patty Clawson, who has been wounded by the obvious betrayal of a young social worker, escapes from his home. <br /> <br /> Faced with the daunting task of finding your family in a climate where the ideal is a visible complete separation from the past; he does the only thing he can do to find his place and break into the office of older social workers to steal the Kashmir. <br /> <br /> Soon after he finds he has made a dangerous enemy. Embarrassed by this torment, this little girl has caused her and her department to decide to use her power and power to destroy her; something he can legally do. <br /> <br /> --------------- <br /> <br /> This topic, caregiver injuries, is relatively taboo. Certainly, it is very little touched in the movies, as few leaders want to build a path that would mean that caregivers are hurting. <br /> <br /> I think this movie plays a very important role in raising public awareness. The case described is not only plausible, but probably many other children around the world have happened. This film is critical for changing public opinion to get rid of laws that protect harmful people, such as Broken Promise, an older social worker. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend Broken Promise. It is particularly important to look at the social workers of the trainees, psychiatrists, psychologists, doctors and other carers. This is a lesson of avoidance that should be taken to heart. <br /> <br /> "Broken Promise." Melissa Michaelsen has an excellent part of Patty Clawson. Especially in films like this credibility is critical. If Pattyi's character was not detected by the viewer, the whole message of the film would be in danger. It is unfortunate that Melissa is still not in the movies today because her performance "Broken Promise" shows she has had an exceptional talent.
