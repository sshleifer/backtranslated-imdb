Deep Water explores the pressure and ambition of a normal person in weighty documentaries. The testimony and archive material is an exciting overview of the late 1960s and the world sailing competition. Personal conflicts against family, self and reputation are played in one of the most memorable and influential films I've seen. I didn't know the history of this story and the drama was successfully and clearly directed. The story is mostly respectful to the participants, who have heroes and crooks rather than indirectly exposed. Most of the interpretation is open to the viewer, allowing the space to be personally associated with situations and characters. This movie is a bitter sweet experience with an entertaining combination of entertainment, joy and drama.
