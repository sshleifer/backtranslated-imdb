As stated in many previous comments, this unique series has many excellent elements and ingredients for your credit. Indeed, more than 20 years after its initial transmission, it is still being monitored and reviewed and has a huge global fan that must show that the players in this series are undoubtedly right. However, the roots of the series's brightness and remarkable appeal must be based on a wonderfully written dialogue and timeless characters? all that are admirable actors. The characters are wonderful, especially because of their complexity. Unlike many other Robin Hood adjustments and many other movie and TV shows, the good guys in this series often make mistakes and can be seen as obvious drawbacks, while the bad ones are bad and ruthless can often be understood and even sometimes seem pretty likable. Will this change the story of Robin Robwood's many real people? rather than good and bad people? something that enhances its uniqueness and remarkable appeal. Also, though, a lot is packed with a series of amazing stunts (which are remarkable for themselves because it was made long before today's computer animation, green screens, etc.). Castle walls, horses and fire, in fact, a real person who at some point fell into a castle or a horse or a fire) is always an amazing dialogue between the different characters of each episode. After all, is it a series of baddies? Nickolas Grace as sheriff of Nottingham, Robert Addie as Gisburne Sir Guy and Philip Jackson as Abbot Hugo de Rainault? who get the best traits and who mostly steal the exhibition with arguments that are full of intelligence and tendency. "It's a wedding, not a party!" is just one of their many timeless "pearls of wisdom" that seem to be one through life :-). <br /> <br /> 20 years after, it's really hard to believe that Robin of Sherwood was originally made for television? and probably not with big money? in order to provide fun for small children in the UK on Saturday afternoon. Filmed in beautiful places, with smart, amazing scripts and spectacular tricks and fantastic actors? many of whom give life in this life? it seems to be more professional in many ways and has more output value than many Hollywood movies.
