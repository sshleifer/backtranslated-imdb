This is one of those games where you love it or hate it for breaking. Even as a hardcore Mario fan you can like this game. You can hate it because it is 2 short and somewhat boring and simple. it is a mix of amazing graphics (not the great excitement of the Nintendo fan) from music or gaming. I know a lot of people who say it's amazing and others who think it's the worst Mario ever. You are a Nintendo fan. I personally love this game and I think this is the best wii game, but you should make sure to yourself. So I think you should get it completely if you are the right Nintendo fan. Classics too much, you might not like it. So try it yourself.
