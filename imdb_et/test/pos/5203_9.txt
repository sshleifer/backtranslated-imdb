This movie shocked me. It was so realistic and the story was incredible. They speak German and Russian, which makes it more credible and realistic. This is a must-see movie. The actors are also big. Really good work. The plot will take place during World War II in Germany. They must go to Stalingrad, the Army, to fight against the Sovietia army. You can associate more with the soldier of each group and follow them through all the dangers when they capture Stalingrad. They face face-to-face meetings against death, blood, grief and Russia's cold. It's a must-see movie and you can't afford it.
