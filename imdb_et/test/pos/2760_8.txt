Graphically, it is the same game that is the first one that is just different levels and some new features to make it fun. The Dreamcast version, which is rarely seen any more, was the best version of the four versions (the Xbox finally came out for the fifth time 2x), a clearer resolution and skateboarders seemed better and more detailed with PS1 and N64. <br /> <br /> The levels are really amazing, from beginning to end, like the first, the school was my favorite, I enjoyed this level so much, not just for the golf cart that sometimes ran over you but for the length. That's what I liked about the first two games, they didn't make these games graphically improved, but focused on the length of the level that's cool. <br /> <br /> Generally as good as first, and worth playing.
