I play this game exactly after looking at a trailer in an old magazine, advertising a CD ... <br /> <br /> It is a very interesting and dark atmosphere (not present in today's games / movies). The game is set somewhere in the middle of the 90s in horror mysterious estates. You play as Adam Randell and your effort is to release the father of the soul of your death. <br /> <br /> The game's appearance is a doom-like but very different game. In this old classic game there are many activities, various puzzles, guests, labyrinths and many interesting places and signs. <br /> <br /> The game only works on Windows 98 and there is no patch for Windows. XP.
