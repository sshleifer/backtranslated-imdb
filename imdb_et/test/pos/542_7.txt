But somewhere, but there is nothing new here, but the great performances of both major actors made it look. Sarandon and Portman are mothers and daughters who are moving from a better life in the Wisconsin countryside to California's sunny Beverly Hills. The main conflict stems from the fact that Natalie would have stayed much more in Wisconsin with all her friends and family, and she felt she was forced to go to California with her overflowing mother. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) Although it is true that the film as a whole is disappointingly predictable, Susan Sarandon and especially Natalie Portman are performing so well that they almost make the material new. But somewhere, but there is no new basis here, but it has a rare quality that is capable of using an excessive object and making it quite interesting. This film also shows the most heartfelt facial look that Natalie Portman sees in her years when her mother falls on her side and looks at how the car disappears. Particularly remarkable is the ironic sub-block of Natalie's mother, who pushed her as an actor, as well as Shawn Hatosy's very convincing result as one of Natalie's very close relatives from home. His death is a tragic clich√© that is almost always seen in such films, but the rest of the film is such weaknesses. Not big, but everywhere, but it's definitely worth it.
