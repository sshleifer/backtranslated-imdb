Well, I'm afraid my review of the dissent doesn't speak much differently than others before me, but I just literally looked at PBS membership - and frankly I'm too excited to say nothing. To really understand the mystery of Barbra Streisand, you have to look back at the movies. Before the Broadway phenomenon in the mid-60s. When television was still young, the air, which is only a memory today, was very entertaining: musical diversity. Some of the musical exhibitions were weekly, but others were one-off, one-off offers that typically show the particular talent of a single artist. This is where we get raw, unimpeded first for Streisand. He had been a guest speaker at other show shows, including Garry Moore, Ed Sullivan, and only once made a tandem with a big coup, giving him extraordinary interiors: Judy Garland. In 1966, COLOR ME BARBRA introduced Barbra Streisand (hence the title), but copied his first special form to a letter a year earlier. For three different acts, we get the abstract Streisand (in the Museum of Afternoon Art, watching and sometimes in artwork), the comic Streisand, who is working on a studio circus for an adorable audience (inhabited by many fuzzy and hairy animals) and best of all, sings in the mini-concert format simply - honestly , just doing it. <br /> <br /> It amazes me that he was still a FUNNY GIRL film debut, but also a singer, director and political activist. Here he is barely 24 years old, doing extraordinary things, because because he puts it into his camera in the introduction, "we didn't know we couldn't, so we did." is closed to the public on Saturday night and probably made with only one color camera. Yet there are many cuts, solves and watches that bring a rather spectacular peak - the modern, lightly charming "Gotta Move". After the disappearance of modern summaries, the jazz club bongods begin, Streisand has emerged with a psychedelic dress and a sparkling eye make-up, making a pleasantly staccato melody of almost androgenic sex. Only when it comes to Law 3, believe it or not that this moment fits or improves with another performance: in concert order, white dress and pearl earrings, says Streisand torchy "Every place I have my hat at home," breaking into the final remarks and exposing one of those climate belts that makes you yell like a little girl, even if you're 44 years old ... and boy. Just an old great television. Look at it.
