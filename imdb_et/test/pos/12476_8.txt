A pretty good movie about a man and his wife who kills a murder and a police officer who is investigating this case. It starts with admiration, but it strikes the wall at some point. We are sure that we know what happened, then a tiny plot of thread that seems like red herring first hides and destroys. However, Clouzot's direction is very big and the actor is pretty good. Louis Jouvet, who also participated in Marcel Carné Drôle de Drame, gives the best result as a smart detective. I don't know if this film influenced Coen's brothers when writing Fargo. Like this film, the police officer does not appear almost half way, it almost becomes the focus of the film. There is also a lot of comedy around him (although his methods sometimes seem fascist).
