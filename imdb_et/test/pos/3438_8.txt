is the end of Carla Gugino * yay * and crappy * boo * <br /> <br /> - "Jaded" is a very erotic story of a beautiful woman who arrives in a city that is trying to escape her past. There he meets two lesbians and after a couple of drinks he decides two fun. But one of the girls takes things a little too far and rapes her when another girl puts her down. He is discovered at the beach where the incident takes place the next day and is taken to the hospital. After that, we spend the rest of the movie watching how he tries to humiliate two girls and at the same time learn new information about who he is and where he comes from and a bit of his past. <br /> <br /> - Director and co-author Caryn Krooth is doing a great job with this film, considering his smaller budget. It is hand-held and sometimes looks like 16mm, but it fits the film because the story requires a tough view. Actors all do the right jobs that are given to them, and there is really nothing to complain about. Of course, the static feature of the film is Carla Gugino, who film all the bares. He's really more naked in this movie than Sin City. The film also features Christopher McDonald, but his character is really pointless, but he's fun to watch. I didn't pay much attention to music because it doesn't really pay attention to myself, but it gets the job done with what it is. The film is appreciated and it is a very good reason. it is occasionally very sexual and very graphic. It is sometimes limited to a soft core, but sexual scenes are necessary for the film, so it does not feel that it is there for the sole purpose of staying there. Although there is one pointless point where we can see how Chris McDonald gets it, this scene was pointless, but it is not really a big problem. The only mistake in the movie is that we don't see the trial after we go through the film. It's like having sex and lack of orgasm or something. <br /> <br /> - It's shameful that talented Caryn Krooth hasn't made a feature film ever since. This is a very talented woman with very few budgets. I really hope he will be back soon, because he is an amazing director. Jaded is not a masterpiece of erotic cinema, but what we have is an enjoyable film that shows a great director in making. <br /> <br /> - Hide the kids and close the curtains, you don't want people to think you are watching porn movies on watching this movie.
