It must be the eternal film I've ever seen and earned a special prize. OK, so it starts with a pretty good, logical, humorous and quick change to complete and express a complete sense. The strange thing is that I hardly laughed, though I think it should be funny, with a very serious message. After a few moments of thinking about why I wasn't laughing, the answer was quite clear ... this film is more realistic than I would like to do. So this is extremely stupid, but very smart when it comes to reaching people who are not “blessed” with a whole range of neurons and synapses and electrolytes (electrolytes?). This movie can understand somewhat large audiences! <br /> <br /> Although they are probably just laughing. <br /> <br /> Well, nice to try ... <br /> <br /> Now I'm editing (adding) my comment because I read some other comments. First I noticed that some people see racism in this movie. Well, it didn't go beyond my mind when I looked at it. But I can imagine, if you look from this perspective, you will see some. Of course, we could discuss the relationship between intelligence and race, but I think this is not the place to do it. I don't know if we would appreciate the Huxtable family here, would you complain that they are all black? I don't think so, but I think you could ... (besides, the two of the smartest people in the world, half, woman, doesn't seem to me to be a completely Caucasian, so "what's the problem?" ') <br /> < br /> Second, the film gets a very confusing rating; Between 1 and 10 and everything, but there is a lot of polarization there, which means the movie does its job very well! It mixes people, makes them want to talk about it and evaluate it. That means it's a good movie, whether you like it or hate it. After 5 minutes it becomes even predictive and boring, but you look at this famous mess. I think you hope this is not the case. Or maybe our sick way to see terrible accidents. Well, that's one sure.
