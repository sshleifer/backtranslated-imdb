When I saw this movie at age 6, it was in the Erols Video chapter CHILDREN because it was an animation. We looked at it and it was a completely different ball game! Very violent story and graphic deaths are very fun and compelling, but not for children. Avoid viewing the family, my mother had almost a heart attack and hung up on the video!
