I was disappointed with the recent (2000) remake of the American mini-series. Although it followed the plot line very closely, it seemed to leave the heart and soul out of the original. Not to mention that you add low preaching heavy hands ... So my suggestion is to leave the modern remake and leave the original. It is much longer but thrilling and well done. Interesting, complicated and textured, without preaching self-consciousness ... and it's beautifully captured. <br /> <br /> I find that these great overseas movies give so many Hollywood fanfare Oscars. (Although I liked that Benicio Del Torro got some honored praise ...)
