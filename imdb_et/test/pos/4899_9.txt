The film apparently came from the idea of ​​one of the writers when he saw one of his creations in a supermarket. The inhabitants of Royston Vasey lead our world to persuade writers not to stop writing and thus destroy their world. <br /> <br /> If it sounds too serious, don't put it down. In the first few minutes, we get: Bernice (a vile female prince), who makes torture exhausted during the resurrection; Chinnery (a vet who inadvertently destroys every animal he touches) trying to collect sperm from giraffe; Mickey (thick incredible), ah, thick; and Tubbs (inbred sister-spouse and local merchant) are always sweet but still nasty. <br /> <br /> Some common characters are missing, but Gents' new idea introduces some of the 16th century characters - and we also have gentlemen in action. If you're a new member of gentlemen, it's a simple introduction and fun. If you're a long-time fan, that's all you expect - including Jeremy Dyson's lubrication joy. <br /> <br /> Everybody said it had the same weak surreal humor that was in the series, plus a few moments of pretty touching "introsections". For example, Herr Lipp maintains a gentle dignity in learning what he sees as a creator of a "single joke". While most symbols remain as they are, some evolve in unexpected ways that are completely natural when they happen. <br /> <br /> This film is a "song of the song" for Royston Vasey, but it is also an exhibition of Gents who prove they can write other things - and that can be very funny. (But you still knew it.)
