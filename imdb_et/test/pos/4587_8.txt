In the world of idiocracy you can read all kinds of references. A futuristic world, inhabited by pervasive, self-conscious morons, fed by the technology of the past era: the precedent of this idea is HG Wells's "Time Device" and Aldous Huxley among other satires among "Brave New World". /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, the narrator explains the rapid decay of mankind for over five hundred years, but does not fill the gaps from where all futuristic technology has come in the meantime. Most of the critics of this very entertaining (and funny) film seem to surround this omission and the resulting complaint that the world is not "realistic". Like "realism", satire quality has never been needed. Is "Brazil" Realistic? How about "Futurama" or "Transmetropolitan"? Hell, how's Gulliver's Travels? I did not think. "Idiocracy", though perhaps not as the best in the genre, hits the same remarks and does it generally successfully. <br /> <br /> Moreover, I did not find a problem with futuristic technology. It is quite easy to imagine that Mike Judge satirises the current trend towards automation and simple product styles, so even the entire idiots can use them. Like "Brave New World", it seems that the film society has reached a point of automated independence at some point in time (probably created by the now extinct "smart people" to place an increasingly foolish nation)), leaving the rest of humanity free to give all the worst, suicidal impulses They can get out, and grow up with a stupider. The film happens just during the last fire of mankind, because everything begins to break down to good. However, it may be "unrealistic", but if so, it is a remarkably unrealistic brand. <br /> <br /> Fools naturally take most of the time on the screen, but they're just victims - they don't know better. Mike Judge rescues his true hatred of powerful intelligent people who are dead when the film begins, but who is now very alive in the 21st century. People like scientists pursuing "hair growth and prolonged erections" for a reason other than that they can benefit from the processing of their snake oil. People like politicians who let companies just buy FDA and FCC. People like media managers and their yuppies who promote stupidity - who can destroy all cultures, morals and health to make a quick button. After all, who's really guilty, Morlocks or Eloi? The world 's Hiltons of Paris or great leaders and advertisers who put it on TV and lowered our cultural standards to leave it there? It is all indirect "idiocracy". Here is a line, a hint (witnessed by a fun car-doctor who literally does everything in the health care system). This is one of the few aspects of the movie that the unnecessary narrator does not put on the ground. It's just that the viewer can pick up or not, but it's one of the most interesting topics in the movie that is much smarter than any other comedy of the year. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that so many people are leaving the film thinking that it is just an excuse to show the rear ends of farting and people have hit the groin. Not that the stuff is not too funny and maybe it's a little beating. But in "Idiocracy" it is not as easy as it seems.
