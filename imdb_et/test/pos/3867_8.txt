SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I love Simpsone and I've seen every time that had ever come out. I have to admit that the first season is the least underestimated season, and it is the slimmest episode in the first season of the season. The episode begins with a family playing the Scrabble game to get Bart ready to take the intelligence test he has to take at school. He says the game is stupid and he doesn't want to play it, but he has to do it. He expresses a word that is angry with Homer and he lives around Bare's house. The next day, Mrs Krabappel assures the class that the test does not belong to their class, but a test that tells them what their future is. Bart can't answer one question. He thinks fast. He is swiftly exchanging a test with Martin Prince, the smartest in the class. Later, Marge and Homer are invited to go to the prime minister's office to discuss Barth's behavior. Suddenly, the school psychologist suddenly arrives and tells Skinner and Homer and Marge that Bart is a genius and should go to talented schools. Bart agrees to go because he doesn't have to do homework. The next day, Homer will travel to a new school. He is introduced to everyone and everyone. Fortunately, his day is not very good. Smart students take their lunch wisely, they can't read comic books, but they still do it, and his fellow students criticize him. Fortunately for Bart, he started spending time with Homer, but Marge bought tickets for the opera. They go to the opera and entertain it. The next day he goes to his old school, but his friends make it fun. They call him points. In his new school, Bart was told he was doing a chemical experiment. He does it wrong and blows at school, leaving himself green. The psychologist has said that Bart tells him why he did it. Instead, Bart tells him that he wants to hide and go back to his old school to follow other children. The psychologist is interesting and he asks Bart to explain it on paper. She finds it too difficult and writes a testimony that she is not a genius. He gives it to a psychologist. All he cares about is that he wrote the word "confession" wrong. That evening, Homer baths Bart and Bart say to him that he's not really a genius and that he's a scam test. Homer is angry and rides around Barte House as Lisa and Marge look at them at random. <br /> <br /> Generally, there is one underestimate one episode. <br /> <br /> 8/10
