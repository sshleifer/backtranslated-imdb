I don't pretend to be a big Asterix fan, having seen just one other movie adaptation and just reading two comics, but it was a great movie, all the same. I only saw the English version and found that the voices fit perfectly with the characters - Brad Garret as Obelix and Sean Astin as Justforkix. The story itself was so interesting and really funny (especially contradictory names - all the names of the Vikings ended with "af", while all Gaulish names naturally end with "ix"). I did) I corrected this story, although it weighed on generic production with unnecessary clichés. The plot is this - the Vikings leader Timandahaf is sick and tired of going to village villages and then finding them empty. So he consults his "wise" Cryptograph whose entire repertoire consists of old proverbs and Cryptograf tells him "Fear borrows villagers' wings". In a literal sense, Timandahaf believes that fear actually allows people to fly and expedition to become a "fear game", an expedition that will naturally take him to Gaulish, where Asterix and Obelix live. The couple is currently very disappointed - they have been entrusted with the main cousin of Vitalstatistix, the nephew of Justiqukix, so they can train him, and the boy is not making progress. If Justforkix inadvertently admits that he "fears everything" in the presence of a brainwave Viking Olaf, he is thought to be a "fear game" and abducted. Vitalstatistix sends Asterix and Obelix to rescue Justforkix before his father returns to his home to bring his son home. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this is a great movie that has few bugs and sometimes defective dialogs in addition to clichés. I enjoyed it carefully, even though it wasn't a comic.
