"One Dark Night" is a genre of low budget horror in the 1980s. "ODN" fills the viewer with the help of retropunctions, clothes and landscapes when horror movies were just ... Horror! <br /> <br /> Nothing is so intense that you don't understand what's going on, the film tells the dark fabe about what happens when you get confused with the dead. Well done is that it is a stable screaming queen, and the work of the thin director of Mc McLoughlin, whom she treats and makes you believe what she is doing. Not "Who did that?" and certainly not a big twist at the end. It's straight forward and your face horror from start to finish, a lot of 80's humor is thrown into the added spice. I'm just giving her "8" just because some special effects will end up in the end of the movie, but at least there are no CGI ... The perfect movie for new fans of the 1980s Horror genre or anyone who wants to live a fun evening of bliss in the classic horror.
