I have to say. It's just one of my favorite movies to watch Halloween. Halloween party, a frightening man, dressed up and complementary to Miami Vice. LARGE LARGE BIG !!! <br /> <br /> ********************* SPOILERS ************** ****** ******* <br /> <br /> I have a big place in my heart for the occasional 80's horrors, and it came out and pulled my heart strings. I always passed this flick in Blockbuster and always laughed at the lid. Now, every weekend, I'd capture a random movie I've never seen ... one weekend was Angela's time. It seemed he'd been bothering me for years. So I took it home and put it in most of the movie. <br /> <br /> It was terrible and tough for me. And not just an actor! Some of the things they came up with for this movie were AMAZING. I can honestly say that the best part for me was watching Suzanne (played by a companion iowan) through his nipple with a lipstick tube. It was random and I loved it. Looking at the horrible Angela FLOAT through the corridors and listening to her horrible demon, it was enough to awake me ALL NIGHT LONG! <br /> <br /> This is not one of the smartest or best-performing horror movies. But its 80-year-old cheese and all its elements are necessary. Shameful Goth Kid, Virgin, Slut, Naked Girls, Scary House, Bad Action, oh and I mentioned naked girls? All the elements were there and put together so that it was made for one of my films. Tissue for filmmakers.
