This little picture succeeds when many big pictures fail. Because it was a small picture, the big wigs of the studio were not harassed by John Ford. He was happier with this film than any other, because he was able to do it. He was also able to use his repertoire of talented characters with actors who had played such an important role in their past advancements. Some of them, such as Ben Johnson, have discovered Ford and have been able to show their talent. Johnson was employed by Ford because he was an authentic cowboy in Oklahoma, who usually did his stunt work. Years later, he won the coveted Academy Award with an excellent performance "The Last Picture Show". Ward Bond even expresses Ben Johnson in this movie. He is not the captain of the wagon, Johnson plays this role, but because of this film he was later given the captain of the wagons in the classic TV series "Wagon Train". Ironically, one of the "Wagon Masters", James Arnes, has been hit by the bad guys in the "Wagon Train" on the "Gunsmoke" TV series. Ward Bond plays the leader of the leading Mormons in the west, often returning to his sins when they call the Mormon Adam Perkins (Russell Simpson). When a troublesome situation arises, Elder Wiggs (Ward Bond) shouts: "Blow your horn, sister Ledeyard!" The sister of Mormon, played by Jane Darwell perfectly, blows so hard and loud that even the devil has to be shaken. Darwell and Simpson were famous for playing Ma and Pa Joad in Ford's classic version of John Steinbeck's "Wrath of Grapes". <br /> <br /> Another major actor in Ford's company was Hank Worden, who plays one of Uncle Shiloh Clegg's notorious but not too bright sons. Worden became famous a few years later when he played Mose for Ford in The Searchers. Worden lived in 91. He still died in movies. <br /> <br /> The wagon captain, Travis Blue (Ben Johnson) and his partner Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.), are horse traders who never do their job seriously when doing fun, especially with a local sheriff. They mix with the train of a Mormon wagon in the West. Ford's beloved Monument Valley is the setting for most movies. One of the main reasons is the beauty of the redhead Mormon Prudence Perkins (Kathleen O'Malley) who catches Sandy's eye. Along the way the train pulls hoochie coochie exhibition, which includes charlatan doctor (Alan Mowbray) and two dirty angels (Joanne Dru and Ruth Clifford). Joining the road is also the Clegg family, who wants murder and armed robbery. Ford shows how difficult the wagonway is to the West these days. <br /> <br /> The songs in this movie are written by pioneers of legendary sons, Stan Jones. Writing Jones was almost as good as Bob Nolan, who had written a lot for the band before. Jones' most famous song, not in this movie, is a lot of recorded "Ghost Riders In The Sky". Pioneers sons sing in "Wagon Master". This adds to the western effect of rolling wagons. It should also be noted that the renowned Native American athlete Jim Thorpe from Oklahoma plays the role of Navajo leader. It was his last film appearance. He died long after the release of "Wagon Master".
