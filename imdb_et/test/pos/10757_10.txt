Returning from China at the age of 20, the young missionary refuses to change to the hustle and bustle of the Hometown PAW. <br /> <br /> This movie was a bit out of Harold Lloyd's earlier films. Often there is often a fairly dominant dialogue, mostly due to dialogue, not to complicated views that amplified Harold's past classics. However, there are some great moments that are pure visual fun when Harold tries to follow a crowded street, or when he strives hard to lose his nightclub remover. There is also a climate scene in the basement of Chinatown, where Harold jumped leaps and bounds in dark comedy. But most humor stems from Harold's refusal to be criminals who have been in their hometown for years. <br /> <br /> And this is a rather complicated collection of politicians and secretaries against Harold, played by actors from fine characters: George Barbier, Nat Pendleton, Grant Mitchell, Edwin Maxwell, Alan Dinehart, Warren Hymer, and Beating Fuzzy Knight. Pert Una Merkel is under the control of a girl who is standing by the tobacco, who catches Harold's eye and keeps her interested in her nonsense outlook on life. <br /> <br /> Cinematographers know Samuel S. Hinds as Harold's missionary. Charles Sellon as the clerk of Stockport Seniorport; and Herman Bing as a German gangster - everything is unredited. Also, Noah Young, who is familiar with Harold's silent films, is just a few seconds as a robbery attempt, here in the final Lloyd's picture. <br /> <br /> Fox gave the film a fine value, especially in the opening scenes in China.
