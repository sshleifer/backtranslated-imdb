* Small Spoilers * <br /> <br /> You know it's getting to the point where Walt Disney Television Animation can be as well known as Walt Disney Sequel Animation. These follow-up results are awesome ("Beauty and Beast: Enchanted Christmas" and fantastic "Lion King II: Simba Pride") awfully ("Jafari Return"). (This is, of course, my personal opinion.) Now, Disney brings us his latest success. "Scamp's adventure" and although it is faulty, it's still fun. <br /> <br /> Animation quality is not equal to Disney animation; Yet, animators are doing a good job of bringing characters to life. Lady and Tramp have not been left since 1955. Reliable still speaks of her sense of smell, and "Ol" Reliable, "and Jock is still worried about her. There is a nice fight between the tram and the pound of the dog, and again we have two spontaneous dinners with two romantic leaders (although it is very doubtful that this will become a classic scene like her predecessor.) <Br /> <br /> I don't care about most of the songs (although Roger Bart and Susan Egan - Scamp and Angel singing voices) sing their parts very well, both Melissa Manchester and Norman Gimbel have done a lot better in the past. Danny Troob's score is okay, but nothing is memorable, and some junkyard gangs look like superfluous baggage, that is, they don't really do much. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the voice work is pretty good. Bennett is a dogcatcher, he is very good at Tramp, and Chazz Palminter is doing a great job when Buster, the spam leader, and Alyssa Milano give their best results as Angel. Then Scamp (who is his father's spit). has announced PERFECTION to Scott Wolf. Wolf does an excellent job of showing Scamp's wild color and his soft side. <br /> <br /> In summary, while "Scamp's Adventure" is flawed, it still makes a fairly amusing look. However, I hope that Walt Disney Television Animation will focus their attention on their original material for their future publications. <br /> <br />
