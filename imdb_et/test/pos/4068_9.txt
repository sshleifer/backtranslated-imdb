Despite the negative criticism, I really enjoyed this movie. I'm not gonna say it lightly. I love movies and I'm pretty funny about them (my home video library has over 9,000 movies - some are big, others are OK, some don't like me at all). And to all those who have criticism: it's comedy. I just love this movie. It's light, funny and very calm. I am aware of all (or most) of the shortcomings, but I love it. Comedy talents by Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro are used (completely for this type of film). Don't compare it to other constellations, just enjoy it. The cast is great and I believe that the purpose of this film was fully achieved. If you really want a "light" and very peaceful night - watch this movie. DeNiro and Murphy just made this movie fun, so we should watch it. And please, don't be so negative. Don't wait for the godfather's performance or meet with DeNiros parents, don't wait for comedy breakers in Murphy. Your parties must not be ridiculed, but it is still very funny.
