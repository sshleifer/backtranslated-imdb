Two new OSS 117 movies have a sense of humor that is both intelligent and puzzling, which I find very fun. It reminds me of the classic pink Panther films, which have almost as good a leader as Peter Sellers Jean Dujardin. And unlike Steve Martin, completely destroying Clouseau, Dujardin is quite brilliant. <br /> <br /> Comments on films that are anti-Semitic are clearly a case of total humor and a lack of understanding. <br /> <br /> Whether you enjoy or hate this movie, it really comes up to what humor you have. I can't wait for a sequel!
