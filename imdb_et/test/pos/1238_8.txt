(WARNING - INCLUDES THE FINAL MEASUREMENT) A film that is almost intended to stop you and control it - it is limited to an almost empty motel, where a large courtyard resembles a circus circle and spaces seem to be temporary stops rather than shelters; When the characters are more and more concerned about the past, the present is getting more and more until the final burning appearance of the black Mercedes Count signifies a fusion of reality and fantasy. Whether their stories are true and whether Stanton is really a dad or just a crazy man who is staging his stories, it's impossible to determine. The theme seems to be how the love of extreme and remarkable nature stands in the direction of stability, where reality itself breaks down; where exotic, wrong place fantasy becomes dangerously tangible. The image of the burning motel - the symbol of destruction - is the strange, but effective, amazingly imaginative end to this stunning but effective film.
