Small spoilers follow, but something you haven't learned from the back of the DVD. <br /> <br /> With Ren√©e Zellweger's excellent central performances, Sister Betty is a dark but deceptively good-hearted comedy <br /> <br /> Suffering from an emotional and mental breakthrough when she sees her disgraceful murder, worried and desperate The miserable waitress Betty is convinced that her favorite daytime soap character is her long lost bride and leaves Kansas to Hollywood to find her. <br /> <br /> Instead of making fun of Betty's mental state, writer John C. Richards is very sympathetic because Zellweger depicts him as a lost innocent, not completely helpless, but tragically vulnerable. It is important, nevertheless, that he never be a victim, and though he will undoubtedly suffer terribly, the motives of his incomprehensible characters are all understandable - even Greg Kinnear, as the object of his misleading affections, can be egotistical, flashing and arrogant, but he truly believes he is just a peculiar wannabe actor with bags of talented talent. <br /> <br /> The farce, where all the main protagonists fall at the same time (in this case Betty's house) at the same time it is as old as the cinema itself, but it works well even if the shade change is unfortunate. <br /> <br /> Zellweger is really confirmed by Kinnear and Morgan Freeman, who both work hard and particularly enjoy seeing Chris Rock's vision in his earlier scenes. <br /> <br /> Not nearly as cruel as you think, and not at all meaningful, Sister Betty - although far from being laughing - is a solid entertainment lifted to the leading actor.
