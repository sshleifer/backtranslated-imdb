OK, well, no one in your right sense (s) would take the movie "Man with a screaming brain" and expects it to be serious. It is an outrageous b-film, which means a truly hockey plot, strange signs, clich√©s, top-the-action and oh-so-cheesy lining. For this odd segment (including mine) that gets out of such a thing, it's a pearl. <br /> <br /> Action better than expected. Stacy Keach is in your character. Bruce Campbell brings powerful and convincing performance. His physical comedy skills are truly impressive in this film and are back in "Evil Dead" movies.
