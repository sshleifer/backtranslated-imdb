The vast bed of the demon eats people among other things. I'm not doing it. <br /> <br /> Completed in 1977 and not officially released until he reached the DVD in 2003. You probably know this thanks to Patton Oswalt's great bit of it, as well as Stephen Throwers' important book "Nightmare USA". Looking at it, you don't know if it is George Berry and what drugs he smoked / injected / died before writing and directing the movie? <br /> <br /> - Is this horror comedy? A combination of horror flick and art movie? A strange prank to the audience? <br /> <br /> -What the hell am I looking at? <br /> <br /> The Death Bed really does not provide any explanation. I know this term has been used too much, but it cannot be more serious than here. It's really a beggar's description. It is both a horror comedy and an art / horror hybrid. But the whole thing is so surreal, it has to be seen. The score sounds like electronic bits of old Candlemass albums, the actor is terrible and everything is disconnected, the direction is surprisingly competent, and the film sometimes looks like Jesus' Franco movie, ie when his films were deliberately funny. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie is not really a good way to describe it. The Lord knows that I've tried, but really, some movies are so strange, unique or remembered when it is. Look at this ... but you are warned. This is also the only movie George Berry has ever done. He definitely left his mark on exploiting the genre, I'll tell you so much.
