A good story of Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) who dreams of being wide-ranging, meaning she has to leave for small dinners where she works with Danny (Gene Kelly) and Genius (Phil Silvers). Rusty is in love with Danny. All three are good friends and every Friday evening they go to a local bar where they get oysters so they can look for pearls (they never eat them). The story offers stories and dances. The film has two questions that Rusty must answer: Is celebrity all that it is? and less if you're lucky? Answering these questions will change the movie. The film also does a good job of presenting the talents of all three principals. Never a boring moment!
