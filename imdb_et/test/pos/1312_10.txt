This film is a haunting message of the life of the author and poet Mishima. It jumps through its past through its last day and through some of its stories, but is expertly designed when it moves from section to section. It includes a person's taste, his work and his times ... the difficult 1960s. <br /> <br /> I think the most wonderful parts (literally full of miracles) are excerpts from his work. Sets (specially designed to work with the camera) are amazing .... stylized, beautiful and effective. They could be used as examples for all designers. I woke up at night, dreaming of a golden pagoda. <br /> <br /> Stories were a powerful study of the nature of man and art. After watching the movie, I wanted to know more about this artist's work. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics or Japanese history.
