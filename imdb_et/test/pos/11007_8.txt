_Saltmen_ is a long film for his genre, and quite often it is much slower than Western viewers. With that in mind, I enjoyed this interesting topic as well as the great pictures of this movie. Some landscapes are truly breathtaking, and there is enough interest that most should have the opportunity to survive _Saltmen_, using minimally fast backward. <br /> <br />
