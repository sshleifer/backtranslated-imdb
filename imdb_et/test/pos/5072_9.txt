Some movies are just for you to entertain, others to laugh, shout or raise you, others like this, try to provoke you, think about you and get angry with you. I was angry at this film, not in the movie, but true that America, free, tortures in an illogical position that it does so for greater prosperity. The scenes of the torture of this film were harassing, the indifference of people was broken, the film was convincing in its argument and showed how wrong it is to torture people. Of course, now I put on the "bleeding liberal" labels that other people draw, who close their thoughts on the facts that happen and not. People who do not know how the film said about every tortured person can get ten or one hundred people up for revenge. You get a cycle of increasing violence. This movie didn't make me hate for America, although I see how it can be done, but it made me hate how America has reacted in its post-September 11th world. The film has a significant price offer, just after we know that 19 people are dead and seventy-five injured at the bomb site, the quote "one America is dead" - this makes the difference. You can't kill an American, America can kill thousands, but you can't kill an American, or they do whatever is necessary, including torture to do justice. This is probably the American way. Call me liberal, call me naive (although I think people who think that torture is good is naive), call me off, call me something you like, but this movie is a great example of what is in America and to the West today wrong. I want this movie to be shown to all students at least. This movie will stay with me for a long time, some want me to forget about it, because I want this type of thing never to happen, but I know it is, the other part I want to never forget, because we we must never forget to remember these shameful events in order to avoid their repetition. Whatever happens to me, this film has been with me for a long time and I am talking to everyone I know to watch, not entertain, but provoke, because sometimes we all have to call us.
