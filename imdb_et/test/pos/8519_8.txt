"Empire Strikes Back" director Irvin Kershner "Never Say Never", a remake of the 1965 James Bond movie "Thunderball", does not exceed Terence Young's original, but this non-Harry Saltzman & Albert R. Broccoli movie is well worth watching when you call for yourself 007. Nevertheless, despite the lack of smart gadgets and the lack of a lively musical score, "Never Say Never Again" rates out of the average senior arrest thriller whose top scores have been cast, including Sean Connery, Kim Basinger, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Max Von Sydow, Barbara Carrera, Edward Fox, Bernie Casey, Alec McCowen and Rowan Atkinson. The film's bristles have surprises with a surprising title credit sequence all over their exciting but long 134 minutes. Unlike the franchisees of James Bond, with breath-taking moments, "Never Say Never Again" offers the scarcity of these scenes due to its excessive budget. Indeed, the film has only three gadgets: an explosive ballpoint pen, a laser watch and a heated motorcycle. In addition to the tasteful opening screen of Lani Hall, the result of the orchestral music by Michel Legrand, the composer of the Ice Station Zebra, is much to be desired. Legrand repeats any of those horrible jazz tests that make John Barry's music a memorable one as a regular bond franchise. All in all, "Never Say Never Again" seems to be more related to the first two Bondi films "Dr. No" and "From Russia With Love" ?? and the "On Majesty's Secret Service" section that is more related to the ground approach to the subject. <br /> <br /> "Never Say Never Again" will ever present Sean Connery as James Bond's parent 007, who has seen his day and been trained in active service. Ironically, Roger Moore was a year older than Connery and Moore's Bond movies were about 007 as an active, young boy. Sean Connery appears to be responsible for 007 as a more mature secret agent and several changes are taking place in the Lorenzo Semple scenario, which emphasizes Bond's age. Initially, Connery had lobbied Bond to play without a hairdresser but graciously smarter thoughts dominated by Connery athletics. He looks tanned and fit and appears in better condition than he did twelve years earlier when he was attacked by John Gavin to replace Diamonds Are Forever at the last moment. Connery had worked on another film and had a role that he could not remove "Diamonds Are Forever" on time. In the 52's, Connery is still youthful, despite the weak requirements of the script. <br /> <br /> The action will open with 007, trying to save the abducted woman alone in the wilderness. He sends several guards who are armed with machine guns and release a woman to pull her with the cage when she is not looking for it. It seems that this whole sequence was an exercise developed by M (Edward Fox, "Jackal Day") to test Bond's ability. The new M does not share its predecessor's use outdoors. M decides that Bond must clean up his "free radicals" system and 007 is packed with Shrubland. While in the state clinic, Bond monitors suspicious activity between the nurse and the patient and sees them as they look. The sister is none other than the SPECTER assassin Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera, "Dr. Moreau Island"), and she is responsible for seeing no USF officer Jack Petachi (Gavan O'Herlihy of "Superman 3"). Petachi is part of the SPECTER plan by Klaus Millionaire businessman Maximilian Largo ("Outside Africa") to double world power by stealing two nuclear warheads. The crooks implant the double-eyed Captain Petachi, who has access to highly sophisticated computers and who can order arms. After stealing SPECTER's weapons, Fatima Blush runs her off the road, snatching her pet's snake on her lap and then attaching her explosive to a broken car and blowing her. Indeed, the first part of "Never Say Never Again", with the exception of the SPECTER Planning Conference, belongs to Fatima when she is in charge of a Petachi clinic and then repeatedly attempts to kill Bondi, one on the sharks at sea and later on in a motel-style explosive device. <br /> <br /> Finally, Bond meets a beautiful blonde Domino (Kim Basinger, "Mother Lode") and slides into Largo's charity dinner at the Monte Carlo casino, where two faces out on a challenging video game called "Domination" to see who reigns the world. Bond bets on him and Largo hates him twice, because 007 is his only race Domino and his side blind that even Fatima can't remove. Bond and Fatima get it after hunting the motorcycle when it returns and blows it up. Their earlier meeting in the Bahamas, when he confirmed the device that attracts shark after him, is pretty flat. As in the original "Thunderball", the scrapers are recovering from hijacked nuclear warheads at sea, but just by themselves. <br /> <br /> Bond flies to Bahamas where he meets his diplomatic contact with Nigel Small-Fawcett (no less than Rowan Atkinson's "Mr. Bean", who is worried that Bond could kill someone and destroy the island's paradise , of course, Nigel's Small-Fawcett movie is a comic-free source, the CIA sends Felix Leiter (for Bernie Casey Bond to back up, this is the first time an African-American depicted Leiter, Bond met some of the problems involving Domino from the Arab slaves while Leiter and he rescues the world. Never. Say Never Again is a richly respectable James Bond thriller with many clean touches, but it never poses a threat to franchise movie films. "Never Say Never Again" looks like a worthy Masterpiece Theater that takes 007.
