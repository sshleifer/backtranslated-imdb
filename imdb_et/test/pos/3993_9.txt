Not surprisingly, this movie I was doing at the time it was. I explored the early beauty and tragedy of the Chosun Dynasty in Seopyonje and was delighted to study the well-known Korean national story of Chunhyang, which consisted of his last two films. The most surprising is that Chi Hwa Seon, his 2002 offer, is not in the style of these two previous films. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I have experienced an experienced hand. We are exploring the real life of a man: a painter from the late 19th century, the Chosun Dynasty, who travels on the edge of modern times, but who is not noble, and who, because of this, causes the fame and fame of contemporary Korean society and artistic expressions of contempt for old Korean nobles and his contempt for both colonies. Painter Chang Seung Up, known as Oh Won (famous by Choi Min Siki, famous for the legendary "OldBoy" star of Park Chan Wook) is becoming increasingly influential and therefore more dangerous in the film. The modern Korean audience introduces such a hero, regardless of the fact, or perhaps because he was so tortured. I feel the same beauty and the tragedy remains intact in history. I'm a master of capturing the peculiarities of my country's past, and in this film he almost surpasses himself. As I expected in the film, the cinema is amazing, the editing is accurate and the story is central. <br /> <br /> The plots are against Seung Up, family ties are tested and broken, allegedly scandalous (and sometimes real), all to bring down the man who "fired". Seung Up is able to survive in some way against the detailed but sometimes convoluted perception of Seung Up's life. She becomes legendary because she can perfectly copy the famous Chinese paintings after just one picture. Art dealers and agents limit her and try to make money. In other words, people who want to use the true Seung Up artistic star will be formed. But he refuses to manipulate. His intelligence, both in massive hordes and in imperialist imperfections, impresses the audience, if not cast. <br /> <br /> What does Seung Up think? He has powerful emotions and opinions about painting, such as the aesthetic belief that paintings are living beings and are never really ready. He despises those who would try to change the art. And he does not care about politicians who use their opportunity to bring artistic beauty around them and then give up the artist to the horror. But he also thinks that painting plays a role in future revolutions. Fearsome scenes of French and Japanese foreign intruders are presented. I am a signed historical epic motif, and its multi-million dollar epic is under the influence. The headform creates greater grief for itself and for those who care for it when it refuses to paint. This is when the story takes on a completely new meaning, not only political, but also social. I take these questions in a commendable realistic way. He, Oh Won, becomes an indicator of Jesus. People believe that he is capable of artistic miracles, and the government feels he needs his artistic support, but the protagonist is still very independent and despised for what others want him to do or do. Finally, both the government and the people fall on Seung Up in a way that is taken directly from the Bible. His holiness becomes human; his humanity is not accepted; he dies (or escapes) from the sins of ordinary citizens, art critics, politicians who hound him. But does he die? Like most of my movies, the question remains. In this case, Seung Up becomes a truly immortal hermit? The film does not solve this issue; it is only a possible end to the real man of Chang Seung Up or Oh Won. There is no death, because death is not known. <br /> <br /> It is hard to find a mistake in this movie, but I've become so good to present different historical absurdities in my culture, that if it does, it's no longer surprising. As I am in films, cinematography, editing and writing are first first. It is a well-designed film that is permeated when I'm a crazy story. It is allowed that he can do it best through the music of ancient Korean pansor. But the film contains the form of this admirable art, and ultimately the viewers feel like they have become big, not to mention the story. And they have, because that's what I am a gift.
