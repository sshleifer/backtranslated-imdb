From the beginning of The Edge Of Love, the spectator is sent to the glorious world of World War II. We follow the lives of four people who may have been created for this film, the study of female friendship and the strains caused by marriage and infidelity. With the exception of one character called Dylan Thomas, perhaps the 20th century's biggest English poet. And his reaction to the surrounding world was not only selfish, but sometimes also despicable. <br /> <br /> This movie is based on Thomas's writings on love and romance. They were adapted to the sharp scenario of Sharman MacDonald (mother of Keira Knightley). Director John Maybury claims that the other three leaders were real people. <br /> <br /> All four are done very strongly. Sienna Miller is Dylan's wife, Keira Knightley is the cabaret singer Vera Phillips. Matthew Rhys is Dylan Thomas and Cillian Murphy is William Killick. The first part of the film takes place in London during the Nazi air strikes, where Vera strives for Willaim, a soldier waiting for a mission. Randomly, Dylan meets her first love, Vera. There, Vera meets Daitani's wife Caitlin. Though three are drinking, William successfully interrupts the Vera guard. <br /> <br /> The film follows their lives as Vera and William are married and sent to war. Vera is pregnant and returns to Wales with Dylan and Caitlin. There they face a sharp existence where Vera supported Dylan and Caitlin with their husband's war. Through these times, the friendship between Vera and Caitlin is growing. So Dylan's demonstration against Vera. He gives in. It creates the first test for two women. <br /> <br /> When William returns from war, he hardly knows his wife and has nothing to do with his childhood. Things get worse because Dylan looks at his friend's battlefield against fatigue (traumatic stress disorder). William realizes that something has happened between Dylan and Vera, and Dylan's house is talking about drunk. about maternity, infidelity, and attempts at murder in Wales. PTSD treatment is well done and should speak to an American audience. Some days (see end). <br /> <br /> Every star has a great moment. Miller, when he casts out his stitches in his head in response to his other child's abortion. Knightley and Murpy, when she finally binds her son. Oh hell, almost all of their scenes are awesome. And Rhys when he cleans himself up to get Vera's wife in jail. <br /> <br /> But the real star of the movie is Jonathan Freeman's cinema and John Maybury's direction. They seem to understand that no matter how good the story is or how historic Thomas is, this film is dominated by the two great actors of our time. And they love their scenes with stunning shots. Although this is not the best picture material, it is a very good film (much more interesting than "The Dutchess"). It has a visual lyric that emphasizes the use of Thomas's poetry. It is also clearly Knightley's second best result in his career and perhaps Miller's best. <br /> <br /> I've always been struggling with the artist's weakness, be it Hulce's Mozart or Captain Hoffman. But I was amazed at how little sympathy for Dylan Thomas. His struggle with alcohol is well known. But his opposition to William and Caitlin to get his first love for Vera puts him out ... ... a bad man. <br /> <br /> Is this the Academy Award? Clearly, no. At least not this year. It will be released from the state in March 2009, making it ineligible for academies. That's 9 months after it's published in the UK. Between reconciliation, Miss Pettigrew and Brideshead Revisited, the US has completed WW2 British period pieces. Damage. This film is better than others, except for reconciliation. But in this area, the Knightley soldier returns, but the man who left him.
