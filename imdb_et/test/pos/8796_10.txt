Hi everybody, I have to say that human traffic and all its characters are so funny. I live in Australia (melbourne) and I am finally out of the club and stay out of the whole weekend lifestyle. This film explains everything that is happening in the world today. So exactly that I can't stop it .... I was just like Moff, so my friends said and I didn't even see the movie .. I left for about 3 months at the weekend after a four-year intense party to change my life I was in the DVD shop when I saw Human Traffic and I remember my old friends attending, so I bought it to see what all the noise was. I looked at it 4 times in a row because I couldn't believe someone had made a movie that explains everything to T.. Anyway, this movie is the best and fun movie I've ever seen. in true everything that happens in the movie .. AND Moff is a legend !!! That's all I have to say. :) Enjoy 11/10 blew my socks when real it was, its exactly whats going on in the world .. Mr. rm i jabber much <br /> <br /> take care of all ...
