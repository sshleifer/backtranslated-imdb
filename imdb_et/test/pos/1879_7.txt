A person with Screaming Brain is definitely not a perfect movie, but I'm pretty sure it was never meant to be anything else than Bruce Campbell's star transportation, which means that it works as a summary of all his career: sarcasm, cheese, action and happy endings. Campbell as a writer is uneven - the story contains a lot of things that don't make much sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts because the female brain is transplanted?), And some scenes feel like better incarnations (a scene in a restaurant where Yegor and William fight over William's body , is directly from Evil Dead II). However, there are a lot of touching and non-consecutive ones that feel quite brilliant, for example, when William is at the height of his panic and screams at the top, "What are you looking at?" The film looks like a Sci-Fi Channel original, probably because it was. The action is actually pretty good. I especially liked Tamara Gorski as Tatoya; he was merciless and insidious, yes, but he seemed to have tragic air at some moments that the story never explored. Ted Raimi handled the usual "worshiping assistant" at an amazing level, and Bruce is funny as a lofty, sardonic, despicable American jerk. (Now that he has written his films, you think he would give himself a role he has not already written.) A screaming brain man is a strange, pointless B movie that should be enjoyable for someone who can cinematic experience too seriously avoided.
