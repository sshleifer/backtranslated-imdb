Don't hate Heather Graham because she's beautiful, hates her because she's fun in this movie. Like hip clothes and funky surroundings, its flick participants work well. Casey Affleck is hysterical and Heather Graham literally lights up. Small characters - Goran Visnjic {sigh} and Patricia Velazquez are like TALENTED because they are proud. Congratulations to Miramax and director Lisa Krueger!
