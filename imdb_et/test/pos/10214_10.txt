Featuring some amazing and wonderful characters, new mythology, perfectly designed and executed sets, Nightbreed is a great movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there was no well-known leader actor leading the film to find vagueness. Perhaps the driver's homosexuality, which makes the film illuminate the film inadvertently censored. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the movie is a monster movie / superhero genre treasure <br /> <br /> Progress that includes Highlander-style setbacks to different historical events would be interesting. Another idea would be to build a new Midian. Maybe in Texas somewhere or in the Lousiana swamps with crocodiles and a traveling freak circus.
