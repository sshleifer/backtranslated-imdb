I watched this movie a long time ago, but I've always loved it. The story speaks of a young girl, Sally O'Moyne, who discovers from a young age that when she prays to St. Anne, her prayers are answered, hence her lost linen blanket and the middle neighbor who prays with her. that someone should give him a black eye to frighten. Well, one minute later something hits him and he has a black eye. Then Sally believes in the power of prayer and decides to use that power to good. She is well known and loved in the neighborhood because she has copies / magazines filled with all her friends' requests in St. Petersburg. Anne. Meanwhile, the local boy returns home from college (I believe) and Sally is surprised how much he is an adult. Sally has a huge drunk on her, but she's so shy. Should he use his power of worship to St. Anne for her selfish desires or just to see if the most popular girls in school are trying to fast her dream man? This is a fun-filled grandfather of a movie who is so charming and brother-in-law, who is a fun and tedious and sworn neighbor in Ireland who plays grand-pop everyday. He has a story that he wants to buy O'Moyne's property, a small house in the middle of two large apartment complexes (in other words, O'Moyne's house is eye-catching with his cute buildings) <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely worth it look and good enough and rare to add to your movie collection. Hope you enjoy!
