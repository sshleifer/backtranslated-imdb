Hi, Hi and goodbye. but before I go, I want to talk to you. I just want to mention some of the keys to this movie. first is erotica. especially gay-eroticism. <br /> <br /> Yes, well. Let's start. When a man and a man love each other very much, they blend together with a remarkable, not to mention offer, explosion in the cinema, which we call a merchant of Venice. <br /> <br /> gay erotic love was sensual worse. and even more sensual. it was hardcore and emotional. it touched me inappropriately and I'm pretty sure I touched it back. and if no one saw, I touched too little. <br /> <br /> I laughed because the gate was banned. she was another friend of gay erotic love. oh antonio. antoni. just tone. I love you. more than you loved this man. whose name may include "B". he was very ugly. <br /> <br /> Anton was very greasy. he dragged his body into the capsule of fat and sensual juices in his hair and went to publish a screenat and introduced himself to the name of the film, ending with a movie, if not for gay erotic connotations, for love like anton. just tone.
