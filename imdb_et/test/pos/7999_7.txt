Batman's return is considered to be of high quality when it comes to superhero films. His predecessor, Batman, is, in my opinion, by far the greatest and thoughtful of the comic book genre. One says that Batman Returns was disappointing, he hasn't been watching the movie completely, and has kept Danny Devito acting as a penguin. Devito and Walken provide memorable moments. Batman's story is dark and Tim Burton has filled the way the comic depicts Batman. Batman Returns offers comic, action, intercourse and fantasy; and it should not be seen as "nonsense", although we all have the right to own opinions.
