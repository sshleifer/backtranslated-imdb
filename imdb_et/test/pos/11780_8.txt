Made up of a twenty-dollar resource budget, this thirty-minute short will inevitably delight George Lucas 'legendary '77 sci-fi strokes' Star Wars, which are most infectious. Writer / director Ernie Fosselius offers a winning and often intestinal crushing blend of ridiculous sound effects, unevenly staged scenes, cruddy special effects (you just have to love cheese scratched lasers, laptop asteroids and households) ... eer, I mean the spacecraft reversed), poorly dubbed dialogue, shameless teeth, and Richard Wagner's classic "Valkyride Ride". The characters are presented appropriately with a wide stroke; my favorites are probably the nervous Fluke Starbucker, the venerable Jedi Knight Auggie "Ben" Doggie and the angry archer Darph Nader (who casts something but incomprehensible filth). What's more, 4-Q-3 is clearly based on Oin's wizard, while Artie Deco is definitely a cheap vacuum cleaner. The real craftsmanship of this film is casting the legendary painter Paul Frees as a narrator; Cutters' tastefully rich and plummy histrionic tones add tremendously silly, but sideplitting tongue-in-cheek pleasure (choice lines: "You laugh! You cry! You kiss three bucks goodbye!"). Total hoot.
