This film is important for us who are interested in Western history because it uses authentic techniques in its production. <br /> <br /> Wagon train scenes are especially authentic; as far as I know, it contains the only scene that has ever been filmed, illustrating the technique of crossing the river in a bluff. Horses and mules must be lowered to the river level and wagons lowered to ropes and pulleys. The scene is such that I could watch it over and over again, simply trying to feel what the intersection was like ... and the early travelers did it over and over again. <br /> <br /> Melodramam is left out, this picture is both dress and style as authentic as they come and worth it alone.
