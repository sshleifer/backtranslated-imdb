The Vietnam War is definitely a long time before my time, but it has always been of interest to me and I've seen a lot of movies about it. All the others I saw were strictly involved in the front line of the battle. When I read the description "War at home", I found the term intriguing. None of the Vietnamese war films I ever heard talked about what happens to the soldier when the fight is over. One night, when switching channels, the film was filmed on Sundance. I put a distant distance and started looking at it. I didn't move from my seat in the whole two hours; it is one of those films that keeps you very interested because it is not possible to predict what will happen next. <br /> <br /> This movie made me a big fan of Emilio Estevez. I was very fond of him as Billy Kid in "Young Arms", but I never saw something he did later. Emilio turned out to be very talented and instructed in writing and acting. <br /> <br /> The movie is getting really up and running. I have trouble thinking about the point where it pulls. <br /> <br /> What amazes me that he didn't get an Oscar or any real recognition when it came out. This is a dramatic story of parents trying to cope with the fact that their son is not the one he used to be and probably not when they remembered him again. Definitely worth seeing.
