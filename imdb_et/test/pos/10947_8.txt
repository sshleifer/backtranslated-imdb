When you go to Twins Effect to look for a pure Hong Kong movie experience, you are disappointed. This does not mean that it is bad, but it is not a traditional Hong Kong film that works like Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle. It's decisively stupid and minor, so if you want a good bit of Hong Kong action, see John Woo or Yuen Woo Ping. This film has a lot of bottles for this stupidity and I thought the first thing I should do is explain what you're doing, because it's frustrated with lots of sails. <br /> <br /> Purists and those with more forgiving flavors are Twins Effect's beautifully silly kung-fu comedy. I liked it for a lot of different reasons, especially this is a wonderful female driver who shines each other thoroughly with the double effect of a fun comedy. I believe this is the first movie of the movie they've been, but they jump, hit and fly like flavored pros. </p> And the movie is quite deliberately written, making a lot of movie laugh out loud. Comedy is the most prominent thing here and it is a subtle, gentle comedy that depends on words like uninhabitable objects flying with La Stephen Chow. It has to be said that the blow is also very fun. The disco-dancing vampire series is classic. <br /> <br /> Action is a mix of two genres. It falls between the period of drama and sword fighting (which is more to the end) and the comedy way of Jackie Chan, coming out with a mix that sometimes sometimes a little derivative is always interesting to watch and occasionally throws up some truly innovative meetings. <br /> <br /> All this is great and the movie is very fun. Nevertheless, it has some couples. For example, Twins Effect is much more western in many ways than kung-fu fans are probably used to, the inevitable comparison with the Blade series is definitely a good example, even though Twins Effect is much better than Blade ever succeeded, especially in combat. Personally, it was also a bit of a shame to see the great use of Anthony Wong (Hard Boile by John Woo's classic hard offender), but the younger audience to whom it is targeted is unlikely to have noticed it or knew about Hard Boiled or his other films, so that it is really just a personal grasp. COMEDY, not balls on the wall kung-fu. Keep this in mind and you're fine.
