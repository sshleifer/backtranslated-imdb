Two years after his first release, Goldeneye still sits in Nintendo 64's first human shooter. Even the Quake and Turok series have not had a combination of graphic detail, sound quality, enemy intelligence, challenge and overall fun. give me back this game again and again. The missions have specific goals that force you to think like Bond, not just to shoot every on-screen baddie, but also to prevent cameras, disable security systems, protect hostages, protect Bond girls, and so on. Q plays in this game, including the famous watch. The game is based loosely on the film line, including all the major characters and the best scenes in the movie, from the dam bungee-jump to the prop-plane that comes out of the St Petersburg tank chase. Even if the layout is possible, it is maintained so that you can see different situations when watching the movie. Other levels are added to put the player and scenes together a little more. For each difficulty level, mission goals are heavier, enemies are smarter, and bullets are more deadly. I'm still not at the 00-agent level. Fraud can be opened not by entering codes or by pressing buttons, but by completing certain levels within a certain time and multiplayer, additional characters can be opened. Multiplayer is still the best among the first person shooters. It is not as sharp as Turok, but it does not slow down almost as much ... tons of choices give your friends each other again and again and once more to hit. N64 has better games like Zelda and all Star Wars, but the rare game has continued to play outstanding games with a first-person shooter who is not and will not be beaten until they started with Perfect Dark in 2000.
