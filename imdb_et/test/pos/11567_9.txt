Being a 90-year-old child, I really enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I had this great time and even more than the classic WB cartoons. <br /> <br /> I don't know why; In the early 1990s, cartoons were something special; I don't know if it was an atmosphere of insecurity, an intergenerational change, whatever. But "Tiny Toons" kept the 90's vibe and gave one of the most popular, funny and undervalued cartoons ever created. <br /> <br /> Memories are dim, but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related exhibition. Just no other cartoon gave me a laugh (before getting into teenage blinds). <br /> <br /> The characters were all funny and had a peculiarity that they had no real sign of control. Every single character was fun and deserving of being called a leader.
