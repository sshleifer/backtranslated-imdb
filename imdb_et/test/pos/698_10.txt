It was great when it came out. It was some of the best talents and a funny story. It was difficult for Candace Cameron and Tatyana Ali to choose who is the cozier, and add Carl Prince and all the other big names to Carlton, and you get a block. Ok, a deed of TV blocking, but still. If you find this move, don't miss it. <br /> <br />
