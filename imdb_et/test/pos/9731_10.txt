It's nice to see a new party that creates devastation in this series. I found this chapter fun. In fact, it would probably be my second favorite in the series. This film has little violence and is only PG-13. It differs significantly from other R-rated puppet films that were loaded with gore and violent chaos. However, lack of violence does not reduce fun. This movie also has extra special effects than the last movie in this series. Good.
