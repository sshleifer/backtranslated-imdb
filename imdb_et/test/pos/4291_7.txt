Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what to treat! Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounded up supporting roles in the forties of false and intrigues. Yet, every symbol retains the most conscience - the moral conscience is kept despite the obvious contradictions. "Contradictions are the source of all movement and life." If these words are true. Watson Anne Manning is at the center of this intrigue - she is the central conscience that the other three have locked. He's indecent. <br /> <br /> False facts are for everyone: one to protect your professional name; one to slow down due to family / partner pressure; one just does not want to face the consequences; one ironically cannot believe the truth and lies in saving friendship. These are all precarious situations. There's an intrigue - exciting to see how each deals and lies. The contradictions are indeed. Despite seeming dishonesty, dignity and heart are strong. <br /> <br /> The treatment of the subject and how each symbol behaves is masterfully presented with simple clarity. It is not sensational or complicated, as the second film "Where is the truth". Credits thanks to Fellowes' writing and the subtle performances of both Watson and Wilkinson. There is heat that comes through a seemingly bold or frustratingly hidden lie. It does not exclude the weakness of people, they meant well. And following the story, the course of events gave satisfaction and smiles as these two Manning's relationships have grown and matured. <br /> <br /> You can say that "Separate Things" is not an obvious act of drama or exciting scenes, but intrigue exists and it keeps your attention. The music of Tony Pierce-Roberts (Merchant-Ivory movie veteran) and Stanislas Syrewicz, whose mood and tone are reminiscent of the composer Zbignew Priesner (filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski Trois Couleur, especially Bleu 1993), deserve production. This is a British film that you just don't want to miss. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson (Anne, wife): debut debut 1996 debut; Hilary and Jackie 1998; Luzhin Defense 2000; Gosford Park 2001; Punch-Drunk Love, Red Dragon, Balance in 2002. <br /> <br /> Tom Wilkinson (James, husband): The Full Monty 1997; Government, Rush Hour (villain) in 1998; Bedroom 2001, Normal (HBO cable movie) 2003, Malaise 2004, recently as father Moore in: Emily Rose 2005 Exorism by Laura Linney. <br /> <br /> Rupert Everett (Bill): He's just a joyful "My Best Friend's Wedding" in 1997 with Julia Roberts and a wonderful "Ideal Wife" 1999 d: Oliver Parker, Oscar Wilde game.
