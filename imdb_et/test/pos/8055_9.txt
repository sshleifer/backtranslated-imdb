"The Phenix City Story" is a brutal, hard-to-find doctrine of what was once called "the City of American Evil". The film documents the events that led Alenama's lawyer Albert Patterson's Phenix City criminal syndicate murder, who made a bid to the Commissioner to clean up his home town's corruption and corruption. After his death, his son John Patterson took his father's coat and won the post, making Phenix City the first item on his agenda. <br /> <br /> Director Phil Karlson created a film with the ability to shock even today. The symptom is so relentless that the movie is actually hard to watch. We see beating and killing syndicates of crime to get what they want - beating and killing involves women and children, and especially one small scene that turns around the death of a little black girl is particularly disturbing. This is not a very pleasant movie, because there is very little in the end to reward viewers for sitting through this led event, but it is a well-made film full of intense and angry energy. The 15-minute prologue contains a number of interviews with real Phenix City residents, some of whom are represented by actors in the fictional part of the film. This gives the film an urgent quality that moves into the narrative, so we feel that we are watching the documentary, the feeling that has helped to make Karlson's filming in real places all the time. <br /> <br /> I am glad to have seen this movie, but it is one of those movies that will fill you with the right feelings of indignation and now make you helpless because you can't do anything about it. <br /> <br /> Rating: A
