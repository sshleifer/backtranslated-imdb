This show is great. "Haruhai Suzumiya" is not only a very well written anime show, but also reflects things such as philosophy, science fiction and small religion. Some points are fun and "cute" (due to the lack of a better term) to others. In fact, it may be affected by my lack of experience with Japanese anime shows, but it is one of the best of my genres I've seen. <br /> <br /> I mainly have to give credit to writers. From the original Star Trek I haven't seen such fantastic imagination on television. I hope the writers will continue to add wonderful new characters and provide more information on the large characters already included. <br /> <br /> 9/10
