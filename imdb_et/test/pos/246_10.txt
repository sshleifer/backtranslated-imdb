It is one of the best musicals of the 1940s. Excellent Technicolor shows Rita Hayworth's beauty and great hair. He should have painted more films, but then he was unable to get money for Columbia Technicolor spectacles. <br /> <br /> Rita is WOW like Rusty Parker - she is more than the number of the brightest numbers with Geen. He also seemed beautiful for a century's bathrobes, giving him the chance to play with his grandmother. <br /> <br /> The movie opens "The show must go" - it seems to me good - but Danny McGuire (Gene Kelly) hasn't impressed. His motto is work, work, work !!! One of the dancers, Maurine (Lesley Brookes), has decided to do better and listen to the Vanity Golden Wedding Cover Girl competition. Rusty just happens to be present at the hearings. In a very funny scene, Maurine was so audible and seen Rusty, giving her some tips on how to impress the judges !!! "Don't be shy and insecure - talk and shine". Rusty does it terribly !!! <br /> <br /> They decide on Maurine and go to the show to see him, but John Coudair (Otto Kruger) sees Rusty - he reminds him of someone's past. Cornelial (Eve Arden) is still a nightmare for listening to Rusty. "Whose accusations" are Genius (Phil Silvers) and dancers who have worked as girls (Rusty on cabbie). <br /> <br /> John remembers the long lost love (Rusty grandmother, Maribelle Hicks) for the first time she saw the song "A Sure Thing" competitions. In the meantime, Danny, Rusty and Genius are looking for pearls in their local canteen. They then start the happy song of the 1940s (in my opinion) - "Make your way tomorrow". <br /> <br /> "Put me to the test" is an amazing song and dance number with Danny and Rusty. In the meantime, Rusty has chosen Cover Girl and Danny McGuires. Lee Bowman appears as Danny's romantic rival and replaces things. Lee Bowman is probably the most boring leading man - so Danny never has to worry. <br /> <br /> Rusty (dubbed Martha Mears) sings "Long Ago and Far Away" and is danced beautifully by Danny and Rusty. The dresses Rita wears are stunning. They were designed by Travis Banton and Gwen Wakeling. Danny wants Rusty the best, but he fears losing. Gene Kelly is also a fantastic "Alter Ego" number where she herself dances. <br /> <br /> "Poor John" is another centenary, written in 1906, a funny song for amusing relationships - Hayworth sees pride in amazingly beautiful clothing. Look for Al Norman in both "Poor John" and "A Thing Thing". He was an amazing eccentric dancer who appeared in several early musicals, including "King of Jazz" and "Paramount on Parade". He was easily noticeable. <br /> <br /> "Cover Girl" dance is just wonderful. Rita was so talented - a beautiful and a great dancer. After beautiful models that parades through American top cover covers, Rusty breaks into a beautiful gold dress that dances the ramp in a very nice "Cover Girl" song. Gosh I just love this movie !!!! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
