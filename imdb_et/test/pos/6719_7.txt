Although it hardly equals other sci-fi movie giants, as in 2001. A THIRD FUTURE SPACE SYSTEM or CLOSED CONTACT, LIFEFORCE acts as a complete confusion between elements of scientific fiction and horror. Somehow, despite the dialogue that approaches the ridiculous and the same act of action, he succeeds in working on some very different elements. <br /> <br /> Relying on Colin Wilson's 1976 novel The Space Vampires, this film is directed by Tobe Hooper (POLTERGEIST; THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE) focuses on a joint US-British mission to the British spacecraft Churchill to study Halley Comet. Under the leadership of the American leader (Steve Railsback), they discover a foreign spacecraft in a comet coma. And when they study the interior of a spaceship, they find aliens who look like giant bats. Later, Churchill reaches Earth's orbit, but no response has been received from radio calls from the mission's home base, the Space Research Center in London. Columbia is launched to gather with Churchill, but they find the whole ship that is burnt - all but glass-covered alien creatures that are far from untouched by fire are perfectly perfect. Aliens are bought back to Earth ... and it happens incredibly. <br /> <br /> These space vampires flee from the Space Research Center, and instead of sucking their blood bites, their victims suck. "Life comes out of them completely. One of them is Space Girl, a thoroughly nude vampire, played by Mathilda May. Railsback, the only real survivor of Churchill, is bought by the SRC Manager (Frank Finlay) and British Special Representative (Peter Firth) to track Mayi, who is soon the vampires have turned London into a pure holocaust scene, people are either dessicated or become zombies, and NATO threatens to sterilize the city with a fusion of heat. The Railsback will end up in late May and sacrifice itself with a big metal sword. <br /> <br /> Despite this the frequent inconsistency of his script and its operation is undoubtedly uneven, but undoubtedly uneven, but still worthwhile, is some of the great special effects John Dykstra (STAR ​​WARS) has killed, some of which are the best. is the incredible orchestral performance of Henry Mancini, almost Wagnerian, just like John Williams' STAR WARS score - and Mancini, as he did before, uses the London Symphony Orchestra to start! <br /> <br /> These days were greatly forgotten, and the critical and office disaster in 1985, LIFEFORCE, if for some other reason it should be seen by anyone with a strange odd. There was never such a movie before, and that is definitely not the case again.
