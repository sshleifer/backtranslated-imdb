Film Haggard is the most entertaining film of all time. It has a frame from CKY (movies) and a great soundtrack. If you have seen CKY or Viva La Bami, you will notice that everything (of the two) is in it. Including Bami's parents and many other people. <br /> <br /> The story is related to Ryan Dunni's girlfriend Glauren (Jennifer Rivall) who is cheating on her, and she's trying to get her back. He does this when Valo (Bam) and Falcone (Dicamillo) swear by his house. There are many different characters with many different stories. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack has great music. Bands like Him and Him, CKY, Gnar Kill, Daniel Lioneye. Iggy and Stooges Pop and New Order. <br /> <br /> If you don't like Viva La Bam or CKY (movies), I doubt you like it. If you like this thing ... this movie is great.
