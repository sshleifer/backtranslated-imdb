God cuts himself with a straight razor, then he gives birth to his mother, which then comes through the sperm of the gods, the son of the earth. <br /> <br /> This is a one and a half hour film that depicts a dark version of how God created the world. His surreal, dark and poetic. The most important aspect of the film is my visuality. Taking a picture is a very grainy black and white film, using both slow moving and normal shooting. Sometimes even a fast movie and stop-motion. The scenes are long and drawn out, which sets a very strange mood. No sound was recorded during filming (I think), later sound effects such as criccets, water and other surrounding sounds were added, repeated over and over again. As you understand, this movie is definitely not impatient for a person ... <br /> <br /> I often felt like it was like David Lynch's Eraserhead, but it's even harder to understand and even pull out, but that's me good, i like it. This is definitely not entertainment (at least not a Hollywood type), so if you intend to review it, I suggest you set up. Be open and nothing like the end of 2001: the odyssey of space.
