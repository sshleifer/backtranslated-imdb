Okay, so I've read most of the comments on this movie, as well as the comments left by visitors to this site, and the feeling that I have the feeling that most of the comments posted by people didn't like this movie. That's why I'm writing now - I represent a minority because I did. I testify that I went to watch the movie because I am very impressed by Ryan Gosling's compelling abilities and the projects he has recently been involved in, nothing more than incredible. He's an amazing actor. Aside from this, I wanted to see this movie because it seemed intriguing to me ... why? Because it is a horse where you know "whoduniti" from the beginning and it is unusual. <br /> <br /> As the plot goes, two teenage boys are trying to commit a "perfect crime" because they believe in a twisted philosophy that only through crimes is human beings really free - unhindered and remember, innocent, acting out of their will. The relationship between Richard and Justin was difficult, referring to homosexuality, and worked perfectly with Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. Gosling was manipulative, controlling the smooth speaker, and Pitt was extremely book-conscious, socially uncomfortable. Enter the character of Sandra Bullock, who seems to think most people are not thinking. I think that when people see it as an executive producer, they automatically assume the role that an actor has when it is a self-esteemed thing. I didn't see it here. Without "Cassie" personal history of the former spouse who almost killed him, and who is not surprised to share similar features to Richard Hayward, he would never have wanted his instincts with Justin and Richard. The incident was apparently air-tight Ray, an unsuspecting school keeper and boyfriend friend. Even if the boys were interviewed at the end of the film, Bullock and his partner did not have much evidence about them, except that they lied about knowing each other and vomiting Justin remained in sight. There's the genius of the movie, because the philosophy the boys tried to prove by killing, involuntarily acting as a "true freedom", ended up with Justin, who finally got a conscience (and eventually left part of his conscience on the body dump). Without this important evidence, they had almost "the number of murders". And there, for readers who are so confused with the title as I've done it, I looked at it and found that something that is "by number" (for example in the countryside) suggests careful and critical planning and rigor. There's also a Sting song called "Murder By Numbers", but it's next to the point. :) <br /> <br /> Many readers questioned the necessity of the relationship between Cassie and his partner, but I think it was really meant to show how cynical and manipulative he had changed because of his history. He likes it or not, his story plays an important role in this film because without it he would probably have followed his instincts with Justin and Richard. Yes, it was a bit of a clich√©, "women despised, a woman who acted on every aspect of her life, but I think you have another movie about teen killers without the depth of Cassie's character and they just might have gone. There's no movie. <br /> <br /> And for the reader who commented that the teenagers obviously did not commit the perfect crime because the police were from the outset, can I remind you that the reason was that deliberately placed and fully traced shoe prints The guys wanted to be involved - it was a game, they were so sure they had committed the perfect crime they wanted the investigators to know first of all what they thought was the truth. What they didn't expect was that Cassie Mayweather There was an overwhelming instinct on his side. A little unbelievable? May be. Many crimes have been solved by the police officers who followed these instincts. But it's MOVIE! <br /> <br /> lm times and every time it made me a little more clear, and I liked it a little more. The more I looked at it, the more I was enthralled and scared by the psychological depth of Richard Hayward - there are people who like it. My main complaint about the film would be that they had a bit more central interactions between Justin and Richard (because we're confronted with the intrigue of the whole movie) and my main props go into characterization - each character was very different and interesting in its own way. It worked very well, though I would have given Ben Chaplin a bit more work (he is a good actor) and perhaps the character of Bullock. <br /> <br /> I think everyone should keep in mind that for a Hitchcock-type thriller that basically tells you "whodunit", it poses a great challenge to the writers to keep the audience up to the end . I think they did it quite well using some small plot twists all the time, the different dynamics of slow revelation, and enlightening the screen with young actors Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt for truly emotionally charged performances. I think that if we remove our innate cynicism and try to see how psychologically complicated characters and their interactions are, we can see all the visible plot holes and see the real texture and quality of this film, only those characters that were perfectly depicted. Especially Richard Hayward. Not that I'm biased. :)
