An interesting story of couples, this little flick manages to unite seemingly different characters and story all over the Second World War and succeeds in linking them without losing the audience. I was impressed by the depicted depth of the various symbols and also how much I really felt I and their motivation I understood, although the time spent on developing each character was very limited. The outstanding performance of those involved in this picture is easily noticeable. A fun, stylized movie with comic moments and a number of head-shaking events. <br /> <br /> 7/10
