Having grown up in the typing basin era and dealing with office politics and men who were able to enjoy the beautiful eateries everyday, this film hits the mark. Good afternoon in the afternoon. I understand that Louis Jordan wanted to work in this movie to play as opposed to GORGEOUS Suzy Parker. Everyone wanted to be and I believe it has worked well and kept up with time. Best screen in kiss between Hope Lange and late Stephen Boyd. <br /> <br /> It may not be apparent that something like this is plausible, but in fact it was probably even intimidation of sexual harassment. I thought the film was well cast, except Evan's terrible action. Which fatty ball, but he found his niche elsewhere. In addition, everyone came to the disc.
