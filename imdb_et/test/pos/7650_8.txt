It would certainly not have been my movie, but my husband saw it on television and said it was really good. So, on his suggestion, I bought a copy because I didn't know if it would ever be on TV. I had never heard of it, except Armand Assante. First of all, I had a hard time getting into the story, because the first part of the movie is confusing - and that doesn't make much sense. Only later did this film come together. Scene Cutting - if called, is a bit jarring - sometimes it seems that some shots have been cut out of each scene and the scenes are jerk - but I think it was made to add an unusual one (if it is a word). The story runs here and there, and almost all the time, when it's all developed, everything turns upside down and you have to think about who is the bad guy and who isn't. Or a bad woman. Action is very good - I wondered how much Norman Reedus looks like Leo Decaprio. The end was a real twist, totally unexpected, which I liked. Good exhibition.
