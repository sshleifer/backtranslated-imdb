Hercules Avenger is by far the best single game I can remember. The accusation made by the critics - cutting and pasting the two previous Hercules films, to which new materials have been added to make it fresh - is that this cutting and pasting method solves one of the central problems of sword and sandal films. Most of these films fall dramatically in the middle third - usually a lovely love story or an arcade political intrigue or both (the Queen falls in love with Hercules and her evil brother, etc.). Look at the exciting finals. Hercules Avenger cuts all of this nonsense from the original film and adds a rather lively narrative to the Hercules impersonator who is tempting his way to power. (It should be noted that this episode also acts as a distant but sharply critical remark about the rise of fascism in Italy.) It also creates a fine final wrasslin between the true Hercules and his impersonator. <br /> <br In a narrower focus, I could add that further editing has improved individual scenes borrowed from other movies. For my money, this scene of evil is much better than it first appeared in Hercules and Captive Women, as it has been tightened by reducing the complications of multiple characters and their pieces. <br /> <br /> Monsters, a spooky underworld atmosphere borrowed (literally) by Mario Bava, from the whole city, destroyed, and the usual amount of gorgeous babes revealing bathrobes. Since no one thinks that any of these films would compete with seven samurai - or even a great seven - it seems a little funny to keep the movie from other films against it.
