For those who remember the initial impact of this video, it will never be forgotten, and Thriller's viewing is all that needs twelve years old. But even though it's a great video, it's not perfect, though it seemed at that time. When this video first came out, nobody had ever seen anything like that before. Now video footage has grown exponentially and Thriller's fresh look opens its bugs. Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song? When Michael Jackson has left his daughter after leaving the cinema, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choirs. When he gets a zombie, the time when he sings again, his zombie makeup disappears inexplicably and he sings again and again and again, as if he had compensated for his earlier absence. It could be the first time a song was ever deconstructed to fit the music video, but it wasn't the last time. This continues to be a problem for MTV. The best videos, like Jackson Billie Jean and Beat It, have used music, not the other way around. Still, Thriller is very fun and the absolute must be in Halloween.
