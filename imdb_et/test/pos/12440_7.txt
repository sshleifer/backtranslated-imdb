The happiest days of your life will introduce some of Britain's greatest comedy tales of its time to the traditional farce and top class. In general, it is a quiz with English behavior, with only girls who make a great contribution to the dark walk. Margaret Rutherford, Alastair Sim, and - especially! Joyce Grenfell is all fantastic, giving us a lot of laughter when they express their complete horror with what they have to do. As the film moves forward, the changing things are facing and bridging with the tour in the school, because the parents are at the top of the crackers. <br /> <br /> Here I mention Joyce Grenfell and her wonderful character Miss Gossage. He is so extraordinarily innocent, stupid, apologetic and ineffective that he seems to steal the whole movie. He gives the biggest laugh during the flirting with the male teacher ("Call me!"). <br /> <br /> While some movies are slow or dated and not always very engaging, most of their sparks are retained and hardly pauses for romance. Suitable for stupid, harmless strangulation. <br /> <br /> 7/10
