Will Smith is an excellent "Relationship Doctor" to heal all his relationships. <br /> <br /> I expect this to be a standard RomCom with little fun. I'm glad to report that I was wrong. Will Smith is delightful and unexpectedly "fresh" in this Andy Tennant vehicle. Surrounded by a large, supportive cast, interesting story and a smart dialogue, I was thoroughly busy. <br /> <br /> We found this one cute, peculiar and inspirational without preaching. <br /> <br /> It sets 7.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
