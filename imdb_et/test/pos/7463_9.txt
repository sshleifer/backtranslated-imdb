I'm really surprised at how little fame this film was. I think it's related to distribution companies, and so on. <br /> <br /> Don't be idiots - if you are looking for fun with this movie - this is a very nice movie that goes through a few hours and it's about ..... girls and boys and whats not too much story between them , but not all movies should be PULP FICTION should they? it's nice and lovely and gives time. Girls also have a very good look and make the whole movie even more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Why did I only give her 9? and the story can be more mediocre and more persuasive. at some point you will start to see little less reliable events. Small spoiler: The baby wakes and the father goes in and tries to relax him. now i'm not talking about a little crying, but a hysterical crying and 30 seconds after my dad goes out and a "baby sleeps" - excuse me when and how exactly you get him alone and sleep and leave his room in 20-30 seconds. but ignore this little pick, because the film itself is not Docudrama - it's fun and should be ignored.
