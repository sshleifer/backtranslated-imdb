When I saw LAUREN BACALL on CACTUS FLOWER in Broadway, I never dreamed that one day I would see an actor like INGRID BERGMAN playing the role of Bacall on the screen. But here, Ingrid lets her hair go for some good comedy moments when the dentist sees WALTER MATTHAU as his wife so he can go on with what he said to the GOLDIE HAWN. <br /> <br /> This is a story for smiles from start to finish, with good sense of humor that never runs out of dry humor and sense throughout its working hours. There are many one-liners or gags that go beyond the usual situation of the comedy stuff one TV hears - the lines are real because they fit so well with characters and motifs. <br /> <br /> Daffy, a girl who weighs (at first) suicide over her unhappy things with Matthau, with the GOLDIE HAWN (fresh from her days as the "laugh" star of the TV) makes a foolish blonde perfect. It's easy to understand why he won the Oscar supportive actor. <br /> <br /> Ingrid draws a surprisingly rare comedy, although there are times when she seems to be a little too chronically for this part. In any case, it is a surprising choice to play with a nurse who puts the office into freezing, but is much warmer. <br /> <br /> Like Goldie's neighbor, Igor, Rick Lenz feels great and makes him the right match in this last scene. <br /> <br /> Matthau plays a character that has become his trade in all of Neil Simon's roles he had - a lovable cadre who comes in to lie when he speaks after being lying. <br /> <br /> This is a rib-roaring comedy that you laugh loudly on some of the fun lines Abe Burrows and IAL Diamond have been able to beat on the French farce.
