I do not believe honestly that this movie is no longer appreciated. Claude Chabroli could be described as French Alfred Hitchcock, and while this film is just another I have seen (the first is Le Boucher), I can already see that this guy is something special just the strength of these two films. The film is co-produced by France and Canada and takes place in Canada. The cast consists of British and Canadian stars and high-quality performances with the rest of the film; most of them are also of high quality. The film is a mystery of murder and begins when a young girl under blood is brought to the police station. After interviewing the inspector Carella, it turns out that a young girl, Patricia, and her sister Muriel attacked a man who killed his sister and allowed Patricia to escape. But as the investigation continues, Patricia goes back to the station to provide new evidence showing the murderer a lot of shocking identity. <br /> <br /> The performances of this movie are great. Donald Sutherland is traditionally modest, but he fits his role very well and I do not hesitate to call his performance as a blood relative as one of his best. The film also includes revolutions supported by the British stars Donald Pleasance and David Hemmings, both of which give good turns; Particularly pleased to show how big the actor is and emphasizes what is shameful that he continued himself in Halloween films. Unknown Aude Landry is also a great result in the role of Patricia. The film is very mysterious in the first hour and really keeps the audience busy. When Inspector Carella discovers Muriel's diary, the film becomes more dramatic, showing her latest activities; and while this part of the movie is not as good as it was before, it is still interesting and leads to a great twist at the end! In general, blood-relatives are a great film that deserves to be better seen. Le Boucher is better known to Chabrol, but it's at least as good for my money! Highly recommended viewing.
