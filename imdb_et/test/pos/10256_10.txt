Cooley High is such a big movie that even the soundtrack of the period, the urban landscape, the wardrobe and the slang ... still don't feel dated. The music itself is timeless classic. <br /> <br /> Instead, it swallows to your right. This is the key to a good movie. From start to finish it won't let me win and I'm never tired of watching it. <br /> <br /> Its end is unique in that it is one of the most sad and at the same time the end of the resurrection of all films. Maybe there are some because (Backdraft comes to mind), but Cooley was the first and much emotional.
