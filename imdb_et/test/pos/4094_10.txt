The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most amazing relaxing and fun musical film of ALL TIME. James Hilton's 1973 musical remake of mythical SHANGRI-LA! is a real special pearl. BURT BACHARACH's music and HAL David's words. A strange mix of straight drama, adventure and musical sequences. This is the difference between making the only war musical fantasy ever filmed. <br /> <br /> This movie was critical and financial disappointment in the United States, but made a lot of money abroad. Only in America it failed. A very different and unique approach as a film musician, it deserves much better credit than it is given. LOST HORIZON is a story that is an incredible adventure and both the 1937 Frank Capra film and the 1973 music are loyal adjustments to the James Hilton novel. What I like about the 1973 version is the freedom in which musical numbers are presented. The film has a prestigious and talented director and operator. It's BURT BACHARACH Shangri-La and it's a great place. Songs like WORLD are around, sharing joy and living together, growing together creates happiness that Hilton wrote in his novel. Why should Shangri-La not be a cozy place? Two love songs, I HIGHLY HEIGHT, and deleted I came to you in sensitive places in the picture. Both songs have a calm and soft spoken quality that is very much in line with the philosophy of the story. What's more, the things I don't want are a good duet with a strong melody. This is a nice change between different perspectives and who can hurt Olivia Hussey and Sally Kellerman's stitching, singing and dancing? They are a great team and the number is well staged. <br /> <br /> I found this story always interesting as High Lama robs someone from the outside world to take their place in Shangri-La. The nature of the High Lama is a gentle soul, but somewhat radical for humanity as a whole. He has no hope that the world would be outside Shangri-La. If this film was rebuilt today, it would be interesting to see more emphasis on the leading character, the conflict of RICHARD ONWAY against what he left off the world, unlike what he found in Shangri-La. <br /> Of course, in order for the film to be credible, the character of RICHARD CONWAY must be presented at the end of the suffering amnesia as it was in the book. Neither LOST HORIZON film version was faithful to the novel in this respect. Did Conway find Shangri-La or was it intended? Did they all die in an airplane accident? Every person has his own idea of ​​what his Shangri-La would be. The contradiction with Conway, who wants to believe in Shangri-La and return to his old life in the outside world, is powerful. I like the face of melancholy Kellerman, Kennedy and Van because they look at their friends leaving the mystical valley. Interesting is how Conway does not want to leave Paradise but is pushed by his brother. Both versions of LOST HORIZON work differently, but both are successful in finding James Hiltons' ideas in a hidden valley where money is not worthy and moderation is the rule. So, in some ways, it is in its capital anti-capitalism, where money and materialism are not motivation. The rule is people's resignation, dignity, compassion, courtesy, etiquette, and living in harmony with each other. <br /> <br /> LOST HORIZON has a much stronger story than most musicals. He is trying to answer the basic basic tasks and hardly can fail. It should be remembered that LOST HORIZON was in 1973 after CABARET. It was no longer fashionable to break the characters in musical music that other singers could not duplicate. LOST HORIZON was an easy-to-reach target for critics. Its expectations were high, almost unreasonable. There were two targets, the producer, ROSS HUNTER and BURT BACHARACH, and the critics had both. Ross Hunter had enjoyed the producers' decades of financial results, and LOST HORIZON was the aftermath of his 1970s dropping airport. This movie was by far the largest universal toy and the success of this picture highlighted decade of disaster films. For years, AIRPORT was the most spectacular film ever seen on television. It was nominated for 11 Academy awards, including the best picture. At that time, Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the most successful songwriters in the country. LOST HORIZON's unshakable sentimentality was hardly a barrier to movies like EASY RIDER, MIDNIGHT COWBOY and GODFATHER. Sex and violence were a new border at the end of the 1960s, and at the beginning of the 1970s, the audience had films that were not visible on the screen. Lavish's musicals were no longer well received, no matter how well they were made. Today, LOST HORIZON can be enjoyed and appreciated on many levels. It is the ultimate enchanting film with a strong story, great music, an expensive budget, and some strange humor. This is unusual in the sense that music is not played before the movie for 45 minutes. This changes the course in the middle when the mystical valley is brought in and why not? LOST HORIZON '73 is a heavenly film that deserves rediscovery. Lost and legendary treasure that deserves much better than its reputation.
