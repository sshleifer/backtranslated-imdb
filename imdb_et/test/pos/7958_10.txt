Palwol ui Christmas is very Korean if you have been to Korea or have Korean friends, then you should know what I mean. Korea is a very traditional people, they see love very much. a feeling you can't find in today's world. I think that's why this movie is so special. it is wrong to compare this movie with Shunji Iwai's "Love Letter", the Japanese are very good, but can never do like Palwol ui Christmas. If you have the opportunity, check out this movie yourself.
