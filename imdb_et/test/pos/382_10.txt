I've been using this film for my college ethics courses for over 10 years (including Woody Allen's "Crimes and Misdemeanors" - another terrible, multi-level ethical study). <br /> <br /> This is fiction. I'm not focusing too much on the unrealistic features of "Strangers" because all fictional films are obviously wrong on many levels. I love the movie as a comedy, saying tense, with many ironic twists and visual pleasures - even if it's "incredible." The story is so good that I don't even think about criticizing this credibility (although I have to admit that the tennis game seems to me to be the weakest part - too much Hollywood fluff and not enough tennis competition). <br /> <br /> Some of the issues that have emerged in the film that allow true moral education and ethical debate are: <br /> <br /> 1. Ethical inactivity: some of Guy's weaknesses are for Hitchcock. The primary ethical review of the film is the risk that it will not be able to formulate its moral position. Guy is unable to effectively block Bruno's insane suggestions at first. The interesting question is, why and how does Guy behave so passively, inefficiently? The possible answer is his depression due to his intense and complex divorce process. <br /> <br /> 2. Miscommunication: Guy makes another failure at the start: on the train to get fast, he agrees that Bruno's ideas are all good. But the literal meaning of Guy contradicts his tight, sarcastic meaning. Bruno literally takes an agreement on crushing murders. The guy takes the sarcastic meaning to escape from any murder agreement. To some extent, Bruno may partially pretend from the outset that the agreement has struck to lead Guy's affiliation to the web. Bruno manipulates Guy; Guy's linguistic vagueness on the train gives Bruno the chance to put an "stranglehold" on Guy. Bruno manipulates Guy can take other meanings. . . . <br /> <br /> 3. The Secret: Some have speculated about the sexual relationship between Guy and Bruno. This seems ridiculous at first, especially since Guy seems to be heterosexual in his relationship with Miriam and Anne. But remember that Guy is ineffective for both women. Guy appears (stereotypically - I remember 1951) feminine, especially with Bruno. Guy, a strong athlete, is weak inside. Bruno is also in contradiction (playing "against himself"), first appearing seemingly and physically strong, but then showing some "feminine" qualities (Bruno's work of fashion and feet; his emotional emotion with Guy in different situations; Bruno kisses and desperately wants his mother's hand loves, other finer gay stereotypes that have a secret meaning from Hitchcock's point of view). I wish I could hear Hitchcock explaining his targeted meanings. <br /> <br /> 4. Unfairness and mistrust: Guy makes some colossal flaws that hide family and police truths about Bruno. Guy cannot fully understand that admitting guilt can be better than resurrection or delay in confession. Again, Guy guides passivity, insecurity, fear - and perhaps hate himself, closer to Bruno's own dignity when we care to see or testify. Both Guy and Bruno act with their emotional parables. <br /> <br /> 5. Lack of Evidence: Guy has a problem to prove evidence to justify himself. Going to the police quickly would solve the big problem, Guy tries his own doubts and uncertainty: there is no desired chip; the inability of the alcoholic professor to declare on behalf of the guy; obsessive need to appear politically pristine; and other personality factors that cause Guy protection. He's just as dysfunctional as Bruno - just not that dangerous (some can still be blamed for Guy's murder). <br /> <br /> 6. Disease and Mental Disorder: An interesting question is how legally is Bruno responsible for the murders? The more ethically incompetent Bruno is the sick sociopath, the more guilty a man who is healthy and could not prevent crimes and act morally. Guy's failure is like a man who doesn't call the police when a sick friend threatens to commit suicide, and death. It can be said that more than one crime has been committed and that Guy is emotionally hobbled accomplice. <br /> <br /> These and many other movie features make "strangers on the train" a moral game. diamond for philosophical and cinematic reflections.
