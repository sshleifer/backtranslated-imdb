It was a great show. It came to PBS home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (from EnVogue) played a teenage daughter. The exhibition focused on topics such as gender, peer pressure and puberty. It was a middle-class black family with a teenage daughter and son who moved to the middle class of Oakland or somewhere (I don't remember). I remember several episodes, but what I usually remember was when their cousin first got a period. I was probably 7-8 when I first looked at it, and I was able to run the program. It was a great show. I don't remember the boy's name at the boy's show, but I was always confused by Kevin Hook.
