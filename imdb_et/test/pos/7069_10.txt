<br /> <br /> Such a film that requires too much audience but most of them are disappointing. I think that the Mexican people who (either in support of Mexican films or to see Mexico's most important films) saw it, half of the people went out of the theater when I watched it, this is definitely not the kind of movie you could expect. I also think of people from other countries who dared to spend 2 hours to see it until the end, "what piece." In order to understand Cronica de un desayunot, Mexico must be familiar with one of the low middle classes (or even better, be part of them). There is nothing random about this film, the family is and has what many families at least share in Mexico. You have to keep this open minded in order to fully accept it, not the movie you look after. The older brother did not let anyone sit on his RED couch, the sister is staying no matter how he wants to leave, the younger brother goes on an excursion and everything he is interested in is the yellow radio, the mother has to prepare the family breakfast, no matter how intense and intolerant the situation is. Father came back, who knows how long, Mom is able to live on a passionate night, which somehow turns out to be a moment, and can repeat all the attitudes of his sons ... The stories in the house are surreal (and so is the film), the travesty who is looking for your penis, factory worker, and his suicide attempt, hidden by his girlfriend's kisses, a fatty man who, with his interest, rides a conversation with homosexuals with his sister? a woman? mother? ... The music doesn't pretend too much, but it gets a lot, not more than drift, tymbals, some strings. Thanks to a good movie, as it was made and released. <br /> <br /> One of the best Mexican movies ever! And one of the less obvious, even by Mexico itself, regardless of what it should have been. <br /> <br />
