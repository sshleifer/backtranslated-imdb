Charlie Chaplin's small trams or small men won World War I, called at that time a great war, with one hand, even for capturing Kaiser, which all Allied forces could not do. Too bad this is all a dream that is somewhat challenging and the weakest part of this subtle quieter (almost 46 minutes of feature film). <br /> <br /> including Charlie, who has to eat a gas mask to eat Limburger cheese from home using cheese against the Germans; Charlie sleeps with a water-flooded ditch next to a soldier, which he continues to irritate; Charlie hides himself as a tree - one of his best sketches - and Charlie pretends to beat his friend who has turned into a PK, hugging him when the enemy is outstanding. <br /> <br /> One amazing feature is how much Charlie, when he is in front of enemy lines dressed in German, reminds Hitler of ten years before Hitler and his Nazi strikes to dominate German politics. Apparently, Hitler designed his film after Charlie's appearance.
