I had to be about ten years old when my uncle took me and my brother to see this martial arts movie "DRIVE IN" ride around Long Beach. The title was "GOD HAMMER", which I can never forget for some reason, but what I remember is different scenes that have left a mark in my mind forever. <br /> <br /> My brother always reminds me of a movie, although it has been forever because we saw the movie. From time to time I look for the years I would look for in the rental shops, and from time to time I would check on the web and for some reason it seems never to be available or no one knows what movie I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> If I only knew if it was available, I'd be happy to buy this movie. If anyone is aware of its availability, please let me know.
