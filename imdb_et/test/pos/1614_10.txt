I first saw "Death in Venice" in 1971 about 15 years ago, I found it moving deeply and thinking about it. Looking at it a few days ago, I realized that it was near the top of the big works of cinema. Hardly any dialogue will admire the spectacular cinematography, subtle action and, above all, Mahler's music, without which the film simply does not exist. <br /> <br /> "Death in Venice" is the stunning adaptation of Luchino Visconti's Thomas Mann's short story to a famous composer (in a short story where he was a writer but made him a composer in the film was a great idea that works great) Gustav von Aschenbach (loosely Gustav Mahler ), who travels to Venice in the summer of 1911 to recover personal losses and professional failures. His search for beauty and perfection seems to be ready when he sees an incredible divine beauty boy. Ashenbach (Dirk Bogard) follows the boy wherever he never tries. The boy, Tadzio, belonged to very rare beings who have a mysterious and unimaginable power that fascinates you, fascinates you, captures you and makes you imprisoned. Ashenbach became one of the charms of Tadzio spells. He became addicted to him; he fell in love with him. Did it bless or curse him? I think both. He died in an unattainable, impossible, but beautiful love, the object of which was perfection. The last picture Ashenbach's eyes held the boy's silhouette surrounded by the sea and the golden sunlight. Nothing can compare the beauty and charm of the scene, and it is death that can only be dreamed. If he could, Ashenbach would probably have said, "I was able to see one face of perfection, I couldn't bear it, but I was told to know it was there, in this world, and now I can die in peace now because it happened to me. "Unforgettable music, Gustav Mahler's 5th Symphony of Haunted Adagnets found the perfect use in the perfect film. It reflects the emotion of every major character - it hurts, lasts, hopes for hope, and it summarizes the idea that when you are blessed with a beauty meeting, you are condemned. I can come with hundreds of movies that use classical music to perfection, but nothing can ever be compared to "Death in Venice". Dare to say that Mahler's music is its main character - it changes and sounds different, depending on what's happening on the screen. It sounded amazing when Ashenbach returned to Venice, which he thought was his happiness, but turned to his death. It seemed grim when he first entered the sea from Russia. You can hear so many different feelings - tenderness and respect, confusion and self-expression, worship and melancholy, but always - LOVE, which gives the purest happiness and breaks the hearts (literally). The viewer's film is similar to what the boy was for an aging composer / writer / artist. We are fascinated and captivated by its power and beauty as much as Achenbach was the boy's mysterious charm.
