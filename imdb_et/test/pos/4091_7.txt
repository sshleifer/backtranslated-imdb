The film is great. Action, cinematography, direction and music are enchanting. It seems to me that the reason why so many filmmakers are low is because they are committed to the original version of 1937, where Ronald Coleman plays. This movie - good reason! - Created an incredible level. From the conversation with people who saw the original when they first appeared, I believe that the effect was something like the first Starwars movie today. I've seen it. It was and is wonderful. But this does not mean that this version is not worth it. The first scene will take you to the 1973 version. Noise and noise are fantastic, especially when they prepare you for the peace of Shangri La and the music of Burt Bacharach is beautiful. So - enjoy the 1937 version anyway. But do not let it diminish the enjoyment of this 1973 version by letting King Jackson off the 1935 year this year.
