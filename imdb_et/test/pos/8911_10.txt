First, the alien saves a small black boy and Mexico, regardless of what the IMDb plot summary shows. This film is the purest of men's fantasies, racial rape. The main character of this film is the dope of George Michaelesque, who does not understand the primary human progress, such as drug abuse and murder. In fact, every time he uses violence to solve the problem, he has an internal conflict that physically hinders him. What a square. In any case, my favorite scene is when he writes a letter to gang members asking them to meet him to protect the 500 bucks they get from the reading center. At the meeting, countless Chicano gangsters are surrounded, but he keeps his cool head. In slow motion, he hits a stop sign on a wooden post that breaks the contact. Then still in the slow motion the gang leader points out, "Noooooooooooooooooooo, mooooooooooooore!" Gang members follow. Yes, right? The beauty of this film in these simple solutions is social problems such as prostitution and gang violence.
