It's an incredibly fun action / exploitation in the 80s. The rules of Charles Bronson are Paul Kirsey. Roisto is terrifying. The soundtrack of Jimmy's page is ridiculously bad. Alex Winter (Bill of Bill & Ted) is great as one of the street points destroyed by Bronson and his team. Team? Oh, these are the cities that have fallen down, who, together with Bronson, will win back the streets. The whole movie is enjoyable, in the last half hour or so that it explodes non-stop and chaos. 9/10
