The only conceivable mistake in this movie is the title !! Please stop comparing it to the first one! In my previous review, I made only the first to separate it. If you haven't seen and curious about the movie, forget the first one and invent a different name for it. Nothing is the same and has the mood all over it. It is a great exponent of the comedy of the early 80s. I seriously doubt that such big names in this movie did because they were crushed or even wanted to do the first time. Anyone who ever wanted to hit snobbish aristocracy should love that little opus. I argue that the only reason why it is at the bottom of IMDB 100 is because of its title. Usually I hate such movies (i.e. adam sandler, going to fear, farrelly bros ....) but this film keeps me mysterious. I can't, maybe it's like a bad relationship that I can't get out of or just ridiculous innocent pleasure. In both cases, this is the least underestimated behind the 80's film The Stunt Man. <br /> <br /> Robert Stack-WE LOVE YOU !!! (1919-2003)
