"Admissions" is a good drama, even though they are some end-of-life problems. Lauren Ambrose plays Evie, who tries to avoid college. In order for her mother not to overcome her work, she makes poems that everyone thinks that her spiritual challenge was written by her sister. All actors are first class, especially Lauren Ambrose and Amy Madigan. They both made great performances. The climax is also very powerful. There are only two bad parts. First, Stewart Worthy, played by Christopher Lloyd. His part is underdeveloped. The second weakness is the end. It goes around, which I did not expect in 84 minutes. Besides, the movie is definitely worth it.
