The first picture you have spoken has come back from oblivion and now you can hear it and see it! In the autumn of 1894, in New Jersey's West Orange Edison laboratory complex, Thomas Edison's companion William Dickson attempted to combine two existing technologies (phonograph and kinetoscope) to record sound and images together. In the event that Dickson was unable to sync audio and image playback, so this experimental movie was never released to paying audiences ... and (unlike many silent movies Dickson did for Edison at that time) is not the official title. . The silent image (recorded at 40 frames per second) has been in the Library of Congress for years that film historians know with quiet curiosity. It was also known that the soundtrack was recorded on one of the raw wax balloons at Edison's national historical site, although no one knew which one was. <br /> <br /> But now it has changed. Recently, curators were placed in a wax cylinder, which had been broken into several parts. They were redundant: reproduction and digitization of sound were obtained. Walter Murch, a Hollywood veteran audio editor, cleaned the background noise and tried to digitize it to sync with a film that Murch had digitally shot at 30 frames per second. The sound and the picture are synchronized in the end! <br /> <br /> The movie starts with the screen man's voice: "Are your other friends ready? Go ahead!' (The invisible speaker remains unknown, but apparently Dickson's assistant Fred Ott.) On the screen, Dickson plays the violin in a huge funnel mounted on a tripod (one of Edison's audio recorders), while two male laboratory assistants beside the camera are each dancing at the fast pace of dance at Dickson's music pace. <br /> <br /> The film lasts barely 17 seconds: just as long as we can surprise this raw material technology with the laughter of two men who poured each other's weapons. Talking about this, here is a WARNING: A well-known but extremely inaccurate reference document (The Celluloid Closet made by Vito Russo late) contains a frame extension from this movie and is identified by The Gay Brothers. It is wrong. "Gay Brothers" is a completely different film that Dickson made in Edison's lab during the same period. "The Gay Brothers never had a soundtrack: this is a short feature film of two brothers who are not" gay "in the sense that Russo meant it. For deceased, Mr Russo, for his own reasons, wanted us to perceive Dickson's experimental soundtrack (supposedly the first film music!) As a 19th-century homoerotic artifact. (Hmm, what is it about gay men and musicals?) Sorry, but there's no such content here. <br /> <br /> This vital movie deserves 10 out of 10 ratings. no "lost" movies should never be considered irreversible if not intentionally destroyed: I am pleased to announce that this film has finally become available to this producer's target group, more than a century after filming the movie!
