Even from the beginning of the movie I really love the art and canvas of one of the Japanese country islands. We see some green green mountains and the eastern houses in the coastal town. In a moment we look at the beauty of the Pacific Ocean on the widescreen of the theater. And to prove how big this film is, I have to say that Charles Darwin would be proud. Teachers of development classes and school science, such as biology, would be fantastic in favor of Hayao Miyazaki's new "Ponyo". As you can see, the title can be a perfect animation icon for the media, represented in all classrooms and audiences. <br /> <br /> In addition to all its scientific aspects, we immerse ourselves in the blue water for this exciting story. We have a thin, old and powerful witch named Fujimoto, who lives in a submerged place and is cynical about the expansion of the city of mankind and the pollution of industrial waste. He wants to get complete control of the seas and the cute look for a peaceful aquatic environment, including fish and organisms. Fujimoto, whose blood is half-human and semi-amphibious, resembles both the ocean-loving anti-hero and the antagonist; similar to James Bond's villain with Stromberg Spy who loved me, who is operating the dubbed underwater city of Atlantis. <br /> <br /> His daughter, whom he treats as an overworked pet, is called Ponyo. She is a big goldfish who already looks like a beautiful red hair girl. The Father forbids him from a true human world, claiming that it is dangerous and too much to handle. But to be honest, Ponyo's curiosity is as strong as his gracious nature. Ultimately, he crushes building strength, similar to Nick Park's "Chicken Run" admiring scenes, and shakes the free father of rocky and fossil water from the city and swims on the Japanese water surface and, for happiness and joy, falls into the caring hands of a young ship tanker captain named Sosuke. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sosuke lives in an ocean fronthouse with a nice-looking beach (or cliff-filled beach) with two very senior parents, an older mother at home Lisa, and the first companion of a Koichi tanker. Lisa seems to be angry with her husband that she has left the ship and left her on all the housework. Moreover, the black magic published by Ponyo causes an apocalyptic chain of events: the moon is approaching too close to the ground and waves rise due to imbalance of the tide interaction forces, and humongous tsunami waves keep the city calm but evacuated. . But what seems to be underestimated by this curse and literally more powerful than supernatural power is love and intimacy with the childish captain Sosuke and the divine red head Ponyo, who wants to be a sensitive person than only a preserved fish. Like shiny hair and free-spirited horses in the Lord of the Rings, Ponyo reminds me of that. <br /> <br /> I can write and the best of this amazing animated film, "Coraline", which was in theaters in February. And now, Hayao Miyazaki, celebrate her eyes with another 10-star rating from her animation fan Graham Abraham. 2009 can fill dozens of animated films; However, Ponyo is the toughest film of many beautiful environmental films and it should be a new miracle in the world.
