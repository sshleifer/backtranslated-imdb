For some unexplained reason, it seemed that Jerry's films often came out for certain quarters, although they were rarely disappointed. This is one of the great secrets of life because her films have always been a "good feeling" for me. But this movie is not only bad: it is an extremely good and smart comedy. For those who can be dragged into "modern" crude oil or cruel humor, this film doesn't see: there's nothing and you waste your time. <br /> <br /> I've only seen the movie once on television. I've been waiting for this time to see it again, and it's been a few years. You think the idea that a surprising millionaire who won against the Nazis by the staff of his small private army would be bored? Well only Jerry Lewis dare to try such a plot for out and comedy and it works, I have to say, great. <br /> <br /> I think, like "The Nutty Professor" and most of his other films, this film is a testimony of his comic gene both in concept and implementation. I think Buddy Love could have said, "You know, true comedy can't do just a six-year hysterical, but it does for his father." Perhaps this film would not like, honestly, some monocles and nervous Nazi generals. If you see another comedy in your life, look at it. Be careful, however, you can die laughing. And I'm not kidding!
