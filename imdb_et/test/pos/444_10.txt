Uncle Frank is an uncle of all. This documentary dealt with all aspects of aging in America, loneliness, humor, irony. Uncle Frank and Aunt Tillie were extremely generous to share their life experiences with the audience. The director did an incredible job of capturing his small and big pieces. Thank you to everyone who helped make this movie!
