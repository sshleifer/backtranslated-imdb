Beautifully captured and stretched short film. It really repels the feeling of this family and a large part of the country just before and after Pearl Harbor. <br /> <br /> I appreciated the visual appearance of the film - naturalistic and simultaneously poetic. Great work by big D.P., David Boyd. <br /> <br /> Although the family movie is a story, it never becomes a snake or saccharin. We understand and believe in the motivation that pushes a young boy to his odyssey. I understand the younger brother's love for my parent's brother and do not doubt why he is going to do what he does. I understand that he is driven by a deep desire to be with his brother during this crisis. The child is tough and Jonathan Furr's performance is great, as is Ron Perlman's veteran work.
