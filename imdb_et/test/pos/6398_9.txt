"My wife and children" is my absolute ABC class! I haven't seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. I have many episodes I enjoyed. One of them was where Junior (George O. Gore II) got a driving license. If you want to know why you need to see it yourself. Before I put it up, I would like to say that everyone always did a good job, the design of the production was remarkable, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although it can be seen in syndicates, I urge you to catch it only when it gets out of the air.
