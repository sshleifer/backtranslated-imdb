I enjoyed the movie very much. Everything in Italy is easy. An explosive man, a secure cracker, a computer genius, a wheeled man and a man with a remarkable plan to steal 35 million without a gun. This movie is fun, although it has no central idea. This is a non-monetary film with many activities. All the stunt work is proud. Venetian speedboat racing at the beginning of the busy roads in Los Angeles, with three mini-houses and even a helicopter. The best pride I have ever seen. I like mini-chambers. Expert thieves used mini-chambers for refugee cars. The exchange of small artists and motorcycles is amazing. They followed the ground. I can say I had no moment when I was eternal. Mark Wahlberg (Charlie Croker), Charlize Theron (Stella Bridger), Donald Sutherland (John Bridger), Jason Statham (Handsome Rob), Seth Green (Lyle), Mos Def (left ear) and Edwin Norton (Steve). I like the participants in this movie. I've seen many movies, but Italian work and one of my favorites. Great Hollywood action movie without a blood shot. After all, I love this movie.
