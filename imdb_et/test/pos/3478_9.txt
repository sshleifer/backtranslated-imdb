When I was 10 years old (now 14), I promised I'd never see a movie I knew it wouldn't have a happy ending. And until a couple of weeks ago I was doing well, except for Shakespere's English class, etc. And I was still looking at only happy things. But then I saw Ramola Garaid at Havanah Nights, which was lovely, not good, but fun enough to watch. After I saw it a few times in two or more years after I first saw it, I grew to like it, especially music. So I was looking for her and found IMDb ... I saw "Inside I'm Dancing" and I assumed she had made another dance film and reviewed. It was later in the image search (from Rory, looking for a Gilmore Girls poster for the locker). I took a picture with this movie ... Then I was looking for a trailer, found a trailer and when I saw the hospital and heard Rory say, "You have a future" I remembered my promise and realized that it wouldn't be a good movie for me. But it just went back to my mind until we were in a video store and it was $ 5 so I went on and bought it. After I saw it, I just wanted it out of my head because it was so sad. I wouldn't go near it until I had cerebral palsy as a vocal. Then I just had to see it again and this time I smiled, even in the most sad parts I didn't feel depressed anymore because I realized that all this movie was happy and uplifting ... I love it and I love it and now it's one of my favorites , I'm sure it's the worst comment you've ever read. But watch a movie that's worth it.
