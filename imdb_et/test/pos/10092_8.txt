The idea is not original ... If you've seen such a story before, you would know what the end is after the first 20 minutes of viewing ... script, actor placement and screening are too obvious ... If you haven't seen this story before, this is definitely a good experience, you will enjoy twisting at the end ... do not forget it again after knowing the "truth", even more enjoy the plots ... Although I have the right guess at first, I still could not hold my place ... <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Must See! ! This one from Korea is better than any of the latest movies in the Japanese genre ... forget about Hollywood! <br /> <br /> Don't miss it !!
