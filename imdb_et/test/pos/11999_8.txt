Ultimately, it is clear that the murderers were seated in the murder weapon of Mrs. Columbo's car and that was in the police ballistics laboratory. <br /> <br /> But where did the gun beneath the hood that was used in the demonstration come from? Didn't the murderers take things under the hood? They had a whole week? Or did the Columbo police repeat the camera / weapon under the demonstration hood? How did they do it without breaking the car and not entering it? Maybe it seemed that the murders finally seemed surprising. But how can Columbo copy and calibrate his camera / weapon device to his keyfob? Columbo has to recover the weapon back from the ballistics and had to re-plant it under the car's hood and I was very happy that the rest of the device with the camera was still there and forwarded it. <br /> <br /> It was the 10/10 shows until this prominent plot bug at the end.
