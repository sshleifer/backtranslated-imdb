When the long "Happy Ever After" ended, its characters - "Terry & June Fletcher" were revived for a longer running and popular stage - "Terry & June", although their surnames were changed from Fletcher to Medford. <br /> <br /> Terry has got a new job and as a result, he and Purley are moving to all sorts of scraps - unwanted guests who drop to visit in awkward situations. for dinner and for Terry, who is trying to shoot his hand at the DIY, but every time he pulls it. The IMDb co-user marked this example as "not smart" and "never well written". Honestly, it wasn't smart, but it was the whole point. As for the "never well written" - for some episodes was quite low, I admit, but in general I found it very well written, very amusing and very well worked. <br /> <br /> It was a warm heart not different from the BBC sitcom “Keeping Up Appearances”. Eight different writers contributed to nine series, giving the exhibition a lot of scope. Terry Scott was a comic genius, as he proved in products such as Hugh & I, Carry On, and of course here! June Whitfield was also a legend in comedy law. <br /> <br /> I enjoy some modern exhibitions, such as "Still Game", "Catherine Tate Show", "Legit" and "Empty". I even enjoyed alternative comedy - "Naked Video", "The Young Ones" and "Comic Strip Presents", but I'm more willing to enjoy vintage comedy like this. Humor that you don't have to think about is great when you feel down and want to lift yourself up. For the record, Terry & June was a great thing. Special attention should be paid to the memorable gateway that brought out a real mood!
