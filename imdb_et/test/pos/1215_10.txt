This movie is amazing. You should never laugh harder. This is the target. No, I think it's ... yes, it's ... BOOB! This movie will be funnier on the other - as if Jackie Chan's character finally dies in his final battle scene. This movie is like a treasure! Congratulations if you buy or rent it. I never think I can get it back. I didn't do it and I haven't found it in the shop. I watched this movie once and I was in love with Kung-Fu's forever. If you are looking for an amazing movie with great product value, good or even mediocre action and good special effects ... this is not the film. If you are looking to laugh and timeless suckling, then choose it for the dollar and you will probably never let it. With friends, popcorn and drinks, it's the perfect evening.
