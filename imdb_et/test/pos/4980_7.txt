Stanwyck is equal to his shameful best, Robinson - so ruthless land barons in this quite ordinary west. <br /> <br /> Some good activities, strong location, color and Cinemascope. But why is it obviously used in the scene? <br /> <br /> Ford is reliable as always and Foster is strong as Robinson's daughter, but it's a bad movie. And it's not just Stanwyck and Robinson - Brian Keith makes a surprisingly striking evil like a Stanwyck lover and Richard Jaeckel is an unforgettable killer with a cold heart. <br /> <br /> Look at this camp's value.
