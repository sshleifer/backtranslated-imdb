I laughed at my ass for an hour. I had no idea who was Dan Finneity. Why haven't I heard Dan Finnerty before? She is hysterical and also her stock singers. They do all those female songs that we would never want to hear from the new experience. They'll get these songs off. That was Bravo last night. Why isn't this Dan man like "ultra famous"? Great voice! Charisma burn! He blew me off with this show! I just read on the internet that he was once a "Stomp" member. I think nothing can be done. For years I saw in the UCLA theater "Stomp" and these boys were amazing. This exhibition last night made Dreamworks! Does that mean Spielberg did that? Why don't they mark Dan Finnerty in the movie. At the end of this show, there was a standing presence and every time the camera cut the audience, everyone was singing, dancing or dancing. It was an amazing energy for the whole show. My only complaint was that it was no longer, but looking back, when you see how much energy these guys put out, I think no one would be able to do such pleasure for over an hour. The man I loved this example!
