It's a great movie, but Momento (another big budget for Nolan) is much better. I recommend people to see Moment and if they like, watch this movie. The film is filmed in black and white, which was a bit annoyed at first, but once in the movie, you realize that black and white are the best way to see a movie. It is extremely engaging and reasonably easy to understand, although it is very smart. The elements of the natural element, I think, are a little daft, but the film is definitely worth a second look. To compete for the film, there is a smart plot, with complicated turns, very good practices and a budget for the film, I have to say that it's pretty amazing.
