One of the best! As a fan of the Civil War, I was very pleased with the first part of the North and South trilogy. Patrick Swayze gives an extraordinary result as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down. Looking at this fabulous story opens up from a time that is never forgotten, with love, passion, grief, shame, harmony and cruelty. This series was first introduced when I was in the eighth grade. Being a young boy, you think I wouldn't be interested in this soap of civil war. Frankly, this story stole everyone's hearts in my class and that's just the first book. I bought a novel and learned pleasant and differences and it was fantastic. I am 17 years old and still enjoy the story, the characters, the subject and the times of the civil war. As a film director of the future, I always enjoy the North and the South: Book One.
