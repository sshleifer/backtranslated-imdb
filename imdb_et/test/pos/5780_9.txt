I give this movie out of 10 out of 10 just because there is not enough scientific reference to the amount of energy it takes to produce food to satisfy science's wrath. mdixon seems to think that really biased commentators make this stuff up, but even an elementary understanding of resources and laws of thermodynamics show that, at least for scientific reasons, if they claim that we cannot continue to depend on oil, we need to switch to different types of energy and not There is no plan to replace energy from oil. Other civilizations have refused to face the facts of life and perished. Read Jared Diamond's "Collapse", which is a popular book or any elementary Ecology or Earth Science textbook and you can check out the main premise of this movie. Go ahead, the violin burns in Rome!
