The film I've seen and enjoyed more than any other film. I first saw it as a child and loved drama and great climate change. As I grew older I enjoyed it so much or more than before, but now, thanks to all the components that work together to make a real classic. The actor is great (especially Keith as T. Roosevelt), cinematography is remarkable, the script is full of jewels and the management pulls it perfectly together. It is loosely based on the actual event, and it shows the speed of Europe and the newly formed America to break the "old man of the sick" (Ottoman Empire) as it breaks down in a different way from other "historical" films I've seen. Humor, drama, action, love ... it's all got and deserves much more recognition (like "The Great Waldo Pepper").
