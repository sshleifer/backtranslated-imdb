For a long time I didn't know that I liked this movie. It's surprising, because I usually know, but because the movie didn't go anywhere, I was a little confused. <br /> <br /> Two people are moving somewhat in the community. The constant work of these spouses or their stay on business trips, paying attention to their solitude, goes to each other. After a Platonic love relationship, Tony Leung Chiu expresses his love for him. Your Li-Zehn, played by Maggie Cheung, is painful, though their love affair is not physically full. Chiu leaves the country, comes back only years later, when everything has changed. <br /> <br /> For the cynic, the movie is right. The film can never actively or actually touch the part of love, but only approaches it, says the film, indeed, says that there are more than many others on this subject. This is also true, I think nothing good would have happened if they continued this thing. At least that's the feeling I get. <br /> <br /> If we want to believe this when Garica Marquez writes that "... love is a state of grace, nothing but an alpha and omega, a goal in itself," then this film falls badly like it everyone else. Or, if you are inclined to a completely incomplete minimalism, it hits the right mark. Which of the films in history have achieved this phrase, approached or persisted, for only a short time? My honest sense of memory is about two. When Harry Met Sally suggests this romantic perfection; and getting everything is just getting there. Interestingly, when Harry Met with Sally, it happens rather during the awakening than at achieving it. Can anyone say anything good about love when it is achieved by two people? Nicholas Spark's latest movie The Notebook comes closer than any other film; Do we believe that when love is attained, it will fly to radar only in some other dimension of the radar, or maybe it will have become a hidden vehicle at the ends of others? <br /> <br /> For the sake of love, it's an honest film with a proud and generous cinematic that is worth the best in every sense Almodovar has to offer, but all he has to say is "Life is sometimes like that. Now it's not worth it to say, especially when it's well-said, but the problem is really at the end of the last act, when Kar Wai Wong tries to round the film only for the second time in a broader historical theme that just plays in the context of the relationships that have taken place. This is a worthwhile effort, and the variation of the musical motif played in the film is quite brilliant, but the relatively free accusation of the theme plays too little to affect more than a superficial impact on the whole-inclined audience, leaving the viewer to divide the difference in every film. The director should know where he is going and how to get there. But to be honest, this is just one wrong way. However, as anyone knows, everything you need is one remarkable imperfection to spoil the honey into a perfect barrel. <br /> <br /> However, effort is definitely worth it; we try to let the historical theme expand and round the film and raise it with a few microscopes, but without the actual prediction it is a major mistake. In short, and unfortunately, it's too late. I think this is too big a challenge for a non-Asian viewer who is not familiar with Chinese history to fully understand this sweeping.
