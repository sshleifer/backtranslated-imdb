Faith Akin has once again made me realize the depth of my passion for the city of Istanbul. Since Faith Akin is aimed at a city with a cultural mosaic, it has helped to deal with it through the mosaics of music in the film. What's more, the film's climax is, in my opinion, the scene where Muzeyyen Senar (Turkish music diva) sings both at the age of 86 and in his younger years, and in a rolled-up cellular air without spending one drop, a traditional act of raki culture. He's just wonderful. Sezen Aksu (Turkish pop singer) with his mystical and substantive look at the end of his song, which gives the film its Turkish title, makes the scene no less than a climax. Last but not least, the wonderful scenery of Istanbul can be felt nostalgically when you are away. Beware!
