just can't look at it a little too many times, it's full of real enthusiasm and intelligence on Mickey Mouse for the first 30 years. Today, Mickey is a smart ass to compare. Steamboat Willie always makes me smile, at least to the end where Mickey laughs after the potato parrot. Animation is very nice and although the steamer Willie has no dialogue, the music is enough. <br /> <br /> IMHO, if this bit doesn't deserve a rating, is not just a cartoon because it's true classic, but also because it's so full of joy and always fun to watch.
