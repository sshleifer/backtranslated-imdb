As a child, I grew up with chin-60's TV series (and I'm not so old? POW!). However, when director Tim Burton brought his new vision to the silver screen, I immediately looked at it and never supported the preference of many of his most mortgage additions ("Batman Begins" and "The Dark Knight"). what I really don't care about. Even if they go a lot more on a reasonable approach and want to study Bruce Wayne / Batman's psyche further? but frankly I do not think there is so much. I wanted the dark fun with a dark stripe and in my eyes what Burton brought, and that's why I can look at them over and over again. <br /> <br /> After viewing the 1989 Batman viewers, Gothic Gothic art and Jack Nicholson are not captured, but psychotic Jokerit. Burton returns 3 years later to watch my favorite music so far; "Batman Returns". Camp, but well done. What would be fairer to be even more expansive, louder, tougher and more nihilistic, and having two bad enemies for one price. Enter the grotesque penguin (with Danny DeVito, who is extensively stretching out) and the delightful Catwoman (steamy Michelle Pfeiffer, who fits nicely in the costume) to come to Gotham's party. Again, Batman (aptly worshiping Michael Keaton is equally commendable and looks like this bat suit sees his eyes) playing on the bad five, but I've always preferred this mild Batman interpretation that gave him a malicious gloomy mystic. but also a psychological complexity that never felt the need to force feed. And his Bruce Wayne's move was well-deserved. Impressive to the atmosphere of Burton, his sleek Gothic engraving opens in a carnival comic book, which is filtered with a great number of characters and vivid costumes. The fashionable narrative (which is probably too long) is more symbolic in its deepening, rather showing its spontaneously arresting and extravagant devices and the sharply etched artistic direction covered by shady tones and gray / blue neon lights. winter background. Magnetically free-flowing camera work goes on and Danny Elfman's large spatial score balances play with gloomy touches with a very hypnotic pull. The rest of the performances may be overshadowed, but Christopher Walken digs into the teeth of the double-layered businessman Max Shreck in a glassy way. Pat Hingle is back, but it is very little to do, as Commissioner Gordon and Michael Gough are wonderful as Alfred. Michael Murphy, Andrew Bryniarski, Vincent Schiavelli, Doug Jones and Peter Rubens are also solid supporters.
