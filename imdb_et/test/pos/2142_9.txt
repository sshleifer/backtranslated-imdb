I was expecting this movie to be smelly, but I wanted to see myself, but I was surprised how good this film was. I know that longer movies may not work well in the box, but why it was pulled out and was not allowed to be seen by the public. It retained my interest and the scenery and photography is at times breathtaking. The plot was good and the moral game was good. I liked the realism that was "Unforgiven". I had to rent this movie to see it, but it was definitely worth it.
