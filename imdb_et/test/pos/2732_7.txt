SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> 15 PARK AVENUE: My humble take this movie <br /> <br /> Now that the cinema watcher has liked such small limitations as my own, niche movies like 15 Park Avenue should be mine sensitive to delicious. With that thought and a mild embarrassment that I hadn't been watching before, I watched this movie last Saturday. There are some similarities to other works like the legendary Mulholland Drive (David Lynch), of which this movie lends at least 3 terms: - <br /> <br /> a) This (at least some) truths are relative b) Shabana and Konkonam's first tour of the car as The role of the opening credit is similar to the car Betty and Rita did at Mulholland Drive. In both cases, the subject of the investigation is likely to be mysterious in both cases, and perhaps more openly on the symbolic Aparna film. C) The revolution around the mad spit resembles the involvement of the whole "Winkies" behind it, but at the same time that this scary creature is embodying something. and that it is "something" and also a symbol It is seamlessly connected with other Lynch works (noticeably noticing disappointed long hair), the light effect of a woman. 15 PA seems to be a tribute in the context of the film and its message, and thus insignificant <br /> <br /> The other films, of which 15 PA also lend, are Blow Up (especially the last scene is thrown back by the truth Vs. perceived poster of truth at the end of Antonion's masterpiece. Of course, the professor and the angle of schizophrenia also remind us: "Beautiful mind." Although the subject of high eyebrow physics and Shabana who admits it, he accidentally arrives vigorously as opposed to the confusing hallucinations of Konkona's character through their great prophecies. connected and that the scene cuts back and forth from the "real" world of the Shabana, where Quantum Physics and Relativity theory justify the universality and composition of the universe, the artificial construction of the "faith" world of the Mith, all of these differences being the same. one is an option and the other is out of nature hi the pain that Joydeep rejected in love, in accordance with Shaban's inability to form a special bond with Kun (Dhritiman) or Sanjeev (Kanwaljeet). But I'm going ahead. Viewers tend to look at this movie in two ways: - <br /> <br /> Hypothesis 1: "It was all along Shabana". But this explanation is not only too far drawn, but also natural, because it would mean that he would dream so many other signs (ie all the signs he saw with Mith's visualization with him) <br /> <br /> Hypothesis 2 : "There was a real Mith and the end is a metaphor." This POV says that the essence of the film is summarized in a film dialogue, as a response to Joy's (Rahul Bose) statement that Mith is looking for something he never finds, his wife Laxmi ( Shefali Shah) is a philosopher that we are all really looking for the illusive utopia where the rainbow, where it seems that lies the noise of joy and satisfaction, <br /> <br /> the lesser opportunities our conscious audience has not accepted so much, : - <br /> <br /> Hypothesis 3: "Shabana and Konkona are the same human changing egos" Hypothesis 4: "Also Shabana is Mith's imagination" Hypothesis 5: "Old, haggard, maybe crazy, light woman is the story of the real protagonist. <br /> <br /> Do these hypotheses deserve Well, your guess is as good as mine <br /> <br /> "Why 15 Park Avenue?" Contrary to popular belief that he was thinking of NY Park Avenue, I believe he got the name popular bathing soap brand. Remember that Jo Jo's "Shikakai Prime Minister", as you know, is a popular ingredient used to make shampoos. The prefix "15" will be used on December 15, when Mithi got in touch with Joydeep and after his escape he will remain forever. The film has a fair share of errors - not using a strong background point, which in such films can really increase the narrative, some sluggish dialogues that are not influenced by any forced dialogue. Some cast members are inconsistent (Shabana and Dhritimaa are excellent, though IMO), although many members of this band are wasted. Shefali Chaya's sudden uncertainty about her husband seems to be an impressively exploitable dimension. I give it 7/10 because it made me think, but not higher, because I can easily understand my sources of inspiration and have experienced (and mostly thoroughly enjoyed) those who used to be, I have already thought of similar lines in the past. So, the experience of a 15-year-old PA is definitely somewhat novel. Where do I come from? I gave 9.5 / 10 "36 to Chowringhee Lane" (although rumors are still that one Satyajit Ray ghost was driving it), 7.5 "Paromiter Ek Din", 7 "Mr and Mrs Iyer" and 5 "Paroma". At an existential level, he was unable to interest me, not even to say 'Truman's exhibition'.
