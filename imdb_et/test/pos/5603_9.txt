Although the camera was definitely "funky" - maybe one Dutch short "with stones" - the premise of the film was fantastic. In fact, he took God, Jesus, and the devil from the terrible satirical tradition of Hal Hartley. The communication between Jesus and Satan gives some fun scenes ... Even Jesus' monologues were great - it was by far the best Jesus I even saw. So buggy, Zen-like, son of God-ish, but still such a nice boy. On one level, this is a very general look at the paradoxes of Christianity, but there is still a personal level where one can communicate with Jesus Christ without God's complexity (as Martin Donovan and Hal Hartley).
