This phenomenon, Helge Schneider, cannot simply describe or quickly classify. But for an international audience who didn't know her, she could say she's something like the Weird Al Yankovich and Andy Kaufman's crude product, adding to Jazz and 70's. Though his productions are already eccentric, his films are simply frightening. <br /> <br /> "00 Schneider" is, in my opinion, the brightest film. He is in the lead role in the two leading roles - the police detective "Kommissar 00 Schneider" and the murderer "Nihil Baxter" as well as the valuable role of doctor "Hasenbein". <br /> <br /> When you open the scene, we see how Baxter, a lover of contemporary art, accidentally kills the circus clown Bratislava Metulskie, from whom he has bought the disruptions used by Jaguar, when a beloved sculpture slips from Baxter's hand, deadly to the metacarpal. When you read the incident in the newspaper, 00 comes back to retire to investigate the case with the support of her loyal sidekick, Mrs Koerschgen, played by a senior actor with the same name. They quickly pick up the Baxter's journey and listen to him in his stunningly decorated mansion (one of the best scenes in the movie!), But initially unable to gather evidence. The story comes through many turns with multiple scenes that have not always contributed to plot development, but are fun funny, such as 00's dream (including the most unusual view of the current man's short film in horse film history), a police department party during which Koerschgen gets to the head of the line and must be hospitalized and visit the already mentioned dr. Hasenbein. Finally, Baxter is trying to flee an airplane on Rio de Janeiro. <br /> <br /> It is always worth mentioning Andreas Kunze, who in this case plays a woman in 00, as she usually appears in the role of dragging women in Helge's films. <br /> <br /> So all people who are looking for new smiles will strongly recommend this movie. Prey? You have to understand German (because I doubt there is an English version) ...
