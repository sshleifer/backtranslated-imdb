Mick Molloy's last production was very impressed. As a fan of her, I was used to different types of humor as shown here. He chose Crackerjack for a more subtle, broad comedy than for a normal low eyebrow, his face. Sometimes it is inconsistent and unequal, but a decent script will work sooner and will make some entertaining viewing. Director Paul Moloney (who has directed almost every Australian TV series), tells Crackerjack's story about Jack Simpson, a member of his local bowling clubs, just because of parking. If the club is in financial trouble, it is forced to compete by trying to raise money to get the club into the poker machines. A well-known and successful formula that is well handled. It cannot be denied that the film owes its success to Molloy's great casting. He seems to have a great relationship with Samuel Johnson and the great chemistry of Judith Lucy, and although the character is probably far from his personality, you can't help but know why he hadn't tried his hand on the film before. To experience experienced pain, peaceful support from Frank Wilson and Bill Hunter, and often steal their scenes. They are two good actors and the couple travels easily through their roles. Had it not been a tremendous success for My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Crackerjack would have made this number 1 into an Australian ticket office, but if you consider what he's filming and who is involved, even the registration of that number 2 was a considerable effort. All in all, it's a clever, sensitive film. A great cast, a great team and a great soundtrack combine one of the best Australian films of 2002. 7/10
