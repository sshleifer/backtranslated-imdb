Lana Turner proved that she can really dance in the magic of the 1940s, that her sister (Joan Blondell) makes a great sacrifice for her. <br /> <br /> When both sisters come to New York, they follow Blondell beau, wonderful George Murphy, in this movie. <br /> <br /> As a fate, Turner will show, but he will not see Blondell doing anything except the work as a cigarette girl. Not only does Blondell not leave stardom, boy, Murphy (Eddie) for Turner. To prevent her sister from hurting, Turner is ready to produce, a rich woman who is married 4 times. <br /> <br /> The story will get back to Blondell as quickly as possible. Nebraska. Become a philosopher of Paul Ford's film. The date of the film and the fact that it is much thinner is hard to recognize. The film leaves you wondering if Ford and Blondell could ever come together. <br /> <br /> Blondell, like a dedicated sister, sacrifices both her career and love for her sister. This film is sentimental and could have worked better if it had come off at Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Few realize that George Murphy, the future Republican Senator in California, was a man of singing and dancing during his day.
