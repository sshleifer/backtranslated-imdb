I was just looking at the thriller I thought was one of Hitch's little efforts before. How wrong can be! Maybe because I'm older or maybe because the film gets better with every view, but now I think it's amazing. Any little effort is out of the smallest detail and the last scene in the marine clothing is just a breath! Perfect in every way, highly recommended.
