I don't think I'd cover any spoiler, but if I do, I can cover my butt. "The Last American Virgin" came at a time when such teenagers reached age / high school sex. Movies like "Prepies" (1984), "Hot Times" (1974) and popular "Porky" (1981) made a lot of money. Yet the "Last American Virgin" is what really is a more serious plot story among nudity and sexual situations. This is often the story of three high school boys who want to lose their innocence. Go to the wrong places (prostitutes), dangerous (elder boy jealous) and comfortable (who love their high school female colleagues). There are a lot of funny moments in the movie, and although the cast did not bring out any major film stars, it is worth remembering the fantastic 80's soundtrack that includes Devo, The Cars, Journey and others. To date, standards have been dirty and could have taken the NC-17 rating, but this is a well-told story of how sometimes personal fixation can bring pain, while love can be in front of us. This is a small piece of the Americana of the eighties, worth paying for in its film collection.
