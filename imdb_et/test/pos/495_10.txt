Blade is probably one of the best vampires / action movies that have ever been made. It's all: action, horror, blood.this movie is for fans of deeds. It's whether you like it you hate it and if you hate it, it means that you don't like the act or the vampire movies.Wesley snipes takes his role seriously and he is the perfect guy for the blade
