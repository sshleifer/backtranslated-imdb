This movie was never meant to be a big budget movie, but it was a lovely little picture anyone could enjoy. It probably won't change your life, but it's definitely charming and interesting. <br /> <br /> Clifton Webb plays a speaker (not a new one) with a TV set. However, his ratings have failed and he is concerned about the cancellation. So he decides that he may be too intact with his children - as he and his wife are not alone. So, as a volunteer, she is a scout player and deplores it almost immediately! Remember that he is a criminal and doesn't like children in particular. To make things even worse, one child really loves her and follows her as a lost puppy. No matter how indifferent he acts against his child, the child wants to spend time with him! The child is cute and almost steals the show himself! <br /> <br /> What happens next and the movie twists are something you need to find out for yourself. Understand that this is a light, cute and not yet appealing film that you probably enjoy.
