Caution - possible spoilers forward ... .. I looked "Joe" for the second time. The first time was 30+ years ago on the basis of the Air Force. I was reminded that the Air Force coat is with Tech. Sgt. boy / broker wore stripes; We were the first smile on air travel that appeared on the screen for the first time because it is the "rank of living". Over the years, I have taken many other pictures of the film. The most important thing was the absolutely beautiful and vulnerable daughter of the executive. As someone else commented, you couldn't take her eyes off. I didn't know it was 20-year-old Susan Sarandon in her first film. What a pity he didn't make more movies than he saw. I also remember the irony of a counter-culture hero like Peter Boyle, who plays the role of the right-hand gun nut. Unlike George C. Scott, the generals of Dr Strangelove and Patton play. And, of course, the shocking end-to-end impression. <br /> <br /> 30 years ago, the most talked about film ever played on a base. We thought it was a great movie and I wanted to see it again because I was afraid it would be as disappointing as the Easy Rider. But when I looked at it today, I was surprised at how well the film was held. This is a very strong script with little holes, though you have to think that the boy will come out of the tub right away when Sarandon comes into contact with him. <br /> <br /> Looking for an explanation of why this movie is still so fun I have to think that it is related to perfect physical pain. Boyle was physically believable as Joe (as others have pointed out, his image would inspire a few years after Archie Bunker's character). Did Ted Knight give his Caddyshack character to Judge Smails after Dennis Patrick's "Joe" advertising manager? They look similar and similar. Patrick was absolutely plausible because it was packed with an over-tight top middle-class leader. And with the innocent eye of Sarandon's innocent eye, the Raggety Ann doll still provides a protective response to the perfect casting of all male spectators. <br /> <br /> Indeed, naked and drug scenes are upward (they were very provocative for their day) and as clear as anything that can be found in thirteen. The only thing about this film is that violence is neither realistic nor graphical. "Joe" was about the same time as "The Wild Bunch" and the film's tone of violence had just begun to change. Another reason for this film is that the events of the last few years have brought about the relevance of the theme and context of this film. The film depicts both types of "conservatives" so that they are full of fear and hate the unusual ways of counter-culture; and full of your envy with your free and hedonistic lifestyle. The counterculture is depicted as a straight line of culture; and although paranoid for the conservatives (legally, that it was only a few months after the state of Kent), they cannot resist their lifestyle to try to antagonize. The political landscape does not differ only 30 years later. I am not sure that Conservatives envy young people and liberals as much as in 1970, but they fear and hate them more. <br /> <br /> A great movie that is surprisingly as important as it was in the early 1970s.
