I'm not a gambler, but a couple of people in my family and my boyfriend. So I decided to find out a little about "fantasy things". I saw Dorkness Rising and thought it was HILARIOUS! It's a blast, but not disrespectful for those who enjoy role-playing games. Also, and most importantly, people who have never played before can enjoy it and don't feel like they want to understand the plot. The action was great and the departures / sessions were plausible. It makes me look for other movies in this film production company. I can't wait to see the future of this group! Three cheers - well done!
