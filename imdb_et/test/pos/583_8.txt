I saw this movie for the first time as a teenager when it came out in theaters when back. Again, almost 30 years later, I was surprised how well it has grown. Gags are still funny, interacting with characters works great, and cameos come better than ever. (Steve Martin must be the best.) <br /> <br /> My kids (9, 11, and 14) loved it, and the music is good enough to still tune in many days later. <br /> <br /> I recommend that you look at at least half a dozen episodes of Muppet exhibitions before watching a movie, so you can get the story behind the characters, or else make the movie so much sense.
