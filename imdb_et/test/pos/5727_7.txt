OKAY. All in all, this three-part documentary brings the most interested people into the world of physics and the last 300 years of our universe. If you have read Stephen Hawkings' brilliant book "A Short History of Time" and I understand it, you could benefit from the visual description of certain concepts that I did to some extent. Greene is tolerable, but obviously in the interest of the masses it tends to explain things lightly. This is, of course, deliberate and suitable for almost anyone watching this series. <br /> <br /> Guest experts were good. (there is no Hawking but I think he has his own DVD) I waited for him to appear, but they almost rotate for almost three parts ... Nova 2 Disc Edition (NTSC) and there were some additions that really worsened from general experience. <br /> <br /> 1. "It has brought you ..." At the beginning of each part, the first part was bad, but seeing it twice before it was over was very common. <br /> <br /> 2. Can't help, I think, but at the beginning of 2 and 3 there are quite a few overlaps that reached the FFW button a few times. <br /> <br /> 3. This disc was directly on TV (ie the ads that happened last time for those who did not, and frequent "goto pbs.org more ...") that appear throughout the presentation. (Quite unlike BBC material that is unbalanced for presentation. Plans, blue planet, etc.) My 7/10 is based on content alone. Niggles were there, but I got over them. If it had been with this classical British pressure performer (you know it), it would, in my opinion, be the ideal album. <br /> <br /> If you have seen it and want more ... then I highly recommend Hawkings' book "A Brief History of Time" ... I wish it was a movie. <br /> <br /> Happy viewing.
