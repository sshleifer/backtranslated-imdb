during the foreseeable movies with a lot of violence, cheap romance and melodrama, it is strange to find such a strange film. The plot itself is convincing and the actors are great, especially Alan Rickman. If you want to look at questions that do not provide all the answers before asking questions, the film that surprises you (good or bad) is Dark Harbor for you. And if you are not convinced, believe me that Alan Rickman's performance is worth it ... especially at the end, ladies.
