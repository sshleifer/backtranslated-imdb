Errol Flynn is best than Robin Hood from the West, battling the business of military bureaucracy, confederates, Indians and carpets, associated with his great and ultimate heroic end. Don't forget the ever more trusted O. de Havilland, who is the western Lady Mary. Never try to link this story to facts and real people, it doesn't work. Just enjoy it because no one has ever claimed that the documentaries Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn did.
