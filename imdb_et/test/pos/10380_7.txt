NVA combines oriental humor, military comedy, and a movie. Although it is somehow somehow sentimental, like a German movie, I think it's a great and very funny movie. Not only are you laughing at NVA, you also get a little insight into the East German armed forces in the late 1980s and how young recruiters and professional soldiers experienced the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the German Democratic People's Republic. Government of the Republic. <br /> <br /> You will enjoy NVA if you liked Sonnenallee (second film director Leander Hau√ümann), but not necessarily if you liked Good Bye Lenin, which is much more serious and less likely to be funny. <br /> <br /> Action is acceptable. But look at the ex-boy band singer Kim Frank, who has only two facial expressions: natural and shocked eyelids!
