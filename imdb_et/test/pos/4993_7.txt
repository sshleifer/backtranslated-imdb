Everyone wants to come back to Duvall and Jones! Viewers say things like Zahn and Urban are not so deep ... Talk! Were you as deep as you were young? It's the whole point: they have a lot to learn. Zahn and Urban are pulling down the low defeats they were about to act on, and with the excellent commitment to keeping the nuances of the nuances of Duvall and Jones in characters. Zahn is absolutely perfect when the early Gus and Urban are finely perfect as early as Woodrow. What bold steps should have been in such a situation in the entertainment sector. They must have known that they would all come under them, that they are not really loved ones, but they did their best. I gave it to 7 because editing was sometimes terrible and the timelines were sketchy, but the show was a joy to watch. Val Kilmer was absolutely great. Another thing: I hope that the audience's entertainment would be more about the mysticism of jaguar and the occurrence of blue and gold if they had shown how they appear and are simply accepted by the characters.
