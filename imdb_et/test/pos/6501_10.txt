I just saw this movie on the resfest and was on the floor. I've never been a big scare fan, but this movie was behind me. it is listed as a documentary, but never felt it. (do not remember the last time I had so much fun watching a documentary). It is a style and energy that is refreshing, insightful and never too preaching. also the output values ​​were there. (Captured movie with cool cuts and amazing soundtrack). generally a smart, fun and enlightening piece.
