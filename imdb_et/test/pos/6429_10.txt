If, oh, when does anyone like Anchor Bay or Blue Underground open this wide DVD? Le Orme, which I know only because of my rare / vintage video collection habit, is a collection of my collections that I would not only sit down but actually watch. The fact that Klaus Kinski is top-notch but only in the small parts of the film means little to me. (Although many comments expressed disappointment about his relatively limited time.) I can't say it's a good horror movie, a good secret, a sci-fi epic, or something like that. It is simply an indescribable "genre" in terms of things. It is rather a confusing, frightening (though not particularly violent or bloody) dream that is full of great visual and mysterious. It is based on visions and emotions like Bava's "Add and Fuck". Both movies are beautiful in almost every sense, but it is almost impossible to describe it logically; they both appear in such a dreamy atmosphere. Do not obstruct the Force Video summary from the back cover. It is endlessly complicated and intriguing. Although the release of Force Video from 1986 (the only one in the US that I know) is cut to full screen, even in this form it is still big. Releasing it to remastered and / or letterboxed would make it great (hint, hint ... DVD companies).
