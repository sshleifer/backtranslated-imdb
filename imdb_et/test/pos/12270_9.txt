It was really a nice surprise. I was late last night and couldn't sleep. Not really thinking twice, I switched on my TV and HBO was on and this movie was just the beginning. Luckily I saw the whole thing and I'm very happy. Because this movie was very good. The actors were well cast and they did a surprisingly good job. Kris Kristofferson gave a solid result, with many races behind him. This movie made me realize he was a good actor. Brian Keith was great as his father, as was Trey Wilson, who played the colonel (this was Trey Wilson's last role before his premature death. Too bad, he was a quality actor and looked like a nice boy). Jobeth Williams also did a good job as an American woman of Kristofferson. As for the direction, I had no idea Franklin J. Schaffner was the director until I read Leonard Maltin's film guide (this was the last film he ever did). Now I understand why this movie was so good. Schaffner also directed Patton, a really big movie (I haven't seen my second big movie Papillon). When I looked at "Welcome home," I told me, "this manager really knows what he's doing," not knowing that Schaffner had directed it. Thai orphan shelter is one really beautiful scene that has enough tears for my eyes. It was not only sensitively targeted, but it was also aimed at a very economical and tense way. There is nothing wasted in Schaffner's efforts. The script was one of the reasons the film was so good. The writer does not weigh the participants with too many lines. It was written very easily but very effectively. It simply shows a lot of words to say. This film made me proud to be an American, while he showed you how beautiful all the people are.
