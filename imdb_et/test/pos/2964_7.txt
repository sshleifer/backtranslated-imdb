The love story for me is whether I like characters and also when they click with each other. Matt is quite unlikely: aside, brave, seemingly lazy and misognist. She is hurting her faulty mother and it makes her a little easier. I think I liked the details of his dysfunction - he was plausible. He compensates when he cries to Amy. He's so cool about Amy that he's beating twice. When they talk, he can't show him who he really is. He empathizes and then rocks it at just the right moments. It seems that he is so mature and strong that his traits coming out later do not fit. (For me.) I found that she was incredibly sexy and beautiful. . . neighbor girl beautiful, i call it. So I started to like this movie if it didn't really hang. <br /> <br /> A funny thing happens to a trainer, but Matt's relationship with another coach was inspiring. The football scenes at the end were confusing. Matt does not carry the ball but seems to be blocking. People, he's not the right size! He's fifty pounds too light for this position. But I thought his acting was qualified. I understand that I wanted to twist my neck a few times during Meredith Monroe's scenes. The film was fine. Meredith M was better than everyone.
