This film is a lonely guy who is happy that he is almost irresponsible and his sensible teenage daughter who is undergoing instability. from the beginning to the end. Both Ann and Adele are well described in the beginning, so we know how different their personalities are. Collisions will inevitably occur and will be introduced in an interesting way. I find myself in my state of mind and their situations. just as I live my life, I feel what they feel. <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon is giving another great performance "Anywhere But Here". He is charismatic, happy, happy, hedonistic, warm and loving at once. I've always liked Susan Sarandon, and I think she is very underrated. <br /> <br /> Anywhere But Here is an exciting emotional journey.
