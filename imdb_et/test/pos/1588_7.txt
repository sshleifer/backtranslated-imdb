Luchino Visconti has become known to the world after the wonderful production of THE LEOPARD. The film fans learned the style of the director, who introduced himself as new post-war realists, an aristocrat who developed his individual free thinking and thus expressed them as an artist. However, when this movie is used, MORTE A VENEZIA, based on Thomas Mann's novel, has a slightly different story. <br /> <br /> The whole film is so unique at first glance, so psychological and so much influenced by the different thoughts of the artist (both director and protagonist Gustav von Aschenbach) that it seems "invisible" to many viewers. Therefore, such opinions became "too slow", "irreducible" or "endless boredom" about the film. Why? The reason seems to be widespread nowadays: "GOOD MOVIE IS BORN ACTIVITIES." Here it would be appropriate to say: "GOOD MOVIE IS PARALEL WHAT DOES NOT WORK". In fact, everyone would be able to say one sentence about the whole content of the film and that would be enough. Everything that MORTE A in VENEZIA has, is a feeling of vague reality, full of depth as well as lowness, which seems to be important in the interests of each individual moment. And when we see psychedelic scenes in Venice, when we see Gustav at the railway station, when we receive his strong emotional memories. The perception of his disintegrating mind is sometimes so intense that the only way the viewer looks at the film is to do his best to feel and experience, not to see and think. Everything is doomed to mow like flowers when their time arrives. In other words, everyone has a sense of loss and death without many events or even dialogues. As a result, it is quite unlikely that the idea of ​​a movie will be received after a single viewing. It has to be seen more than twice in a constantly open mind. If you like it or not ... it's a different story, very personal. <br /> <br /> Art values ​​are a factor that can be noticed at first glance and remain with us all the time. Beauty is something that is very important for the main character who seems to come and leave; to rest something that it so badly moves and which comes to it in the most unexpected way; the feeling that he finds a teenage boy who appears as a model of all dreams and desires as a forbidden fruit of homosexual lust that disappears. Costume designer Piero Tosi is doing a great job in this movie. Through a lot of wonderful wardrobe he gives us a very realistic view of 1911 when it takes place. The filmmaker Pasqualino De Santis gives us a terrible visual experience, which can be called the true party of the eyes. The background is Gustav Mahler's music, a composer whose life was inspired by Thomas Mann to introduce his character. The performances are top-notch, especially Dirk Bogart as the headline, Gustav von Aschenbach, who wants to relax after hard artistic work and tries to find it unnecessarily in crowded Venice. For most movies, we have a great understanding of his thoughts, feelings and actions of anger, exhaust, and despair. Although sometimes it is frustrating, it keeps us on the right track to the end, which does not lose hope for a less tragic ending ... Tadzio (Bjorn Andersen) is a model of decadent homosexual desire, but also a model of beauty and purity that seems pretty pretty short. .. "Adieu Tadzio, it was too short," says the main character. Great exciting, but very controversial work has been done by Mark Burns in a sort of "super ego" with Alfred, with whom Gustav polemics of ideals such as beauty, justice, hope, human dignity. Alfred has a sense of beauty. How Freudian, but how dangerous a idea might be! And once in the historic Italian films Silvana Mangano - here as an elegant lady from Poland, mother of Tadzio. <br /> <br /> The memorable moments are really the strong points of the movie; yet, all viewers can't find them unforgettable. Like all the strange film, they are struggling to get on the right path to the director's individual ego and the fourth wall of his psyche. Among such scenes, I find the coastline quite important, especially the way Gustav Tadzio observes. Physical distance accurately represents the lack of courage ... I also appreciate the frames when Gustav sits in the gazebo and the city view moves in the background - as memorable, that can create existential thoughts about the transmission. Whether we are people, no matter what "travelers" in the world, on the journey that is life. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to tell you one important thing. I found MORTE A VENEZIA very strange until I began to look deeper into what the director was actually trying to convey. Then every scene in its interpretation turned out to be meaningful, which you do not have to agree with (I do not agree at all with the main character), but you should at least allow it, as the author would say badly. Listen to his voice, let him have a word on one page of reality ... <br /> <br /> Therefore, there is a long way to understand the film because there were not many such films made in 1971 and are being made. Paradoxically, we all seem to have the right to feel right about this movie in the long run, as we are all obliged to experience the once strange, inevitable, usually unexpected reality of death ... 7/10
