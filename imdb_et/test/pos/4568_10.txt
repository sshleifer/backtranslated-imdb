I love this movie .... one of my all time favorites !!! It was the first big-screen movie my mother took to see when I was 9. I recommend it to every African American. This story is about the love, trust, challenges and everyday life of the black family. All participants worked together. I wish it was a video, but that's not what I know. I caught this TV a couple of years ago and saved it, so if I want to watch it ... I have it! Music is also fantastic! Must-have!
