No less than the familiar comic book characters, I was expecting this film to fill only the basic ones: introduce me to the characters and their characteristic qualities, present the plot and end with the destruction of the main opponent and perhaps a hint of the possibility of continuing. And that's exactly what this movie works for. <br /> <br /> Unlike most other comic books, I felt it did a bit with class. "Blade" is a victim of a modern, strong language and graphical struggle that represents a very modern, plausible and disgraceful world with small nuances of the viewer making sense - as small as possible. who has rarely ever taken the story unless it is related to an emotional (ie delicate) aspect. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie has countless hits and unevenly unrealistic situations, such as a normal female doctor who is smart enough to understand what someone else has failed for a thousand years. But if you have such a cool enemy in this movie, as well as fighting scenes with cutting-edge and exciting camera trimming and special effects, as it is, what else is important? It may take a while, but for what it is going to do, "Blade" stands out prominently among most other films in this genre.
