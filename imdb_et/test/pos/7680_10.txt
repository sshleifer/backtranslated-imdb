When I was a kid, my grandmother took a look at this movie. And I fell in love with it. I admire Dorothy Dandridge so much and wanted to be like her. I fell to Sidney Poitier. Pearl Bailey made me laugh. And Sammy Davis Jr was as big as Sportin Life. Music was just breath. When I had my first son and the movie came on TV, I let him see it and so far he has never forgotten this movie. He loved it. I always remember Porgy and Bess. It is in my heart and now a special place. I really want them to restore this movie because it was one of the biggest movies ever with all the characters "Black Cast".
