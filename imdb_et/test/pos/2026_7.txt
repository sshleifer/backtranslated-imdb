Rock Star is a "nice" movie. Everyone is great. Even the guys who don't have to be nice are really nice. Chris is a nice guy who learns a lesson in life. She goes back to her girlfriend, Emily, who is also nice. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie, even though it's fine. Maybe I'm used to all X music. In some way the film was a Rock Stars caricature that was not strong enough to be credible. <br /> <br /> The acting of Mark Wahlberg is pretty good. Jennifer Aniston played well, but it was easy. She was a nice girl. <br /> <br /> Look at it. If you've ever been to a rock concert or seen Spinal Tapi, look at it.
