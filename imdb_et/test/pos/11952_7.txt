It's a lot of the same creative team behind "Better Out Dead", but it's not quite as good as this amazing teen comedy. It's a lot of fun, but the whole place and just not that funny. Curtis Armstrong is accustomed to less impact (he was "Better Dead", Bobcat Goldthwaite is very fun, Cusack is good, Demi Moore is Demi Moore (only with better hair here). Cape Cod, he is trying very well in the 80's Cape Codi summer, but for some reason this movie seems more like a "mainstream" than a "better dead" if you're a John Cusack and Savage Steve Dutch fan, it's definitely recommended.
