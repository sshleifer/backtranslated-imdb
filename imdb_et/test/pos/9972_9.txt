The problem with any production by a Venetian merchant has never been pseudo-controversial anti-Semitism, but the fact that there are two stories in both tone and content. frothy romantic comedy and irritating tragedy. The mixing of genres was all the rage of the sixteenth century (and was called by Shakespeare Hamlet). As a result, most directors are forced to emphasize one story to another, and it is not surprising that the decision will benefit Shylock. <br /> <br /> Like many of Shakespeare's big tragic heroes, Shylock is still fascinated for 400 years because he is so complicated and complicated. Calm, proud, angry, revenge, weak, arrogant; his behavior simply violates the analysis and continues to discuss it. He is not faulty because he is a Jew, but because he is a human being. Rarely do modern screenwriters make their creations with such richly textured contradictions and it is in everyone's favor that we have Shakespeare inspiration. <br /> <br /> The Shakespeare language is wild and rambling, saturated in many respects, word game and metaphor. To understand this, it must be an influenced and informed actor who does it. When an actor fails, words are poured into the pipe of incomprehensible words, but if he succeeds, the English life will rise immediately and with vitality that will take your breath away. Al Pacino is one such actor, and here is an unmistakable level of clarity and control that if there was justice, each prize wiped out in the bid. It meets Shylock's head presentation challenge and delivers exceptionally fine and nuanced results. It would be a crime if we could never see what he was doing with King Lear. <br /> <br /> Supporting casting is remarkable. Jeremy Irons gives an original acquaintance to Antonio, presenting an older, quieter figure that shows the inconvenient contradictions between medieval devotion and timid prejudice. Joseph Fiennes is a revelation when he matures after a superficial eye-candy to live a character once. Lynn Collins is the only disappointment. Many Shakespeare women are signed and demanding that the actor work really hard to put them into practice, and the recognition of Collins' Gwyneth Paltrow seems a bit flat and does not fit the darker tone Radford seeks. <br /> <br /> The design team must be recognized for creating a unique and thoroughly credible vision of the late Renaissance in Venice. The city has not looked at this resentment because 'Don't look right now'. To make full use of existing places and natural light, the film has authenticity, greatly enhanced by the dark and timed costume. Everything again deserves to be rewarded. <br /> <br /> The financial supporters of such films must be praised. With a $ 30 million budget, they need to be fully and firmly aware of the fact that they can never make a profit, but they still invest. We are all grateful for this because the result is a remarkable adaptation, which is certainly a benchmark for many years.
