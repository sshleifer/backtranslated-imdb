Reiterates the darkness. Based on author Khaled Hossein's mega-best seller, this film gives us the top of the Russian invasion of Afghanistan and the Taliban terror. Director Marc Foster adds a legacy to his CV that already includes "Monster Ball", "Findland Neverland" and "Stranger Than Fiction". <br /> <br /> A story about young friends Amir and Hassan and an unknown bond to the next generation. It is a story of honor and courage and loyalty, and it is an unusual story of the era. Some great boy scenes when they're kids and then a couple of really amazing scenes when Amir returns to adulthood to find Hassan's imprisoned son. <br /> <br /> It's a tight, powerful story that speaks with the message. Action is a definite collection, no actor steals the screen. While this is not a pleasant story to look at, it is definitely a sense and a heart. A quick and medium-length oil painting, played in the pool hall, is a welcome gift.
