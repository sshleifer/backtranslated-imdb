Exactly what you expect, and then some. The first movie was a TV show step up uncensored with coarser tricks and an increased gnarly factor. Surprisingly, Jackass Number Two is even more twisted. <br /> <br /> Stunts has become more dangerous and remarkable because some minds are blowing some painful jokes that are sprinkled with good fun to make this smile nasty. br /> <br /> Knoxville, as always, dominates the process, but this time he has a reason to take center stage when he makes the most dangerous and idiotic stunts a volunteer. Bam Magera proves himself both wildly and ever before, despite his "Viva La Bam" image. Surprisingly, the infamous Wild Boys (Steve O and Chris Pontius) seem to be less involved in the skis, despite being in the focus of their previous trips. <br /> <br /> If you like Jackass or Dirty Sanchez, be sure to enjoy this movie and laugh at your courage for a 100-minute duration as you see it as a child, disgusting, or sad at the present time of youth culture, so you'll find it as never before. So f ** k out.
