This is one of the paradoxes of the Basil Rathbone's anti-war Nazi Sherlock Holmes (Terror Voice, SH in Washington, and so on) that although the plots and settings are mostly terrible, he is so good. Despite the strange sweeping wind that was meant to be seen younger, he bleeds through every scene with so many bites and attacks that you barely register when the small plots are. Here he also has great opportunities for action with Lionel Atwill, who makes a wonderfully reluctant professor Moriarty - a heavy-duty cockroach with nice clues to sadism and misery (it may not be kids). At the headquarters, the laboratory became a "drop" of Rathbone's blood drain, as it is a general sinner as Seincheld's archaeologist Newman. The film itself is the ancient fare for the matin√©e of the child, but it is useful for the production and atmosphere of Roy William Neill. It also seems quite sharp when it comes to restoring a UCLA DVD - don't even think of purchasing another edition that is all faded, uncomfortable public domain prints.
