The East Side Story is entertaining and informs the unknown part of the Cold War. What is any documentary? To inform the reader through comments and footage. It succeeds on both. You will never find many movies with clips here, because some of them are destroyed and some are inaccessible. <br /> <br /> You can see and make music from musicals in East Germany, Russia, and other Soviet-controlled countries. This shows that the people who made those films and those who watched them were looking for the same things that the western women would look for, beautiful women and men who sing and dance on the streets with a smile and (hopefully) a white tooth.
