I gave it to 10 because it's the best kind of movie ... a good old fashioned T & A movie in the shadow and spirit of "Animal House". I saw it with a similar movie "Swap Meet" and both were good at their kind ... a great opportunity to spend a Saturday afternoon. Let's face it ... this film has more breasts than you could imagine an R-rated movie. From start to finish, they just seem to appear on the screen (sunset scenes, bedroom scenes and, of course, climate games). It is also a memorable kissing cabin (kiss me, Clutz!) Everyone seems to have a good time in their roles (several Playboy playmates, Danny Bonaduce, many familiar TV and film makers, etc.). The only complaint I have to register is that Lisa's London character is named by her surname "O'Hara" and not by the name of the 1970s like "Olivia" (or even Ora or Ona or O ... ?? !!). I saw it back in the late 1980s with my ex-husband (pretty well blessed) and he couldn't believe I really enjoyed the movie! He was probably jealous! Again, this movie is a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon ... just don't think too hard!
