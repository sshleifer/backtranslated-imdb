In the same year as the first Lumiere films, it is much shorter than the brothers tried until next year's Niagara. The surviving print is very tough, but it only adds Turneresque's visual violence, as it is a huge water drop against a steep pier and looks ready to watch the camera. <br /> <br /> If you look at several of these early shorts in chronological order and try to get into the mindset of the times, there is another shock that, unlike Lumiere's single frame settings, this movie has a change that was for me at any speed. like "Un Chien Andoulu" razor blade. <br /> <br /> Unlike the monumental vision of Lumieres' movies, Paul unlocks the opportunity to unleash the natural power of the viewer, never letting his hope go down in the snow. At the second stroke, it's similar to Niagara, but it's less scary because we're threatened by editing. In a movie like "L'Arroseur Arrosse" or "Repas du bebe", nature is indifferent and powerful, which the camera cannot get. Grammar in the main film ends its primacy.
