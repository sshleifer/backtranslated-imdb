I first heard when I searched for 'Net' for an overview of some other Italian giallo / horror, modern LADY IN BLACK (1974, which I recently acquired from R2 SE DVD Raro Video, by the way). ? where it is called in a similar way, but equally well. Now watching the FOOTSTEPS, I see where this reviewer came from? the fact that both films deal with the psychological collapse of their female protagonist. Stylishly, it is much more for Art-house cinema than anything else? in particular the work of Alain Resnais and Michelangelo Antonion (and especially LAST YEAR MARIENBAD [1961] and THE PASSENGER [1975]); therefore some have accused him of "deadly bored"? epithet, often associated with such a "pretentious" (read: brain) ticket! <br /> <br /> In any case, does the film include an attempt by her (Florinda Bolkan) to determine her movements in the past three days? of which he seems to have no memory. After several mysterious clues, does he travel with the "mythical" Garma land (nearby places bear the equally fictitious names Muda and Rheember)? where he meets several people (including the aristocratic regular court of the resort of Lila Kedrova) who seems to remember the heroine who was there during his "power cut"! But the most prominent is the young man (Peter McEnery) and the little girl (Nicoletta Elmi, Mario Bava BARON BLOOD [1972])? the former always seems to be at the favorable moments on the scene, while the latter mixes Bolkan with another woman (long red hair and medium streak!). <br /> <br /> Although this is essentially a mood, it is nevertheless a nonsensical puzzle: inevitably, vague events occur deliberately? and where much of the power of the film stems from remarkable central performance (which can be seen as extending the role of Bolkin to Lucio Fulci Giallo A LIZARD IN WOMAN'S SKIN [1971]). However, the contribution of cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (who offers any number of sweeping camera movements and effective color schemes using orange / red / blue filters to create an atmosphere and saturated to look for an unpleasant, odd finale) and Nicola Piovan's appropriate melancholy score (composer nowadays known For Oscar winning work, Roberto Benigni's Holocaust Theme-Comedy LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL [1997]). <br /> <br /> With this in mind, it is worth discussing how the FOOTSTEPS was presented in the version I looked at: well, obviously in its original form (I can't be sure if it's here or not, except saying the movie ran In 89 minutes, when IMDb lists it with 96), this edition is occupied by quite astonished English VHS (dubbing is surprisingly good considering international light) where burned Swedish subtitles start (in addition, a copy of DivX) froze In a few seconds a story around a 82 minute mark is very important! However, we get a welcome bonus, ie 9-minute 'Highlights From The Soundtrack' in MP3 format. <br /> <br /> I understand that I have not mentioned the six mission sub-items to which Klaus Kinski's presence is limited: by the way, at the same time he had the same short but central position with another sci-fi in place) good workout thriller? namely LIFESPAN (1974). When I watched the film, I couldn't understand what this potential connection with the central plot was, except that Bolkan mentioned a recurring dream of a movie he had never seen, though not to the end, called "Footsteps On The Moon" (somewhat misleading alternate film about himself) for)? amusingly reminiscent of a picture called BLOOD ON THE MOON (which is, of course, a classic western poem by Robert Mitchum in 1948 and directed by Robert Wise!). Nonetheless, I took this "deviation" step as another extreme touch to the film (also considering Bolkin's former work as a translator at the Earth's Future Conference)? and certainly did not expect the astronauts to turn to the beach of Garma, at the end, to lead a female, where the sand then becomes maliciously on the surface of the moon? <br /> <br /> The film's plot is probably more meaningful in the second viewing? to be honest, it is best to approach the visual / phonetic experience and should not really expect it to give a narrative that is somehow clear and easily rationalized! For the record, the only Bazzoni struggle that I had previously managed to catch was the average straight giallo THE FIFTH CORD (1971), starring Franco Nero (which I had recorded on an Italian TV tonight); some time ago I got my spaghetti western transfer to Carmen titled MAN, PRIDE AND VENGEANCE (1968)? also Nero and Kinski? as DivX (after I have already left this matin√©e)? but the conversion was somehow faulty and therefore the disc did not play properly!
