This was the best film ever seen by "Germen's Cine Club" (Buenos Aires). This film is a realistic critic of the past and the society of the next century. This gives a very good impression to all partners of the "Germen Cine Club". I recommend this movie to all Troma fans and all the people who like good movies, not commercial movies.
