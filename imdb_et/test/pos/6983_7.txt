In the future, a diverse group of people on a commercial spacecraft will be forced to improvise their survival when a spacecraft lands on a distant, rough planet. They already have one problem with one of the passengers being intensive criminal proceedings by Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel, in his first top-level role); however, they will soon be abducted by strange predators living in the dark - and rarely will there be rare sunshine. <br /> <br /> Although this movie script is ultimately on a routine side, it has worked properly and is particularly well done technically. Location, photography and design (both production and creativity) are all impressive. It is never an original or stimulating scientific literature / horror image that is far from far, but still offers good entertainment. Diesel fuel is especially good for getting your scary character under your skin. However, this is not entirely predictable and will gain some points <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> with a more politically correct end than most of its type. <br /> <br /> Filmed in Coober Pedy, Australia, in the Queensland Desert. <br /> <br /> The order of the works is <br /> <br /> 7/10
