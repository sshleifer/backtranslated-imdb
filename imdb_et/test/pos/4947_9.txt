Iron Eagle has always been one of my favirote films. It looks like it is Topgun, but with a different plot and (many people don't agree with me here) I think it's better than Topgun. <br /> <br /> This movie has some amazing fighting races when the fighter planes zoom in through the air. He is also the queen of the song "One Vision" that bounces in the background, which I think is a fantastic song. <br /> <br /> Frankly, Iron Eagle was very good, but it's another garbage. <Br /> <br />
