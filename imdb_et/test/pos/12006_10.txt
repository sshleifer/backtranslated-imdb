Probably anyone who has not experienced the communist regime's life in hell is obviously underestimated. Although it seems hard to believe all this has happened, in reality the reality was even worse than the movie. It is reminiscent of the Orwell's fiction, but it's not fiction. John Hurt is great as always. Yes, the scenario is not full, but life is not. The plot is breathtaking. Yes, people were shot, yes, thousands. Their "crime" was that they wanted to leave the communist "paradise" without the permission of the government. Sometimes the film tears the eye. We need more movies to really understand what America offers us. Great movie, highly recommended! God bless our country, USA!
