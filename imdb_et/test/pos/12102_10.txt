If you are a Turkey and Middle East music fan, you are lucky. This movie is a documentary of Istanbul's current music that includes traditional contemporary. It's very good. You couldn't do better when you went to Istanbul yourself. We get interviews with Orhan Gencebay, a concert of modern musical icons, a road show with a Roma (Roma) audience, Hip Hop (surprisingly good) and much more. Some of the best female singers I've ever heard of. A Kurdish woman who sings in a hammam (steam bath) who hangs your heart. Many social and political backgrounds. If this is your thing, you have a great time. I can sit quietly in the theater. <br /> <br /> CD audio is now available on Amazon. Dear.
