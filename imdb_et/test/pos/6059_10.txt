I was lucky enough to be on the island of Perris in the fall of 1959. DI showed an evening in the theater right in front of our barracks, Plt 162, B ​​Co, 1. Bn, 1. ITR. <br /> <br /> Although we weren't there long enough to even think about seeing the movie, we heard those who laughed. This is one of the many indelible memories of my thirteen weeks in PI. <br /> <br /> Later I got to see it in the theater. I am still convinced that this is still the most realistic picture of the experiences of the late 1950s. Nobody has done it better than Jack Webb ...
