It is always hard to bring a 450-page book to the film for three hours. I read the book earlier and found the BBC's production that deals with this difficulty in the best possible way. The features of the book have not disappeared: the dense and lively image of fingerprints in London in the 1860s, the brutal cruel cruelty that Maud has grown up, the characterization of different social groups in different ways, the unexpected and surprising twists, the way the film is viewed by viewers, is the same scenes are different when they are first told from Sue's point of view, from Maud's one. The main actors make a very good and especially growing love between the two women has been convincingly developed, with the first culmination being a very delicate scene of love between the two and finally forgiving all the evil they were willing to do and do with each other because they still love each other. <br /> <br /> For each of his books, author Sarah Waters has thoroughly investigated what life was in the British 19th century. While Tambett was, it was the world of vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements, in Affininn, the terrible reality of fears of women and the highlight of fashionable spirits, in Fingersmith he depicts a public ceremony in which people hang in London and inhumane persons in sources and scientific research based on disruptions alleged or declared treatment. This is a very well-written film, so the corresponding scenes show a high level of historical truth. I highly recommend this film production because it offers three hours of colorful Victorian atmosphere, vibrant emotion and intercourse.
