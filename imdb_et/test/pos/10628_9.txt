Isabelle Huppert is a talented female piano teacher who is contented, unkind, and distant in the public and is bitter about her students. He privately sees violence and frustration, and his sexual life is lonely and perverse. She lives with her overflowing mother who obsessively guides her to a noticed (and so on alive) as a talented pianist. The key to both mother and daughter characters is "obsession". These characters can no longer change their impulses if the rabbit caught by the headlamps can avoid death. <br /> <br /> The Piano Teacher meets young, attractive, talented pianists who lure him from the beginning. They start the relationship in the most unconventional way, but from the outset he makes perverse and violent terms that he has to do, which suffers him enough to end his relationship before it really has started. > The film links the lead of a woman. Isabelle Huppert is brutally astonishing, totally convincing as a piano teacher. She cleverly shows a woman who pulls beauty and perversion, but her violence is fueled by her perverted impulse. As a feature film of this kind, you know that it wouldn't work as if it had been bad. <br /> <br /> This is a powerful, intelligent, intelligent and sensitive custom novel. The work of the camera is also suitable for film. There is what I only mean to call, take pictures when the director has a scene and it forces me to throw it away. This is done very effectively against the empty bathroom wall and is an additional proof of the master's mastery. <br /> <br /> Expect this movie to bother and suffer. But be brave - let the courage go and see it. This is a very private look at the essence of one person's life, but does not expect it to be entertaining in Hollywood terms.
