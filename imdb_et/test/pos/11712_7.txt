Burt Reynolds directed this film and (surprise!) That he is actually a good director. This movie begins well when Burt's drug dealer test is botched and he's reduced to vice squad. The band has some pretty funny scenes, as Brian Kieth always eats, Bernie Casey has more classes than all his associates, and Charles Durning loses control over his team. <br /> <br /> Stumble upon a high-level spoken language that may be related to some murders. Sharkey spends her days out of the Dominoe (Rachel Ward) apartment and begins to adore her far. <br /> <br /> Just when they get close to the criminals, they are murdered. I'm not surprised at the plot, but the first hour of this movie is great. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the scenario is very large and unbelievable. Why should Burt Reynolds confront the crime chief with his great secret? Of course, this guy does sweat, but it causes much more police killing. And it is unlikely that Dominoe and Sharkey would love much less when they knew each other than their lives were in danger. And finally, what happened to the whole police who got into our building with our heroes? Isn't there a SWAT team? Nor does the film ever talk about how all the bad guys are connected and why they have to kill so many people. <br /> <br /> A movie that is probably the only really nail biting. It is a disgrace that the climax is a typical shoot-em-up. However, this movie is definitely entertaining if you like crime and action movies. Don't think of the plot holes and you have a good time.
