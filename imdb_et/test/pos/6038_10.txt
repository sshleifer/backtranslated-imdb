This is my second favorite Columbos. This sport is a top-notch pronunciation, including John Cassavets, who was never a revenge or sexist, Anjanette Comer, Myrna Loy and Blythe Danner. Now there's something I was always thinking - was Gwenyth Paltrow born when this episode was shot, or was Danner pregnant at that time? Thanks to IMDb I have the answer - she was five months pregnant. Now I really feel ancient. <br /> <br /> Cassavets plays a brilliant conductor whose marriage to Danner was probably the use of his mother's (Loy) social ties. She has a bitch in the village, well-known pianist Anjanette Comer, but she says she wants more. He's sick that he's back on the street. At night her concert gets rid of her and makes her suicide. Columbo is asking for some problems right away. One thing he notices: "You have a beautiful woman here - bedroom eyes - she has money, body and career. Where's the man?" It's nice to see Falk and good friend Cassavet. The vet has a very funny episode with Columbo Bassett. All cast persons are excellent. <br /> <br /> This is one episode that made Columbo a classic series.
