In this Daffy Duck there is only one racist joke, which is basically when Daffy rides to Black Beauty, it's a black woman. I can partly understand why this joke was involved, because at that time few people did not know how rude it was racist, and even the illegal discrimination of black people was not even illegal. <br /> <br /> In addition, "Coy Decoy" is basically a fun, interesting short, where Daffy meets the characters of books and does things in books. I liked this short pretty much (despite the other reviewers here). Daffy's love of the clock duck is vaguely disturbing, but at the same time very fun. Porky is a great publication for the episode, although it wasn't important for him. The wolf is an example of how people also thought wolves were these days, blood cancer, terrible animals, which of course have never been (unless they are very hungry). I also liked the style and episode of used animation. <br /> <br /> For people who are full of Daffy Duck and people who don't love casual racial fun cartoons, enjoy "A Coy Decoy"! <br /> <br /> Available on YouTube.
