The film's absolute looter and its age years before this time. I first saw the week when my father's neighbor's TV came home that the boy was thrown into the trash. The girl who was all electric had been working for two days. It was July 1955 ... and probably only the third house on the street for HAVE TV! Pretty much the first thing we ever saw on this grainy and flashing 12-inch screen was this movie. "It's pretty old," I remember my mother who tells me! <br /> <br /> For almost 50 years, and it doesn't seem to be older - rather like World War I in that part! An astonishing little fantasy about the London omnibus carrying about 13 passengers, which crashes and kills one of them. Then we take back the lives of those people and what brought them on that bus on that bus. <br /> <br /> When the crash ends at the end of the movie, the victim's identity, perhaps inspiration behind the 1960 film ADRIAN MESSENGER LIST, turns out. <br /> <br /> If you come across this little pearl, I suggest you look at it!
