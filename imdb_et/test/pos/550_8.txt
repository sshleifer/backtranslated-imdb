My one-line summary suggests that it's not a good movie, but it's not true. I enjoyed the movie, but I thought too much. Adele, whom Susan Sarandon has firmly portrayed, did not come as a very pleasant character. He is an airy and irresponsible about what would be an unforgivable degree if it were not for his daughter's enormous love. This is one thing he knows how to miss. Adele's daughter Anna is a sad girl who is so busy that she fills her mother's disadvantages that she doesn't seem to be just 14-17 years old. This naturally makes Natalie Portman an excellent choice for playing Anna because she never seems to be 14-17 years old. Portman pulls this role so easily that you almost forget that he hasn't made films for 20 years. But even for two specific wires, Wayne Wang doesn't seem to be limited to the audience as he did with Joy Luck Luck and even more with smoke. Although I haven't read the book, it seems like the film seems to have made the necessary changes to bring it to the big screen, the changes that can let emotional force. I liked watching the movie fun with two wonderful actors who did their job, but I have never lost experience and have never been involved with these difficulties.
