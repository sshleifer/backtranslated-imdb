Gosh, I learn quite quickly that sometimes, when you see a movie as a youth and then again 20 years later, you get a different view - mainly because after 20 years you can learn more. For example, I had no idea who George Cukor was - how big the director was and how much of this movie was flying. All I can say is what I really loved about the film about the parallel area of ​​my life: a lifelong friendship between two women. Does this EVER exist? Well, in certain doses, yes ... and this movie made a little bit more ... "how." <br /> <br /> Being a young person who didn't have much life experience for the first time, so I focused more on the "rich" and "famous" part of the two. At that time, I had no idea there were differences and what would happen to two women who discovered it ... and how it would affect their friendship. Through these men, their career, they have defined them for decades. Understanding one thing was stronger than anything else ... their friendship and knowing each other more than anyone else would have. <br /> <br /> Then I got older, I learned a little movie ... and I watched this movie again in my best friend's high school. We understand the "rich" and "famous" corner ... and we are still the best friends ... but this movie is not a cinematic masterpiece ... it can sometimes be considered a bit swirling ... a little over the top points (me "dynasty") "and" Dallas "level ...) and honestly I can identify the" teddy bear "scene because we share the bear, which means a lot more than stuffed fun toy through our research and misery men / careers that al .. so it is not so from above as it seems ....! As many have already said, Meg Ryan and Matt Latanzzi and Dack Rambo and David Selby saw the vision in 1981. this is a nice "chick" flick!
