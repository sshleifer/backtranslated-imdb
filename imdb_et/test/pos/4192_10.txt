Forget the Easy Rider - the head is a movie from the 1960s. <br /> <br /> Almost laugh: because monkeys are cutting down on dandruff for one minute in their entire career! See: 50 feet Victor Mature is trying to find out what he's doing in this movie! Hear: Frank Zappa (with his pet cow) says to Davey Jones, "Your music is terribly white"! Experience: Monkees' only lively performance as a real rock band plays aus-to-gosh for the first time in a true punk-rock song (Circle Sky)! Listen: Like Davey Jones sings Harry Nielsen's song about transsexual father! Be confused: be very confused, as confused as Terri Garr is when Mickey Dolenz makes a sexual inspiration in his film conversation. Witness: A pointless protest against the Vietnam War jumps out and disappears as quickly! See: Mike Nesmith spits on Christmas when wearing a velvety Victorian smoking jacket in the cobwebbed Gothic horror movie sound stage! Let yourself drift: a karmic blessing inspired by the Indian mystic comic book, which has been given by an actor on the black face of the white silver character, while Peter Tork claims he knows how to play the guitar! Discover: Academy Award-winning director Bob Rafelson's first full-length feature, written by Academy Award-winning actress Jack Nicholson! Pretend that it does not happen: if monkeys put the group into suicide when jumping on the Golden Gate Bridge! Drug taking - take a lot of drugs: take as many medications as cast and the team apparently did this when making the movie! <br /> <br /> With the head, the monkeys showed themselves to be the most sad, the best entertainers in Hollywood history, the bar is not. It's amazing to find that they blamed this film for a bad promo. Certainly, the promotion was practically non-existent; but did they not understand how angry, how downward they are, how this film is destructive? This film represents a journey of bad acid to the suicide center of the mental hospital. The only movie I know is Terry Gilliam Brazil; and like Brazil, this film shows why the later life of the 20th century was almost unbearable - if you were happy. It is not just that Western culture suffered serious information under overload, but the information itself was just bad, bad, bad and bad. In fact, it itself had the effect of congestion, because it allowed people to disrupt themselves with one crisis - if Vietnamese news became too big, they could turn around the channel and the documentary would rise to unemployment. <br /> <br /> "Positive" response to the reality of the incident was Woodstock - three days of peace and love and nudity and mud and bugs, and bad food and dirty drink and poop and pee and bad acid, and Peter Townsend killed almost Abbie Hoffman. Everything is done behind the steel fence, under the watchful eye of the real army of NY country soldiers, which means that the "freedom" of Woodstock Nation was as illusory as the song John Sebastion, who thought he sang when he pulled it out so quietly. talk. "The 500,000 asshole is too stupid to get out of the rain," was one of the critics' ratings for Woodstock (I think it was Andy Warhol). One good thing that happened was Jimi Hendrix's Star Spangled Banner. Two years ago, Jimi Hendrix Experience went on her first American tour as a warming band for Monkees. <br /> <br /> Look, it's all connected somehow. <br /> <br /> You owe it yourself, but you owe it to your unborn children - to see the real 1960s, but only find a movie in this odd, wonderful and completely absurd respect for one of the more interesting capitalist scams of the 20th century.
