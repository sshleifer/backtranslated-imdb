Although this movie comes from, it's definitely worth watching. I saw it about eight times as a teenager when she opened and it changed my life ... I had to live in New York. It has big open-air games from the Manhattan silhouette with Johnny Mathis. "Romance is still the best ..." that competes with the West Side Story. World's First Real Supermodel, Suzy Parker, is pretty amazing (sorry, Janice D.), but it's a great eye candy! It also provides a bit of insight into American mores at the end of the 1950s - our obsession (and repression) of sex (at work, not less!), Romance, and marriage before women's slogan. This is the era when New York was at its best, and Joan Crawford's superbitchy show is just a cake icing.
