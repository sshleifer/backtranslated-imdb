Eventually, having come to this "masterpiece", it seems to me that it must feel awfully wise in its day. It is French, arty, forever playing torture and ultimately down. But despite the 37-year-old perspective, it is just a bit empty, pretentious, and dissatisfied. Others have gathered the story, but I don't think anyone has shown a dramatic error at the heart of this movie: Corey and Vogel do not deserve what they get. They play a square in their code, never harm anyone who didn't ask for it, and show great courage and initiative. What's more, Corey is a victim of her former gangland friend who stole her girlfriend and who repeatedly tries to kill her, probably because she (Corey) dared to borrow a few thousand francs. These are the guys who really should break! Instead, things get much worse for them than the logic of the story they really need. <br /> <br /> It can be argued that this is the whole point: that true villains will never be caught; That they meet the police, if necessary, sell their friends and always come up. But it hasn't been shown. Corey's old gangster friend has not agreed with the police. Nor has he shown that he despises his victory. In fact, after he has done several times when he needs it, he is not visible at all, leaving a completely unresolved dramatic tension (his way of thinking with Corey). <br /> <br /> Nonetheless, I would say that this film is worth seeing its beautiful photography, slow, deliberate pace, great death, its complicated hysterical sequence, and encapsulation of the art-film style of the late 1960s.
