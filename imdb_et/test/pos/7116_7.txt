The Drakula House works from the same assumption as the Frankenstein House last year; namely that Universal has three of the most famous monsters; In the film Dracula, Frankenstein's monster and wolves appear together. Of course, this movie is quite dirty, but the fact that all three monsters exist is usually enough that the sixty-seven minutes of the movie would not be boring. It is obvious that the idea of ​​making another monster mash came in the head of the writer before the actual plot, because the yarn we gave is not exactly without holes. The plot has Count Dracula, who arrives at Dr. Edelman's home and wants to cure his vampireism. Then, which can only be described by chance, Lawrence Talbot, a.k.a. It turns out Dracula is on the cheek of Edelman's daughter, but Talbot is really serious. If it turns out that he can't give up wolf change, Wolf throws Man into the sea ... where he gets to Frankenstein's monster. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is not as good as the previous Frankenstein house. The 1944 film made its plot better when the series was doing, because the plot here does not give each universal monster the same time. The Dracula plot is the largest first, but soon it tends to recover at the end. Wolf Man is the star of the show, but his story never develops, and it's just another version of the plot that he always finds himself in. Franken's monster is given the coldest hand as he appears in the film as a succession and an obvious apology to ensure that all three monsters appear in the film. The most interesting is the story of all three doctors involved, but it is a bit of a disappointment because it is not the reason why people see this movie. Action is good enough for John Carradine to show his misfortune and Lon Chaney Jr for his tragedy again. Glenn Strange is not allowed to do anything, and Onslow Stevens proves to be a real highlight, like Dr. Edelman. In general, this film does not make anyone who is not a fan of Universal horror; but like silly monster movies, Drakula's house is worth it.
