I saw a movie at the Nashville Film Festival on May 1, 2003! It was amazing! All the things I read about Stuey were Tony Vidmer (writer, director, director, editor), Michael Imperioli (incredible work by Stuey) and incredibly good and everyone else involved. I'm glad he (Vidmer) did not go down the "Leaving Las Vegas" routine of Stuey's bad habits, but put us in his life, family, and gift. Linking the whole story to the motel room where he died was a great vehicle and showed his manuscript skills. Great "thumbs" about it!
