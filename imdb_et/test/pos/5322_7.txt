One wonders the state of a society that produces a father like Albert T. Fitzgerald, who we meet for the first time on an airplane where he has gone away for a long time and where he left the woman and child who are now accused of murdering a boy with mental pain . When we see him for the first time, he is on the paper in the title that the woman in front of him reads. Rather, he asks if he has a newspaper, and he offers other sections. Well, this is not what he asked for what he wants to do for the woman, to give her the front part she reads. <br /> <br /> Matthew Ryan Hoge wrote and directed a disruptive movie that largely reflects our society, as it is today. In fact, Mr Hoge speaks exactly what is wrong with it. <br /> <br /> The film is Leland, a teenager who can't even distinguish between fantasy and reality. It is obvious that the killing of a human being, even a sweet and innocent boy who deserves nothing, is a deadly consequence not only for himself but also for his family and the killed boy's family. In fact, it seems that Leland has no idea what motivated him to commit the crime because he does not show any repentance about it. <br /> <br /> It is clear that Leland is traumatized by his parents' divorce. His father is a stranger who doesn't care less about him. It's Pearl, a juvenile detention center teacher who sees a young man's confusion and wants to help, but unfortunately he has no chance. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is Don Cheadle, a great actor who always delivers. The ensemble chooses good work under the leadership of Mr Hoge. Kevin Spacey has a good chance to play the egoist father of the accused murderer and make us arrest him for an arrogant idiot. <br /> <br /> Although the film is a bit long, it leaves us with more questions than what it answered.
