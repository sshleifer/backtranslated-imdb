MY SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The misunderstood classic remains one of Henson's best and most personal films. It may seem funny to call the movie as it is "misunderstood", but people seem to remember it mostly for the delicate scenario of Jerry Juhli and for Paul Williams' exclusive songs. Now that these things are really big, as well as the formal playfulness of the movie (scenario, manuscript, movie break, etc.) that differentiates "Muppet Movie" from other Muppet movies, there is a serious, poor subject that runs through the picture. It is a road film, though, but like most roads, it is a pleasure to get there and the pursuit of the goals of the characters is limited by uncertainty and the knowledge that they can never go back. Throughout the film, the championship is shown ahead, even before Muppets has done this: Piggy gives up Kermit without his second thought, Gonzo expresses the loneliness of the performer's life and regrets his haunting "I'm going back when I ever go back" and worst , Kermit is tortured and constantly tested by Doc Hopper, who wants to commercialize for the sacred purposes of his art. (One can only ask what Henson would have had after his death for his family management.) Kermit himself agonizes his choices in the desert chat scene, and the final "Magic Store" number asks if it is all worthwhile before concluding that it is probably not so. All of this is done with the anticipated Muppet chaos and satire, and deliciously terrifying jokes, and of course, no serious stuff if it were not. But "Muppet Movie" isn't just one funny because the rest of the falling-back Muppet movies are changing. No, it is a lovely, gentle metaphor between art and entertainment and a business relationship, and today it's as effective as 25 years ago. 9.5 out of ten.
