This movie was so cool! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends. When the first credits ran, we saw that Lionsgate Films had made this movie. They are the ones who made this stupid movie Wolf Creek, which was absolutely gay! When we saw it, we fell. We thought it was like Wolf Creek, but we were so wrong! The film was not only better than Wolf Creek (which is not really that difficult), is one of the best horror films I've seen for a long time! They really redeemed this movie. It was gory, smart and scary, which is a combination of awesome horror film. Kane is fantastic when Jacob Goodnight and Christina Vidal, Samantha Noble and Luke Pegler did some good jobs as part of an old motel cleaning group. It had some difficult scenes, and you feel somewhat sad about some people who die. All in all, there is a great horror movie to watch on a Friday or Saturday night with lights and friends. Just don't look at it at the hotel.
