Undoubtedly, the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years, Werner Herzog, have probably pushed cinema boundaries more than any other commercial character. Herzog has already become known for a few decades and I have never been impressed by both man and his work. Last year I went to look at Rescue Dawn and was somewhat surprised when the movie was relatively mainstream, but couldn't imagine Herzog taking his actors and the team into the real jungle, not only to make a movie but live. No other filmmaker is so painful about the purity of the film making process and the subsequent lecture, as Fitzcarraldo is a cinematic legend. <br /> <br /> Today, I sat with Fata Morgana, a 1969 Herzog movie that could be described as an allegoric film. Without looking at the actual locations, I assume that it was shot somewhere in Africa, both in the coastal and desert areas, in an area that could have been a baby, infant civilization, and infant life on earth. It is these origins, the Bible Garden, and the Biblical Integrity that Herzog touches, which is expressed throughout the 79-minute working hours of a shared story. <br /> <br /> Watching the FM could not help but I feel I was traveling deeply on the journey. In the opening order, the title "Mirage" is translated and Herzog compares this translation with a multiple-time landing on business planes. These images are perverted, their 3-dimensionality is broken between a long lens, exhaust gases, heat waves and light aberrations. The effect remained in my conclusion: things are not as they seem. <br /> <br /> FM is divided into 3 very different chapters: 1) Creation, 2) Paradise and 3) Golden Age. The first chapter opens up countless sliding images where evil, fruit landscapes are moving, dead animals are rotting, broken shells of broken planes and abandoned cars are slowly disintegrating in the desert in the sun. People who wear this unpleasant landscape are dirty, uncomfortable and visible prisoners in the desert. Talking speaks of time before life, the time when the canvas on earth was empty and everything that existed was in heaven. Although narration hears a simpler, cleaner era, a young boy who keeps a fox-like throat, cools the human's cruel, ruthless interruption to reach the government over nature. <br /> <br /> In the next chapter we will introduce the same, but the images and people are more animated and seem like infusion of life and vitality. We listen to the biologist we are talking about saying that in such an inanimate environment the lizard of the monitor has a beast hunting. As he keeps a watch on the monitor, he denies flying, he also describes how difficult it is to grab these creatures in 140 degrees of heat. The parallels are properly marked and Herzog continues to explore this concept with repetitive, honest portraits of sun, desert, and labor-intensive efforts needed in this harsh field. He also draws on the subject that if it is not under control, man will confirm his control over his environment and not always in the most pleasant ways. <br /> <br /> The last chapter brings us to the desert blast that is more familiar with the Herzog territory, where eccentrics and absurd behavior live. Nobody seems to be a more effective symbiotic relationship with the world's oddball than Herzog - maybe he knows it most at home. Like Errol Morris, Herzog decides to place his camera in a seemingly objective position when he allows it before the roll. The ensuing flirtation with Herzog is a consequence of his subject, as he can continue shooting beyond the time that most directors were cut. As Morris does, this expanded roll pushes until the moment when the subjects know the obligatory offer and their discomfort as a result of overtime gives their facade something real. In this chapter, the most humorous portrait of a 2-member band playing an odd, polka-like song that Herzog circulates throughout this chapter. The band's drummer carries the same goggles as the biologist, as does the other guy who does the magic trick, questioning what's with the glasses? They will certainly add some relief to the film, but you have to think about whether they have a deeper meaning or importance or is it another example of Herzog's playfulness. <br /> <br /> Keep away from it, Herzog uses popular and blues music as an experimental documentary. Leonard Cohen grabs most of the screen time, his two beautifully melancholic songs "So Long Marianne" and "Suzanne." perfectly with scrolling scenes, adding a convincing feeling that we are really driving. By the end of the journey, Herzog goes back to one of the many films that are repeated throughout the film: remote measurement of a single vehicle that passes through an endless desert that has passed through a horizon-filled water hill. Despite the general darkness of the FM, the crescend of the film and the motif of noise, you are left with a hopeful spirit, a conviction that life is permanent and perhaps even flourishing against all coefficients. <br /> <br /> Having finished writing this letter, I referred to FM to find that Herzog shot this Sahara in Cameroon only weeks after the bloody coup. Her legend was arrested, beaten and imprisoned by Herzog and his team. In captivity, Herzog captured blood with the parasite Schistosomiasis. It's really hard not to love a hypnotic and oyster movie like Fata Morgana; knowing that the filmmaker was ready to die in order to do so, only makes you respect it. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
