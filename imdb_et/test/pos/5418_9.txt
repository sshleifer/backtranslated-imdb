The person I picked up can leave feedback for 10 minutes. I love it. <br /> <br /> After not seeing it for years, it happened the other day and looked back over and over again. <br /> <br /> 'Stop the eye shaking' and 'shake the stone and roller bar and cut the board to stop the classic lines. <br /> <br /> Art is cheerfully raw. Dialogue is small and wonderful. Just find it and love it. It can't be recommended enough. <br /> <br /> Thank you to the high school art teacher Mrs Kogan for showing us this over and over again. Thank you to the NFB for allowing it. Thank you MTS for showing it (at least for free now). <br /> <br /> Now I want a great snit t-shirt. I love the animation cell, but pop up to 440.00, it won't happen. <br /> <br /> Find this flick and watch it.
