I would like to see a link between NightBreed, The Fury and the X-Meni series, which is how the second series of Outer Limit would associate specific stories and plot lines to create a story, even though it was never intended. I would also like to know if there is more information about the relationship and / or cooperation between Clive Barker and David Cronenberg - anecdotal or otherwise. I just don't understand that David Cronenberg just appeared as an actor in Clive Barker. Is there more information on this topic? Finally, it has been 17 years since the release of the film and I had hoped that there would have been a sequel to date. Does anyone know if they are plans that have never reached, or are there plans for the next stage?
