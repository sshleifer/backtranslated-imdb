I remember seeing that in the early 1990s on British television and was hooked. The international scale of production is amazing and looking at how characters develop within five hours is great. The scenes set in Pakistan and Afghanistan are of particular interest, and as a viewer you will get a real sense of the culture and atmosphere of these countries at the end of the Cold War. Fazal's and Helen's characters thrive really well across this series and rivals, like in the area like Sopranos and six feet. In the UK VHS is about 6 pounds and a DVD of about 10 pounds - a quality deal. I thought the Soderbergh version was great too - but it is clearly owed to this masterpiece.
