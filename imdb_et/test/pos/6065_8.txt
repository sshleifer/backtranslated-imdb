First of all I'm an American - I haven't seen any comments about IMDb about this series yet from the US viewer. Secondly, I work in the development of the television industry. So I slip a lot of mud out of the programming of American broadcasting. "Unit One" is an example of television, which is a setback to what I attribute to 70s style scripting. Namely, those young authors who had hands free to make the drama more real and to allow organic character. It captures more along the stars of British dramas such as "Cracker" and "Prime Suspect" and Australian brilliant "Underbelly". The "Unit Unit" contains individual cases that have been committed each week and then resolved. Mysteries are neither extraordinary nor especially the Byzantines. Typically, they are in the middle of one revolution, generally tending to be a 40-minute mark, and resolution is well after 15 minutes. What changes the breath of fresh air in this series is that it has the main characters you are involved with and relative to episode 2. These are real, breathable, living characters with personal luggage, but this is not a talkative, dirty baggage type of American flots like "Gray's Anatomy" or "Desperate Housewives" spoons. These are realistic people whose backplanes open peacefully during the series, as if they were working with them on a daily basis. After a meaningless decade of "CSIs", "NCISs" and "Criminal Minds", along with their next spawning, it is refreshing to actually sit down to see the friends you want to spend time with, as is the case with Unit One. "A funny scammer, an unemployed wooden dialogue and an overwhelming risk that the American series I called every week are absurd in comparison to the nuances and quiet resonance you get with this remarkable Danish series. I'm the 7th episode of the first season, but I've already bought all for four seasons and for a long time.If you need explosions and far from testosterone, with The Who's music and fast cutting, neon light, nervous palsy-cam action with chiffon-like main characters, like your main television drama watching diet, I suggest you stay If you are an adult with hungry fine, terrible, thoughtful and, yes, sometimes straightforward drama of procedural crimes, I ask you to show it.
