This film got better over time. I can't believe it has been forty years since I saw it at the age of 15. Yes, that's right. Movie ratings were not yet a reality, so every teenager could walk in any movie. Imagine what the Midnight Cowboy and the Putney Swope were like for the baby at my age. Imagine the times. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King have just been killed, but next summer he was walking a month and Woodstock. Putney Swope was an opportunity for Woodstock's people to stay with this man. You see where Robert Downey, Jr. got its sardonic shine. His old man was a quick hero to my similar children. There are no strokes in this class, the hippies of aging rejoice when they live this age. Hopefully, this new flower children will be encouraged and this current era of fascism will be the same as the one I had under my age.
