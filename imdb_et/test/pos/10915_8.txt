I've seen this movie many times and I never get sick of it. tells the man to come out of the closet so he doesn't know he is. Kevin Kline's character is a teacher, and if one of his former students tells Kline's character, people in his city are speculating whether he is straight or gay. Kline's character begins to wonder whether she's straight or gay. The exhibition is absolutely fabulous and fun. I found the movie very funny and heart-warming. I love this movie, it makes you laugh and makes you feel good while watching it. I recommend this movie to everyone, you have this great time to watch it.
