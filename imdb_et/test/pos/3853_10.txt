The Queen is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her rich owner in Paris. When the evil commander hears that the rich old lady leaves her cat only, she is angry because she wants to get everything first. Then he puts them to sleep and gives up on the roadside. When the cats wake up, they start traveling long. The anti-street cat Thomas O'Malley will meet with them and help them. When Edgar sees them at home, he is furious and starts sending them to Timbuck. But Thomas's friends are coming to save the day. The rich lady decides to leave her home for every cat in Paris. <br /> <br /> It's a charming movie. Songs, including "Everyone Wants to Be a Cat", are lively and lively. The voice is great, Eva Gabor (who later plays Miss Bianca in Disney's THE RESCUERS) as Duchess, Phil Harris (Baloo's board, Little John ROBIN HOOD) as Thomas, giving interesting personalities to her characters. Probably Walt Disney, before he died in 1966, passed on this movie. Recommended for Disney fans or cat lovers everywhere! 10/10.
