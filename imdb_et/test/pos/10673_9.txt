I have nice memories of watching this visual dazzling film as a child in the late 1970s / early 80s during NY wor-tv (now upn-9). Although this film is a product of the 60's, it is hardly an outdated film. Impacts are as strange as in 2001 and in some ways better (modeling is flawless). JTTFSOTS is an attractive cast, superb color photography and set design and reminiscent of a result.
