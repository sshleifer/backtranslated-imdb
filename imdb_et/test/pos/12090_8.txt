The European musician and composer strives to capture Istanbul's musical diversity. Alexander Hacke (Einstürzende Neubauten, a German avant-garde band), a lover of sound experimentation, rides the streets of Istanbul with his mobile studio and magic mike to collect inspired Turkish music. His journey leads to the discovery of a wide spectrum ranging from the modern electronic, rock and hip-hop classic "Arabesque". When he travels this seductive world, Alex collects the impressions and stories of artists such as the neo-psychedelic band Baba Zula, the fusion of DJs Orient Expressions, rock groups Duman and Replikas, maverick rocker Erkin Koray, Ceza (Turkey's answer to public enemy), breakdance performers Istanbul Style Breakers, digital dervish Mercan Dede, renowned clarinetist Selim Sesler, Canadian folk singer Brenna MacCrimmon, street artists Siyasiyabend, Kurdish singer Aynur, "Elvis of Arabesque" Orhan Gencebay and legendary twins Müzeyyen Senar and Sezen Aksu.
