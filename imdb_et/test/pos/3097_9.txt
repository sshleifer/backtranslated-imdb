The well-known filmmaker Werner Herzog's "Fata Morgana" is breathtakingly unusual. Although characters appear in the movie from time to time, there is no real story. The film is also not an educational or historical documentary. This is a film that does not have the accompanying scenario. <br /> <br /> The film consists of curious background music and a somewhat illogical narrative of VO, the combination of which mostly covers, but is not limited to, the image of the Sahara Desert. . Some pictures are strange and common. The camera captures ghostly images or noises, optical illusions that tantalize and mesmerize. This general cinematic trend is driven by random subjects that concern good topics. For example, in one order, the man in the safety goggles the lizards of male doctrine. And for me, the most exciting and bizarre, a small room with a dark-eyed man who sings with a voice that is completely distorted by the microphone he uses, with an old lady playing a loud voice with an old piano. Neither the man nor the old lady seems to be doing what they do. How the Baroque is. <br /> <br /> Fata Morgana has a basic principle that combines a wide range of strange images and eclectic sounds. But this concept is so subtle, so opaque that you can never think of it without help. This fine topic makes sense for the film. Without this reference point, the film may seem a tedious and endless parade of casual terrestrial images and esoteric narrative. <br /> <br /> Unapologetically redundant, thematic confusion and cinematic uneven, "Fata Morgana" will probably make you sweaty or make you throw. You either have to capture the Zen-like qualities of the movie or the temptation to break the DVD into a thousand pieces. One thing most viewers agree is: "Fata Morgana" is ... different.
