I don't understand why all people give negative comments to this movie?!?! I loved this movie! Bled is a form of abstract art, and if you don't know art, I see why you wouldn't want that movie. It was very complicated on average, playing a vampire movie. If you are looking for a fresh, new and brilliant new vampire movie, this is for you. But if you want one of them to become bats, wolves, and melt in the sunlight, look at how your old one played Dracula. Of course, this is a bit of a small budget, but they did a great job with their budget. I'm very happy to have found this movie because I started to give up the vampire genre. I thought this movie was great! I'll give the publisher, the director and all the people involved in the film 2 thumbs.
