The final installment sees Sho Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi (which looks cooler than ever before in their reversible coat!) Against each other during the last battle, this time in the future. The plot owes much to Blade Runner, but it is made with Takashi Miike's low budget, funny, comic style. I thought it was the weakest of the three DOA films, and although the ending was still terrible, it didn't have the value of the previous two shocks. Compared to Ichi killer and visitor Q, DOA is almost not extreme in the finals, but loyal to the other two films in the trilogy. This means that the fans of the first two (and Miike fans) will get a lot of it, as it links all three movies together and gives a final explanation of the relationship between the two main characters.
