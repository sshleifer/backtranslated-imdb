The music is Stravinsky (not stupid incompetent Philip Glass) and it is written ten years before the unlucky birth of glass. The production is simply extraordinary. Japanese narrative adds a dangerous quality and intensity that is not in Latin. cf. Terzieff's version. Huge heads and hands are completely justified by the mythical aspect of the story. The props and makeup for the roof are just on the spot. This is Taymore's best work. Singers are very good, especially Terfel. Langridge is pretty touching and clean, and Norman finds the right expression and her beauty is great and finds the right place: bigger than life. Just black.
