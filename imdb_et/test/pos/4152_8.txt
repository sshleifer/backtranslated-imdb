This is a film that is remarkable for what is not shown as much as what is. What has been shown is an incredible poverty in Sicily, as the 19th century brought a 20th century lifestyle that made people dream of a new world of America. The Mancuso family lives in a place that is not even a small town but a stone house located between the country's harsh and harsh rocks that cannot offer any green grass. The order of opening shows that the men of Mancuso scramble barefoot in the mountainous ridge, there are stones in their mouth, which at the top of the shrine offer a "sign" which they should lay out for the new world or stay where they are. It also shows life on liner ships, indeed massaged, the longing to breathe freely and the conditions in Ellis Iceland, where their journey is still not being heard, and they are being investigated to prove their "suitability" to enter America. What NOT to show is a ship in Longshot or indeed any blow that would detect it as a large ocean ship; What is not shown is something that would detect America, the New York Harbor cliche and the Freedom Step, so Ellis Island could be in any country. Perhaps the most remarkable blow is what has been done by a camera hoist that scans hundreds of people; Slowly, almost a third of the left of the screen's population begins to separate from the right-hand side of the screen, and we realize that the people on the left are actually on board and the right is the dock, a powerful society statement fragmented. There is a strong documentary feeling as if we were watching a ship full of immigrants, although it has been carefully written and is clearly an amalgam of typical families / conditions. Almost nothing happens in dramatic conditions, not to the multiplex popcorn brigade, but for the rest it is a very nice movie.
