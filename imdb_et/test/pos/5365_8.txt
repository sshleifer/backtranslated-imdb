I saw it at the 2004 Stony Brook Film Festival in NY and was very warmly welcomed. In this pre-WW2 movie, a couple of German rocket scientists work on Skarp's Scarp Island as a horizon of war looms. The characters on the island are invaluable in creating and depicting them. Shauna MacDonald is especially memorable <br /> <br /> After accelerating with "Scootish" accents, the viewer sees himself at home with those peoples looking at the fun when the Germans are working to tie their island to the mainland through rocket-based mail delivery. Since this film seems unlikely, it was based on the actual story. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is a memorable film that will remain for you for some time thanks to your pain, story or landscape.
