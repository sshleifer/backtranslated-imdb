Even Maria Montez / Jon Hall chewing gums of the '40s have overshadowed the "princess of the Nile", the entrance of Fox in the mid-50s of Hollywood, obsessed with Egyptian things (see "The land of Pharoahs," in the kings' valley, etc.) \ T that is highly produced (in fact with a low budget, but using kits and costumes left from "Robe"), this Technicolored speculation looks like it costs millions, 71 minutes of eye candy (a plot that has something to do with old Egyptians with inconvenience) offers the operator and the audience a glimpse of Debra Paget with a large number of faces, most of which hit the ground when she shakes and shimmies through a slave-girl production number that is incomparable in film history. Female video players were not replaced: Fox's youngest contracted player, Jeffrey Hunter is as photogenic as Ms. Paget, while Michael Rennie strikes in the background, stirring evil actions in the pyramid lands. For those who think Paget & Hunter can't act and hired only for their physical qualities, look at their subtle, neglected, heartbeat work, which a few years later "White Feather" (the second Fox production that has unfortunately disappeared) . lost movies). "The Princess of the Nile" is still in the classroom joyfully frantic, breathtakingly fast, dazzling testimony of the 3-band Technicolor glory and the charming charm of Mrs Paget (all 20 at that time)). Put this one-of-a-sure kitsch at the top of your "innocent pleasures" list and enjoy. Satisfaction is guaranteed!
