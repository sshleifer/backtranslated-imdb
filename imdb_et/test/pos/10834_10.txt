I've noticed that people have asked if anyone has this exhibition. I have all 26 episodes that inspired and wanted to be shared with interested parties in the United States. All I ask is that you submit VHS tapes or blank DVDs that I have in both formats and charge for shipping. My email address is creator67@pipinternet.net, send me an email and your request and I will notify you and we can arrange. Quality is very good and they are very enjoyable to watch, especially if you have not been able to see them because they have appeared in the 60s. It was one of my favorite shows as a child and I have a very special place in my heart because it brings back many memories of my childhood and other shows like Ultraman and Astroboy. <br /> <br /> Peter
