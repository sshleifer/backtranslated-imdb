At the beginning of the 19th century, a young woman with a carnivore has violated her family's ambitions and local community's superstition, but she meets a man who can see her differently and just change her life forever. <br /> <br /> Precious Bane is a British broadcaster that adapts Mary Webb's highly respected novel. This is a beautifully filmed piece that works at an incredibly high level, the story of {Maggie Wadey} is great, and the details of the period and the use of dialects are none other. It is a disgrace that this movie has not yet received a DVD, it might have been thought that Clive Owen's {big here as Gideon} will rise to the stardom, the BBC could get out of it, but unfortunately the catch is in very rare cases that TCM shows it. Janet McTeer as Pru Sarn's lead is just brilliant, guts and real emotion go hand in hand when McTeer gives her everything. You must not only fight your face by dysfunctioning, but also by constant slipping and criminals. This is the time when the people believed that when a rabbit ran in front of a pregnant woman, she wrote to the destruction, the time of bullfighting, the time of superstition, and the witches. Despite his constant return, Pru is strong and inventive, even his own family knocks back dreams without understanding it, but this path can be very terrible, but hope is eternal and Pru is countless in hope. <Br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
