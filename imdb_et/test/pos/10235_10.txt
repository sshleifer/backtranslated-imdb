Nightbreed is definitely my favorite movie, I have worn more than one tape. Make-up is awesome, the story is cute. It takes a couple of different twists and is not as deep as the story it is based on (Clive, Clive Barker), but it is very accurate for the source material to customize it. The only problem with this film was the manufacturer's in vain attempts to make it into a teenage movie, so the end changed to allow queue * rolls *. Apparently, one day we'll get a director's section that (I hope) explains it a little crap. So far I would recommend it to anyone who likes slashers of Freddy / Jason / Micheal. I really don't know what would be comparable ...
