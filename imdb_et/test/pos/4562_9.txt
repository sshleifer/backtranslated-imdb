This is one of the most satisfying TV adjustments. An actor who makes us believe that Borg may be sexy, believes that spy and traitor may have some redemption qualities. <br /> <br /> The TV channel line doesn't exactly follow Cornwell's story, but it is as exciting and rewarding as repeating good yarns. If you have a yen of uniform romance, there is a lot of sexual energy between our male Sharpe and the lying hussy. I wanted my role to be closer to the books. But regardless of whether the hero is spoiled, the hero will be redeemed, the hero of the rage, the hero in flight and the hero in battle to keep you in the DVD game.
