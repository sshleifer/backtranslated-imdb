Being relatively young, I didn't know how bad anti-Semitism was in Brooklyn, where my family came from. This movie amazed me. I've seen a lot of movies about prejudice, racism and anti-Semitism, but it seemed to me harder than most. . I had to drive it for 45 minutes and it was worth it. Almost everything about the movie was great. Sometimes it was a bit slow, but it didn't bother me because the film was very atmospheric. It happened in the 40s and it looked like it was 40s. The action was great ... William H. Macy was always wonderful, so was Laura Dern and I liked Meatloaf's performance pleasantly, playing a malicious anti-Semitic neighbor. <br /> <br /> 9/10
