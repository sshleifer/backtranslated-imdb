I went to watch this movie carefully. The suicidal "comedy" didn't seem consistent. Being a brother who has tried to commit suicide and has seen the entire family causing destruction, I know first how breaking this problem can solve the problem. I have to say - this movie deals with it in a way that allows the viewer to "suffer" someone who suffers and just doesn't know why or how to stop it. Although the film is not perfect, it respects the subject and, more importantly, makes it accessible to the masses. I know for my family, humor has helped us out a lot of pain. And Max and Grace are just what he's going to be - suicide comedy. It's funny - And I thought the characters were real and viable. It is also extremely smart, but simple. It cuts the chase and I appreciate it! I'll give it 9 and recommend it.
