This movie can be the best if you want to watch and laugh at movies and then make friends watch these movies. If you are like me and you probably are, then laugh at the jokes of this movie for years. One of the funniest parts is when Gus grabs money with a kid boy and then the guy takes the kids in the forest like Hansel and Gretel, he and his wife go with them. The soup scene kitchen is occupied by a comic genius: "Inspection Officer - Here!" and the following lines, in my opinion, remain forever. When I have shown this movie to my friends, they usually say "What was that ?!" so if you're in the mood for one of those movie types, yippee! This movie is so OOP that it's no longer funny, so it's probably the easiest way to get it online. For the first time I saw it on rent.
