I am a 20 year old bloke from England. I'm not shouting in the movies. But it took me. I cried like a girl! It's a completely moving film I've ever seen, although the story was questionable. The little face of Joseph Mazello, when he dreams of crying, put me at any time to wreck. How can anyone suffer such a sweet boy? I'm just thinking now! Noteworthy.
