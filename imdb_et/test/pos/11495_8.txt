I feel that Lisa Krueger is easy to forget. Personally, I found my first film, the 1996 Manny and Lo, a wonderfully detailed character study and performances that were equally wonderful (special credit to Mary Kay Place). The movie was played for a week or two in major city centers and disappeared. One or two critics really liked it, but many saw it as a little. Krueger's second film, Committed, was released this year (2000) (after almost two years of delays) and it was lost. And once again, the critics pushed the film back lightly and pushed it aside, praising Heather Graham's presence on the screen, but rarely was his behavior. And once again, I am committed to solid success. I feel that Krueger has a true voice and personal visual style and features that should not just be ignored just because he works very restrained hostile. , but it usually refers to Joline's (Graham's) refusal to let his wife Carl (Luke Wilson) leave and leave. He watches him from New York to El Paso and becomes one of the most attractive journalists in his latest cinematic history. His respect for his marriage promises leads to Mexican mystery and self-analysis. And yes, the plot is just that easy and so just so easy to ignore. <br /> <br /> Joline, of course, is the generation's crying voice, whose parents left nearly fifty percent. And for me, his personal revolution against the legacy of broken promises and fraud is quite intelligent and powerful. Joline believes in the belief that people do not have enough faith in each other, Joline must inevitably discover that her beliefs are not with the general beliefs of society. Several of the comments he has made for his character as one-dimensional and I am afraid this is a simplified reading of the film. Or maybe even wrong. If Joline were just innocent, she wouldn't be interesting at all. It is a fact that he understands the world and refuses to play by standards that make him so interesting. Sociologically, he is a complete deviant. <br /> <br /> Krueger sometimes gets into the moments of cutesy dialogue, and his direction on this film is rather strange to the addiction of clouds that move across the El Paso silhouette. But his mistakes are quite rare and in this movie, like Manny and Lo, it's a day that carries a day. Graham has never been better because he has never had the character like Joline. For the first time in his career, Graham seems to be playing adult, even in a slightly arrested development. He's wearing the movie perfectly. Luke Wilson and Casey Affleck (like Joline's brother) have as many moments as Alfonso Arau, Mystic Mexico and Mark Ruffalo and T-Bo, a slightly psychotic truck driver. Like Manny and Lo, these characters are part of their environment, well-detailed, completely organic creations. These signs may sometimes seem unnaturally peculiar, but they make sense in their context. Even Goran Visnjic, as an artist with Jolini's devotion, is in a strange way, although his character has never been discussed by a stranger. <br /> <br /> For me, this is a movie that gets back from the depths. The second comment here spoke about the stereotypical images of Mexico. And again I am tempted to call it wrong. Joline is seeking self-justification. He knows that his dedication is out of control, but he is looking for any spiritual path that can help him. Arau's character realizes that most people do not believe in Him, and he plays his faith when he sees a woman who respects Him. <br /> <br /> I think I can understand how this movie can be considered a sublime, I just disagree. It's consistently funny, often fun, and all characters emit heat that is quite wonderful. <br /> <br /> I will give it 7.5 / 10 and when I login here, go to 8.
