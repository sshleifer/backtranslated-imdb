Werner Herzog is studying the human psyche again. "Little Dieter ..." we meet a effervescent, brilliant man who lived in the Bavarian War, having seen hunger and strange sights, moved to the United States and filled his dream of being a flyer. War, food, death, survival, stocking, planes, heads come out ... how an American is born. Again, Herzog sees madness as an existential level, and surreal mixes with fears like Herzog himself tells the story of this German psychic journey, which becomes Americans who drive at the end of the 20th century during the war, when culmination of technology, pilgrimage and garbage with spoon cans are constantly optimistic about a man redefined America. As always with Herzog, we are confronted with cunning madness, brilliance, and being a person in the eyes of our excessive, social and personal. We laugh and shine and we are surprised at this man. Where else is this man, but America?
