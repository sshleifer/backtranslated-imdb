An interesting movie with Jordan Brewster as a young woman traveling to Europe trying to find out what her older sister (Cameron Diaz) was, who died mysteriously years ago. Brewster is very good and keeps you involved, despite some unrealistic drawing, such as his amazing finding and romance with his dead sister's parents' boys (Christopher Eccleston). However, mostly good. GRADE: B
