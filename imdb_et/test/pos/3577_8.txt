"Poor dreams always come back like unwanted friends," says Marion Fairlie, who, along with her sister Laura, lives in the middle of the Victorian countryside. "And last night I found myself in Limmeridge's churchyard. Usually dead people are dead, as usually criminals are locked rather than victims, but then there was nothing normal that happened to us." "And we are away from the first-class Gothic story of madness, deceit and misery, relying on the great novel of Wilkie Collins' Victorian secret. It is a good idea to pay great attention because plots are plots, but they all focus on a cunning and merciless scheme that still includes money. , lots of money. <br /> <br /> Marion Fairlie (Tara Fitzgerald) and her sister, Laura Fairlie (Justine Wadell) are dedicated to each other. Marion is fierce and defensive; Laura is softer and more romantic. Marion does not have the marriage prospects we know, Laura has been put back for some time by Sir Percival Glyde (James Wilby), which is a very charming aristocrat, they are their uncle's, stubborn, uneven, Huge self-centered hypocondria (Ian Richardson) Everything seems to be quite routine, but then the young artist Walter Hartright (Andrew Lincoln) will teach them to draw and artistic recognition. arrives at the local railway station at night, there is no carriage so he leaves the legacy. In a dark forest, he meets a strange woman dressed in white, traveling and talking about things she doesn't understand, who then disappears. Are we satisfied? Yes, and so are her and her sisters when they realize that the strange woman looks like Laura. Later will love between Walter and Laura arise? Is pung booming? Is there a misunderstanding that sends Walter away and takes Laura married to Sir Percival? Will it break? And whether the secrets are slowly coming to light on the relationship between Laura, Mariani, and the white woman ... do we learn to be deeply suspicious of Sir Perciv's intentions ... whether we enjoy the style and customs of Sir Perciv's close friend, Count Fosco (Simon Callow). and do we finally realize that mankind is capable of destroying unpleasant depths, as well as the power of glory and true love? Are we visiting Victorian crazy priests, seeing the fall from the high towers, digging in the middle of an open grave at night, and watching the revenge that comes in the midst of the roaring flame of a locked church? <br /> <br /> Well, of course, and it's a great journey for us. <br /> <br /> This BBC / Masterpiece Theater program features fine-tuning and great product values. Matching the Collins' 500-plus-page novel with less than 120-minute TV shows means that much needed to be cut or shortened, and some changes were likely to have a greater impact in less time. However, in my opinion, the production of the White Woman, in my opinion, has worked very well as a moody, romantic, dark TV story. Tara Fitzgerald, like Marion, gives a lead report as a woman who has decided to protect her sister and then save her. James Wilby, like Sir Percival, leads smart tips that allow us to see submerged mucus that still has magic. Ian Richardson, as a young female uncle, almost steals the exhibition. He gives such superior and sharp performance that almost always balances the story every time he appears. Perhaps the main parts are the weakest Simon Callow as Count Fosco. Count is just a monster, but extremely civilized and charming. Collins described him as a huge circle. Callow does this fine, cunning work, but I don't have a little evil monster. At one point, Marian tells us, "My sister and I like gothic novels when we sometimes act as if we were in them." Little did he know what was in store for himself and Laura.
