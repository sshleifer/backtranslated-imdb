Italian Soft X Exorcist Clone. <br /> <br /> The woman buys a perplexed thief. This thief comes to life and is a devil with rape fantasies. <br /> <br /> Ivan Rassimov plays the devil excellently. Mostly due to his bad appearance. And because he never did nudity. Good for him. <br /> <br /> The leading actor did a decent job. Her wide-eyed innocence and the fact that she looked very naked helped. <br /> <br /> It has a similar primer on most Italian horror movies. The girl's parents are dirty and spoiled. See it for details. <br /> <br /> Laura Gemser's wife, Gabriel Tint, also appears as a random spike. His part is basically called, but like cheap beer, it did work. <br /> <br /> Failure of Director due to shortcomings. It could have been fear / sex classic.
