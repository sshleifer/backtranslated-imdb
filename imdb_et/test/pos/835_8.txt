The original female Convict Scorpion is always a masterpiece. The first sequel, Jailhouse 41, was, in my opinion, not quite as good, although it is still remarkable by the fact that it took the idea of ​​the original and created something completely different in style. Director Shunya Ito has managed to make the same film again; The story here is a bit different, but still it has managed to make the previous recordings great and better than many of these types of movies and something quite original. Again, action focuses on Nami Matsushima ("Scorpion") and this time he is in prison and not too eager to go back. After escaping from the police, one thing leads to another and Scorpion finds himself with a prostitute and his slower brother. Prostitute reaches the impregnated infant (...) while the Scorpion is kidnapped and detained by someone who made the prisoner an enemy. But Scorpion does not like spending time behind bars and it is not a long time before he does what he does best. <br /> <br /> The film begins as a big start when we see that Scorpion was about to take his copper hand to his prison. From there, however, the film slows down a lot and Beast Stable is more than a drama than the previous two films. This does not mean that there are not many actions yet - Scorpion is still spending a lot of time in "revenge" mode and the film is not generally short. Meiko Kaji reiterates the role of his ominous title, and is another underrated, almost non-verbal play. The presence of his screen is great, but he manages to have a dangerous presence, even though it is physically small. The plot structure of this movie is similar to the other two because it all relies on revenge. There are more people in this movie who have been angry with Scorpion than in the previous two, so this part takes a big part of the movie. There are some surreal sequences, not as much as the first movie and almost not the other one, but the movie remains in that part of the rest of the series. In general, I would say that this film is between the first two qualities - not as big as the original and a little better than the other.
