This movie is based on the game and is another adaptation of this work. Paul Sorvino plays a basketball coach for a team of players who won the championship 20 years ago. They've all come together for a meeting. Terry Kinney plays juniors, juniors, who will soon get their nerves and their sorrow and will feel sorry for me. Vincent D'Onofrio, like Phil, plays a reluctant businessman with just the right amount of "money". Tony Shalhoub is George, the current mayor of the city, and seems to be on the edge of some sort of division. Gary Sinise plays Tom, writes about an alcoholic, and I think it's an excellent role. Although they all think they are celebrating their championship, conflict, jealousy and struggle. As men meet what was and is now, they are forced to look at their lives in a non-pleasant way. It is unusual for a group of people to be told and called out about what might have been, and I found it interesting to associate them. It's not the best movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely good to watch.
