It must be the best film of all time (in my opinion). It really taught me when I watched when I was 10 years old (in 2000) that the child's freedom slipped away before we wait for it. Joseph Mazzello also has to be my favorite actor and I think his and elijah's wood was a great job in the role of the brothers. This movie is quite sad and some people don't understand the end. But the story itself is quite unbelievable, the idea that a bad 7-year-old boy (bobby) is a drunk step abused by his father is terrible and what the two boys do is sad and important. My favorite part of the movie is when Tom Hanks (older Mike) lists 7 things that are a child who has disappeared into the adult world. There are, however, some parts that could have been better done in this movie, such as the mother pouring (lorraine braco), which I think is a terrible actor. "The King" played its role well because it is a difficult role. Joseph and Elijah were definitely movie stars. I couldn't believe how well they played the abusive stepfather's victims when they were at age (7 and 9). But in general, I recommend this movie to someone who loves big child actors and a big movie. :)
