I enjoyed this movie thoroughly and by now it's one of my favorites. The story was great, though eventually the twisting was too predictable and I knew what would happen too early. Usually, if this happens, the film is corrupted for me (like "others"), but even knowing the result enjoyed it until the end. Kelly Overton's (Eve) performance was impressive by other people's comments. I'm afraid it wasn't. His performance seemed to me a weak part of the film, unlike James Haven's (Don Wake) amazing result (or characterization) ... I hope we'll see him more. What a very small movie that is highly recommended for everyone!
