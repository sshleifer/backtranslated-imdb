I went through the tops. I went through the low tide ... crying, laughing, beating my loving interior. But through all this I got healed. I became a better person who sat through this experience to self-imposed deterioration. We cannot say every day that we have lived the worst and have come across something similar to our health and health. Friends ... neighbors-connect and be now. Go out and find this movie and finish your extravaganza. Put it on the coat high and kiss your polystyrene box. Take it to bed. Take it out with you when you go shopping or if you have blind dates with strange people. They will appreciate you for your greatness and the unique schizophrenic inclination in the cinema. And then they throw their drink on their face (but you have the last laughter). I ran to the governor with this little beauty under my belt (and you can!). This is the affection that deserves again and again.
