I recently saw it at the 2007 Palm Springs International Film Festival. The movie's title and, in fact, a large part of the film's sketch comes from Robert Graves' poem Beauty in Trouble. Jan Hrebejk leads the story of Petr Jrchovský in Hrebejki and Jrchovský. The story begins in 2002, when Prague hit one of those devastating 100-year-old floods that destroy Marcela (Ana Ceislerová) and Jarda (Roman Luknár) and their two children, Cuba (Adam Misik) and Lucina (Michaela Mrvikova). Because of the conditions of the images, Cuba's life-threatening asthma lives. Marcela works and Jarda runs out of the garage where they live. Jarda's shady occupation runs against him and one of his victims of theft is Marcela. Evzen Benes (Josef Abrhám) is a wealthy businessman who shares his time between Italy and the Czech Republic and takes care of Marcela and his two children. Jana Brejchová is Marcella's mother, who lives with her common-law spouse, Uncle Richie, who was probably played by Jirí Schmitzer as the best role in the film. Rounding this great pain is Emilia Vasaryova Jarda's mentally fragile mother, who gives her the money she receives from local religious charlatan. There's a lot of small film here and it's a good story with a great script and a lot of comics. Ales Brezina offers music with additional music by Czech singer Raduza and Irish singer Glen Hansard. I like this movie a lot and I would give it out of 10 out of 10 and recommend it.
