I had never read any of Sarah Waters' novels or watched Tipping the Velvet. I only heard about Fingersmith when I was on the "L word" websites. Fingersmith's story was of interest to me, but I went away, thinking that "during the lesbian Victorian period that never ends well, I have enough lesbian series and movies that don't go where" <br /> <br /> Christmas with my The local DVD store gave Fingersmith a discount, I brought it to the DVD and my life has never been more colorful. <br /> <br /> This mini-series is worthy of appreciation and praise. Action is so great that I rarely call it. Sally Hawkins, Elaine Cassidy, Rupert Evans, Imelda Staunton, and many other things I could not name, brought their characters to light and darkness. Just with a little gesture, a bit of a look, a little touching, they made their characters real and as a viewer I couldn't help but take them home, keep them close. <br /> <br /> Fingersmith, a set in Victorian region, is a story of a Sue-early-lover who loves and lives with her "Family" pocket pockets. He was little aware that his fate was related to Maud Lily - somewhat shy, timid girl growing up in mile and miles away. Maud's mother left her fortune, but Maud can't touch it unless she marries. The worst thing is that Maud's uncle makes him involuntary when he keeps him in jail. <br /> <br /> Enter a gentle, good-looking thief, which is such a bad heart as Mr, sir. She wants Maud's happiness for herself and for that she does Sue as Maud Lily's servant, asking Sue to convince Maud to live with her. As time goes by, things would be simple if Sue didn't love Maud. <br /> <br /> And things would be simple if the story was just what I just said. I don't want to spoil, so I'd like to stop there. But I can assure you that everything is twisted and turned before you know what happened. If that happened, then you ask what happens next. In addition, the story is full of other passions. There is no self-search, questioning of sexuality, "Oh my God likes girls' moments because girls in Fingersmith are buried so deep in their darkness that they hardly care. The story of such a twisted plot moves as smoothly as water, passes passionately, but strangely calm. passed when I watched "Fingersmith", but Maud's eyes are still pursuing me and Sue's words warm in my heart "You gem, you pearl, you pearl," he said.
