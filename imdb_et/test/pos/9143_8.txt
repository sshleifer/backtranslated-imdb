China White (1989) was Ronny Yu's first international film. This U.K, / Dutch / Hong Kong production was shot in English and edited to a little Western audience. The American Wong brothers (Michael and Russell) were supposed to celebrate the film together, but it was not possible due to previous commitments, so another Western actor Steven Leigh took his place. Several Hong Kong stars, such as Tommy Wong (play mute) and always horrible William Ho, appear both in the interesting spot of the scene and the director. <br /> <br /> Chow's brothers are in the Netherlands to run a family business. . They want to go to the family business legitimately, but other Asian gangs do not want to see and move there by saving face, that "foreigners" like and would like to keep old fashion money. Others want to go into a new low on drug trafficking and not on their business. After Chow's elder has been blown off by cold blood, the brothers make their own move against any family who is not with them. Can the Chow family keep families from killing one another or from the streets of Holland with the blood of virginity and gangsters? <br /> <br /> Very underrated movie. I was surprised how good it was. I haven't seen a version of Hong Kong. That would be a great treatment for me. It is longer and production is much more Hong Kong cinema stars. Too bad this movie is not available D.V.D. The video I saw was washed out and the sound reproduction was not so great. <br /> <br /> Very recommended for action fans. <br /> <br /> Factoid: This movie takes place before decriminalization of drugs <br /> <br /> The Netherlands.
