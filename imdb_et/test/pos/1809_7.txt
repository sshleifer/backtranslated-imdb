This typical teenage film is one of the best, the story is good, the music comes with the film. Although I do not enjoy the classic film, if it is not a classic and better written script, it is exceptional. Maybe the style and language of hair should change a bit, in the 80s I believe that offensive language is rarely heard. <br /> <br />
