Totally wonderful! Humor, amazing music and an anti-war message will probably make it the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> First of all, I love how clever this movie is, especially in Vietnam. plot. What's interesting is how the army officials get rid of the draft. Observe this with the real war and then the conclusion (which leaves me angry during the war); and yet there is no violence on the screen. Wow. <br /> <br /> Music is also really cool. But what is very unique about this music (such as Evita or Oz's wizard) is that words don't tell the story. Mood (with visual and inter-song dialogues): "Donna" is a cheerful song that emphasizes a happy mood, while "meat failures" are driving, intense competition, with a small key. <br /> <br /> I also note that the LSD scene is not very flattering. Now I certainly don't intend to do the drugs (not what I ever intended). <br /> <br /> All the things that it is is an amazing movie. The only negative comment I can say is that dialogue is sometimes difficult to hear. But who cares? 10/10 stars!
