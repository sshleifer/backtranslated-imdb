Spike Feresten is a comic genius. "Talkshow" shows a fresh surprise that has created such odd examples of the ball as Letterman and The Daily Show. His sensitivity is felt. It looks like he finds a unique angle, not a predictable sitcom path ... thank God. His comedy resembles the award-winning Arrested Development (cross your fingers that Talkshow has a longer life). His highlighted themes tend to be the things that go unnoticed by everyone else, but when he makes fun around them, you don't know how you missed it for the first time. I especially liked the sketches ... "Unfair Goals" is a cult classic. Set up your Tivo people ... this is a show that can't be missed.
