The film begins at a board meeting in a larger advertising agency. Putney Swope is on the board for some other reason than being black and the agency needs a "badge" on board. Swope ignores the meeting by reading a Jet magazine at a large table and all ignoring Swope ... Maybe the CEO is on the spot. Time is not wasted. The keeper is called to take the corpse and the board immediately decides on a new CEO. And when the voices are agreed one after another, this tension persists, and finally, the voice climbs a funny climax, giving the viewer a delicious logical effect to relax on the rest of the film. If you've ever talked back to stupid television, you can see this movie. Too bad doesn't seem to be any real Putney Swopes in the world.
