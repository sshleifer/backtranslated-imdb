OK, it's easy not to confuse this flat with Stuart Gordon's "The Bed of Death" that came out a few years ago because it's "Bed See Eats". And how do I even describe it? Well, starters, probably the bed that eats. This is due to demonic drawings, which naturally affect most things. The bed is in an old servant's room or something, and is responsible for the loss of quite a few people in their time. We have a narrator who is a ghost that sits behind the wall behind the painting, and collects all the non-edible sweets (jewelery, etc.) that the bed gives. He died in consumption, one of the few people who put him in a bed that could not eat, probably because he was sick, he theorizes, as we see him in cages of blood in the projectiles ...... The thing about this movie is that he has a very strange sense of humor, but it's all dead. The film is divided into several "deeds", I think, "Breakfast, lunch, dinner and just desserts". Unknowingly weird and strange fans, it may just be your alley. All I can say is that it should believe it. 8 stars out of 10.
