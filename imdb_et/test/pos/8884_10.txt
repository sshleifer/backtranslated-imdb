Was it the one who raised you when you were young? You want him to get out of his life? This woman is your mother. You should respect him, you should respect him, whether he is sick or well. But it can be aggravating at times. Especially when he gets very upset. That's how Owen (Danny DeVito) had to deal with "Throw Momma Fron The Train". Her mom (Anne Ramsey, 1929-88) is one of the worst. He is trying his best to be a writer, and he is all but grateful. Invites him to "clumsy poop", "larda $$" and "fat" and "fool". For her friend Larry Donner (Billy Crystal) she has her female problems, her former wife. He's trying to paralyze him. What did Owen do? Push it overboard. What is he doing? Help back, get rid of Mrs. lift! The kitchen event liked that Owen named Larry, "Cousin Patty". And Momma said, "You have no cousin Patty!" and Owen shouts, "You lied to me!" and El Cabongs Larry with a pan. Then there's a fun part when they're on the train and try to kill Momma Lift. It is a failure and he hits Larry out of the train. Well, all back to normal, the former husband lives, but Momma threw the bucket himself. Perhaps he should have seen the mistakes of his dominant ways. It's a fun movie and it's great. Classic! 5 Stars!
