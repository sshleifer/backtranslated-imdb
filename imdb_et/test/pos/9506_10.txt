As other comments have said, there are some missing videos on this collection, but what is on this album is overwhelming. There are two different audio tracks, original recording and a completely updated version. All new musicians from the population are welcome, and I think the new version may be more friendly to the listener for the first time, but I prefer the original recordings (probably just because they are "originals." The production of this DVD is amazing, new and old videos are all interesting , Live Video is likely to offer the least interesting video available (although fragments of live recordings that are considered Easter eggs are extremely welcome).
