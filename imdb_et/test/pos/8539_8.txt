Ed (occasional editor) has been hired to cut horror films so that they are in Europe (where standards are much stricter). But he thinks the movies are very desperate and start to get a little crazy. Okay, "a little" can be an understatement. <br /> <br /> Let me first say the best: the best. opening. scene. never before. A man in an office that blows his head with a grenade. His boss then says - straight face - "you're fired". The whole movie can't keep that intensity, but it certainly does. <br /> <br /> Take shotgun scenes, shots, "lost limbs" clips (what my friend Jason wanted a real movie). The writer of this movie thought that a woman who was raped for violence and then immediately after she was smiling on her face is the main body. This is something you can't find in any other movie (at least, I'm pretty doubtful). <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake in this movie is quality. The picture is not as crisp as the 1997 film should be, and the sound can be touched (though not bad). I thought I was watching the 1980s movie. Although it gave him some momentum, the film also had a writing and leadership style of the 1980s: a fun feeling and giving the audience a little extra. I miss those days. I think you should see it. You've seen a box in the video shop where the ax is shared ... maybe you've passed it many times. Maybe you thought it was cheese. Pick it up. Enjoy it.
