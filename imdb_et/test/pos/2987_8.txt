Most of these reviews are dead, so I'll cut a different chase and answer a few questions I've seen here. <br /> <br /> Although the characters look and see the young (hence the contradiction), the actor / actor himself was 17 and 18 at the time and apparently over 16 barrier. Here in the US, it is still somewhat controversial, but the simplicity and innocence of the film compensates for it a lot. <br /> <br /> I am not sorry that Sean would have seen it any more; in this film, at least his expressions are demonstrative and obvious; you know exactly what the character feels, whether he is angry, scared or confused. Anice had a healthy career, who at the end of her life had lost cancer at the end of 2006. He was a beautiful and talented actor. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> A great price; I've seen it as low as $ 60 and as much as $ 152 (with this comment, there were two). The next video PAUL & MICHELLE is not quite as expensive and can be obtained (if available) for Amazon on average between $ 16 and $ 70.
