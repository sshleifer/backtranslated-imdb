I find Saboteur as Hitchcock's first "American" movie because the story is entirely in the US. <br /> <br /> This movie has great scenes. Statue of Liberty Scene, Barry Kane jumped from the bridge to the water, the scene of the water body is amazing. It is not Hitchcock's fault that he did not want the actors he wanted. Hitchcock originally wanted Gary Cooper to lead foreign correspondents and Saboteur. But Gary Cooper wasn't interested in making a thriller. Another reason why Hitchcock didn't get big letters was that he was not one of the leading leaders. While Rebecca was a great success, most of the film's success went to David O. Selznick. For example, David O. Selznick got the best picture of Rebecca for the Oscar. And Hitchcock didn't get the best director for Rebecca Oscar. Hitchcock began to pay attention after a foreign correspondent (1940). But Universal gave him a low budget for Saboteur (1942). Hitchcock tried to get Joel McCrea for this movie because he was ready to work with Hitchcock again with low wages. He enjoyed working with Hitchcock as a foreign correspondent (1940). But he was not available. That's how Robert Cummings played the role. Hitchcock named Robert Cummings "competent speaker." I thought he did his best. He was a less well-known actor who was ready to play the role of many great actors refusing to play a leading male role. <br /> <br /> As for women, Hitchcock wanted Margaret Sullavan or Barbara Stanwycki to take the lead. They were not interested. So Universal decided to give a role to Priscilla Lane. I read from the book that it was one of his favorite films. <br /> <br /> I also liked the scene in the house of blind people. This is my favorite scene. When we listen to the dialogue that takes place in Uncle Filippe's house, we can see how intense it is. Uncle Philip (Blind Man) studied Barry Kane's character as he entered his house. Today Barry heard his house, hearing Barry's handcuffs. Through the conversation, he realized that Barry Kane was not a crime at all. We also see their hearing through these scenes. For example, Barry hears the sound of the car saying, "Is this a car coming?" Uncle Philip says, "2 cars think." Uncle Philip was right. We will see 2 cars in the next scene. Priscilla Lane did a great job in her job. He was not a big star. But I thought his performance was very good. Another bright event in Uncle Philip's house is a scene where he asks Priscilla Lane (Patricia Martin): "Are you afraid, Pat? Is it making you so cruel?" I thought Otto Krueger played the cable perfectly. Hitchcock wanted Harry Carey to be a villain. But he refused. Harry Carey is famous for his role as president of Mr. Smith in Washington. I want to talk more about this movie. But I think my post is too long. <br /> <br /> Each Hitchcock movie is special in its own way. I'm sure Hitchcock fans like this movie. I appreciate 10 out of 10.
