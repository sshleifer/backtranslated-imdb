OKAY. That's how you can do it! We have a perfect vampire movie here. Gothic, beautiful. With all the ingredients. Realistic vampire. Great story. Please note - I'm in Transylvania and I assure you that this movie respects the vampire lore! This is exactly the same as what I heard in my childhood. For the Transylvanians it is ... plausible. You must see it if you are interested in real vampires, as they were depicted in medieval chronicles and not how they were made in recent Hollywood films (as far as I think Hollywood's problem is to mix vampires with the Incub - which Vampires are never beautiful or attractive, they can only inspire horror and repression. The incubation called my nightclub in my country is one beautiful demon that kills its victims, loving them. recommend it to every gothic person! Look at the sequel, they are all 4 good! Leave a dawn! Something similar is to Nosferatu in Venice with Klaus Kinsk.
