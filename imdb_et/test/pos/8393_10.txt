It's about as good as the gone wind was. I love this movie I could watch it over and over. Scarlett always gets what he wants no matter what cost.She is trying really hard to forget about Rhett but he just can't do it. She loves her so much. This is the story of true true love. It started with the wind and went to the movie. The only real way to finish this movie against true love. Was it finally Scarlett and Rhett at the end. the way he finished with his girls. What else could you ask. There is no better end to this great love story than that. What else to say about this great movie.
