Until the final credit was granted, it became apparent that this film was made in 1989, because all the elements of its production were made to look back in the 1960s - exemplary, characteristic, set and props were first aesthetic. /> <br /> The film opens for moments before the A-bomb has fallen in Hiroshima and how this tragic incident affects one family: a young woman, Yasuko, who lives with her aunt and uncle. Even in black and white and using special effects that are quite primitive to modern standards, but emotional and effective, the immediate consequences of the bomb are quite terrible. Family members become recognizable with each other, others resemble zombies as they travel on the streets and in shock. <br /> <br /> The title refers to precipitation that fell rapidly after a bomb that was mixed with radioactive ash and that is being caught by Yasuko. Rumors of the Yasuko Hiroshima bombing affect his marriage prospects, and later it is known that black rain really causes illnesses. The film not only affects the physical effects of the bomb on the Japanese, but also the forced social and psychological damage. <br /> <br /> I found the film's compassionate and exciting journey into a unique culture. Although the film is mainly about one family's feeling, the delicate political message of the film is important today, and apparently, wars have terrible consequences at all times and should not be concluded unless absolutely necessary. It has been said that history repeats itself and that the leaders of the current "Coalition of Preparedness" have not learned anything. Although atomic warfare has not recovered since 1945, there are other deadly consequences. This movie is compelling.
