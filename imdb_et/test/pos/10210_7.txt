As he escaped from the bank's heir, the vocal Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott) helps Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger), the chief engineer of the Western Union, looking at the wild west and being an accident with the horse. In 1861, Vance restores to Western Union with a team that installs Omaha poles and cable to Salt Lake City. Vance and Harvard's Richard Blake engineer (Robert Young) flirted with Edward's sister Sue Creighton (Virginia Gilmore) and chose Vance. But his past haunts him when Jack Slade (Barton MacLane) steals the flesh of the Western Union hidden from the Indians. <br /> <br /> Western Union is a good but predictable west, led by Fritz Lang. The story shows the difficulties of brave and idealistic men who are responsible for installing the telegraph in the West, before the early and Indians. An entertaining story is acting, drama, romance and a funny situation, but with the exception of Jack Slade's identity, the story isn't surprised. Randolph Scott has another great performance. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Os Conquistadores" ("The Conquerors")
