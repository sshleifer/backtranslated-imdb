If you're a "child of the eighties" like me, you'll probably remember it in 1981. I remember this movie over and over again when I was in high school, and I only recently found this very old copy because Disney stopped producing the film several years ago. Needless to say, this is a real fun movie to watch. Five college teams decode clues in Los Angeles at a dinner party, trying to reach the finish line first. Watch the coming of Paul Reubens. From cheesy music to discotheque twins of fats, this is the 1980's fun movie you love.
