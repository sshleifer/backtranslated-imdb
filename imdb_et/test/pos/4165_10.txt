I'll do it briefly. It was a pleasure to watch. It may or may not have been more effective if the characters were similar to their real life counterparts, but aside from this little observation, I found that fantasy animals are the most enjoyable. The visuals were the most stunning, except for the second-level CG scenes that could have been omitted. I don't like computer-generated animation, it strikes a biological goal like this. Look at it, you appreciate it too!
