I felt that the film was ahead of time. One potential girl was such a strong, career-oriented woman. He knew what he wanted and was diplomatic but confident with supremacy. Mother's role played very well (you just loved her hate). His need to control his son's life was neurotically evil. If you have ever been in a relationship where you have been a judge and found a lack (and everyone involved knew it), it may be too close to home. This film has been around for years and I remember that this plot and dialogue would work in the 50s or 60s. Because of the dynamics of mother and sons, it's hard to look, but I'd like to see it again. I hope to find it in one of the old movie channels, but there is no luck so far. Attempts to buy it were also meaningless (I don't think it's on tape or DVD).
