Chen Kaige lost the pace. I envy Europeans and Americans who are able to watch a film without dialogue, because it hurts to do: slow, unnaturally hard and redundant. But the western peoples suffer from the poor quality of the subtitle translation, which is capable of losing all the nuances and double meanings that make the film's careful examination so much fun.
