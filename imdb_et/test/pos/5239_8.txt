I really liked this movie.it features John Wayne in his first starring performance.even then you can say Wayne is a real presence, although he is not really a mature icon he is known to Stagecoach, 9 years later 1939 It's about settlers all over the country that head to the new west to colonize. Wayne's character Breck Coleman joins, but for his own personal reasons, most of the main actors were and they had never made a movie before, making the film even more amazing. they managed to create incredible, distinctive characters, and here is a rather strange mix. Cimarron comes out a year later and had a very similar story, although I didn't like as much as this movie For me, the Big Trail is a strong 8/10.
