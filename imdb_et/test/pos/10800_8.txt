Not a bad movie, but it could have been done without a 10 year old boy's full foreskin in one of the opening scenes. This film has a great dialogue; which is definitely common among foreign films. The foreign players still know how to act against American actors who let CGI, stunts and special effects do everything for them. This movie is just good old fashion art. Gerarde DePardieux always did a good job. Costumes and landscapes are accurate with time. My only complaint is that they should have named English words in French instead of using subtitles; it may just be because I hate reading subtitles.
