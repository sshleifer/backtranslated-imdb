"The Gig" is a tight, funny and terrible little movie about a group of friends who have gathered regularly to play Dixieland for fun. The group expects unexpectedly paid work in a musician's letter; "concert". <br /> <br /> In New York, they drive a two-week concert in a summer resort, minus one member worshiping for cancer. At the last moment they hire a professional. Things remain sticky, as the oversized Frankie Vall type tries to come back to the resort and try to use the band as their band. With two weeks of concert playing, they took out the bread from someone who needed food for their family. While Pop, Rock, Rap, Country and Western and R&B stars make money from albums. Jazz musicians must travel abroad to live. Almost no one gets rich. Your dreams also live for the necessary income. <br /> <br /> I believe almost everyone who can play a musical instrument with some skill dreams of playing a one-time payment for a language, Woody Allen and Kevin Bacon are two popular examples of this amateur-professional crossover. I especially recommend this movie to anyone who has played music professionally. My mother, who was a musician, loved it.
