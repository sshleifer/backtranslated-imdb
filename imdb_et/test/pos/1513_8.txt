"Un Gatto nel Cervello" / "Cat in the brain" is one of the never-before-ever movie films. There are a lot of blood and brains, including the chainsaw meat industry, bloody cracks and numerous losses. parody "Fulci", but gore and violence are its main element. Some Gore FXs were taken from their own Fulci films "Quando Alice Ruppe lo Specchio" and "I Fantasmi di Sodoma" (both 1988), plus gore FX taken by Fulci's "Snake House" or "Bloody Psycho" by Leandro Lucchetti, Andrea Bianchi "Massacre", Mario Bianch's "Non Avere Paura Della Zia Marta" by Giovanni Simonelli "Non Si Sevizia i Bambini" and "Luna di Sangue" or "Fuga dalla Morte" by Enzo Milion (all 1989). The scene where Brett Halsey wins the woman's face for cellulose comes from "Quando Alice Ruppe lo Specchio", the film Fulci was for Italian television in 1988. The cut of the female body from the beginning has been taken from the same film as the head of the microwave and the man who can drive over and over again . Highly recommended, especially if you like extreme cinema!
