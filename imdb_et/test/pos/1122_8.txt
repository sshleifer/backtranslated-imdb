This is a great effort for B-Movie Martial Arts actor. Ian Jacklin, a former North American cruise ship Kickboxing champion, is leading and performs well in scenes. Muscle Matthias Hues gets the chance to add his "Martial Arts" movie to a bad person more than everyone else and if you are a fan of The Teutonic Titan, rent this movie now! <br /> <br /> Renee Griffin is also a remarkable romantic interest in this film. He starts attitudes, but soon gets warmed up by the hero and in a very stylish way "with two backs of the beast". <br /> <br /> Fighting scenes are good in American tradition (NO Hong Kong acrobatics here!) with the realism that Benny "The Jet" Urquidez is playing as John Larson (Jacklin) coach. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie seems to have more genres than most of its genres, so get more of the story.
