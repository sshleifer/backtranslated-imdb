my girlfriend, when we go to the Leicester Square after a movie in Cold London, saying that if they don't speak English and they didn't show the stadium, you might have thought it was the slums of the South American city or some other slum all over the world, not Queens NYC -s. <br /> <br /> Ramin Bahrani is now my official hero, because he seems to have dedicated his work to showing the American face, not the American face. <br /> <br /> Ramin Bahran's films are like Ladri di biciclette or Germania anno zero or Roma citta aperta. Chop shop has become a reality movie, is more realistic than documentary, in fact I think Ramin Bahran's movies are more realistic than documentaries. It's a great movie, but don't wait for a car to kick back or shoot. This film talks about the tragic life of the wealthiest, richer country in the world.
