"Tesis", "Open Your Eyes", and "Others" were evidence of Amenabar's talents and skills as a filmmaker, but (in my humble opinion) there were also flawed films that tried to speed up the audience. twist too much, favoring cheap excitement, turning and turning depth and resonance. Everyone is happy that Amenabar chose the theme of his new film, which doesn't surprise me by focusing on the characters and the emotional ties that bind them. The result is a small miracle of the film that is beautifully written, photographed, scanned, behaved and directed. Everybody who participates in this film offers excellent sound from the cameras, behind and behind the cameras, wonderful light (Bardem shines, but Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo, Clara Segura and Lola Due√±as give the film great authenticity) Aguirresarobe fine lenses. <br /> <br /> The film deals with many important issues and emotions effectively, it focuses on the equal power of the heart and mind, and gives you a final blow that will stay with you long after the roll of credit. This is a wonderfully executed movie that not only marks the landmark of Spanish cinema, but will definitely be a pleasant surprise when it opens up abroad (Sony Classics has made a record $ 6 million to distribute it) Don't be surprised to be able to get to the Oscar race ... No Amenabar stopped ... <br /> <br /> Buen trabajo, Alejandro!
