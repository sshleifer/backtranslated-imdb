Of all the actors in today's movie, my choice would be Kristin Scott Thomas at my choice if I had to choose one on the desert island. <br /> <br /> I could just sit down on the chair for a few hours. So I find it difficult to objectively objectively object to my film. <br /> <br /> But I enjoyed this movie and its story in itself more than what many people show on average. people who commented on this site before. <br /> <br /> Harrison Ford, however, is not one of the participants most enjoyable. But he's a handful of those who have reached 7 to 8, so who am I to argue about? <br /> <br /> Ford is often in style, and sometimes it seems to be a serious need for antacid and caffeine - and "Random Hearts" are in this group. <br /> <br /> His obsession with loss testing, both by his and his spouses, is understandable given his invitation as a detective, but not to the level shown here. Although not far away, it went beyond the "annoying" category. <br /> <br /> But most of the scenes after her and Thomas's involvement were interesting and well played. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been 9 *, but I would reduce this pair of levels based on Ford's overall performance and second, as it contained a little more remote sub-area elements than it seemed necessary.
