"Family Guy" is probably the most ballsy sitcom. It is worshiping everything he thinks of TV shows up to family drama. Best of all, it's one of the few modern TV shows that is actually funny. Lois, the mother, who is more or less the head of the family, though Peter sees herself as such. Chris, a fat teenage boy with just as little brain as a dad. Meg, the family's black sheep, who's joking. Stewie, a child with plans to kill her mother and take over the world. The family dog ​​Brian, who is often the voice of reason, but is often spoiled. <br /> <br /> Family Guy uses a lot of tactics from the audience to laugh. The most remarkable thing is that we are just talking about what has just been said. They are effective due to impeccable timing and their playing. "Family Guy" also uses spoofs for humor, mostly 80's TV shows. What really shows is that one does not have to be familiar with what it is. I'm sure it would help, but the material is funny. But the show doesn't stop there. Not only does it speak almost everything, but it hides your spoofs! The exhibition is full of color humor. The only reason people don't go to the show is probably because it makes every race, gender, and other community equal. There is nothing sacred here and no one and nothing is immune to "Family Guy" satirical jams. . But the Family Guy contains some great songs. All well written and executed, and of course, they are fun (perhaps the most famous, "Freakin 'FCC" is so memorable and hysterical, because it hits the rating committee where it is hurt). <br /> <br /> Voice characteristics are right for the money. Seth McFarlane is enormously talented. He gives Peter, Brian (which is his own natural voice) and Stewie's voices. Votes are not only consistent and creative, but can change the will of their pitch, so they seem to be spoken by three different participants. Alex Borstein brings Nissan to the Lois that is perfect for character. Seth Green is recognizable as Chris (if I hadn't looked at IMDb, I never knew it was him). Lacey Chabert started with Meg's character and when she was good, Mila Kunis raised her character with her sharp voice. Kunis gives Meg a new, sharper edge that he didn't have with Chabert. <br /> <br /> The "Family" has been compared to "Simpsons" and is perfectly understandable (not only because they are produced by FOX). Both are blue collar life satires and "Simpsons" are good, "Family Guy" contains a sharper edge. The exhibition is absolutely fearless. There is no real holy cow. The exhibition strikes a disadvantage (physical and mental), nationalities, TV shows and films, celebrities, politicians, religion (especially Catholicism), drug use and addiction, any sexual humor (including S&M), and some that are simply not described. Not all "Family Guy" throws the audience, but as a whole, this exhibition is consistently amusing and often fun. <br /> <br /> If there are any errors with "Family Guy", then jokes sometimes work too long. Especially with "awkward moments", the sequences are stretched so long that not only does it become funny, but it becomes so irritating (and long) that a fast back and forth button is needed. They can be effective for about 10 to 15 seconds, but sometimes it takes more than two minutes. It can be argued that the exhibition writes its rules around the plot and often does so (for example, Brian often acts as a person, but he acts like a dog when the story requires it). But this is not a problem because the play is still working. <br /> <br /> Some people have argued that the show is no longer funny. Although I agree that it is not as sharp as before, I think FOX is not guilty of McFarlane and his team. The exhibition started with FOX, but after some dark ratings and voter turnout, it was canceled. However, the sale of the DVD was big enough to get adult swimming to get it. The show was a success and FOX bought it again. But since the show is so big, FOX is afraid to let writers test and try new things. Although it is still funny, humor is not so fresh and sharp. <br /> <br /> Be sure to check this example. It's awesome.
