If you have been looking for a movie that has a nympho controlled by an extremely religious southern man, check out Paramount Vantage's latest release, Black Snake Moan. Not exactly what I've just described? Well, you get the best and get into your local theater and you can still see it like Samuel L. Jackson's character Lazarus would say. As long as you are open and do not take everything seriously, there is no reason why you would leave the theater to see it. <br /> <br /> The third director, Craig Brewer's offer, is deep in the south, where the movie is all tagged, all hotter. Although we have introduced Godfearing bluesman, Lazarus, as previously said, what Jackson played, and almost always half naked Rae; Role taken by Christina Ricci. In the film, this unlikely pair of crosses is long enough for their characters to learn from each other. Both lessons will finally give us a message to the audience, whatever it is, we are all human. No one is perfect and if everyone understood it, we would be much better. The question of whether it is understandable or accepted by anyone who sees the film is another story. One thing that's not for discussion is how big Jackson and Ricci are. You think it's a woman with sexual craze, overuse would be given, but not, not here. Ricci breaks through and shows real talent with raw performance that also doubles its best. Then we have Jackson who completely disappears and for the first time in a long time forgets us who he is. Unfortunately, the third star of the movie, Justin Timberlake, is not so great about playing Rae's military friends. At first he is unlucky because he seems to be trying too hard. Later, he goes to some place, still far from the level he reached from the 'Alpha Dog' in January. <br /> <br /> Another thing Black Snake Moan has is a great soundtrack. Including Black Keys stories, John Doe, scores made by Scott Bomar & of course four, count, four tracks from Jackson. In fact, this is one of his songs, the main result of the film, "Stackolee", which is the fuel of the fire of this great collection. This alone is worth the ticket price. Other remarkable musical pleasures of the song are Bomar's "Chain", "When the lights go out" of Black Keys, and the title track, which is also one of the most memorable scenes in the film where Lazarus sings Rae's storm at night <br /> <br /> However, Craig Brewer's efforts cannot be mentioned. His latest film "Hustle & Flow", which ended with low expectations and received critical recognition, put it on the map. What she has done with "Black Snake Moan" is what distinguishes her from other beginners in the industry. Not only did he manage the "Moani", but also wrote his own script. The end result is a surprising and smart story. When you look, you feel you know exactly where he is, despite his courage. Just as you think you have predicted the next move, Brewer changes gear and takes a completely different path. However, there are some pictures in the scenario. The background marks are drab and flat, while the end is somewhat disappointing. It left me craving for something exciting. After so many tops I think the last scenes were weak compared to the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I imagine that most people who see the black snake Moan don't enjoy it because they can't stop thinking about how unlikely the situation is. This is a frustrating part of the fact that there are many other films with the same unlikely, even more, shameful scenarios. It is a racial, religious, and sexual theme that the film shows that has more impact on opinion than anything. The idea that a black man links a white woman in his house is enough that most people don't even see it. Simply put, it is not for everyone. As I said, you have to go open for full enjoyment or otherwise waste your money. For those who can do it, I highly recommend it.
