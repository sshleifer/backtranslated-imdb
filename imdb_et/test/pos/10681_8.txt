The journey towards the sun is about discovering the planet on the other side of the sun, which shares the same orbit as the earth and is thus undiscovered until the solar panel has a space meter. Of course, two astronauts (Roy Thinnes & Ian Hendry) will be sent for investigation, but they will attack and find themselves on earth for only 3 weeks on their six-week trip. Of course they got caught (at least Thinnes, Hendry is seriously injured) and grilled and asked why they returned to their mission, but claimed they didn't. Until Thinnes, a couple of very strange things seem to be returning home. It's great when sometimes somewhat talkative, and the kits and the feel are not far from the Thunderbirds territory, but live actors once. This is not a big Star Wars-type production, but a quiet scientific literature that needs to be thought a bit. It is worth noting and it is criminal that the DVD is printed. 8 out of 10.
