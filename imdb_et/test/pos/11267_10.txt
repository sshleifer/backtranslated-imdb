I was happy to see Saltimbanco live before I see the video version of the show. Although nothing can be compared to being really, the people behind the video did amazing work with taste, feeling, feeling and much more. The stunning performances of Saltimbanco's amazing amazingly amazing troupe remain beautiful. The video flows so smoothly and intelligently as the production itself. Great experience.
