first real movie this year. amazing long shots, sometimes with a fixed camera, so specific for Nordic cinema (leave aside Dogma). A true author's film I find. Athmospherique :-) It just rejoiced at all my senses and remember how the picture goes violently and painfully during the scenes when he tries to kill himself. This is the point I don't think it will last on the entire plot. Why, if it were an ideal world, could you not die, but did you still keep your conscience? Was there a real world with "custom" rules, or was a "fantastic" world, but in this case, there can be no accidents like people who remember how it had been before. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of Kafka and maybe more, Huxley Brave New World, especially where sex was actually available to everyone because it was seen as a right to entertainment. It did not have a plot, but I think it was better because you understood and knew the strange, strange behavior, absurdity and lack of real feelings in this "happy" world. <br /> <br /> I also think the end was great. The real world is really gay homini lupus, you eat if you are not strong enough.
