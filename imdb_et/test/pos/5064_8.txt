Is torture ever right? No. The answer is simple and absolute, without qualification. The reason for this film is the impact of torture on society. The values ​​that have been hard to win in Western society because of the centuries-old revolution and struggle are that all men and women can live in a free and open society. One where individuals are treated equally and their fundamental rights as people. Institutions that are wrong, fair and honest have been developed to protect this society. These institutions have been adapted and made by the hard work of the generations. It can be argued that these are the real foundations of democracy, if they belong to all of us, we all promise to hear. If we allow undemocratic, inhuman acts to take place on our behalf if we share our society with those who have rights, and those who do not, then we will take back the work of our ancestors. In addition, we are all complicit and all guilty and corrupted. Whether the defendants are guilty or not is irrelevant. We are defined by our attitudes and responses.
