It's outdated really well - still exciting and relaxed. Definitely one of Hitch's best movies. Beautifully shot with great assumption intercourse, a sex appeal by the beautiful Ruth Roman. Because of the great assumption you have the feeling that you have to look at it to the end. If you find yourself losing faith in Hitch and doubting his title as a champion, I recommend this nice little movie as an antidote. 5 out of 5.
