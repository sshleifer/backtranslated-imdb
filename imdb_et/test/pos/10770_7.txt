Mas Oyama was the most successful karate captain of the late 20th century. He rejected "training" for karate clubs from a time that focused on intensive training. Finally, he built his system as a big business city with hundreds of schools all over the world without compromising his teachings. Kyokushin School Testing is still one of the most physically challenging tests each martial arts school needs. One of the non-physical hardships was Oyama, who was facing his foreword, and he spent time proving that loyalty was to Japan and Japanese carat. This series of films was part of this effort, although anyone who had the opportunity to meet with Oyama (I did) does not question my fidelity to Japan. In this series, Oyama's most famous students, Sonny Chiba, are invited to present their master. <br /> <br /> Oyama arrives from the countryside where she has studied alone. He challenges and briefly does what he meets. Karate is frightening, Oyama returns to her only training. Finally, he accepts a student, falls in love and goes to the gangsters who have joined the established karate schools. In the middle of it is the legendary bull fighting with a mad bull. How much movie is true is questionable. <br /> <br /> The fact that Oyama can kill his bare hands is true. He was invited to repeat this procedure repeatedly. There have been filmed cases where Oyama actually does this, although sometimes the bulls seemed to be tethered because Oyama started moving for years. Sonny Chiba represents his master of belief and karate is quite good. Chiba may not be the best karate practitioner, but at the moment he was definitely above average. <br /> <br /> The movie as a whole is good, much better than most martial arts movies in the drama department. I've always wondered why it's no longer known. It may be a very realistic imagination of martial arts. People are tired and hurt, unlike 99% of the action film, where the hero is an unlimited source of energy, and every shot immediately sends an opponent to death. Chiba seems so exhausted that it is painful. Perhaps viewers do not have such a close connection with their entertainment. <br /> <br /> Recommended especially for martial arts.
