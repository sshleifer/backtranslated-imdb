This movie was certainly not very complicated. No, humor was actually pretty stupid because I mean. But even when I mean, I smiled - proving that a decent comedy doesn't have to be very deep. <br /> <br /> Fatty Arbuckle is the star of this short star, despite the fact that Buster Keaton appears in the film. He is a butcher of older foods. There were a lot of stupid things in the store and I think I laughed the most in the grinder - you have to see it yourself. <br /> <br /> Anyway, afterwards, a greasy girlfriend is forced to go to a girls' school and because she can't attend, she dresses up in school and penetrates school. Arbuckle is one ugly woman! So, for the foolish and complex amusements, look at this movie. It does not change your life and is a very light picture, but it is also fun.
