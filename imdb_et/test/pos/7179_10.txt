Another movie about the Gaulois pair of Asterix & Obelix adventures is 10 times better than the first. Humor is great (and irreversible) and the script has been well executed since the original cartoon of Goscinny & Uderzo in 1965. I fell asleep with the first film (although I'm a big fan of Asterix) and he didn't want to see this sequel, but I'm glad this film proved to me wrong. Great comedy for everyone. Highly recommended!
