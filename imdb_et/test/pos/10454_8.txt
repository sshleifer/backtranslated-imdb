When I was in the tenth grade and my friend was late in my house and were around the cable and started watching this movie. We looked at it because it seemed funny and because she had chest. But then the end came and we just sat down completely without words. I think after a few minutes looking at the credits that he just rebelled "Oh dude .....". It goes from foolish 80's teen comedy to nihilistic realism so quickly that it catches you from the guard. I've been trying to rent this movie for years and haven't been able to find it - and no one has ever seen it except me and my friend - it seems. But now it's available! I recommend renting it and raising yourself.
