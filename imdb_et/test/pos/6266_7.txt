Gentle and brilliant film seems to have been neglected due to triviality ... and the narrative is fairly weak and light as drama. The art of a new and alien and skeptical society has a shine and naturalness that grabs the century-long romance between cinema and audience better than every year's film. Jared Harriss's enormous sympathetic performance (who seems to have inherited all his father's charisma ... hopefully against the poorer Richards' hellrises and temptations) .... and the charming successful clich√© of costar Yu Xia makes it truly warmer from the heart. Fast location photography (including amazingly beautiful scenes on the big wall) and a sensitive direction for Ann Hu will add to the film's impact. In a nutshell, we are going to have anyone who has ever lived in the shadow that flashes in life ... and doing magic in the dark.
