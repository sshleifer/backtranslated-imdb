This is one of the very few movies that has a terrible way of doing things, a wonderful story and what's worth seeing. This is about changes in life. The question is how happiness can be found when one is real to himself. It concerns yourself and others. It concerns life problems. It is an adaptation to reality. It is courage. It's about love. Both actors are very real about their role. The actor had a very good chemistry in the film. This is the key to making a movie. It is rare to see such an independent film. It can be said that the hard work the film crew had to keep producing this movie. I want to see more of this producer / writer movie. Watch the movie, you love it.
