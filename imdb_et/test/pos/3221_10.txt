I didn't get Gilmore Girls when he first came out so I could catch up with the first season. I read through most of the users' comments and for the negatives I have to ask what are you looking at? <br /> <br /> This show is a classic, great line, characters and good actor. And best of all, don't always show your standard formula from time to time. There are probably more women who see themselves in Lorelai / Emily's relationship with Lorelai / Rory. People and storylines are not PCs, but they are real! <br /> <br /> If you find the dialog annoying, I suggest you record the show so that you can understand the parts again.
