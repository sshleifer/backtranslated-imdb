I love this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is the main character, but that's why it's called the "big liar". Although this child runs to Hollywood, it does not give the children an idea of ​​what they are getting. Besides, he does not just do it for fun or go away, he does it to restore confidence. <br /> <br /> I don't think this was just one big ad for Universal Studios, because I liked how it gave an inner insight into what it's like for kids who don't know how to make a cool movie is. <br /> <br /> It has good music and fun characters. This family / comedy is completely fun for kids and parents. It has humor, excitement and real difficulties like lying. Finally, "Big Fat Liar" sends a moral: don't wait to lie down.
