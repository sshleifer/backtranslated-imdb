A warm-hearted flik depicting an angel Michael as a beating, obesity, cigarette smoking who loves dancing and dragging with the opposite sex. However, he has a good side as he tries to put things in the life of a couple of burnt losers before calling them back to heaven. A funny, well-played movie; very enjoyable, though somewhat redundant.
