In 1974, teenager Martha Moxley (Maggie Grace) moves to Belle Haven, Greenwich, Connecticut High School. On the eve of Halloween, his evil night was killed in his backyard and his murder remained unresolved. Twenty-two years later, writer Mark Fuhrman (Christopher Melon), a former LA detective who is O.J. Simpson's trial and moved to Idaho, decides to investigate the case with his partner Stephen Weeks (Andrew Mitchell) for writing a book. The locals worship and do not welcome them, but with the support of retired detective Steve Carroll (Robert Forster), responsible for research in the 1970s, they discover criminal and power and money to cover the murder. <br /> <br /> "Greenwich Murder" is a good TV movie whose true story is the murder of a fifteen-year-old girl committed by a wealthy teenager, whose mother was Kennedy. A powerful and rich family used more than twenty years to cover the murder. The Snoopy Detective and the convicted convicted person were able to disclose how the stupid crime was committed. The scenario shows a parallel study of Mark and Marta in recent days, but drama has a lack of emotion. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not Available
