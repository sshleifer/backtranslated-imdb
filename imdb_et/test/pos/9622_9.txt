Although it is usually one of the first martial arts films to play here in the West, it has a real impact retroactively. Lo Lieh is a very low key and many fighting scenes, though often they are innovative (which they were at the time of the first release of the movie), then what is after what came after (especially after Bruce Lee, who got the standard on which all others are predicted earlier). This does not mean that OPTIONAL MESSAGES / KING BOXER is nothing less than a classic in itself because it is. Like many of the leading characters in many martial arts films, Lieh plays a game that is low on a large part of the film, but when he cuts it, he effectively cleans the house. You can't ask for more.
