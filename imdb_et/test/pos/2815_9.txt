I have no cable vision and I no longer have "DirecTV". I was a rural resident to have to wait for DVD publications. Being a blonde lover, but not a blond, of course I'm not just "Barb Wire", but I have a "Stripper: The Complete First Season". I have not yet found "VIP" or another season for Stripperella. I have a "Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding" DVD. I have the Playboy questions that Pamela Denise Anderson made. I can go on. I love Pamel! There is no one or anything that could feel me guilty of enjoying the Stripper. But there are certain elements that I do not like but live with other series, sometimes also showing smoking and alcohol consumption. But these are my personal peels and I'm not trying to let them ruin the fun of such a series. I also liked the change in animation style, but I adapted it. However, the number of female nudity has declined and it is a great disappointment, as much is expected in a series of such assumptions. But then I adjusted. One of my favorite "Mork & Mindy" episodes was when they met Robin Williams! So of course, one of my "Striperella" favorites is when visiting Pamela & Tommy clubs and comparisons begin! If there really is a "2nd season" then I hope to find it because I need to collect it to complete it. I recommend it to other female form lovers and blonde lovers. (Hello! Psst! "Blonde" and "Blonde" is a feminine form of "Blonde"! Your software should already know it!)
