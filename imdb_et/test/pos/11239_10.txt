I think this is a great example of cool talking heads and very cool action. Two men who pretend to be women 's seduction masters show their skills in different nightclubs and 4 experts (pickup artists themselves) who choose the winner. Their jokes are fun and some participants have great fun to watch. What's more, this exhibition really teaches men how to connect with women, many expert opinions are useful when you see how it works in the field. In fact, I think it's one of the best TV shows and I recommend it to all men who love women. <br /> <br /> ps / grace for my broken engrish.
