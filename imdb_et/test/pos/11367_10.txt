It was so long ago (1960), but I've never forgotten this series and often wanted it to appear again. So I accepted Mr Rathbun, then the President of Standard Oil, who sponsored the PBS presentation. He sent me a picture of the tapestry used for the credit (actually the charcoal rendering). <br /> <br /> Bayco's "Elizabethan Masque" themed music was gathered around my family and my black and white TV. Drink in Shakespeare's words as great but relatively unknown players (at least for American audiences). <br /> <br /> We were introduced to actors such as Sean Connery, Dame Judi Dench, Tom Fleming, Patrick Garland, Julian Glover and Robert Hardy. I have continued to achieve my achievements. One of the most interesting things was how the actors still grew up at their age when Shakespeare's "King" games were played, perhaps for the first time, in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I would like to tell those parties how much this series is for me. <br /> <br /> If "Age of Kings" can be revived on VHS and / or DVD, please be one of those who would see it for a long time. and those who passed this first time. <br /> <br /> GOOD NEWS! PBS IS EXCLUDED DVD "COMPETITION"! SEE YOUR JULY 2009 CATALOG, PAGE 19 OR ASK FOR FREE. I ordered mine!
