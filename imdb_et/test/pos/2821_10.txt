I shot this movie. I'm very proud of the movie. It was a great experience to appear on the screen. Halfdan Hussey is a great collaborator who had a vision and been able to shoot as we saw in the film. Sets are amazing and well-designed for each design. John York and his team built kits that not only match the characters, but also did a good job of shooting the film, allowing us to move smoothly across the walls and from one device to another. Every character has an amazing arc that makes a great story. I feel that all the actors gave great performances. I do not agree with any other comment that says it was not good. See it and decide for yourself.
