Intelligently written, well-functioning, intense and intense. This exhibition lives in the real world, not as fantastic as "24" (and I'm a big 24-year-old fan of the way). It is a plausible character and in many ways it is much more wise in this genre. He is trying to present both sides of Islam. So far I have been watching the first 4 episodes and found that the story is more evenly balanced. Terrorists are more complex and not one-dimensional. And as a result of this balance, terrorists become more frightening when typical crooks are depicted in film and television. Last but not least, the hero is truly heroic without being a comic. I recommend this example to anyone who is a 24 year old fan.
