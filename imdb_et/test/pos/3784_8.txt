Charles Chaplin's 1918 "Bracelet" was his longest film to date, although a little over 45 minutes in length was not a feature film. The First World War, which drew you close, made many of the time's popular entertainers to inspire their local troops, and Chaplin was no exception. And so pleasant tram went to war! The film starts with Tramp training and the character is fun even for the most basic military exercises, including marching and rolling weapons, much more than his drill sergeant. The tramp then finds itself in the ditches facing a terrible enemy, even though the Germans will eventually become more incompetent than even her. The terrifying moment when the tram announced that it unilaterally hit 13 German soldiers "surrounded them" I had stitches. <br /> <br /> There are many other great moments in this movie. Chaplin wakes up to find his sleeping pads underwater and cannot literally find his feet, as does his brilliant tube from the player to sleep under the surface. <br /> <br /> But the most memorable scenes in the movie are undoubtedly linked to the enemy hidden behind Chaplin's hostility. The reactions of worshiping German soldiers, unknowingly just a meter away from sworn enemies, because they are one by one with disabilities, are very amusing, especially when one soldier grabs the ax with the intention of cutting wood. <br /> <br /> This is a very enjoyable movie and one of Chaplin's best pre-1920 efforts. Highly recommended.
