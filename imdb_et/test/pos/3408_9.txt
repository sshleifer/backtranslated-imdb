I am a history teacher and generally I was happy with the film. My teens enjoyed it during the holidays. Is it 100% accurate and is it sometimes small? Yeah, but my kids go out of the computer and playground to spend four nights watching all this. Lloyd Bridges like Jefferson Davis and Hal Holbrook as Abraham Lincoln. We all thought that Phillip Casnoff was Bent bad and charming. We all thought Charles stole Orry and George's show. <br /> <br /> We're enjoying the movie again!
