Maybe More is mostly remembered for the excellent soundtrack made by Pink Floyd-1969, which they had not yet. In fact, they made an album with movie music, no fan can leave it! <br /> <br /> But this is also the first film by the German-French director Barbet Schroeder: it is a cult film. When it was released, censorship reduced sex and drugs everywhere. It is also one of the first films that clearly treat drug slavery. <br /> <br /> A German boy travels to Paris and meets an American girl: they fall in love. Together they look for the sun and exotics. But this is too high a price love: it initiates it into drugs. <br /> <br /> The sixties anti-drug campaigns were not like today, there wasn't much information. On the contrary, in many drugs, taking drugs was a kind of spiritual experience ... So it is quite surprising to see a film of the period that describes the horrific heroin experience. <br /> <br /> The film is simple, not vulgar at all, and captured in "cinema-verité" style. Actors Mimsy Farmer and Klaus Grünberg are very convincing. "More" is the document of the late sixties - and also the document of the end of the illusions of hippies.
