The BBC and HBO joined Dirty War, a 90-minute TV movie about the terrorist's "dirty bomb" attack in London. The film is about to go into business quickly as it wraps the terrorist efforts of both terrorists and government into the film, leaving little room for human interest. On the side of terrorists, we follow a bomb resulting from the accumulation of radioactive materials from accumulation to detonation. On the government side, we see PR and training, gathering and analyzing intelligence, banning, post-detonation and follow-up. There is also a sense of how Al-Qaida-type terrorist cells, radical Islamic terrorist mentions and terrorist strategies are organized. The sort of anatomy of the "Dirty War" incident of the "Dirty Bomb" responds to many of the issues that lie in the eyes of the public who are increasingly aware of this mysterious threat. (B)
