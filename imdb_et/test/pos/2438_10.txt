Well, I don't know anything, but I liked this movie. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple and warm-hearted. In other words, it was everything he anticipated. <br /> <br /> The story is placed around the girl's first love (as the title suggests) and I should definitely warn you: wait for something challenging or provocative. I mean, it's a children's comic. It's really just a simple story, but it's well-said, and it keeps your attention well. <br /> <br /> Finally: it's short, it's funny, it's cute, it's easy, it's good.
