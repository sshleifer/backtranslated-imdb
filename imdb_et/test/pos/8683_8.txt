All I can say is that I was waiting for a wick movie and "Blurred" surprised me positively. Very nice teen movie. All such situations are normal in school life, so I can all say that it all reminded me of my school time and sometimes it's good to watch such movies because entertainment and us return to those golden years when we were young. Also, make us think better as we have to understand our children, because in the past we were just as they want to be at the present time. Try this movie and you are very pleased. At the same time ensure that your time is not wasted.
