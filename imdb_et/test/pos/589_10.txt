I've seen the beginning of the muppet movie, but just half. Because I watched it only in Mrs Kelly's friend's house. The songs were the best and the Muppets were so fun. They learn that if they believe at the end of the rainbow, everyone can do it, no matter how small, nothing but green (which was included in the trailer). <br /> <br /> What this means describes the main character) and so are the other mups. Mel Brooks was amazing when he played Professor Max Krassman. A scene where Miss Piggy saves Kermit by making them young Kung Fu. It was so cool. <br /> <br /> Muppet Movie is the best Jim Henson movie with the most fun characters and people are fond of their successful film.
