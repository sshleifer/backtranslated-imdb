Like a movie buffer, I had obviously read all the terrible comments and funny, sarcastic comments on this film (my favorite is the Woody Allen career. If I had a life to live again, I wouldn't change anything except the musical remake of the lost horizon). I've ever been able to watch it on choreography / set / songs, etc. Recently, I met on a widescreen DVD and watched it for the first time in a year with a friend who had never heard of the film's reputation. He really enjoyed it and - after he tried block all negative prejudices that were obviously related to the film - so too I. There is nothing bad about the lost horizon and it is much more enjoyable and traceable than many other films from the early 1970s, not even in the camp. repetitive and simple, but it is not really obvious when they are first heard or if the shortcomings are in advance and brought, so you are ready for them. For all reviewers who claimed that cast cannot sing, this criticism has broken down from the duplication of Liv Ullmann, Olivia Hussey, and Peter Finch (well, because the vocals fit perfectly with their voice) and Sally Kellerman has a truly cute and completely unique singing style. Alas, Kerman's duet Olivia Hussey's "Things I Don't Miss" is great. Particular mention should be made of the legendary Hollywood star Charles Boyer as High Lama - and his comments on the destruction of mankind are cool to the world today. I do not require another that the lost horizon is a masterpiece (things I would not miss, uninspired choreography and Bobby Van's "Question to me answer" number that would be easy to cut), but if you haven't even seen the lost horizon or have not seen it for a while, try without looking at it "Oh boy, let's laugh at this spam and you will be surprised how enjoyable it really is.
