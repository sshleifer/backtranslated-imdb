This all-but-ignored masterpiece is that the monkeys become aware that they are fictional characters in the movie, and that everything they do or say is already written with a (invisible) script that seems to be the following. During the three-day LSD trip, Jack Nicholson, Rafelson, and Peter Tork wrote at an expensive Hollywood hotel. The other three Monkeys only acted in that. <br /> <br /> They fight against it as they get, doing things that aren't scripted. They deliberately drag their rows, walk out, break landscapes, hit other participants without reason; and finally smoke, jumping on the bridge. For example, in the case of quick blinking of a psychedelic party scene, when you look at the frame words, you can see Rafelson's camera and the operator sitting in a deliberate way in the mirror. He reveals that the party is actually a fake and strikes the studio with actors who suddenly left the character and walks in the middle of the conversation when the director shouts "cut!" <br /> <br /> Monkeys never leave their character, because these characters are the ones they really are. It will soon reach the core of the revelation that is about to appear. <br /> <br /> At each stage, they realize that their increasingly strange actions were exactly what they had to do in a scripted movie they couldn't get. You say they went crazy and walked through the sky (which turns out to be colored on paper and hung from under the ceiling as a set of backgrounds)? No problem! Hey, they're monkeys, and these crazy guys just keep going! <br /> <br /> Finally, even their deaths didn't make them free. So the movie had to end and their immobile, water-moistened bodies were caught out of the river, placed in another box and stuck in the studio store until the characters needed to produce another studio. <br /> <br /> This is all the more so as the Monkeys are actually fictional characters who forced themselves into the real world. They did it through their music power. Ironically, in the end, Peter Tork has what he rightly sees as a very deep revelation that solves their problem, but unfortunately nobody listens. <br /> <br /> Peter understands: "It doesn't matter if we're in a box (movie)". It means that it doesn't matter whether it's free or illusory, and that "the only thing is that you let it happen at the moment ... You just have to let 'now' on HAPPEN as it happens without analyzing or without evaluating or deciding whether the experience is "valid" with some abstract definitions. <br /> <br /> If you can't even tell the difference, it's free or irrelevant - linking out if you are "real" is just a futile waste of time. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie at a very important time in my life. I tried to figure out how to get into this "geeky, horrible crying girl", I thought about it intensely instead of just having fun (ie but the revelation in Head broke my recursive trap and helped me more than ever to know Rafelson or Nicholson or Tork. <br /> <br /> For decades I've been watching "Good" and wishing I could thank Petet. <br /> <br /> Was it a good movie? <br /> <br /> Uhh, how, like ... <br /> <br /> == <JAH> ==
