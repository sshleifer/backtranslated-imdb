It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. 14-year-old boy Jason Shepherd wrote an English book "Big Fat Liar". When his skateboard was taken, he had to use his sister's bicycle to arrive at the college in time and hit the limousine. When he went to the limousine, he met the famous Hollywood producer, Marty Wolf. When he left the limousine, he forgot one thing: his paper! So Marty Wolf took this and he turned to Jason's English paper! When Jason admitted he left his limousine and Marty took it, his parents and his English teacher didn't believe him! So Jason and his friend Kaylee had to fly to Los Angeles to go to Hollywood for Marty to admit that he stole his story for Jason's parents. When Jason said Marty called his father Marty stole this paper, Marty tried to catch him and burned his paper! Jason was so angry that Marty burned this paper so Marty named security to get Jason out of his site! Jason and Kaylee realized that Marty didn't recognize the truth. To take Marty down in stage 2: Takedown, Jason and Kaylee put a solid blue in the area and when Marty jumps, his body turns blue and it doesn't come off! Then they put Marty in a permanent orange color in her shampoo and when she uses it, her hair turns orange and it won't go away! Finally, they put a lot of glue on Marty's ear to call him Jason's father, and when Marty uses it, he's behind his ear! It was funny when Marty's hair and body changed all blue and orange and her headset was glued to her ear! After that, they knocked Marty, saying to Monty, who is Marty's assistant, that Duncan moved to the house where the party takes place. When Marty went to see Duncan, she was in the wrong house and all the kids in the party beat her up! When Marty was in the house, Jason and Kaylee switched their car controls. When Marty drove his car, he knew that all controls were on and he didn't know which button to press. He's stupid enough to fall. When Marty hit the back, Masher destroyed his car! It was so funny. So Marty's going to call Jason's father and cheat him again! He was on the phone, but it wasn't his father, he called security! After the security got Jason and Kaylee off the Martin site, they suggested going home. Monty was supposed to be on Jason's and Kaylee's side because he knew Marty was a liar and a jerk, so he told Rocco, one of the security guards who cared for the children. Jason told his father that he had received the truth in the last 2 days and that his parents came to L.A. Jason divides the team into three teams for Stage 4. One team is bothering and trembling Marty until Jason's parents arrive. Marty first rode with Frank Jackson, but his car collapsed to go with Jale, but he took him to the desert and left him there. When Marty was in the desert, the helicopter had to save her. After that, one of the blades is stuck, so Marty and the pilot got out of the helicopter. After that, he was on his way, and when Jason saw him, Marty stopped and saw what Jason had: his monkey! So Marty went to Jason and Kaylee, and when they saw Lester, he freed the water and, when the water came, he pushed Marty away. Marty was still after the children, and when Kaylee went to the other side, Jason led Marty to the top of the apartment building. Up, Jason challenged Marty when he admitted the truth and Marty never said the truth. When the team captured Marty with a surprise, all the people, including Jason's parents who were on the set, knew what Marty did. Marty killed Jason, but the only way to get to Jason is to jump down! After that, his parents believed that Marty had taken his story. If the people on the left were the end of Marty. Finally, there was Jason's story, Big Fat Liar, film. I can't get enough of it.
