-It's pretty much the soundtrack of this movie. I just saw this baby at the Munich Film Festival and shook the house. Director Doug Pray has never seen or thought that he has even heard of this documentary, but he has made a very intimate glance at the "mixer" lives and history. He has segmented his film into about eight chapters, and then his dirty group speaks of enthusiastic interviews according to what they say. I was never a big scratch, but the film does a great job of keeping the elementary for those who know little and joking about those who are experts in this field. Mix the master Mike Beastie Boys in this movie, but only after the movie I got to name a number of heavy hitters in the industry (DJ Shadow, Q-Bert, etc.). The extraordinary charm of these talented and original DJs is evident in their explanation of what their music means to them. In the film, there are also some joyful lights about those boys (and one woman) who have to be classified as musicians. Pray does not let your film go idle and, if there is a slow scene, it will soon be reusable with barely ending music. If anything else, this movie will increase your slang vocabulary. I have to go back to "dig" so I finish this review. Look at it, it's interesting. Good stuff man. Good stuff.
