I saw this movie a week ago and I had to convince my friend to work with me because this movie seems to be such a bad appraisal. Of course, this is not "Human Traffic" or "Lock, Backup ..." but it is not a flop. I think that the fact that there are so many big budget films at the moment means that it has been ignored, but it should not be. I think it says that I'd like to do what he wants to attract for an hour and a half and leave us happy and happy. I'd rather go and see the "Mummy" that seems boring. And no, I'm not a teenager. Don't listen to critics, Star Wars fans didn't do it. This movie is worth noting just to see the wonderful Luke de Lacey and Rupert Penry-Jones. Look at this!
