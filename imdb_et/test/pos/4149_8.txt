This review is a response to a presentation asking how the movie was actually corrected ... <br /> <br /> You saw this movie last year and found it inspiring promising immigrants, like my Italian grandparents who came across Ellis through Iceland the turn of the century would have subjected any invasive control to enter America. <br /> <br /> It was definitely an eye-opening, because my grandparents never said anything terrible. My grandmother was 5 years old and my grandfather 18 when they arrived. <br /> <br /> I just went back to a trip to New York, where I was happy to get to know Ellis Iceland and the museum is really staying through the immigration assessment process - the filmmaker probably did his research only on medical exams and equipment, questions and riddles. They are all in the museum. Even Wedding Pictures and Review Room - Actually Right! Anyone with an immigrant grandparents should watch this movie. Inspiring to say at least.
