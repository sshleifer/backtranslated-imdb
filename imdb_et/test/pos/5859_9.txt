I get very tired of the mysteries of murder, except for some really great TV series. Otherwise, these murder themes are too many of the topics. I don't like these two superfluous, selfish youths who kill as an intellectual exercise, I don't care about Hitchcock, who seems to be involved, but I'm not going to find out. But don't misunderstand me, the topic itself is great, the whole movie is so well done, and of course Sandra Bullock is always supreme. <br /> <br /> Sandra's character (like Miss Congeniality), which the man's team has not appreciated, despite her obvious skills, and the boss ignores his ideas, forcing him to surrender and giving his male partner a case. Of course Sandra works out what is going on and almost killed very dramatically. It is intriguing how a boy who developed a plot of murder cannot allow his colleague to be killed - he has some sort of conscience and maybe he could "save, the other is a real psychopath." Sandra's hard shell derives from her past, related to the murder case and her colleague, knowing that Sandra solves this case, despite being blocked by her close boss, eventually discovering what happened to her with Sandra teens that she must now face and exhaust and the last scene shows her start - we hope anyway - just do it. <br /> <br /> I can see from some of the other reviews I have had time to read that this film attracts a broad group - those who are interested in two spoiled boys who want their time with their harsh philosophical determination to deceive the police and escape the perfect murder for the relationship between those wisely depicted, the haunting links to the past of the heroine, the subject of the police, and some smoke and mirrors - as well as for Hitchcock fans. <br /> <br /> For those who have asked why a Bullock character must have a problematic past, I really think it would be a much less interesting film than he would have been just a detective trying to understand what's going on and the chief of male-chauvinists. The connection between the murder victim and the detective is necessary to show the detective too much or otherwise how he would lose his lofty boss's trust and lose his life with it? This is hardly an original subject, in fact it is usually a very irritating topic, because this man-chin-chaotic boss speaks brutally, but obviously inspirationally, to give up the operation and leave it to someone who obviously does not have enough skills to deal with it though the sidekick is. I was very worried about what could happen to Sandra's character, because her emotional involvement in the incident and the special compassion for the victim's victim led her to this incident dangerously. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with the relationship between Bullock's character and his sidekick. It is interesting and sometimes very amazing. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the two boys is definitely intriguing if that's what you were interested in. I felt that it was kept at a low level in some ways because filmmakers didn't want too much boy-boy to enter into friendships, or because we didn't have to think that emotion was in their relationship. With the film, you can wonder what boy is responsible for the situation, and there are some turns and boys show their basic immaturity at different stages. <br /> <br /> One thing I wanted was explained, and that's what happens after "the end of the movie" when Sandra's character arrives in court .... you have to watch the movie to find out why she's there. <br /> <br /> Very well done everything. I can certainly not agree with those who complained about Bullock's actions - he was great. Part of it was very good for him. The story is exciting even when the mysteries of the murder are not your thing and they are not so often in me.
