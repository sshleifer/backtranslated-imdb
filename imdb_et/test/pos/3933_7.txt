Many people burn this movie in the presence of Paris Hilton, but this is not a fair reason to object to the film. The reality is that Paris has a fairly minimal part, it spends most of the movie. The film also makes him fun several times, usually with the camera and at least once a night. For those who enjoy the Paris Hilton stage scene, this can be a movie to see when the video is published at home, because when we screened, we all smiled through his failure in the movie and depicted as "the woman's questionable values". <br /> <br /> Film it was pretty good (unlike the flames of the recent weak horrors), it has everything that should be good, horrible offender, excessive violence, deeds that make this middle person sad ... this movie hits all the bases.
