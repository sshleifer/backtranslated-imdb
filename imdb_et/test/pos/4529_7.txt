This is the thirteenth Falcon movie. Tom Conway has not lost his sense of humor and style and does not show signs of fatigue. The film has a very satisfying story with lots of red herring, suspects and dames. Madge Meredith is the story of a good girl, she plays it enough, but in no way puts a fire on the screen. Myrna Dell is a bad girl and she puts the stone on her eyes, the eyes in her eyes, the wonderful face and she expects to kill as many people as possible to rejoice. Edward Brophy is back as Goldie, but a surprise surprise his manic overactivity has stopped and he is actually in control. This is a good tribute to William A. Berke's leadership skills, who had done so many Westerners, apparently not ready to take any pointless Brooklyn dummy. The result is that, for the first time, perhaps during his career, the Brophy was sufficiently toned to add to the film rather than trying to slow down the patient's patience with a slow but terrible six-year annoying behavior. It all goes well and is very fun.
