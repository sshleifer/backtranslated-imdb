This is a phenomenal film. Really one of the best movies I've ever watched. I'm a serious critic and it takes me a lot to mix, but this film had all the combinations that fit. The passion of the participants without doing anything, the pain of all involved characters, the serious and subtle truths about marriage and divorce make every effort to see the film, even though it is the 1970s. This is certainly not an "old movie" but a classic / vintage movie. I hope you deal with it when I did, if you think all kinds of volatile relationships can be, if you also consider how deep love-related pain can be, and how the most difficult decisions are always the most painful, but when they are done pain pain but only gradually. This film certainly shows that the most changeable relationships may not be weak relationships and that leaving is not necessarily lost / lack of love. The "craft" of this film is certainly from a place deep in the heart and mind of someone.
