I look at this movie in my heart with horror, because my mother was also a broken head like Michelle. I was wondering where Michelle is now. There have been times when I had to find my mother in places where I was scared, but I'm afraid to leave her! to see Michelle's behavior, made me wonder where she sleeps all this time? I watched it was never so bad for my mother! and what i want to know is ... where Matt and Tracy "teared this ass"?! The worst scene for me was to watch Tracy shoot up the old navy wardrobe !! u ever trying out clothes before you and it looks like everything except Michelle has the tools !! where do they know 2008? can we get the update ??????????
