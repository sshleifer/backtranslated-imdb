The Vicious Circle is a very unknown British puzzle story. Like many Hitchcock films, it is a person who is accused of a crime he has not committed, and he does everything he can to prove it. This time dr. Latimer (John Mills), who finds a German actor murdered from his floor. Like an honest man, doctor calls Scotland Yard a big mistake ... <br /> <br /> There's nothing special about this little movie. But watching a movie is a fun way to pass time. I liked the development of the plot. Fine actors are a plus.
