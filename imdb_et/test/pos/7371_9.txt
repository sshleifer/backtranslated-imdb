It was this Saturday before Halloween (today, at the time of writing) and it must be the best horrorantology there. I am not usually a fan of horror films - mainly because of the volume of recently released crap. However, the director of Campfire Tales has a temporary gift from Hitchcock - unlike other contemporary films - it does not take every opportunity to scare you foolishly, instead of using predictive and "almost longing" incidents that seem to be urgent that the climax is occurring at the moment, but may not be. <br /> <br /> I didn't hit "Hook" or the first major segment, but what I was reading here was two that you could afford. <br /> <br /> "People can hit too much" was full of tension - this short keeps you on the edge of your seat, waiting for a little girl to do something in her yard and the house was looking for her football and later her dog. He faces so much in the near future that the mid-term review reaches the heart's stopping proportions before the short, when the girl gives up and goes to sleep, thinking, thinking her dog is under it. He comes under his hand to let him catch it, and he feels touching the tongue in his hand ... before you notice that in the blood-written mirror, "People can also lick". I'll leave for the last few seconds to find out my reader because at this point you might have been briefly taken many times. <br /> <br /> 'The Locket' was an indisputable masterpiece for this movie. It starts with a man on a motorcycle, just driving ... to what he doesn't know, but he can feel closer. When he drives, the storm breaks and he is forced to find a muted girl's house. Two quickly cozy with each other, but before they can kiss anything, the girl shows in writing that the ghosts are living in her house. They start packing up quickly to leave, but they've been caught in the mid-decades of the scene - a father who comes home to his daughter and boy who is preparing to revive, murdering both and then committing suicide. I have to leave you right here at the end - I couldn't hope to make the story fair anyway, and what I have said so far is just a story of a brief summary - I couldn't hope to pass on the nuances and sensory details that add to it. <br /> <br /> The campfire site, which is a yarn that connects all stories, is a pretty interesting car accident issue and girls are very attractive - in fact, most of the girls in this movie are beautiful. In any case, despite the fact that it has been cut, the story is given to justice and the end is hard to predict when you are familiar with other stories. However, if you pay enough attention to the segments of campfire sites that are widespread at the film, it is certainly possible to predict the prediction, especially if you have seen the same premise-based movies. (MST3k fans, remember Soultaker? Same assumption, but without Vivian Schilling's creepy writing and most of the movie. If you've seen the first 30 minutes, then you should predict the end.) All in everything, the best horror movie I've seen LONGLY, and the only one horror anthology that deserves to be bought.
