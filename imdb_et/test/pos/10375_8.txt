David Suchet is Agatha Christie's Spicy Detective Hercule Poirot, produced in 2005 after "After the Funeral". Anyone who has heard David Suchet with his British accent knows what the shock is, because his accent Poirot is such a perfect and organic character. Suchet is a poetry of books by Agatha Christie, and although I confess love to Peter Ustinov, there is not so much to do with his portrayal as Christie wrote. <br /> <br /> In this episode, a friend of Poirot's lawyer asked to investigate a possible murder of one of his clients. At the train, the lawyer tells about the post-mortem events - the strange destroys the presumed heir and pronunciation of the man's sister that he was murdered. When Poirot comes into contact with his family, he finds adultery, many secrets, another will and murder. <br /> <br /> The story is great with rich product values ​​and a great, detailed time period. All actors are great, especially from Monica Dolan, who plays Miss Gilchrist. Poirot here is without Hastings, his beautiful office or Miss Lemon, but he's still effective. <br /> <br /> I had the privilege of seeing David Suchet on Broadway "Amadeus". Breathtaking. What an actor - when he plays Poirot, I see IS Poirot.
