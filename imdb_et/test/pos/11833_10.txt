I just watched this movie for the first time today and loved it just ... <br /> <br /> Yes, it's easy in your delivery letter, the love story of love, and how no woman could fall in love with Callum Blue strikes me ... <br /> <br /> The Italian landscapes were like you thought, beautiful, finally lost bad and two loving birds reunion, was wonderful, but the scene where certain Italian swept confetti after Eric and Wanda's wedding, perfection! <br /> <br /> Take a cup of tea and watch a fantastic movie, yes, better the fabric is ready and tempting, I know I was and hope to get it soon on DVD. All participants played their parts perfectly, this was the WW2 movie you could have believed, because it was so realistic and without up on other movies ...
