Over the years, I've come to be a fan of the director / writer Barry Levinson and he didn't let me in politics with that funny look. Popular TV comedian Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) has enlightened the people with their nervous jokes about the state and responsible politicians. At night he has fans on the islands running; Then it is suggested that Dobbs go to the president himself. His manager, Jack Menken (Christopher Walken), says that. Dobb's sliding truism throws the grassroots movement that puts him in the vote. Comedian presidential candidate. At the same time, a young woman (Laura Linney) finds an error in the computer system that takes into account the voting patterns on the coast. My favorite sequence is Linney's blend in the cafe. William is completely hysterical with his jumps. Others noted: Jeff Goldblum, Lewis Black and Rick Roberts.
