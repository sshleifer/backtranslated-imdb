A talented high school graduate, who has a bad attitude, is forced to play in a country's star-shaped high school football game. When he meets and falls into an attractive local girl, he helps him understand that he has a "full ride" scholarship when he starts well. <br /> <br /> Too often, these dramas fall into formal traps and say the same old story of a hard and confused teenager. FULL RIDE Matt Sabo definitely fits this profile, but under the surface there is a lot of unique personality when we usually see it by genre. Matt is the center of action and is a realistic teenager, both hypersensitive and vulnerable, optimistic and cynical. Amy is affected by Matt to grow up as a man with a character and a heart. He, in turn, forms friendships with his teammates, which affects his growth as an athlete and team player. <br /> <br /> FULL RIDE has all the elements we love to see in the movie - a great actor, amazing characters, exciting sports scenes, a terrifying drama and a love story. However, although these elements can be seen in other films, FULL RIDE helps performances that are sincere and occasionally moving. Perhaps the most impressive of FULL RIDE is the feeling of reality. Although the author of the previous comment seems to disagree (obviously a disgruntled student who has quite obviously caused a bad class in his film class), Mark Hoeger puts the film in a credible situation and location and does a good job of what life is in a small town. These characters are real people who are rooted in realistic situations that often create the most powerful entertainment. On one level it is a love story, on the other hand it is a character training and another simple football movie. All these ideas together form a single vehicle.
