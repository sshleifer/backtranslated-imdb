I've seen this piece of perfection :-) during a Berlin fantasy film and when I went to the cinema I felt like I was "stunned"! I've seen a lot of movies, but there are only a few that I would call perfect like koyaanisqatsi or fight club unconscious cruelty is definitely one of them !!! half of the people went out of the Berlin screening and I understand them completely! it is not a movie for "normal" people who have dreams and illusions! a person who lives in his dreams every day who does not want to see our life and all the horrors of our planet is very shocked by this film! if anyone reads it now who has seen s.c. and thinks it's great: contact me - so far I haven't met anyone who shares my opinion - it would be cool !!! this movie earns 10 points out of 10! !!! Finally I am very bad for my bad English-iÂ´m not learned a person !!! (und das ist auch gut so * g *)
