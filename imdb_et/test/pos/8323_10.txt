I saw this series in London on 1999 and it was blown away. As the other user commented, this would be what I would have liked to see when I first starred in the life and death of Jurassic Park - Dinosaurs in their natural habitat as a documentary. CG is very viable and the diversity of dinosaurs and habitats shown makes it very educational. The series takes everything known about dinosaurs, adds a lot of good ideas about what it might have been "to do what it looks like a documentary. What I missed was a small angle graph that was constantly moving around one corner of the screen" fiction "and" facts "with narration and pictures, because you don't know how much educated guess, and how much pure fantasy <br /> <br /> In the light of some facts and fiction tips you have to see 50 minutes of" Making Of, which is not only very educative about the CG process and the gathering and involvement of paleontologists' knowledge, but which is also very funny (dinosaurs who smoke cigarettes and complain about CG animators). series before going to the upcoming Disney Dinosaur movie or watching any Jurassic Park movie again, which will make you more critical of these movies.
