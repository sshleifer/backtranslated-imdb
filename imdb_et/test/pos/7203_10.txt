I loved this movie, the audience I was part of, and the little 7-year-old girl who was with me loved this movie. We all laughed at the red, visual humor and good feeling when you finished the cinema when it ended. I can easily see why it was such a big box-office success in France. I plan to buy a DVD so I can see it again and I laugh at all the bits I missed because I was so hard for the first time.
