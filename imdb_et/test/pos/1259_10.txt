It's a fantastic movie! If you haven't seen it yet, then you should well fucking. Of course, the plot develops slowly, the special effects are ridiculous, acting ridiculously and the action is poorly choreographed, but when the wrestler DDP says; It's not a bad thing ... it's good! All this movie is fun, especially if you get a duplicated version with even worse actors. It has countless laughs until you reach the end, longing for a sequel where mummy fights with wrestling women. So I give him ten stars. If you are not one of the "extraordinary" and "intelligent" good-tasting people who like only "high quality" movies with the highest caliber, then I recommend this completely multidimensional movie!
