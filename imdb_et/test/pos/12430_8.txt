It was on Showtime the second night, and I thought it was another video-video-crap fest, like "Earth vs Spider" or any of the other HBO horror. Instead, I found comedy / gore classic. It was legitimately funny and surprising that it was pretty good. Even my wife, the general horror hater, agreed and smiled at the parts. In addition, FX was of high quality. <br /> <br /> In general, the film, like Joy Ride / Jeepers Creeperside parody, and the two main characters, reminded me of a pair of Shaun of the Dead. Be sure to look at it, but don't take it seriously. <br /> <br /> The End.
