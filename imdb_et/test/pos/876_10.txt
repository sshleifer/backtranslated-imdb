I love this movie. This is the first movie Master P has ever done. It is based on his biography. This is a low budget, but it is very good. This shows how Master p grew in New Orleans projects. <br /> <br /> Media P began not only in this movie, but also with Moon Jones writer and director. There is also a "No Limit" ice cream party on the DVD. This movie shows how Master P goes from bad to too good and how he had to deal with his affairs. There are also many No No Limit Records in this movie. This movie should be bought or rented. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie to watch as you like a rap or Master P fan. I won't break this movie for you. Go to this movie as soon as possible and see it. You like it.
