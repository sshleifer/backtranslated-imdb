On a routine mission in Iraq, the group's delta soldiers will recover their computer hard drive from the Alqueda training camp, detailing the location of the weapon experts Dr Walsh. After completing his secret arms development program, Dr. Walsh has found an alternative source of funding and is building a new research facility deep in Chechnya, the notorious Belzan forest, where he develops weapons and sells them to Chechen rebels. The Delta team has been sent to a black ops to get a doctor and his technology before the Russians find him and his lab. What Delta's team will soon discover is that doctors' latest weapons are big carnivores that have been genetically engineered to develop a taste for human flesh. I found this film much better than I expected. There's a lot of activity and lots of blood. It is more or less what to expect from the function of nature. Operation is not great but passable. I have certainly seen worse. In general, this is an enjoyable movie about what it is. A good popcorn movie.
