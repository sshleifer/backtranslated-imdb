Great great! West Coast got "Dirty" Harry Callahan, East Coast got Sharky. Burt Reynolds plays Sharky in "Sharky Machine" and I enjoyed every minute. Playing maverick drug policeman in Atlanta, GA is just what everyone wants. Instead of being suspended, he is sent to the Vice-President. As in Dirty Harry's films or in some other film, the captain always jabs. When I was a kid, I was curious what this film meant "Sharky machine". Well I knew who was playing Sharky, I don't know what his machine was. It was his group of colleagues. After the murder is discovered, he goes all out to find the perp. If it turns out to be a big time boss, Sharky doesn't play around. When he gets another prostitute safe, Sharky fights hard and good, despite losing his finger. And I also like the part where a bad glass is blown out of the building. That was BOMB! Randy Crawford's "Street Life" brought the movie to the right mood and the film itself is really a big blow for me. Rated 4 out of 5 stars.
