Antarctica, winter 1982. The team of the American research base surprises a couple of mad Norwegians who are tracking a dog with a helicopter and trying to kill it. All Norwegians are killed and Americans leave nothing but a dog, a few bodies and questions. It's the biggest horror / thriller movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, you will feel a tense, paranoid mood. Helpless and non-men alone. Ennio Morricone was nominated for the Razzie Prize for her score. Why I don't know, as far as I can see, his score is simple, horrible and very good. In fact, it gets the right mood. <br /> <br /> Actress is great! The best result is probably the dog that is just amazing. Like Russell and others on two feet, I can't say anything less. <br /> <br /> Can you guess 1982 and the special effects aren't the most impressive? Think again! You haven't seen it all until you've seen it. Body parts are falling and creatures are changing forms ... Rob Bottin has done a great job today because it is a milestone in special effects makeup. <br /> <br /> The film didn't get a big response when it first hit a big screen that was at other times due to alien movies and so it is not very well known. In fact, it's an almost unknown film. Someone I have asked has not heard of it. But the film has managed to live a twenty-year culture as a movie on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long time, and except for haircuts, the film is still quite up to date. This movie is considered classic. <br /> <br /> The film is undoubtedly one of me, if not my favorite. I've seen it many times, but it's as good as I saw it for the first time. In Norway, the only thing I do not like about this movie is that MacReady requires the Norwegians to call!
