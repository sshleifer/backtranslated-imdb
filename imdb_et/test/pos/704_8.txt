"Desperadoed" (1943) is a real classic, not its story (which is quite routine), but the elements of its technical production. It was the most important western, which was once the greatest at the time of its release, and the more unique because it was Columbia's production - a light studio with a profound nourishing reputation. Only Fox's "Jesse James" (who also played Randolph Scott) a few years ago gave it a genre near this rich treatment. Although "searches" and "high evenings" would have overshadowed a few years, "Desperadoed" was a groundbreaking effort and a historic treasure. <br /> <br /> In 1863, the economy of the Red Town of Utah is based on the Union Army rounding and selling wild animals. The script will be a little confused here, referring to the railroad (which was in Utah's future for several years) and Custer's last base (Custer was busy with Stuart in Pennsylvania), but these are not essential elements of the plot. The Red Valley is an honest sheriff, Steve Upton (Scott), but the banker and many citizens are corrupt; robbing your bank every time the government pays for the herd of horses. The city is visited by famous laws, old friend Steve, Cheyenne Rogers. He wants to go straight, especially after he has fallen into the pretty pretty owner Alison McLeod (Evelyn Keyes). Cheyenne partner "Nitro" Rankin (Guinn "Big Boy" Williams) is primarily a comic relief, like Uncle Willie McLeod (Edgar Buchanan) and City Judge (Raymond Walburn, who designs his character on the Frank Morgan's "Wizard of Oz" crystal ball) faker). <br /> <br /> Having no chance with its huge budget, Columbia packed this thing with tons of action and every western film element, but with Indians and covered wagons. There's the best wild horse ever filmed, a spectacular baroque strike, an explosive climax, romance and a three-layered Technicolor. All these things may not fit together, but who would have taken care of it in 1943. Unity is a problem because it seeks to be so serious about Western as well as comedy. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was probably the best during filming. Internal scenes are strong, but it is truly impressive naturalistic photography; both lyrical static shots and filming of moving cameras. <br /> <br /> Scott and Claire Trevor were the best bills, but the studio wanted to clearly advertise Ford, who would soon be their biggest star. And director Charles Vidor used this film to introduce his new wife, Keyes (whose depiction of Scarlett's sister "Windmill" was more about audiences than any small part of the history of films). <br /> <br /> The dynamics of Ford-Keyes is the most unique and important feature. Instead of going to the piano with the "love triangle" with Scott and / or Trevor (what it happens first), the whole romantic focus is on two younger players. This was probably the best role that Keyes ever had, and he uses it best. Playing tomboyish, but very sexy young woman who looks good in both leather pants and dresses, and who travels and fights like Kiera Knightley's character "Pirates of the Caribbean". At the same time, it was revolutionary and coincided with the establishment of the 1940s WAAC for World War II military service. <br /> <br /> "Desperadoed" is one movie that is well maintained and the print looks like it's brand new. Unfortunately, there are no special features on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Then what do I know? I'm just a child.
