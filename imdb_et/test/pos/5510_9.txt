This thriller is one of the few (movie) surprises I've had for some time. Everything - and I mean everything - I was talking about it when it was in theaters, that it was terrible ... but then I thought ... none of these people really understand horror / thriller or metal clocks - so why am I listening to them in the first site ????? This movie starts the ass - but only if you can understand and enjoy this type of entertainment. In short (too late) - look at it openly and it may just open your mind. ... also sound tracks are great ...
