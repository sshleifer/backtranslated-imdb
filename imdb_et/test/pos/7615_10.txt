I saw it coming out for the first time and seeing it several times. I have a DVD. This is one of Drew Barrymore's best works, worth more than once. <br /> <br /> Not a popular high school was one of the things I could interact with. I was not as tortured as Josie was (during her real high school days) or as Aldys, but I was never a big party type. The prom scene was three popular girls who sacrificed their worship when Josie rejects how Aldys (the proposed victim) is my favorite scene, and I hit it when I first saw it. <br /> <br /> I can still watch this movie. that's great.
