Anthony Minghela (writer / director) Cold Mountain is a carefully designed, sensitive and intelligent drama placed in the social context of the confederation during a civil war that deals with war politics in a very fine and realistic sense. Although it is the brutality and inhumanity of this war, it does something that many of the films in this period are unable to deal with so effectively - Cold Mountain explores the inner context of the south and represents the people who made the war among those who have non-slave changes. And almost uniquely, Cold Mountain doesn't move the general, northern, or anyone else. <br /> <br /> The film comes through the genres as needed - never to be played from an anxious moment. It is romance, military history, action adventure and historical fiction, all of which are beautifully knit together. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), who are for very simple reasons. As this young romance begins to turn, Inman expands into the confederate army, taking with him the book Ada and her photo. Ada's character is one of the most brilliant aspects of the film, which is important because the audience experiences this film from a third party perspective, but the story is clearly from start to finish. Ada is an intelligent southern belle and daughter of a liberal minister. He begins his film as a father of a girl who has experienced in many arts that South women surrounded by servants had to learn. In other words, if he admits to Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger), he is just a useless captain. <br /> <br /> Ada's father goes on and leaves his modest real estate in his hands. In the absence of such experience, he fights and survives, keeping the memory of Inman close to his heart. Ruby enters the picture as a tough young woman raised by a drunk and careless father. Ruby has all the skills and abilities that Adal lacks, and when they become an integral business partner, they love each other as better friends. Inman's experience is radically different, but mirrored by something. During his participation in the war, he sees many friends who were killed for reasons they do not believe and decide in the desert. The one he meets does not escape his rescue when he goes back a thousand miles to Cold Mountain and Ada and most of the people he meets die. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie takes place during Inman's long walk with both main characters when they live, learn, grow and change. The constant act of despair keeps their intense passionate love. For Inman, this is his only source of hope in a world of pure despair. For Ada, this is the same thing, but also the old southern symbol and the residue - the world that is fast going through. <br /> <br /> Cinematic art is powerful and breathtaking. There are beautiful shots of the Appalachian landscapes that give the film a strong history. The script and editing are also extremely strong - emphasizing the wide class and educational differences reflected in the middle and sub-dialects of the south. The pain of this movie should not be expected to be perfect. And most of the time it will rise. However, one of my criticisms is related to the characters of Kidman and Law. Australia and Britain are unlikely to be expected to accurately reproduce South American speech, but there are some cases where these two exceptionally talented actors produce disturbing vocal clips. I acknowledge my hypersensitivity to this and I can say with certainty that most people are not disturbed. Zellweger's performance is outstanding and it creates the character that I remember in my aging. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
