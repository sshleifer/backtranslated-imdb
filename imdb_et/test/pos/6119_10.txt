The movie that gave us John Waters is one of the funniest movies. Yes, it can be difficult, but it's full of hysterical moments that nobody has done so far. The infamous dog scene must be one of the cinema's highlights. not just an easily offended film, it's one of those movies that you always see something new. Divine performance is worthy of reputation. Mink Stole is hysterical. It's the film's film and the whole genre of Gross-out comedy. I know it sounds a bit extreme, but think about it. Before that, the comedies in the mill had run very hard and almost identical. After that, the comedies started strange and strange, but well. I'd give it out of 10 out of 10 if I could.
