I saw Beyond Rangon about 20 times, it was good. First of all, when I looked at it, I saw Laura Bowman's story, but later, after several exhibitions, I realized that it was also a parallel documentary. In my opinion, the story of Aung San Suu Kyst and the struggle of women was to keep them strong in the face of uncertainty, danger and sadness. I would also put history and politics on the list after further viewing, because I learned a lot about Burma's past and presence, and I can only guess this future. This movie is not just one you want to see, it is also one you definitely want to own. This is a film that the whole family could easily see, though not for children under the age of 13. However, the educational advantages of this film cannot and should not be underestimated.
