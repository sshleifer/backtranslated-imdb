Great fun for both the movie and the excuse to sit and play "oh, this is a whassis name" game. Every letter in the golden age of English movies seems to be in it and it was a pleasure to see them. And the biggest of them all, Richard Watt, was as big as ever. <br /> <br /> There is actually a plot that is moving very well, there are some great jokes and comedy moments, but the key to this movie is its characters. Alastair Sim is great and somehow convinces you that a six-foot boned Scotsman could be the director of a girl's internship. George Cole, Beryl Reid and Irene Handl are in their moments, but the star of the exhibition with Alastair and Richard is Joyce Grenfell. He is an absolute lump and brings a smile when he is on the screen ... his accent of walking and plum is made to perfection. <br /> <br /> And for those who play, this is a whassis name game, you can even meet Arthur Mullard, Barbara Windsor and Ronald Searle.
