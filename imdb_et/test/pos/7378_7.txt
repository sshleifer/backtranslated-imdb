When driving a dangerous zigzag on a lonely road at night, teenager Cliff (Jay R. Ferguson) has a car accident with friends with Lauren (Christine Taylor), Alex (Kim Murphy) and Eric (Christopher Masterson). Spending a cold evening campfire in the woods, they kill the time that talks about ghost stories. In "Honeymoon", a couple of Rick (Ron Livingston) and Valerie (Jennifer MacDonald) are traveling to their RV in Las Vegas for their honeymoon. Rick takes the shortcut to visit Clayton's caves at night, but the stranger Cole (Hawthorne James) suggests leaving them because the dangerous creatures are attacking people in full months. In "People Get a Lick Too", on the eve of his twelfth birthday, Amanda (Alex McKenna) tells her internet friend Jessica that she is alone at home. But Jessica is actually a psychopath. "The Locket", biker Scott (Glenn Quinn) crosses his motorcycle in the country. If he has problems with his bike, he finds an isolated house, where the proud stupid Heather Wallace (Jacinda Barrett) lives with his father. When a man returns to his herd, Scott finds the truth about Heather. <br /> <br /> Campfire Tales presents three good horrors, with monsters, psychopaths and ghosts, and a surprising twist. The weakest segment is "Hook" with Eddie and Jenny, but the other stories are great. The plot's point is completely unexpected and gives a big conclusion to the average horror movie. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazul): "Contos da Meia-Noite" ("Midnight Tales")
