Astronaut disappears in a deep space and finds that he is traveling through an unknown territory on board a living spacecraft, accompanied by a language of alien species. This incredible drawn and enjoyable TV installment is a positive birth fantasy. Individual characters who are at the beginning of the series must learn to deal with each other and eventually become a powerful group. Most of the activities take place in the mother of a living spacecraft of Moia (who even gets pregnant and is born on another ship!). Although scientific literature is usually interested in negative birth fantasies (see, for example, "aliens" films, especially the fourth part "Resurrection"), it is a surprise. There is also a lack of military hierarchy on board and a positive attitude towards gender and human (and alien) body. One of the female characters who are actually a plant is experiencing sunlight under the sun. The team must even go to the toilet. Isn't that impossible in Star Trek?
