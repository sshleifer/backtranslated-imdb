If I assume you know what this film is talking about, I am also forced to assume that you have come to this review, knowing that you are likely to look at it despite what I say. If all this rings right - read on - you may find some inconsistency at least with this part of the review. If you are undecided or not sure what happened in the late 70s and early 80s in the culture of urban and suburban music, you should probably read one review that pretends to be objective. <br /> <br /> Although I did not grow in California, the American punk scene was the first music I ever really lived on. At the height of hardcore I was about 1979 - 1981. only common denominators between the frequency bands and the members of their audience were: <br /> <br /> * rejection of compliance <br /> <br /> * tolerance and enjoyment of differences <br /> <br /> * a desire to have fun - hard and fast <br /> <br /> Hairstyles, politics, government figures, and violent slam dances were not an integral part of what I experienced, though there were certainly clicks or factions that tended to be intolerant of those who haven't dressed, talked, or acted "punk" enough. Often, some of these clicks often contained a certain amount of uncollected credit for those who really struggled to live under the fascist paradigm of anarchist, self-exhausting, angry young policemen. <br /> <br /> Although the interviews with the audience in Penelope Spheer's excellent Cal-Punk documentary "The decline of Western civilization" are very narrow, some of us enjoyed subculture, interviews with bands, club owners, promoters and even security people at least from my own perspective and much more of the "scene" memories. nevertheless, it is possible that those who approach it will have the prejudices in this film without their pre-treatment being disputed. Unfortunately, it is only for those who promote, believe or feel comfortable with stereotypes - not filmmakers. Don't blame the escort. <br /> <br /> The music here is not for everyone - nor for the most. It is not the most raw material there, but it is a peculiar, unpleasant, fast and less worrying technique than raw energy. <br /> <br /> It seemed to me that the early black flag with Ron Reyes was singing, X, fear and circle Jerks was much more expensive than the cost of this movie. As much as I like the nerves, seeing Darby Crash's nonsense - and a nice guy - he got a little cold for me. Nevertheless, Darby's games were with a pet tarantula, while "Shut Down", which was drowned in the background and on top, was valuable. The X interview is also great. <br /> <br /> Spheer's simple documentary style is complemented by natural pans and zooms during musical segments. During interviews, framing is used very well to provide the context that is said. Given his experience and budget, Spheer did as well as everyone with this movie. <br /> <br /> Recommended for those who really appreciate this movie, and for those who have forgotten those couple of years of honest honesty, the undirected rebellion before the common election of Amaerican punk in musical mainstream and stereotypes became more important than basic philosophy.
