If you like silly comedy, like a plane, you love this movie! This is definitely an airplane and scary movie style. Fun movie! It has the strangest number of characters in the same movie. Michael Jackson, Evan Marriott, Joyce Giraurd, Stuart Bank, Charlie Schlater and Eric Roberts. Special effects are hockey, but I think they should be, because it's a silly comedy. There are probably two versions of the movie, one on Blockbuster and one on the official website: MissCastaway.com. The website appears to have a preview version signed by the director. Sometimes the fun is behind the scenes filmed in Michael Jackson with Neverland. The film was filmed in 2003 and says it is fun for PG.
