This is really an amazing story and the most amazing part is that it is really happy! If you haven't noticed: it's based on a real story. <br /> <br /> (Possible spoiler) <br /> <br /> Imagine shock and horror to discover that your father was once an officer of SS World War II. <br /> <br /> This is a very intriguing story and I am really surprised that the movie has been appreciated at imdb.com today. 5.3. <br /> <br /> My price: 7
