Up and coming was a very positive sitcom, which led to a tool / channel that opened up the thoughts of the young black culture. Focus and prospects were a positive message for our people and hope for change. I recommend this choice for every American household to experience this struggle and reward. The exhibition was never given the opportunity to flourish in the middle of the idea of ​​black people who become owners of their own businesses. The question was so compatible with the real life situation that affected the lives of so many people. I sincerely hope that the whole volume can be restored and the Americans put on DVD to enjoy their family. <br /> <br /> Thank you.
