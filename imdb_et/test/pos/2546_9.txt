This is one of those films when you look at whether it is a documentary or a fiction. After the film, Ramin Bahrani answered many questions and we learned that the film had a script. arranged to make the picture beautiful but can't get me wrong; there are many preparations for this movie. From a personal level, being part of the environment that is ignored in filming. <br /> <br /> The main character is an "actual" actor in every sense. thank all the team for this movie, showing us a new country in NYC. I strongly recommend it if you like the stories of others. <br /> <br /> Bora Kizilirmak
