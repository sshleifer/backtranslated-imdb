I saw a move in Paris in May 2006 ... I thought it was impossible between the mission and the mission ... I am very glad to choose OSS 117 not only because it was funny, but maybe also watch the FRench movie in France. I had a great time ... I would recommend it. It is important to understand that today's French society really understands the humor of this movie ... can't wait until the DVD comes out ... I don't know how some "jeu de mots" "sticks" would be translated into English. I'll definitely buy it out! P.S. I saw the "BRice de Nice", a film starring Dujardin, that all the children spoke in France. this movie is comedy, but quieter than you can imagine ... when comparing both movies, I have to say that Dujardin did a good job in OSS.
