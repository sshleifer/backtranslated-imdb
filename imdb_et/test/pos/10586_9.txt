"Haggard" is in Bam Margera's hometown of Westchester PA, a semi-real story of Ryan Dun and his friends Falcone and Vallo. <br /> <br /> Dunn is a two-year-old girlfriend, Glauren, who now sees a beer, a long-haired metal head called "Hellboy" and drives Dunn crazy about jealousy. <br /> <br /> In a desperate attempt to find the truth about what is going on at Glauren and Hellboy, Dunn will pay his friends Vallo and Falcone to break into his house and file evidence. I found this movie to be very funny, maybe partly because I am a fan of Jackass and CKY, and I have to say that a lot of humor is likely to be lost to those who have no prior Margera crazy comedy brand. ‚Äù<br /> < The movie has a lot of interest in roller skates, especially the legend of rollerblading, Tony Hawk as a police officer. Bucky Lasek, Brandon Novak, Jason Ellis and Bami's long-suffering parents are in April and Philis. <br /> <br /> Add-ons for DVDs includes a music video from CKY (Bam's brother with Jess drums) Bam's favorite band, HIM (Bam's character in the film is named HIM's chairman Ville Vallo) There is also a documentary and "too hot jackass" skit. <br /> <br /> I said earlier This film is mostly interesting for skaters and Jackass / CKY fans, but I feel that Margera and the collaboration have made great efforts with 'Haggard' and I, I enjoyed it thoroughly.
