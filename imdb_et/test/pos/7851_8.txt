I was amazed at Clint Eastwood's early performance. I didn't read the movie summary when I decided to watch it on TV. Thanks to Mr. Eastwood, I waited for some nice shots and a deep story. I was pretty wrong. I found a couple of topics that were unusually explicitly discussed, and to the end I couldn't make my thoughts about who is good and who is bad. This movie is certainly not typical of Eastwood, but it's definitely worth a look.
