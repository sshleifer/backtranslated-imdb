From time to time you stumble over a movie that will surprise you and it is one of them. On a surprise scale, it is a hot tub shared with Jessica Alba, while Elvis, Jimi Hendrix, John Lennon, Phil Lynott and Keith Moon are made up of a band. The reason why this film surprises you is that for the small budget they had (8,000 pounds) and that it was made by a number of friends who just wanted to try it, they have created something very slippery and look slightly 100 times more if its budget is easy. <br /> <br /> The plot is a simple mercenary team that carries a dangerous prisoner through space and is forced to hit the ground on a nearby empty planet. After some checks, not only does the existence of a planet exist according to the star cards, but they are not alone, as it seems, and they are chosen one by one very unfriendly. The mixing elements of Sci-Fi fares for aliens seem to be very standard. Predator and Pitch Black, but it takes all of them and makes them fresh and original. <br /> <br /> Taking this location is awesome using the maximum of Balberdie Beach in Aberdeen and you really feel there is one alien world. The seemingly endless sand dunes and smart light effects give him a very fine feeling, you think the team is a stranger in the world. The sequences of activities are also excellent, an offensive attack on a merchant ship is a great example of what special effects can be achieved both in the budget and in the fires, and the stunning finale that all show the ingenuity of the film. <br /> <br /> As for the mercenary team, it goes without saying. With a low budget for an independent movie, here was the local media outlets, and they seem to have chosen some possible stars for the future. The local bodybuilder, Mike Mitchell, who is not a natural actor, does not take on the role of mercenary Arnie-Esq. Of the rest, there are two outstanding performances by Patrick Wright in the second command of McNeal and Scott Ironside as a harsh and ready engineer Vince. Both have the best features in the film, and Scott puts good humor on the film. Patrick performs well in circular performance because the command is hunting as another. <br /> <br /> Director Mark Stirton can be very proud of what he has achieved and shows that Scottish cinema doesn't have to be "Kilts and Ceilidhs" or "Slums and drugs" Scottish movies can be fresh, ingenious and above all a lot of godliness. This film is on the Scottish (north-eastern) core and praises the actors and directors for retaining the accent of accents that adds to its charm. Although budget constraints show from time to time (the only mistake I find) is to wait. This film, its production and the team deserve all the progress they can make, and some more. I wish Mark and his team would succeed and their careers would be very attentive. <br /> <br /> Rating - 9/10 The first Scottish sci-fi is a brave, fresh and inventive triumph. <br /> <br /> Movie reviews, news and opinion like no other plus kick-twice a week pod-casts. <br /> <br /> www.fightrunner.co.uk <br /> <br />contact@fightrunner.co.uk
