It has been since 1972 when I saw this movie and still remember one of my favorite music. I'd buy a copy if it's on a DVD and it's too bad if it's not. You think something that Peter Sellers is about to bring back. Much better than "Be there" and as good as the Pink Pantheri series. Uschi Digard had a small part of such a well-blessed performer. He's a bonus in this movie. I think the medical industry may not understand this film because it makes a profession from a professional point of view, and it also understands that sellers have never been able to treat them because its side of the bed is sucked, and it has also analyzed urine samples.
