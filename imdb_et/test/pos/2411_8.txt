OK, so it's the first Karate Kid. But I think there can never be too many movies like the first Karate Kid. This kind of story is something that seems to be very similar to people like me. You have a general feeling that you can overcome accidents by finding yourself new things. In this movie, Hillary Swank is a pearl as the next Karate Kid. You can really say he has a bright future in front of him. <br /> <br /> Don't say that this movie is not without problems. Unlike the first, Mr Miyagi seems to be a little eager to get Julie to study martial arts and combat. He almost seems to have forgotten his values ​​from the first film. Likewise, the monks must be suspended in disbelief. Because of the film, the monks have seen a too simple view of life and do not really explain why they do what they do on the line. Scrapers are also somewhat questionable, though bad guys hate. I also have doubts about the Martial Arts films that end at night. <br /> <br /> So maybe it's not a perfect movie. So maybe it wouldn't be the biggest movie on Friday night. But more than one, it is a blame for pleasure. Hillary Swank is just so cute, and the story, even if it's original, works. The genre of films, which seems to be something other than action and violence, is the breath of fresh air. Unlike all Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van-Dam, this film is about spirit and heart. There are some people who need such movies and we take everything we can. My Rating: 8/10
