Several years ago I saw this movie without subtitling on television and despite the fact that I do not understand the word about what the characters say, I still got a general idea and the mood of the movie does not end. <br /> <br /> Last saw it a few weeks ago. my heart missed when I saw a picture in the television guide and for 8 days until the movie was really shown, I told everyone I knew to go and see. The story reminded me of a little alfred hitchcock dizziness. a slow, stray film of a man who one day believes he sees a girl who has disappeared for years. the next is a wild racing race, which is linked to setbacks, changing perspectives and truly invented twists, and at the end of the movie I was breathing. I wasn't sure what I had been waiting for (and I had already seen the movie!). be confused. <br /> <br /> 9 out of ten
