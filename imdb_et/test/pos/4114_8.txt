Much better than generally granted credit, this "Lost Horizon" version was not only great music and beautiful landscapes, but also some great mountain photos. A few years ago, a special edition magazine appeared, adding more than 30 minutes of previously deleted material, extra music and lots of bonus materials. Why is this not a DVD?! Studios are sometimes difficult to think of. Certainly, the roles could have been given to people who could sing better than Peter Finch, Liv Ullman, George Kennedy and Sally Kellerman, but what do you want in the movie, good shows or melodic tubes? Singer and dancer Bobby Van is very fun, Michael York is a suitably tragic villain, and seeing Sir John Gielgudi out because Chang may seem stupid, but actually works very well on the screen. Trust me, you have to control this movie - if you find it!
