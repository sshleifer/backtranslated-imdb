Enjoy "Den brysomme mannen" http://ow.ly/PTTp (my wife didn't do it, so I looked at it in bits a few days). <br /> <br /> Inspectors confused - most agree that it is allegorical but not; "Heaven", "Hell", "Socialism", "Capitalism"? <br /> <br /> Because most people do not want to escape, and this is essentially forbidden, most of these options go. <br /> <br /> So supposedly you should design your favorite project for worry / prejudice / fear about it. <br /> <br /> So I would say that this is an a-epicurea. A lively desaturate color, literally in the film, in an imaginary interpretation.
