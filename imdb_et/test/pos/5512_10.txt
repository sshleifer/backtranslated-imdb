Dee Snider was inspired by a two-part horror movie. This film wrote / directed / produced and featured in detail the themes of these songs (Horror-Terria, TwistedSister / Stay Hungry). People have commented that he must have a sick mind to do something like that. I can't hear anyone giving such comments about Stephen King, Wes Craven, Dean Koontz, or Alfred Hitchcock himself. The film has evolved into a modern psychotic created by current trends in society. Personally, I thought it was pretty good pictures of just imagination and inspiration, even in big budget conversations with real victims / criminals. This movie is perfect if you want to give something to you for nightmares and make you guilty of potential and probable. It can succeed!
