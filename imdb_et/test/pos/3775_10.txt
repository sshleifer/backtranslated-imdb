I saw this movie for the first time in the early 1980s and used it before betamax. As we all know, betamax went on an 8-track tape, sighing, really good picture quality. Anyway, I'm glad I found this movie again, I've been searching for it for more than 10 years! This movie belongs to films like the plane: continuous jokes, oneliners, fun activities (bodylanguage). Mark Blankfield is completely fun. His transformation from the shy Dr Daniel Jekyl to sexual participatory hydrodynamic hydrodynamics is unforgettable, with goldtooth, chesthair and goldchains. The part I loved best was when he hijacked this poor guy and then went to Mrs. Woo Woo. Fully psychedelic experience without medication! If you need laughter therapy, this is the film. When I first saw it, I had tears in my eyes and my stomach was constantly laughing. This is a movie I can watch over and over again. I highly recommend it.
