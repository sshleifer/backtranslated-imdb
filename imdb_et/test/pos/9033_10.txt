I'm not a fan of Faulkner (which is considered sacred, especially since I grew up close to the author's hometown); I think it's a great movie. The killing of the best quality movie "Kill Bird". If you haven't seen it, buy it anyway. It's worth your own stock. TCM recently played a movie as part of Race's Film. I wish they would play it more often. Very moving. <br /> <br /> In a guest note, the residents of Oxford, Mississippi will enjoy seeing the city square as it was in the 1940s. Courthouse, Town Hall, etc. They are all on the screen. I didn't know the film was filmed there until I noticed the knowledge of the buildings. When I saw the arch in front of the Town Hall, I began to suspect. Take a closer look at the Chick Wall Pennants: Be Two to Miss.
