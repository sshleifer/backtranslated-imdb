Watching "Death Bed: Bed Eat" is like waking up to the hospital, two days of suicide, looking, desorising, but strangely stimulating. In mythology, morality, and surrealistic ideology, there is little cinematic equivalence in this disturbing but often humorous lesson. <br /> <br /> Cocteau's 'poet's blood' and Maya Deren's experimental works will highlight the strange atmosphere of DEATH BED. Close comparisons are the dark adult fairy tales of the literary gene author, Angela Carter, Unica <br /> <br /> Zurn or E.T.A. Hoffman. <br /> <br /> DEATH BED has many well-known elements <br /> <br /> from the past, but it shows a completely unique and original story. <br /> <br /> The story is that DEATH BED is amazingly simple but original <br /> <br /> something that only one thousand independent editions can achieve. This vague film has technical drawbacks, but it all goes beyond the beautiful non-participants. <br /> <br /> and creepy places - a true classic of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> DEATH BED also shows a unique, subversive, three-dimensional personality - a deep and constant stratification of dream images and ideas that give it a joke-type design. As time went by, they spoke of setbacks and historical timings, a bed with bad black humor, a rich but underestimated symbolism used in its design. The most enjoyable is the image of the affected artist Aubrey Beardly, which has been eternally captured in his own painting frame when he comments and loves the "donations" of murdered victims he has given to the love of the spirit of a demented bed. - Sick refrain and wonderful element / metaphor "trapped in the artist" - something, but stranger in POE or MALLARME can be the same. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates the spirit of an independent cinema and craves a multi-layered symbolic experience or craves the surreal concept of "creepy <br /> <br /> beauty" and filming the Gothic horror tendency for low-budget exploitation makes this a completely unique vision. A simple and fun movie with delicious deep psychic currents. VERY RECOMMENDED. *****
