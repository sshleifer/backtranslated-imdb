What a great movie it is. I found this full of unexpectedly unexpected pain to be a teenage girl. And it is placed on the tropical island paradise. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardeiux brings his special European praise for the divorced father of a teenage girl. They are on vacation together and they will add excitement to the island in many unexpected ways. But you have to look at the movie for yourself to see all the fun situations they find. <br /> <br /> There are some cult classic that all teens should see. This movie should be added to the list. In addition to Dirty Dancing, Ferris Bueller's Day, Bill and Ted's great adventure, Rocky Horror Picture Show, and Animal House, my father's hero should be in film training. See if you had a teenage daughter and you laughed. Look at it with your teenage daughter and prepare to laugh for a month.
