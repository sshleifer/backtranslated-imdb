Much more than that of the other films of this time, the Demons Night depicts a meaningless and enormously pleasing horror. This is an unpleasant fun with cumbersome nasty effects, gorgeous (and crooked) teens and divine cliche elements. A group of pet animals led by an alternative Angela is going to celebrate Halloween's abandoned tomb that carries a terrible legend of the city. It all starts with dancing, drinking and occasionally flirting with those youngsters who are unable to control their hormones, but soon the bloodthirsty demon is the hostess. In the most inventive ways you have ever seen, the rest of the casting is only killed to return to bleeding as a ugly creature. What makes this film better than most of the 80's horror films in the cheese games is to find a good balance between a light-headed camp and an atmosphere of horror. Some sequences are really horrible and the funeral settings give the demons a night of great tone. Director Tenney uses excellent pieces (coffins, crematorium, endless dark corridors?) And his young, enthusiastic cast will probably love what they are doing. The terrible makeup effect of artists and designers Of course, the obvious aspects of love and horrible fanatics love absolutely a lot of broken limbs, pulled their eyes out and crushed the skull! However, the ultimate emphasis is on Linnea Quigley's trick with the vanishing lipstick! This nymphomaniac bimbo pulls all the lipstick tube into your nipple and continues sexual murder! Terrible! The demons' night became two sequences in the 90s and although they are definitely worth a look, they focus more on comedy than chills.
