After seeing the Texas Tale of Treason, Cox's frenzied correspondence couldn't even afford the massive collusion that Stu hadn't run without a budget. It tells a story of devotion, sweat, quiz, fire and punk rock. I love it! My favorite items are interviewing Marc (he's such a hot baby baby and he digs me but he just doesn't know it yet). The Japanese secretary burst into rows that broke me. The sexual scene was very cool. I'll see if Stu sometimes goes over and makes a box of light when I do it to my wife. Intro and of course my 5 seconds credit closing time. I know I get chicks for me. I hope to see more from Antstuie because I know I'm looking forward to an unexpected.
