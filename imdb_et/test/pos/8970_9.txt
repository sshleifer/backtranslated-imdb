Here is a film that is almost all right, good presentations from everyone, and three good performances from Hanks, Seymour Hoffman's premiere and Julia Roberts, which had spells for the first few seconds, are performances that raise and keep production on the stars. <br /> <br /> In addition to one or two very small script issues, the only thing that lets you put it down is the technical direction, too many bad cuts (fudged continuity), and several camera "scams" that just don't work. It's surprising about this movie of nature and it's a bit annoying to watch, but it doesn't destroy the otherwise beautifully designed movie.
