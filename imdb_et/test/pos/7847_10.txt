During the Civil War, the wounded soldier of the Union hides in an isolated confederacy school; where the school head and the school teacher decide to take care of her and keep her until the difficulties start brushing alone and sexually disappointed women and girls. The soldier decides to take advantage of this situation, but it's all at a price. <br /> <br /> "Dirty Harry (1971)" (which was made at the same time "The Beguiled") may be my favorite collaboration between Eastwood and Siegel, but after that I see that I think it's the best of couples work together. A very atypical, skillful and stylish vehicle for Eastwood is always a brand with Don Siegel's rich controlled direction and Lalo Schifrin's haunting music. This sultrily is the passionate and gloomy nature that is intrusively planted in the psychological makeup and manipulative strangulation of the film in sexual misery. It is played abruptly and it makes it bleeding and screaming blood when these random shocks and cunning intentions are tensioning. How Siegel illustrates John B Sherry and Grimes Grice's enticing bold, slow-burning, taken from Thomas Cullinan's novel, is effectively conducted through the harsh lyric context of harsh emotions and scripting. Siegel's strong direction puts an idyllic southern Victorian placement on such heavily garnished photography and puts the couple in a strange way for a very clear and restrained shot. Although the performances are truly commendable and of high quality. Clint Eastwood is a smooth suave, sweet talking chameleon alliance that is very impressive and delightful. Deeply featured, the Geraldine page steals the image when a hardened headmaster and elegant Elizabeth Hartman gently adds sincerity to her innocent character. Mae Mercer is heavily tailored so that the black maid and Jo Ann Harris are a selection of young pupils who are hostile to a clever person. Honestly, while the charismatic character of Eastwood plays the fields of its selfish needs, there are still mixed intentions that are played (where the female race climbs) not better than their guest at the end. Throughout this, the material is bouncing in the dark with a sense of humor and an ironic touch. It is shown here that it is just more than your main violent shocker, but what is tightly layered with the intrigue and the feeling of reality that is hard to shake. This also applies to this very scary title and closing song. <br /> <br /> Effective cooling, a low-key product that is hard to tempt for hospitality.
