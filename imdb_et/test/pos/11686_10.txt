Definitely a conviction today that was needed when looking at high school. This is the great illumination of a punk scene growing in LA in 1980. As the bands play, Spheeris prints the texts in subtitles, which is of course necessary if someone really wants to know what the guy is calling the microphone. But it also changes the camera with POV tourism, passing through this alien world. The band's interviews show an honest approach to music that no longer exists. And again, it's not as easy as $ 16 / month for former church cabinets like Chavez Black Flag. How many unknown bands do you know they're not trying to get a dickens record? These guys just don't care. And who can't love the little French spokesman who used to be the "singer" of the Catholic discipline (of which Phranc was a member). His sharp voice gives one of the best movie images ever captured: "I have great news for the world ... no such thing as New Wave." Whew! What a relief!
