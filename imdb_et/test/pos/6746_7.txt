This is really a dark film. Noir really. The title character is the smallpox that Evelyn Keyes unknowingly brings to New York. <br /> <br /> He is on a mission when he arrives and rougher after he no longer talked to him about his innocent nurse. But he himself is not a deliberate killer. It doesn't mean he won't kill. This does not mean that his presence somewhere between eight million people will not throw the city into confusion. <br /> <br /> Keyes is great. Also supporting cast is very good. Several little-known people, including the director, are involved. Don't let yourself go. This is a movie to be considered! (And how nice to see the Columbia picture. Colombia and the Republic showed wonderful comedies and noises, but we never see them again.)
