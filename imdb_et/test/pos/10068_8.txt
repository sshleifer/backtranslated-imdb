"What's his name?" "Loudon." "Loudon what?" "Clear." <br /> <br /> It's still me twenty years after the movie was released. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie and love it today. I had to look at it hundreds of times and when I bought a DVD recently, I still remember some dialogue. <br /> <br /> Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a young woman imprisoned for a crime, didn't do it. When he goes out, he decides to look for revenge. <br /> <br /> Griffin Dunne (What Happened to Him?) Play a lawyer with his fianc√©e father (John McMartin). The future father asks Loudon for a Nikki prison bus station and make sure he gets on the bus in the expected new public relations program. A seemingly easy task, but there are many complications, a funny dialogue and some really stupid but funny scenes along the way. <br /> <br /> This movie has a stupid voice in this movie that I could see with one or two lines of subtitles, which was incomprehensible to me (so only 8/10), but on the other hand I can't imagine he does it in a normal voice. <br /> <br /> This movie shows Madonna's comic (maybe not on those days) and she's really funny about that role. Dunne makes an excellent foil, while Haviland Morris is perfect as hostility. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is predictable, yes, jokes can be better, but I think it's a great movie and is happy to sit and watch it 100 times more.
