I went to watch this movie because Joaquim de Almeida was in it. Joaquim had a rather small part, so it was good that I liked the film myself. Actually, I liked it a lot! <br /> <br /> The film focuses on two characters, Albert and Louie. Albert is a shy, retired breed and Louie ... is not Louie. The story revolves around Louie's request to Albert to allow him to come back to Albert shortly. Louie has just come out of prison. <br /> <br /> Albert and Louie have known each other from childhood, and of course, when they do something together, they are in trouble and that is Albert, who always falls. <br /> <br /> The film's action is based on the adventures of Louie's visit. On Run is a chronicle of mad-cap, zany, situations. But Bruno de Almeida and screenwriter Joseph Minion (after hours) will not always take you where you go. The depth of this film adds to the turns. Of course, there are a lot of direct comedies, but here's a lot more subtle humor. <br /> <br /> Here are some good results. Albert plays wonderfully Michael Imperioli. He is well known in the HBO series The Sopranos. <br /> <br /> Louie plays John Ventimiglia, who admires her character in a lovable, childlike quality. (no matter what he does, you just have to love Louie!). <br /> <br /> Both participants are excellent in their individual notes. With Imperioli you want to hug her and bring her to her mother. Well, you don't know if you should hit him or take him home (and not to Mom!). <p> <br /> <br /> There are also other stand-out shows. Rita's character is played by Drena DeNiro (yes, Robert's daughter). The audience respected him. Talking about the film, it was fun to discuss whether it was their favorite Albert or Louie. But everyone loved Rita! <br /> <br /> Is this movie perfect? No, I can't say that. It was many times when I wanted the director to have a bigger budget. There were some scenes that called for greater budget freedom. (Give this man a decent budget to work together, and I believe you'll see a movie that makes you show up.) <br /> <br /> The final order was a little budget. Yet the budget or budget, the final screen, I think, is a memorable, emotionally effective scene for the talent of the actor and the director. <br /> <br />
