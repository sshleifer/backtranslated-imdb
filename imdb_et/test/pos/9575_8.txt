You know, this movie reminded me of so many people I know, I think that's why I loved this movie so much. I was just laughing on the floor because it had such a serious and documentary feeling, but the dialogue is so fun that you can't help but have a good time. Basically there is a movie about those crazy dog ​​owners who compete at a big show to see who is the best one. It seems that dogs should take this competition seriously, it turns out that the owners are the same crazy. One of the dog owners Megan goes to the hotel manager for almost a series of psycho-killers because he can't find a special bee nerve toy for his dog. <br /> <br /> There is another couple that is just great, Gerry and cookie. It's a complete joke and an attractive woman who is just so lovable. At the beginning of the movie, Gerry describes how many boys' cookies were. Throughout the film his "lovers" see him and even hit him before Gerry! It was easy and fun to see Gerry's look. This whole movie is just a hoot and you can't stop with the recognizable faces that open up. This is a great movie is just fun to watch, I would recommend it very much! Now I have to find a nice way to show it to my friends who are like these couples to see their mirror image. : D <br /> <br /> 8/10
