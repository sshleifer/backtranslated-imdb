I agree that this film was remarkable. The way Jamie Foxx photographed, not only the impression of Ray Charles, but the nature of Ray Charles really made the film. His life made a great story and it is good to say it finally. I also found a great interview with Jamie Foxx about Ernie Manouse's role in InnerVIEWS in KUHT, Houston Channel 8.

The only problem I mentioned with the film is that the style of shaking was occasionally boring, but in the end I think it helped to make the story more realistic and to focus on people, Ray Charles rather than Ray.
