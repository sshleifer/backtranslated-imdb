First of all, I believe that this film is much appreciated by viewers who have actually read Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness," a book that was the literary basis of the film. By saying this, I believe this film is amazing. This is a great war film that does not focus so much on the core and brutality of the Vietnamese conflict, but rather on the psychological path he took to the young, inexperienced "children" who were sent to fight it. Coppola showed a true genius in filmmaking using the story with many visuals. The good thing I felt was definitely about to be. Marlon Brando's participation in the film is what really happened in me. His explanation of Willard at the end of the film rolls you and reveals the cavity of the person you have heard and wanted to see the whole movie. Those who find it to be another war movie must give a detailed overview of all the literary elements associated with this film, because it is of great significance. In my opinion, this is one of the most sculptured and best films ever made.
