This NFBC film was made in the 50's, 60's and 70's for the Montreal Canadian Dynasty. My fifth-grade teacher played this class in her 11th birthday in 1987 and also celebrated my return as a serious face injury in 1986. I've been a 30-year-old Canadian fan of 30 years. On a scale of 1-10, I will give this film 117. All hockey fans should see it because I hope it will be placed in the Toronto Hockey Hall of Fame and shown at the Montreal Bell Center or here in Edmonton, Rex. Watch this movie with your family, it's a great movie. I also recommend the book in French and English. Go to Habs Go.
