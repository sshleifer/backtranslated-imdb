Do you want to know why French and Italian love / hate each other? Would you like a glimpse of history that drives our lives? So, look at the Virzi movie (of course, in the original language) and you can watch the wonderful Monica Bellucci, who finally speaks her mother tongue Citt√† di Castello (Umbria, just on the border of Tuscany). And the rest of the characters talking about Livornese (lovely Sabrina Impacciatore and everyone else). Daniel Auteuil is definitely in Napoleon's shoes. A lot of fun, a real fresco of the Elba Island landscape and a picture of political reasons to kill or leave life (good for all).
