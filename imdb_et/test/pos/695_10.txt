This movie is a reality, World War II submarine was not pure exact science. There were no exact enemy details, there were no precise devices to control the 100% slave. Not all the teams went to battle with their heart and smiled at their call. <br /> <br /> The people who are waiting for "real war" in this movie are extremely disappointed ... that reality would hit your face. <br /> <br /> War is not pure, accurate, people who like to break songs. It is frightened, cold / burned, hungry, desperate people who want to survive. <br /> <br /> "We Dive into Dawn" is a good example of a desperate situation that needs desperate action.
