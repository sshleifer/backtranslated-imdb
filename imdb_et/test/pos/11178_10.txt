It is meant to be a classic before it was even conceptualized. This game deserves all this recognition. At a time when first-person shooters like Quake III Arena and Unreal Tournament are gathering the attention of computer players, graphic adventures are dying. With great pun and humor, the Monkey Island Curse game is enjoyed by all age groups. Life can be improved only after playing the Monkey Curse of Iceland. * prediction * sequel Escape from Monkey Island is already a classic. I guarantee it.
