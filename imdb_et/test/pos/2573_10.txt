This is the first movie I've given in ten years. If ever there was a movie that needed mouthpieces, that's it. $ 4 The box is shameful. People don't know what it is. If you have Blues recognition or just good use of good music, there is a reason to see it alone. How many people knew Jackson could sing, and also the damn good. You can hear books and movies that robbing salvation. Once you see it, you can never forgive the trivial use of such a word. Yes, it is sharp, sexy, home-made truth, weird and your face. Isn't this the best way to see a movie? Those who get their meaning will not stay away from seeing this week.
