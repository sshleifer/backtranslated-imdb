I think FULL ACHIEVEMENTS is a very good TV show and they should do a lot more episodes. This is one of my favorites !!!! It's very funny and it's really good. I say you should give them the opportunity to do more episodes. I know they can and they should !!!! They should add NICKELODEON FULL SAVINGS when they do! I'm sure many people agree with me !!!!! I like the TV show because it's a very good program for our age and it's very funny. I also like COMPLETE SAVAGES because it's not always the same thing and things that happen can be real, unlike other YV programs. When they advertised it, I didn't like that sound, but I looked at it for the first time and I loved it. COMPLETE ACCESS is a great comedy and I miss it on television !!!!!!!!!! I can't compare OBSERVATIONS with other TV series because it's different !!!!
