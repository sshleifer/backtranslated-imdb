Lucasarts has pulled another beauty out of seemingly bottomless bags. If there is a need for further evidence that they are playing the genre of this game, that's it. Before playing the game, there was a little bit of concern about how the writers held the gags after the first two games. Fear was great to wear a little thin. <br /> <br /> Play the game and see how fast these fears are scattered. From the introductory video to Guybrush on the dodgem boat (!), To the finishing stages of fun, jokes go on. I was a big fan of the first two games and other Lucasart works (The Of The Tentacle, Sam & Max, etc.) and it can't deliver quality. You don't have to be disappointed. (Well, I wasn't.)
