I have to admit that I have been a big fan of the almighty David "Hoff" Hasselhoff since he was hit by the 80s "Knight Rider". Is it his extraordinary debut as a libidinous high school basketball player in a cheerfully outraged "Cheerleaders Revenge" or his brilliant image of a striking prince schlocky sci-fi in real "Starcrash", Hoff has proved time and again that he is just terrible (and disgracefully undervalued) actress. Hoff stands out as Gary, a cynical and skeptical photographer who, together with his repressed virgin writer girlfriend Leslie (attractive brunette Leslie Cummings), is studying a saturated, broken haunted hotel located on a remote island off the Massachusetts coast. They do research on witchcraft all the time and the last owner of the hotel was an actor who allegedly practiced magic. While looking at the hotel, there is also a coffee bar. Pretty soon, the mysterious Lady in Black (an effectively frightening Hildegard Knef) will be confused by various people. <br /> <br /> The rest cast Hoff for his money: the perpetually permissive Linda Blair designs her usual charm as a dirty pregnant woman who is going to rule (natch!), the legendary jazz singer Annie Ross slides this butterfly into a sniffing smell (bad Annie winds burning) in life after she has stitched her lips and is hung up in the chimney, and the gorgeous blonde Catherine Hickland faces every buoy as lusty bitch. Fabrizio Laurent's competent direction, an appropriately creepy atmosphere, Gianlorenzo Battaglia's shiny, glossy cinematography (the fluid carrying Steadicam's tracking techniques is especially nice), passionate special effects, Carlo Maria Cordio and Randy Miller's moody shuddery's pooky score and gory sadistic violence are all par. Ultimately, it is the one and only Hoff's immensely dynamic and charismatic presence, which makes this choice a delicious, harsh Italian horror cheese for such a winner: He takes his shirt off (hubba hubba!), Sprayed with blood and - - WARNING: Big * SPOILER * - even will meet pleasantly awfully prematurely. Compiled by someone other than Joe D'Amato, this picture overall rates as good as sleazy fun.
