From the outset, it is obvious from the outset that the waste of playboy Robert Walker has pointed out Farley Granger as an unwelcome companion to a couple of murders. Granger's semi-public figure, he's a tennis project, but not very high. But big enough for him to know that Granger is in love with his wife and wants to get married to Ruth Roman. <br /> <br /> So when they meet on a train with a stranger on one afternoon, Walker knows enough that Granger is at least interesting enough that if two of those who are strangers are committed to killing the other, would be accompanied by their death. Although Granger has been rejected as one of the beautiful things in this film, it is that you can see in the performance that Granger can simply be tempted. <br /> <br /> When Walker kills Laura Elliot's Granger husband, who had two timers and even become a pregnant man, he expects Granger to kill Walker's father so that Walker can inherit the estate. Nowadays, the Walker is called the Trust Baby and is quite malicious. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock, in his career role, was ironically led by Walker in his latest complete film. Walker died next year with most of My Son John. Hitchcock does not make Farley Granger too bad either. <br /> <br /> Of course, when Granger attacks killing people who haven't done anything to him, tension. The foreign train is also characterized by great editing, first in a tennis match, where Granger must complete the game and walk the Walker before the plant evidence accusing Granger of the crime position. And also in this latest excellence fight on the robbed carousel between Walker and Granger. <br /> <br /> On a stranger train, Hitchcock is at its best, it should not be overlooked and should be looked at as a film class editor.
