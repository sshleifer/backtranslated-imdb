This, ladies and gentlemen, is a truly modern B-film. The dialogue is rigid with wood and it is predictable (some decent turns) and the characters remain on most 2D. And more is sure ... charm. WWE wrestler Kane brings to life a man with many sins, sick, twisted monster (although it is somewhat similar to his character that he has been playing for about ten years) and I find it quite amusing when people say it's not for him there is a lot at hand, "but Glen Jacobs is probably a pretty nice guy, so it is in fact. a break for four different killing scenes, honestly go to this movie, thinking you have fun and gorefest, oh this is REQUIRED for gorefest. a fun but pretty bad movie.
