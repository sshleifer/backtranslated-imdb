It was a great movie. It was one "sot-so-nice" outbreak. In addition, there were some very intense (drama) scenes that made it unsuitable for younger viewers because it is still under radar. The exhibition was very enjoyable and touched our family room for an almost perfect landing. It kept the whole family's attention and we were very happy to finish it. <br /> <br /> This movie included spy children, whose youngsters saved the day, but was given a somewhat more credible scenario. The scenes of dreams were first disturbing, but they did a lot to create the plot. Amazing and hi-jinx were also quite amusing. <br /> <br /> We hope you enjoy as much as we did.
