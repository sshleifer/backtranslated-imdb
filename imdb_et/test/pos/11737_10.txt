Cliche's romantic drama film with a very simple plot but very good cinematography and script. The scenario, management and action were also good. The film's flow is sort of manipulative to bring the audience tears through excellent love music and the fact that works, but later after the movie, makes one feel rape in a way. Jones makes his character very memorable and lovable though. The deeper story could have taken this movie to a higher level, but still, the movie is offered by this genre. Watch out for hopeless romanticists, a great love story for a fan, a great soap drama fan, 50's Cinemascope cinematographers and fans of leading actors .....
