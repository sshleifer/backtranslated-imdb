German gate, Stefan rides during the summer holidays in Paris, when he falls to a mysterious young woman he meets in a nice scene in Paris. He then follows the famous Ibiza Island, a hippie joint with Wolf, a man who throws Hitler-Jugend knives, holds bars and hotels and holds Estelle with his thumb under his thumb. A couple trying to escape from Wolf, Stefan gets in touch and jealous of Estelle, who is a living and free spirit. Great photography and music, the plot is quite common for this period, but it's not a movie that's cold and dramatic. Morals are quite strong (he was looking for the sun ...), but I wouldn't say it is a film against drugs, even if it puts drugs into use.
