I didn't expect much when I saw this movie. I was gladly surprised. Although writing was not polished, as some dialogues seemed to be pulled out and burst, the script was shiny. (My favorite line is "Life is like a rich meringue, and I'm a diabetic so I can't enjoy it ...". ) I believe some scenes might have (should have been) longer (and maybe some shorter) .The excessive use of blood was campy, but it seemed worthwhile .... they would have explained what happened. (I don't want to ruin it.) It could have also included the time of the movie, which is "an hour long, how good is it?"
