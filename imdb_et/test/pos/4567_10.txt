Claudine is the film that is the worst representation of the US system. The welfare system was originally created as a springboard for those families who needed this extra hand back on their feet. The film showed a precise description of how the welfare system of a family unit breaks down. In other words, if the father or the male sex is in the lives of women and children, their financial support would be compromised if it were not terminated. The struggles of the poor can be seen all over the world. I would like to see this movie replayed in all stores to rent or buy your library for collection.
