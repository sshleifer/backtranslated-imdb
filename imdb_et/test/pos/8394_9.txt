I'm a big nut nut, but I was disappointed that both went for the wind and the Scarlett mini series is so different. So much of the wind left the movie that was in the book, and they did the same with Scarlett. Both were good movies, but I really liked both books. There were so many characters left from Scarlett and the age of some characters did not match the book. Also, timelines are not suitable. Scarlett realizes that he is on board a ship in Ireland in the Book, but he understands it when he throws himself in the Savannah. Sally has also been designed to be a ridiculous monkey in the book, and the film showed Jean Smart to play with her, who is probably not a ugly woman. First of all, Scarlett is a good movie, and it will help anyone who was disappointed when Gone With The Wind ended to see what might have happened if Margaret Mitchell had lived to write a post.
