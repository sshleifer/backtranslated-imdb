Listening back to the "good old days" of 1971, we can be reminded alive when we treated Charles Chaplin in the cinema all season. It was called by this advertiser when we saw him in someone's old conversation. (We can't remember exactly who it was; either MERV GRIFFIN or WOODY WOODBURY, one or the other!) The guest talked about Sir Charles's career and how his films had been out of circulation since the 1952 ex-exclusion. Little Tramp from Los Estados Unidos as he was an "undesirable alien". (No Schultz, he's not from another planet!) <br /> <br /> CHARLIE was considered "subversive" by his interest and open exploration of various political and economic systems - all since the 20th (and before) anarchist movement, Technocracy from madness to different forms of socialism was a fair game that was discussed at Chaplin's Hollywood parties, which meant, of course, engaging in Soviet style, which we usually call communism. <br /> <br /> CONNECTION Mr Chaplin's inconvenience was confused by a small detail. He had never become an American citizen. <br /> <br /> ANYHOW is enough for this background! <br /> <br /> SUFFICE said in the United States, "Persona Non Gratis". It was high time to get old movies out of mothballs and back to the filming houses. Certainly, it would be a very good forgiveness for us and the abandonment of Americans' quick forgetting. <br /> <br /> This would be a great gesture for a big filmmaker; moreover, Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences had a special respect for Chaplin at the 1972 Oscar show. It would certainly be a tearful, but cheerful package of packages for America to call Charlie back and receive a special Academic Life Award, which has millions of global television audience numbers. <br /> <br /> BESIDES, it would be natural to promote the Chaplin season in the theater! (Remember, Little Tramp was as lively as $ $ man when he was a filmmaker!) The program consisted of MODERN TIMES, CITY LIGHTS, GREAT DICTATOR, MONSEUR VERDOUX, KING YOUNKUS. and finally CHAPLIN REVUE. We remember being very excited to wait for a multi-day film festival. <br /> <br /> In our fair Chicago city, it was booked for Carnegie Theater on Rush Street. The events show up with MODERN TIMES and all others are shown one by one, each staying at any time to satisfy the public's desire to see each picture. Recall that the last schedule was THE CHAPLIN REVUE. <br /> <br /> In RETROSPECT, we look back and want them to have launched REVUE; because there were no doubt legionnaires (much like themselves) who knew very little about their achievements in films except those Keystone, Essanay, and the quiet silent shorts that were shown as a normal feature, so much Kiddy shows the world. Oh, again, no one consulted me! <br /> <br /> CONCENTRATING with today's honored guest film The CHAPLIN REVUE found it was actually three separate pictures; Chaplin (own), live topics and random music (written by Chaplin again) and some lucky talk and serious narration (Ditto, Chaplin.) He opens the procedure by taking advantage of some home theater movies depicting the construction of Chaplin Studio in Hollywood, as well some movies taken from some trial times, showing the director Chaplin the example he wants for a group of participants. <br /> <br /> This segment was well done by the audience and well received. Both humor and exercise in the building were amplified, making them faster. (Trying, of course, building the camera's photographic process with the building. The old trick seems to have been built almost by the buildings. <br /> <br /> These short short amalgams include three Chaplin's short comedies: The First National Pictures, ie 1917â€“1923 The choice was well thought out and gave us many different topics and moods. <br /> <br /> THE FIRST was SHOULDER ARMS (Charles Chaplin Productions First National Pictures, 1918) As the title suggests, this is a World War I story. was published about a month before the 11th of November enemy day, between the comic army gags and the Romantic private sector Chaplin and the French girl (Miss Edna Purviance), which is a quick, physical and old-fashioned tradition that is the enemy's German army laughable. /> <br /> DOWNLOAD A great example of an old celebrity for children and dogs that bring people together, Next movie DOG LIFE (Chaplin Productions / First National, 191 8) monitors Chaplin's trampoline and newly received stray residues in a parallel life. The story of the film includes families, two of them. One Homo Sapiens, one dog, and both of us provide great surprises. <br /> <br /> At the same time, we at THE PILGRIM (Chaplin / First National, 1923) were a good choice to be the finals. It was bright, light and dense. It was an excursion to the western spoof region, this type of comedy has been done by every comedian and team. "Pilgrim" is not a story of its usual Thanksgiving variety; but rather a "guy" or "tenderfoot" who has come out of the West. Tram is not just this man; but his character has escaped Convict, who is mistakenly considered the new clergyman of the western city church! <br /> <br /> Our rating (ie Schultz and me) is ****. (Four Derbies) <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
