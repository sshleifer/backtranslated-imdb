Yes, it seems, and for the most part, he plays like "after school special", a little more to an adult audience, maybe a teen audience. But add Bill Murray (already showing both dramatic and ordinary comedy talents), a nice supporting cast and an unexpected sweet growing and remembering those big or not so big days in the summer camp and you get a warm-hearted, funny, sleeping bag. <br /> <br /> It is a bit too fragrant for you, but it is also one of its charms. When you hear the title "Meatballs" and you see a poster, you are expecting teenage sex, but what you get is a fundamental but sometimes sexy look at these formative years in the summer camp. Honesty and a reminder of the simplest times remind me of the "Christmas Story" I love. The summer camp memories were never so well-known. The only movie I've seen is "Indian Summer", which I love almost as much as "meatballs" and also celebrates Matt Craven. We hope he will finish the trilogy. Perhaps he could come back to "returning meatballs" and bring some fame to the franchise (meatballs 2 to 4 are not like the original classic). <br /> <br /> "Meatballs" is just my Top 10 guilty health all the time (not to blame). It's a great little movie that always smiles at me.
