WOW! Talk about a movie that shares the audience! This is true love or the fact that it is filming. Personally, I really enjoyed it. I noticed that other reviews compare it to Pitch Black - that's for sure, the only thing they have is SAND! People can be real fools. No, this movie is much more like The Thing (how people don't realize they have amazing - they even have the same basic music) There are lots of carpenters, blue collar heroes, sharp humor, endless rolling landscapes full of death, and things are not understood. Perhaps what hinders this movie as a true classic is that it is a tribute to other carpentry. At least Dark Star has something in common. I would like to know how much it really costs? $ 8,000? Is it even possible? Maybe it was based on a short film that cost $ 8,000? But I found myself strangely moved when died in different dudes of space. They are so underestimated that it is like watching documentaries. Having said that, the script is rather dirty and only about half of them can still act and I'm not sure one big captain is one of them. But his gun is ATTENTION! Give her a chance if you like an early carpenter, you can come for it, just don't wait for 2001.
