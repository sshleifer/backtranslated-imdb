We didn't see the movie in our commercial debut, but just stick through it through the DVD. Because of the worst expectations, Hitch has proven to be a pleasant experience for its three principals. Thanks to Andy's tenant's direction, the film has a slight pace, and although it is predictable, comedy has some winning moments. <br /> <br /> Hitch is a kind of "date coordinator" for losers like Albert who is not exactly what could be considered. However, Albert is a real man who, without professional help, would miss the same women. Enter Hitch to prepare him to overcome the obstacles he cannot overcome, and while Albert remains overweight and never gets social grace, he will conquer us because he is real, in sharp contrast to all the voices that make the round in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> The main mistake that most production designers make is how they are untouched by reality when preparing Hollywood films. The apartments where these characters are located are so rare to find that only by the magic of these films can these people live in such places. Apparently, most people in the film have been engaged in fantasy because most of the citizens in the city would kill such fabulous spaces as they show in the movies, not to mention that the people depicted in the film can't afford them. <br /> <br /> Will Smith is a charismatic actor. He has a disarming way of magic without much. The film's surprise, however, is Kevin James, who, as an overweight Albert, not only wins us, but proves that he gets his own scene with Smith. Eva Mendez is Hitch's main interest. In smaller roles we see among others Adam Arkin, Amber Valletta, Michael Rappaport and Phillip Bosco. <br /> <br /> "Hitch" is a fun movie to watch with Andy's tenant inspired driver.
