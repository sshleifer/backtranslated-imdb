Like larger screen letters, when their career has fallen, many have turned to television, where they are likely to secure their reputation for their offspring. An example is Donna Reed. <br /> <br /> I don't think Donna Reed thought Donna Stone was a challenge, not a woman who won an Oscar to play a very different type of eternity. He was definitely better off playing the wife, mother and home Donna Stone after she played Mary Bailey. <br /> <br /> Donna was always beautiful and smart and always helpful with her children and her husband's problems. Carl Betz was not an idiot, he was a pediatrician whose office was attached to the house. Tell us that a man is never ready in a crisis. <br /> <br /> Although it was a Donna Reed Show, Donna's husband was Tony Owen. But it lasted as long as it was because of the popularity of two children, Shelley Fabares and Paul Petersen. Fabares had the most sold teen record Johnny Angel he introduced at the show. She successfully went to the adult star, the best known for her role as coach Craig T. Nelson. <br /> <br /> But Petersen was a slave in the day. Donna Reed Show dares to say I got most viewers for her. It is now forgotten, but Petersen also had the best sold record, my dad. Didn't do either side or Johnny Angel. <br /> <br /> Now, Paul Petersen is working as a support group for former characters like himself. So many of them end so tragically that he does a good job. The Stone family was a Quintessent of Middle America. They lived in a suburb of Chicago, they led a healthy life. Mother and father were always there for children. Of course, the problems they usually had were not just interrupting intruders. <br /> <br /> This is the series I think was the model of Pleasantville TV, where Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon are sucked. <br /> <br /> I have nice memories of The Donna Reed Show. Easy to take, but not too serious.
