Well, what's wrong with "Private Lies" (accused elsewhere of not being "exciting"). It is cunning, subtle and poetic. (Of course there is a Phil Collins song and a James Belush movie called "Separate Living", which is called here.) But the real point is talking about ethical dilemmas at different levels to film the probes. Okay, it's not a funny title, but it's not a fun movie for your face. Please give British movies this opportunity. They are trying to think people about important things, like here: how far are you going to protect your life (even if it is a bit rotten) against an unexpected disaster. Maybe you're talking wrong. Maybe you ignore the lies of your loved ones. It can carry a lot of people. <br /> <br /> American movies on this topic are rich, but they usually go a long way, involving firearms that are not part of everyday life in Europe. <br /> <br /> Maybe we are not so "exciting" here, but we do not expect slogan-like films for those films that are not targeted at the general public.
