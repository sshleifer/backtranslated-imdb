I was fortunate enough to see the last stop I live at the Moving Pictures Film Festival (for those who don't know, the Moving Pictures Film Festival in Canada is a movie that takes place in Canada). Just before the movie started, I was told that it was the premiere of the world and that it was on the edge of the American distribution agreement that added my excitement. <br /> <br /> I am a big horror fan of the movie, and yes, I also love the Scream trilogy. So when I found out that Rose McGowan made ten small Indians, I knew I was in treatment. Rose McGowan was the biggest name of the festival for the actor / actress. <br /> <br /> The best way to describe it without getting too much of it is because it is not quite like Scream. And it's definitely worth it. It's set in the middle of the snowstorms (filmed in Vancouver, B.C., Canada) in a mountain motel that adds a touch. Rose McGowan makes a great result as a girl-neighbor (?!) With the rest of the pain. And what ultimately happens is the only thing I say is that you never end up. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is probably not the case in North American theaters. because the only decent money maker is Rose McGowan. But if you have the opportunity to see it, I would recommend doing so. And if worse is the worst, there is always a video. <br /> <br /> I gave it to 10 out of 10.
