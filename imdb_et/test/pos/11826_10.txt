And I don't understand why the show shows so much beating. In my opinion, this exhibition is really great. The first two episodes were not so big, but in the third episode, it is gaining momentum. What seems to be typical of Steve Moffat's sitcom. I would appreciate this among the best UK sitcoms. <br /> <br /> The show itself is the best farce, it's not Fawlty Towers, but it's definitely as high as Black Adder, Coupling or The Young Ones! I look at the first season, and all I can say is that I'm happy when I bought a DVD! <br /> <br /> The problem is likely to be with this show and why it was so hard on the Internet that the original press release compared it to Fawlty Towers and everyone was disappointed not! Well, even Green Wing is closer to Fawlty Towers than this show, all I can say is clear from any prejudice, at least run until the show (including episode 3) and then decide for yourself! <br /> <br /> All I can say is thanks to Steve Moffat for writing it and thanking all the staff who pulled it out!
