"The Journey" is a romantic version of the Cold War. An English woman (Deborah Kerr) tries to bring her former love, a Hungarian scholar (Jason Robards, Jr.) into smuggling from Hungary in 1956 during the Hungarian rebellion. He is on a bus with thirteen other international residents. to leave Hungary via the Austrian border. <br /> <br /> Of course, the Russians stop for a bus security check. The responsible Russian officer (Yul Brynner) is interested in an English woman (Deborah Kerr) and is staying. Of course, the Russian officer knows the truth about a Hungarian scientist who is a British citizen, but he decides not to arrest a scientist because he expects the English woman to come to him. Of course, it all sounds absurd, but it's a fun movie to watch. Despite the romantic dialogue between Mr Brynner and Mrs Kerri, which seems to be inappropriate in the situation where they are, the film has become tense and interesting. Some foolish dialogues exceed good deeds. Maybe some Hungarian people involved in the insurgency do not understand this film; they would be a fluffy piece. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite Yul Brynner role. He speaks with his own, male voice and is very attractive, especially when he becomes vulnerable. This is Deborah Kerr's second time working with Yul Brynner as they made a king and a man in 1956. They make a very attractive pair. Too bad they didn't work again. It was another sexy role that Mrs Kerr took "From here to eternity". Despite the fact that Mrs Kerr wore heavy winter clothes throughout the film, she was very beautiful and sensual. <br /> <br /> Jason Robards, Jr. Some international castings were recognizable, such as Robert Morley from England. But the rest of the participants I have never seen or seen since then were very good in the film. It was fun to see in the background that Senta Berger is one of the servants in a few lines of Hungarian. A few years later, in 1966, he was in the film "Cast a Giant Shadow" with a leading lady, Yul Brynner. He's still working today.
