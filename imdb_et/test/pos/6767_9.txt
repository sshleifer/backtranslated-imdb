OK, so I'm not usually one that runs out and rents foreign movies ... especially foreign dark comedies. I think I can count on the number of movies I found to be really fun from start to finish. This movie will be added to the shortlist. Even the dark comedies out of Hollywood sometimes turn me off because they need an incredibly dry sense of humor. But it was my eyes tears. My sides hurt. I haven't laughed at that for a long time. This movie was suggested by my mother and I don't think I'd even have dreamed of watching it if she hadn't talked about it. Don't be afraid to read your movie while you read - you won't leave a terribly well-behaved flick.
