Warner Brothers produced this 3D extravaganza, the biggest commercial success for the West in 1953. Guy Madison controls a group of guards soldiers and clutter to save two white women kept by the Indians. The 3D format was in its early stages as a Hollywood trick to compete with the growing popularity of home TV, and the effect works very well here. The rescuers leave with the ladies and continue with the Indians until the white men are standing in the stream bed on the island. Indian guns come between the audience all the time, and the spray of tobacco juice directed at the rattler is thrown for good measurement. Madison was quite popular as Wild Bill Hickock on television, and it is a good displaced animal husband to whom the army has given his ungrateful task. For the entire film's polishing and presentation, the film was made in just three days.
