The story of this game is very outrageous, where it seems that the writers of the game have tried to find ways to justify how character appears in certain parts of the world map in the stories of the soul. That means it's the only grip I have on the game. <br /> <br /> Original FMV is remarkable for breathable and exciting new devices, such as the ability to create and shape your character and your own martial arts discipline. There's even another story mode that makes up the soul story of an awkward story design. <br /> <br /> One part of the breath story of FMV is also interactive, where you can decide on the nature of your character to a degree that is an interesting feature. <br /> <br /> With many character combinations you can create, there are different games that you can explore in the hymns and chronicle mode of the sword game, this game remains for Beatem up / RPG fans amused for some time!
