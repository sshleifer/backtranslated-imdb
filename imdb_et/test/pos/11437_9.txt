This is an enjoyable movie. It's a very realistic "wonderful music world" that I've done and done there. It shows a person's character and reality that no one is perfect. These amateur musicians were not all these bad players. Cleavon Little's character Marshall Tucker played very well. Marshall was not a saint. Here he got a job to do the job, and he gives these men some trouble with what the old one is up there. You don't bite the hands that eat you. I find it hard to believe that a player with his jazz experience claims he doesn't know any dixieland stories. He has a tremendous sense of predicting chords he doesn't know. Not normal, but not audible. At the end of the film he gives a real and harsh message when he tells the clarinet player, "he is not a religion, devotion is not enough." At this level he is right, though I think the clarinet player could have done this job. He practiced his ass and vocal music is not so difficult to read. Very enjoyable movie.
