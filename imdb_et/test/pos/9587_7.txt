Tiny Tweet and Sly thefts are locked in cages to drive a train who knows where. Swinging Tweety begins to grab the inadequate song as soon as the train leaves the station, so I hope Puddy Tad will get it this time. Sly tries a couple of funny hand tricks, but spoil the sportsman man puts the bird in luggage in a safer place. The next attempt by the cat is that he reaches the steam engine for coal. And chasing is on. Of course there is a bulldog, and silly Sly just can't keep her mouth shut. <br /> <br /> In the following, a persistent pussy will try out old suitcases-bits (twice) that will produce a salary for Tex Avery would be proud. Unfortunately for Sylvester, it seems that this bulldog is everywhere. She even shows her back level to change her talent shape and produce huge clubs. Even Sylvester's ability to cross the speeding train does not save him when he is thrown down in the Silver Streak style, many times in a row. Coming to a grandmother's new place (Gower Gulch, population 86), the cat's final test is associated with a rectangle. But you know what happens to men in dress, they always get more attention than they wanted. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
