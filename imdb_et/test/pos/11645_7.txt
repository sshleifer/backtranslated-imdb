Before seeing this film, I suggest that the viewer take away all expectations that victims of the crimes depicted will receive equal treatment and discretion as a criminal. There have been many films about crime victims. It's related to a murderer. <br /> <br /> The "dead man" finds the story realistic: there are no explosive agencies to save William Poncelet and no dramatic stories. The film does not try to put him in good light; he is guilty, he is reluctant, is racist and was responsible for the terrible murders. With all this in mind, we are asked to do something very difficult: look at him as a human being, despite his crimes. In this way, the idea of ​​the film is that the death penalty foresees "justice". Whether you are against the death penalty or against it, the film raises the question of whether it is possible to find redemption, inequality in the judiciary, and the relevance of the death penalty. <br /> <br /> Both Susan Sarandon's Great Performances and Sean Penn. In particular, the latest moments of the film show the real depth of Penn's ability.
