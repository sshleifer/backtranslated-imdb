David Cronenberg, like my colleague David Lynch, has a taste. A director who plays topics such as reality, perversion, sex, insanity and death is bound to get the most extreme solutions from the audience. He proved it with movies like a flight, naked lunch, crash and eXitenZ (capital X, capital Z) and recently Spider. It is best to see the clear mind of eXistenZ. Try not to read too much of the plot, or destroy it for you. I can tell you that Cronenberg takes you through the world of video games, which acts as a metaphor for any escapist behavior. Living fantasies is what people always dream of, but how far can you go inside before reality becomes cloudy and fantasy takes over and becomes horror? These are the topics that concern eXistenZ, the study of identity, the human psyche, the physical bodies that diseases are invading and, most importantly, the reality. <br /> <br /> The story and leadership are excellent. Cronenberg knows his trade very well and successfully manages the artificial world, avoiding the usual pitfalls and clich√©s like such stories. The film shows quite nasty things, but is unusually low in the Gore department, compared to Cronenbergs' other work. Such impact effects are never up and the plot progress is very intelligent and creative. It is never the most intellectual film, but it leaves you thinking, thinking and quite confused. <br /> <br /> The actress also gets two thumbs. Both main characters, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law, play their parts perfectly and intelligently depict the changing moods and identities of their character. The dialogue may sometimes look a bit outdated and clinical, but it is part of the impact Cronenberg was going to make to create a calm and unfamiliar atmosphere that makes you quite restless. Supporting actors such as Ian Holm, Don McKellar, and especially the horrible Willem Dafoe, the film is even more annoying with familiar shows. bleeding images and existentially twisting story, you love it.
