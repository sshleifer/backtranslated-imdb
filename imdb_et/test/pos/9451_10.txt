It was a fantastically written scenario when it comes to things from a different perspective. Comedy was timely and not superfluous, acting generally was terrible, and the plot line was more of a purpose to create misconceptions than we think of people only on the basis of their appearance. Because of the plot's twists and turns, the brother / sister of Amanda Bynes tries to play football with the boys' team, finding a new love interest instead. Tatum Channing is a place where there is a real misconception, and he will gladly start work at first, who will not care later, and later realize that friendship is the most important thing in life, not attitude.
