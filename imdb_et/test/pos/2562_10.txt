Initially I was rented this movie because of the DVD disc art. It actually happened to my friends who didn't rent it because of the art and the mental image (s) he represented as a movie that didn't interest me (or my friends). But I rented it and watched it and was really surprised. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comments of another user that this movie is not for everyone thanks to blatant sexual conclusions, so this is certainly not something I would like toddlers to look at (and seriously question if they still understand it) . Teasers show that they turn out to be bad. Acting ... did it work? Ricci and Jackson performed so well, this film was not even drawn to realize they were acting. The same thing story ... may seem somewhat drawn, but it did so very, very well. It reminded me of another film with Mel Gibson, Tim, where every character had limitations, whether they were spiritual or indirect, so they were precisely defined. I feel that everyone involved (from cameramen to actresses) should be praised for their excellent fit / outcome. After watching this movie, I was talking to a couple of friends who had a negative approach to watching it, as I did, so after listening to their comments they had rented and watched it. They were also surprised how good it was. It is too bad that the jacket is made as it was because it is off. I see now how art works, but I never heard about this movie and art was my first impression ... art sells or destroys DVD sales / rentals. <br /> <br /> These characters were given them more depth and good timing to give such an audience a time like me to feel to everyone. I felt that I could trust the film smoothly and did it. So, if the jacket is gone, I would recommend watching this movie.
