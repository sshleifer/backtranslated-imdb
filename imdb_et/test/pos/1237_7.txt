Adapted from Sam Shepard, this film retains many playful elements, such as a relatively fixed device (50-member road motel in the southwest) and extensive, intriguing dialogues. The "May" woman is called "Eddie" (played by Sam Shepard). She tries to hide her in a hidden motel, but she finds her. The film examines their relationship, mainly from their childhood, which has led them to date. It is very easy to feel sympathy with the characters and to understand that their dysfunctional current relationships are due to their past. We mainly follow them to fight, form, fight, offset and so on. One picture that stands out in my eyes is grabbing Eddie over Mayi's shoulder struggle and screaming, taking him somewhere he doesn't want to go. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also the perfect spiritual state, with the vocals of lesser-known artist Sandy Rogers. He's the voice of the country that is almost anywhere on the album! This is a movie that is part of your brain / soul. In other words, look at it!
