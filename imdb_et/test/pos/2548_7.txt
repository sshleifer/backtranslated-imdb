It cannot be said that it was not done well. At a recent film festival, the director admitted that some scenes took 30 days. And there is no slightest reference he did not get exactly what he wanted. But this is a strange non-Spanish film, as the West Side Story was many years ago. Both leaders, the brother-sister team, are excellent and memorable in their parts. The underground car repair area in Queens is completely unfamiliar to most people and is worth the price. But the key issue of the film is something unsatisfactory, namely what the sister must do to get. I understand the brother's reaction, but it just seems to me too easy. The film seems to suggest that such people do not need our help to find a way to survive without the usual support systems. I don't encourage anyone to believe. Here is much greater resistance to the choices made here than depicted. Other than entertainment, it works well. I think the exact image of culture, not so well.
