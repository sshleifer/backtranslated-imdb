Don't listen to most of these people. badly gives you a better view of this movie, which I and my friend love! It's about Jill Johnson played by Camilla Belle, who's a nanny in the Mendrakis house and someone is breaking in. If you don't know how he got to the house, he probably went through the garage. anyway, don't listen to the "worst action". it's amazing. with a great story. I think Jill has two benefits. 1. He is a fast runner and has a track team. 2. He was alive! it's a cool movie and pretty scary. check it out, you're happy with this masterpiece. don't listen to other people on the site. its very good. trust me, i'm good at watching movies. I'm a future critic. I want to buy this movie completely. and you also when you see it. it is amazingly fantastic.
