It is interesting to see how this film depicts the society of the 1950s. Men have one-on-one entertainment, chain smoking buffers (time hasn't changed so much, but "sexual harassment") and women are at work only over time until they find a husband and live. Some are worthy of dialogue, but at the same time it's charming and passive. I love opening credits that show a romantic and exciting view of Manhattan, where Johnny Mathis sings on "The Best Of Everything". I want to jump right into a scene shot by N.Y. on the streets, around 1959 and experiencing the time I've only seen on film and photos. Some of the scenes in this movie reminded me of Melanie Griffith's "Girl". Especially when Hope Lange (who crosses Grace Kelly & Dolores Hart) is bombed in a beautiful Stephen Boyd apartment, she puts her in and just looks at her bedroom (like Melanie, she wants to know if something happened the next day). Joan Crawford is definitely comparable to Sigourney Weaver's dreadful female boss, except when he was outwardly nasty (with a soft core), but Sigourney's character was sweet from the outside and horrible from the inside. I found it anxious how Suzy Parker's character (Gregg ) started acting as an independent woman's career as an actor who allegedly did not need to complete her. She becomes a stalker / lunatic / walnut when she lets her fall in love with her bananas after she's done with her. rumor, your thickness with a New Yawk accent If you like movies like "The Valley of Dolls" then you like it.
