Some people have been born with mourning that the song has sung separately until they come into contact with another soul as tortured and / or bitterly sweet when their own and unusual magic happens. YOUR ONE is brutally honest to explore the two tortured souls that are intertwined for a moment in understanding and unity, so that they leave each other out of their unity. Death is studied figuratively and literally. This happens when the soul is dead or alive too alive, also awake to reality. This is the life you imagined behind the eyes of passers-by. This film explores the pain of all of us, the painful excitement under the facade, the pain below. The unsightly instinctive creative thoughts and actions become honest and factual, and then Bechard blurs unexpected innocence and beauty. Writer Bechard is an expert in the human situation, and because of his non-judicial attitude, he presents life in the light that we often protect our eyes, but longing to see and understand. He, the director, focuses on the nuances of the spirit of the participants, which appear through the character they play on the personal knowledge of the actors in relation to the emotions created by each situation. This is the most accurate written and directed character of the experience of man and woman that I have encountered, although two characters are probably not a "normal" meeting. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack encapsulates every song lyrics what characters let their hearts drain out if possible and strong enough. Every character's voice sounds through the beauty, pain, talent and emotional intelligence of new indie artists ready to explode in the alternative music market. Perfect sound for those who have problems - us who admit that we have problems and those who hide it. <br /> <br /> I always enjoy studying the dark side with Mr. Bechard with such an exciting creative and realistic view of life and the characters in it.
