Fado is the sad black blues of Portuguese gypsy music, repeatedly heard through the film. As one of the main signs (Igor) explains, it also means destiny. <br /> <br /> Indeed, this is a fate that brings together the two main characters Paco and Alex and launches the following problems. <br /> <br Generally, I enjoyed it quite a bit. It starts with the drama / journey movie "Down and Out" based on a temporary thriller / tefilm. <br /> <br /> There were two things I found unrealistic, which kept me from giving up (I gave it to 8). The first is the main point why Alex gave up. He was so desperate for the money that he sold his passport for an evil amount and then he gave thousands to the strangers a value? His explanation was not convincing. How did they go through the gate, where were the police officers?
