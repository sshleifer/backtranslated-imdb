... but you've probably seen it or else you wouldn't be here. It's so hidden that you probably stumbled like I did, because this little known pearl doesn't get word of mouth. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, you know how the story shakes, but looks at how our innocent redhead sister puts puzzle pieces together for quality entertainment. Most horror films bombard viewers with graphical images of torture, but don't look in the basement finely, which makes for a great distance. Note to horror filmmakers: some of us are like a nuance! A cute and homely sister Charlotte is recruited in a sanatorium, but she is frightened when she learns that her chief doctor was unhappy and now she is a mysterious doctor who we all know is not a doctor at all. The interplay has been built through the spread of Charlotte events with the help of many patients, but which patients can trust Charlotte? It's a pearl and my absolute favorite TRUE HORROR film. I love Re-Animator and Evil Dead, but they play more against the HORROR-COMEDY crowd. <br /> <br /> VALUE: $$$ (amazing fear of standards, but the whole movie has a good spanking. Open scene is classic, no other horror film will start better and eventually a fair share of gore). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$$$ (likes to fall in love with Allyson (Betty Chandler) spends a lot of time naked trying to attract half of men in sanitary care, Betty Chandler is a knockout and I'm shocked that it's her only movie credit). <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ $$ (The story is well handled, despite the premise that Hollywood has a lot of mileage). The script has the ability to create a distance and never puts poor Charlotte in a precarious situation.) <br /> <br /> DOING: $ $ $$ $$ (Betty Chandler is doing Allyson's best job of capturing dementia in an insignificant form. great considering the facts before he reached the verdict, while Rosie H's existence like Charlotte gives a real result when you feel about your character.
