Gerry Anderson's first lifestyle, featuring big movie films that offers incredible FX models and an excellent Barry Gray music score. Reel-to-reel analog computers, far from "2069" (I think Anderson really wanted a 100-year secure date!), It's a bunch to see, like a guru-jacket fashion, but could just blame 2001 for the same violation, but no one could have foreseen some things when they turned out. This film was a springboard for the next year's UFO series, and in fact they were not just the same people and producers of FX, but many of them were decent at this show. <br /> <br /> It's always like an "alternative history" of the future more than anything else - the "Apollo-like" rocket that is used in the elevator, always seems like it's really another planet than the earth. Given the "alternative land", one would expect that it was the feeling they wanted. We end up giving more questions than answers. Because there is a "second country", every movement, event, and thing that is said is duplicated when it happens in both worlds. The two variants of the same person (in this case, Glenn Ross, astronaut) can never meet between giving it and the sun. The complete accident discovered the planet first if it would probably have been forever hidden. <br /> <br /> Filmed mainly in Portugal with FX work in England, it's a must for any Gerry Anderson fan. I have a few years ago Image Bare Bones DVD, but one of the hopes that Universal will release it again, maybe the extras and even Gerry Anderson's comment.
