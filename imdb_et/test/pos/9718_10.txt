Jim Henson always seemed to be outstanding television shows. Unfortunately, this was one of the shortest lives. It was pleasant to hear every story with its pleasant morality. Each episode was a new story with new characters. John Hurt did an excellent job of playing a storyteller, and Brian Henson's sarcastic tone when the dog was always enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Sets and costumes were well done. Muppet is classic Jim Henson's work, if necessary. You know it's Muppet, but it's a loving look more than forgiving. You'll find yourself fascinated and forced. When every episode ends, you realize that you were quite entertaining. Entertaining that fills up, not what it takes in a few moments. You sit back and think about each episode, knowing that every story is really timeless and gives a strong tale of morality. <br /> <br /> I haven't shown it to my kids yet, but it's really a series that's more than family entertainment. I ask you to find it on a DVD and pull it up. If you can't do that, just find out how.
