Italy's work is a real blast. It's a really entertaining movie that you just look at for enjoying it. It is not difficult for drama or emotional delivery, it has no cosmic statements about life and is neither violent nor silly. It's just a fun movie. Looking at the small Mini Coopers to fly between LA's crowded streets and the big bits that the stereotypical computer-geek-turned-bunch (played by Seth Greene gleefully), I had a great time watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Special praise for background music. They put a really masterful tone on such a film, so fine, but it keeps you on the edge if necessary. Apparently, a lot of artists contributed to the music, I found it to be the toughest part of the film. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. bad day in the office. <br /> <br /> Barky
