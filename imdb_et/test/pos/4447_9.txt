What a surprise this movie was. I've seen good Fulci horrors and zombie beats and surprised that this was done by the same director. He also wrote a screen game that shows that the captain is able to handle a detailed story in detail. Copying this is not good, but far from a terrible slope that only prevents later ones like "Manhattan Baby". A strange, almost futuristic road appears on the whole film, which focuses on a small town where young boys are murdered. The scene of beating the woman is uncomfortable to look at, but refreshing compared to the usual cinema violence. <br /> <br /> What went wrong with Lucio? Perhaps there is a strong case that indicates that he had reached the top of this film, and it went down slowly.
