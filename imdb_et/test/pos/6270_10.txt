The Ator series is a brilliant example of what B movies should be. They fail in every aspect, but so much fun that they are rather funny than sad. "Ator l'invincibile 2" or "Blade Master" or "Cave Dwellers" shows us Europe's favorite Conan clone, Ator, where we left him on the first movie - after we show us all the events of the first movie. This time, the world has to save "Nucleus", a bomb that is light on the screen (I think they couldn't afford it). It has invisible attackers and samurai. As with the first movie, a lot of film material is used (including one pretty obvious "Star Wars"). Greatly ridiculous and unforgettably bad - this is a B-film exception.
