I never heard of this Aussie horror before Michael Elliott's enthusiastic review; In fact, after reading it, I decided to check if the DVD was available at my local rental point and it was (although it is a German edition, which means the R1 annexes), so I decided to check the movie immediately. <br /> <br /> Although I don't go so far as to give her perfect characters? just some of the headlines get me out, not to mention the dusky modern flick? I have to say I was impressed by the impressive BLACK WATER. Instead of looking back at previous crocodile films like ALLIGATOR (1980) and LAKE PLACID (1999), it creates two memories that saw a small group of people going on a trip, getting lost and graciously finding the place's elements and creatures? namely LONG WEEKEND (1978), especially the little known but impressive Australian production and OPEN WATER (2005). <br /> <br /> The compact, simply drawn film includes a couple and a younger sister who decide to fish far away and forbid part of the Australian desert, known as the Crocodile Territory; very soon (before even 15 minutes have passed!) their boat is covered and the alligator dies? so our unhappy adventures overshadow the tree. DVD Talc reviewer believes that film will spend too much time during this time? With the three statements they should make, they try to look back at the boat, looking through the tree jungle (only to cope with water) and repeatedly attack the monster. However, I think that the makers take the situation as far as it goes without slipping into tidium: this is due to an ambitious gap and, as Michael said, the disbelief of the characters (especially the two women), but also the fact. that the crocodile makes one of the most frightening and memorable of today's memory (I don't know how they do it)! <br /> <br /> Do I also agree with Mike that the film contains some really effective moments of shock? the alligator jumped out of the water to bite the bullied heroes; this head unexpectedly before the woman when they do for the boat; although one of them reaches the vehicle, the monster can lift his massive weight and get into the boat! Finally, if the same girl can find a weapon (confusing her guide), load it and wait for the alligator to appear, the latter slips behind her (by the way, the creature is attributed to shark-burning JAWS [1975]). With this in mind, is the finals the same as the crowd (though clearly smaller) than the classic Spielberg explosive? even if it is a sharp follow-up. Another definite asset is the lack of film? which is generally pretty cute but becomes nervous for the right moment. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, the BLACK WATER breathes fresh air into a demoralizing decline in which the cinema of fear is late; for this reason alone, it deserves greater exposure to remind us that there is still hope for our beloved genre (without the real need to turn CLOVERFIELD [2008] out of focus to draw attention)?
