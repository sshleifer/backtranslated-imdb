Having grown up with GWTW, I drove both the "Scarlett" sequel and the mini series. When I first watched the video, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed depicting Timothy Dalton's Rhett Butler and Joanne Walley-Kilmer's Scarlet. I feel that "Scarlet" should be judged rather than to try to compare any of the honorable Selznick masterpiece GWTW. While the story of "Scarlet" and some of the dialogues suffered due to the lack of an inspired letter, I generally thought it was worth dramatizing what might have been between Scarlett and Rhett.
