It was an interesting film ... half comedy, semi-political thriller. It had many good elements, although it was a little predictable. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams marks Tom Dobbs, a popular comedian who has hit a show where he gives political comments. Think about everyday life with John Stuart. During the recording of one of his exhibitions, the audience's wife tells her that she should lead. That followed by some serious jokes was all that was needed to roll the ball and start the Dobbs political career. <br /> <br /> He runs independently and equally against democratic and Republicans. He is simple and honest and is becoming more popular, but perhaps not popular enough to actually win. He is clearly the basis for the elections. In the meantime, a corrupt software company has created a program that makes voting for ordinary citizens much quicker and easier, but there is a disorder. This disorder is discovered by a young lady named Elanor (Linnley), who is attracted by the software developer with a lie that she confirmed the alarm before the upcoming elections. <br /> <br /> The election day is over and look, look, Dobbs is declared the winner. (Big surprise!) Elanor knows he's not really president - he didn't win legally - He decides to tell the president ... but complications arise. His company went as far as poisoning him to silence him. In addition, he quickly likes Dobbs. <br /> <br /> The plot has a couple of revolutions before it is a little predictable. But it's never boring. Robin was nice, as usual, and Christopher Walken often stole an exhibition from a Dobbs leader-turned political advisor and best friend. <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie with a good message. I recommend this if you are in a dark satire or something that makes you think. Generally I give him 7/10.
