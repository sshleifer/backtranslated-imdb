My first Mami movie saw it in the IFC for a long time and loved it. It seemed completely artistic, original, fun and fun. No moment from the film left me and did not make me eternal and I laughed a lot or had a smile on my face. I mean, this movie is really funny. But here's the catch: it's also artistic and creative - if you don't know Yuri Mamin (apparently unfortunately, because so many of her big movies aren't available here), she has a very original style, like anyone else, and that's not for me even my favorite movie (just this is crazy ("Saideburns / Bakenbardy"). I also have to say that as a Russian language this movie is very good because you really see what the Russians are. And this is possible because it is a real Russian film for me , NOT a foreign film trying to be an American or trying to file a complaint, Mamin doesn't sell it (and since then he hasn't been so good, if not better, from Gorko (1998). It is a real Russian-style filming that came out of communist society. Realism. <br /> <br /> If you liked this movie, I think you have a great chance to love Mamini's other movies, and I think it's the most accessible movie, like a fountain that takes 6 years before perestroika the same actor in leading role and more Mamini traditional people you know between Windows and Paris; it has one supernatural twist, but it is mostly realistic comedy, great. Viva Mamin, Hopefully Criterion sets all your movies up for one day, she's still working and her directory is so big! Watch your movies when you can.
