A strange but acceptable mobile comedy with an embedded FBI agent (Matthew Modine) flirting with a mobile-related widow (Michelle Pfeffier) ​​to link two murders to a difficult-to-understand mob leader (Dean Stockwell). <br /> <br /> The film says he doesn't have to go over the top to be funny and director Jonathan Demme ("Sheep Silence", "Philadelphia") keeps the movie so that it is not as restrained. It is good and also avoids predictability.
