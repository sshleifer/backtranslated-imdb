I always loved French movies because I think they are full of more emotions and thinking than Americans. This film is a pearl. <br /> <br /> Starting from a wedding that is so funny that you just want to join them and finally, when the little kids of the family tell us who is with who is extremely funny. Catherine Deneuve is just hot and so good that it is quite possible for a young man to fall in love with him and Vincen Lindon is ideal for this role. The best scene (except for a wedding party) is at a family reunion where Antoine is crazy and screams her feelings towards Lea before the family. It's a shame that I can only buy this movie from French, not English (so I have to learn French to watch it)!
