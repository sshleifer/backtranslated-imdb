.. is a princess bride meets ... well Trainspotting. But wait, it's a good combination! It was definitely one of the best films I've seen for a long time ... it's a funny dialogue that I associate with Princess Bride or a cemetery man, as well as horror film violence. The heroic feeling of Princess Bride (this is odd) is the lack of really good boys she had at Trainspotting. <br /> <br /> I am not saying it was as good as a princess's bride, but it was in the arena and it shook. Some dialogues are pleasantly brilliant, the plot is interesting, the characters - albeit slightly anachronistic - are by nature not anachronistic (in the 18th century, homosexual people were resistant, contrary to the comments of the previous reviewer), but just the language they used. Anacronisms made it fun and not chewy and easy to lay off. <br /> <br /> If you've ever read any of the Garrett series by Simon R. Green or Gleen Cook, you know exactly what this movie is. Look at it. That's great.
