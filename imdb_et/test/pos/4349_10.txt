I think this is for sure. Writing is of such quality that English primary school students should model their dialogue after the dialogue. For example, the exchange between Paul Kersey (Bronson) and Mrs Kathryn Davis (Deborah Raffin) (more of this character later) is extremely clear and point: Ms. Davis says, "I hope you like chicken. The thing I know how to do," to which Kersey responds, on the contrary: "Chicken good. I like chicken." If it's not English grammar 101, I don't know what it is. <br /> <br /> Another thing about this lady Davis character: Kersey sleeps with her the other day after she practically throws herself at her and tells her she wants to see her "last time" (this is only the fourth time they are never met) before he moves to his sister's house in Binghamton, NY, to go out. then he doesn't even see his body burn in the street in just a few minutes. Kersey never says her name through the whole movie. Not once. Never "Go here, Katy" or "It's a nice dress you wear, Kathryn" or "Be careful, Katie or creeps!" <br /> <br /> And while this "Love" develops between the two, Fraker (Gavan O'Herlihy) always keeps them close. It's almost like Kersey uses her as a feed to get to Fracer when she uses a camera or a car. Of course, when Fraker bites, Kersey bites ... the series of most amazing events ever caught on film! The last fifteen minutes are only competing with the Delta Force in the last thirty minutes for their shine. And it gives Delta Force a lot of credit. In what other movie do you see Ed Lauter from Alex Winter to get Charles Bronson's upside-down, worrying gang leader who seems to be calling neo-Nazi cyclists to come to his aid, and the harsh Broadway dancers who wear meshes in street pants are anything but Jimmy Page. If this is not the highest of the highest comedy, there is nothing funny. <br /> <br /> In fact, thousands of ways Death Wish 3 is an unintentional comedy, but the only way to really understand this is to look at it and judge yourself.
