For an independent film, it is high enough for production values ​​and great pain. Operation is uneven, but the plot is convincing. We could have developed Wes Ramsey's character a little more, but hey, dude is fun to watch!

It is less than a tempting image of the Morman Church and its relationship with gays. Although, like Brokeback Mountain, it is about accepting tolerance and your own life, I found it more successful in delivering a positive message. It was also more mobile.
