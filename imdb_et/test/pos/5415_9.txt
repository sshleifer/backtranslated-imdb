I saw this movie when it was an entry to the Santa Fe Film Festival. Hard movie! The image of a completely dysfunctional family, taken to the other extreme level, could have pushed me to the extreme if it hadn't been very funny through visual disorder and dialogue, which would ease the overall tone of the film. The relatively "exaggerated" end gave hope to those affected by the initial tragedy. However, I did not walk out of the theater, ready to have fun. The film stayed with me for several days. <br /> <br /> Returns memories of "ordinary people", but with tragedy mixed with humor. I thought the action was great, especially Sigourney Weaver and Emile Hirsh. Sometimes every actor involved in the tragedy was sad, self-assertive, and at times fun. Smart Dialogue and Situations.
