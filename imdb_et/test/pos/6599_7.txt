It's a pretty good documentary. I'm not a skateboard, I don't like a particular skateboard or skateboard culture. But somehow within about 2 hours this film was interested in him. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't call it the most interesting movie all the time, but for some reason, when these boys talked about how they started their skateboarding clubs and skated in these tiny South California pools, I was interested. <br /> <br /> I should also add that the music in this movie was also pretty good. I do not sit for longing to hear more of the 70's rock bands, but it seemed appropriate for what they were talking about.
