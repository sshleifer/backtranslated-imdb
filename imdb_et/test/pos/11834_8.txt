"Love and War" is a simple emotional-good TV movie that should be seen as such. <br /> <br /> (Possible Spoiler) <br /> <br /> This is a World War II story of British soldier Newby, imprisoned by his team of Italians and imprisoned in a former orphanage. As the Italians give down to the Allies, the commando is released and tries to escape. At the same time the Germans arrive and the commercials are caught again. Only Newby, injured, remains great. The rest of the film reflects how the partisans are hidden and protected, and his survival. <br /> <br /> End of Spoiler <br /> <br /> The real story of "In Love and War" is a refreshingly simple movie. Half comedy, half romance, the story is simple and unambiguous. "Atmosphere" is warm and sunny, and different stereotypes (desperately unorganized or romantic Italians, serious stubborn Germans and phlegmatic and pragmatic Britons), though unicorn, are still humorous. Nicola Piovan's musical score also adds a Mediterranean flavor. <br /> <br /> Although it is far from being a "road with mussolin" or "La Vita E Bella", "Love and War" is a lovely simple film that makes you smile and maybe even have a little sun on your face.
