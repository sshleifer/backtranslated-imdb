I remember seeing the trailer of this movie when it first appeared and looked pretty cool. I could never see it. When I went to Blockbuster to rent videos, I thought I should watch it. After all, I loved "The Silence of Lambs" and "Se7en", and if you liked these movies, you could get "The Cell". The whole story is very interesting. I cannot imagine going into the world of living in the sense of physically murdering. Operation is actually pretty decent. Jennifer Lopez is the only thing I have to say is that it wasn't that big, but she does a credible job. I would recommend a scary thriller. <br /> <br /> 7/10
