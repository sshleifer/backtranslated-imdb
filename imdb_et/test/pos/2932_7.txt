I mean, let's face it, everything you need to do in modeling is for photos. The judge is over-critical. But the show is fun, especially Tyra Banks, Nigel Barker, J Alexander, and the supermodel itself Twiggy. I watched the season 5, 6, 7 and 8 in the middle of the season. It seems that American Idol has gone sexy, but I'm a man and I look at it just because hot girls put their bikinis! The exhibition can be quite boring when it comes to decision-making, Tire tends to move on and on, and it's really set off. Anyway, would I recommend it? Yes, would I recommend it to women who want to go to a modeling company? No.
