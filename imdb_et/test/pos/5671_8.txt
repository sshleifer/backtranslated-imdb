I found this movie quite brilliant. Initially, I wanted "when animals attack" "frankenfish" or even "rogue", but they were given a truly terrible ordeal that was not human. Having been in those areas where it was made (including the beginning of the movie, even sharing the same guide!), It was added to the fear factor. These crocs are indeed everywhere there, although I don't think they had this beastie "attitude". Yes, there were some melodramatic moments, but they helped to disturb the whole atmosphere. I take care of the real characters and despise the reflection, "what would I do?" in your boat. I don't know where your enemy was or the night of the crochet sound was really scary. I would say that this flick is one of the best horrors I've seen for years (near descent). I'll give her four alligator handbags.
