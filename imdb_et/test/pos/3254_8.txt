Having seen and loved this movie in Australia, I was very interested in copying caves. I have one DVD back in the UK to find that this is a very different edit. <br /> <br /> The domestic Australian editing I saw is snappier. United Kingdom and I assume that Europeans will make much more of Jimmy's dead brother's narrator. And really belabours it and some other points don't give real benefits. <br /> <br /> This is not a serious criticism, but Oz editing is just stronger and I think it's more sure. <br /> <br /> Can't say why they thought it was necessary to expand overseas markets? <br /> <br /> One you go. <br /> <br /> I went to both sides.
