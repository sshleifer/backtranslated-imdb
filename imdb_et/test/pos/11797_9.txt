At more than one level, I can relate to it in a very personal way. And all I can say is that it's true what Dexter's mother says to Eric at the end of the story: he actually "cured" his son, taking away his sad feelings and loneliness. <br /> <br /> This film highlights the philosophy I very much agree with. We all die one day sooner or later. Finally, this is not the time we live, but the fun / good times / happiness we have at that time. It does not mean quantity but quality. <br /> <br /> I think all the other words used here will keep you from seeing this movie unless you have already done so. I would really like to see it published on DVD. It will definitely be added to my "all time classic"!
