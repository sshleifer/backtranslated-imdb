All the people who voted a little on this movie 1 are all I have to say: You are not mature enough to enjoy such a cinema. There is a certain commitment to achieving this level. And this is the segment of people to whom this film was directed. Not your average filmmaker opportunity! . Back to the movie. It was quite right and definitely included in the Bollywood Hall of Fame. I'd give him # 2 all the time, just crossing the legendary Gunda of Kanti Shah. This film had an impeccable story and created a beautiful mix of fantasy and sci-fi. Pan's Labyrinth would actually have shattered the balance created between parallel stories. And now I really need to mention their letters and even the stars (this is the word NOW) about them (a special note goes to Mr Nigam on his best debut on any film on this land). All of the actors in this movie were very carefully selected and their role was adapted to them (and they must be added to their age). Manisha Koirala still looks like his 18-year-old man and with this figure I would have raped. Don't you know where this rape suddenly came from? Yes, rape is the basis of the premises of this film. And it's not like your average Bollywood-type movie. If you are an atheist or agnostic, this movie is back for you. Because this film can heal your faith. I don't think it would have been too far from saying that this film could cure cancer. Only the people who need it most are not able to appreciate their power, charm and unpleasant beauty. Tchch, so unfortunate! <br /> <br /> The only mistake in this movie: Your dreams, baby! It was flawless. <br /> <br /> Only a small complaint: the director could not mark Mithun Da. <br /> <br /> I will not destroy you any more. Just go and see it. Today. And if you like it, here are some more suggestions. Gunda, Desh Drohi, Aparichit, old Ramsay Brothers horror movies, Loha, Indra tiger and Sivaji.
