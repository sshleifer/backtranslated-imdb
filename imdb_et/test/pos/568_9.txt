I just saw this movie through Netflix. I was interested in the way the film was described, but in the end it was better. While watching this movie, I moved in many different ways. I was full of hurt, hatred, anger, bitterness, pain, and finally relief. To look at the accused young man, your heart would break and convince you that they have the wrong person. The mystery of the police makes you an elbow, because just as Rodney King's beating brought out the brutality of the police, this film brings about the complete absence of moral fibers in these police. And the fact that they beat this guy and went with it will only give you more grace. <br /> <br /> But I have to tell you I fell in love with Mc Guinness. One of my favorite lines when he told us what the ** police hole was, ... the policeman told him that he would continue to suck this cancer. Mc Guinness told the policeman ... "I always have a cigarette before sex ..." I told him that I would shut him down "<br /> <br /> I have a new law against some new law in that country.
