If you don't mind subtitles, you like comedy and really interesting characters, and taste something different from American traditional film, then take the chance to rent this movie. <br /> <br /> Two contrasting friends, one very neurotic sweater, another strong silent lone guy working as a jerk-butcher in a smaller Danish city, they decide to kick themselves and open the butcher shop itself. First of all, they will not be able to have something new that they are recipes and will become a village exchange. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting story in itself, this smartly humorous movie is even more put together (friendship), romance, crime, death, personal tragedy) that makes this movie so funny, but it's full of fine interests that make it so interesting but warm and fuzzy. <br /> <br /> Participants who believe in them. You still have the best script, if the characters are not believing that it can sink and control the movie, act, characterize the faith and story for all the networks so well that it makes it a very fun movie. So, if your mood to stretch flowers, you want to see something very good in a little different way, then I suggest you rent this movie when I'm on the way to find more director Anders Thomas Jensen. .
