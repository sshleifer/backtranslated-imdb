This movie gives Daniel Wu the chance to make a great movie, but I really see that Emil Chow's character is really great, gutsy, but decided to make a mistake. Plus the main terrorist, it makes me think about my revolution, makes me wonder if he does it for good or bad. <br /> <br /> The film that tells us about Todd, an amnesty of a terrorist that is considered secret until he learns who he really is. The consequences he makes from his terrorist family gives him the choice of redemption. <br /> <br /> Purple Storm was one of the best I saw this year. The film really stands out when it is filled with the enormous Stephen Tung Wai activities that won the best sequences of action in Hong Kong prizes. (9/10)
