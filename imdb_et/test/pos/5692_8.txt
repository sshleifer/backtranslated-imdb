"Black Water" is one of the toughest films I've been watching for a long time. The story moves fast as it follows three tourists (all major actors) to the gossip with a small boat guide. Soon after the anchor falls into a remote area of ​​the swamps, they are trapped in the water. <br /> <br /> Three are rushing to get close, when they realize that the crocodile has been attacking them. Over the next two days, they must desperately try to escape the crocodile's evil eye, and he doesn't want to go away. The movie just drags a little, but what can you expect from the assumption and the limited budget? It's so much better than "Primary" and other recent crocodile / underwater predators. The tensions are heavy and all three are awful. Really chilling, this movie hit me with deep claustrophobic fear. Probably based on real events.
