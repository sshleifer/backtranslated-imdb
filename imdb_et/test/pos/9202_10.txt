Frankly, I just enjoy watching James Cane. Wonderful actor. With this simplicity, you know exactly what he thinks. Real pro. <br /> <br /> I have seen the viewing from the very beginning and found it differently - this is something unique in Hollywood - a new idea - not the third version of the current hit - <br /> <br /> the exhibition is fun and exciting - I like the temple - you are never bored - I especially like the secret of every episode - how it develops. I am a big mystery fan and I have read many great secrets, but I find that the exhibitions are well written and the result is rarely obvious. It is also very interesting to me, probably because I am not a gambler, there are different drawbacks that gamblers come out of - I was fascinated by the number of schemes that people came out to rob Las Vegas. Music: I like playing music. Absolutely perfect for the show ... Determines the tone and atmosphere. Just wonderful. And of course James Caan.
