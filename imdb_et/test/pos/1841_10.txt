I saw this movie a few years ago and it was literally put away. So charming and very romantic. David Duchovny and Mrs. Chief have chemistry that is so hot you have to take off the layer of clothing. A strong mold is a 100% upper limit. Just looking at Caroll O'Connor and Robert Loggia to play each other is pure poetry. Bonnie Hunt and Jim Bellushi and a great team and some of the most exciting moments are on the screen. As Jim Belushi shouts to his children to go to sleep "OUT!" or he's dancing in the kitchen. This film made me want to know such people in my life. Not to mention what a woman does not want a David Duchovny boy?
