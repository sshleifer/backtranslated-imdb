One of the best memories of my childhood. Should be on DVD. It hit everything we grew up in the seventies - peace, softness, flower power, and great acoustic music. Two hosts, Carol and Paula, were the ultimate head-hips, with long hair, puppies' blouses and bells (they looked like Katherine Ross ("Graduate") and Ali McGraw ("Love Story").) <br /> < They gave us the joy of daisy "chucklepatch" jokes, gave us lessons that we were a nice squirrel in the organizing of conversations, and entertainment with our musician from our guitarist. They were the best, and Carol was also the original Sandy of the original "Grease" (Sandy) production. <br /> <br /> This exhibition should be timed in a capsule, including: "Yellow submarine", "Arrow to the sun" and Marlo Thomas "," Be free ... You and me. "," Sunshine "and" Point ". <br /> <br /> And last but not least, the thematic song," Look ya, look ya, hope you have a good, good time, ah ha, joy that we have to say good mornin "that I hope we can see again, see ya, see ya, Glad you could stay some time, ah ha, hope we can see again, see ya, see ya.
