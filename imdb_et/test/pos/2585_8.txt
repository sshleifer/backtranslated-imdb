I and my roommate got free tickets for pre-check, which I think you would call it Atlanta, GA at the Atlantic Station. Looking forward to waiting for something contradictory, provocative, superfluous, etc. But the movie is much more. This is the story of two people who help each other. It is not superfluous and the film has been carefully done not to force or say it is unnecessary. <br /> <br /> It's really well-assembled and doesn't take you too seriously. This is its beauty. If she tried to take herself seriously, it would have been unfortunate, but it carries some humor (some unintentional) and some surprisingly good Ricci actions. Though Timberlake fails in his role, the film is good enough to put it on the side. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie, if not for any other reason than that it is something else. experience.
