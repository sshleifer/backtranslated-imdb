Those who do not like such a film think that a loved one has "somehow" belonged to them, and it should be ignored if they leave with someone. Fortunately, the human animal is much deeper than that; who loves someone deeply inevitably causes suffering - though we are fortunate to have their death. <br /> <br /> This movie is true where Nigel Balchin's original novel ("Make a Tree") is in setup, atmosphere and dialogue. and by identifying a seemingly incompatible dilemma, the silent despair that lies behind many seemingly idyllic lives (and the portrayal of the English upper class is very accurate). <br /> <br /> I loved the movie and hope it will soon appear as a UK compatible DVD
