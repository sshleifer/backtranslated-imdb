Yes, it is "Flipper". But the writer / director Alan Shapiro has produced a version. Stylish photos of the above and underwater "Jaws" veteran Bill Butler and Joel McNeely and Crosby music, Stills & Nash make this a truly memorable family life. Shapiro, whose last film was unlikely to be "The Crush", shows himself again as a very talented and versatile filmmaker. Rent it!
