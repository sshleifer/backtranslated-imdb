The Messiah was watching from the beginning to the end. The story apparently focused on random murders in London in various bad ways. DCI Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) must find the truth that, to his surprise, is a bit closer to home than he thinks. <br /> <br /> Grabbing Drama and Ken Stot was great. Hopefully we haven't seen the last DCI Red Metcalf.
