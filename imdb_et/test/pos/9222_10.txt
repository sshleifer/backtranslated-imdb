When I was a kid, it was the movie I watched. I think it's a great movie that kids watch and parents don't have to fear any kind of violence or obscene. rainbow brite is a cheerful young girl and she is trying to get out of the winter. He finds something or someone trying to steal the source of life and keep it for himself. I love this movie and I think even adults can enjoy this movie.
