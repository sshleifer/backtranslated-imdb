Finally, I watched this frightening movie last night, and what a disturbing way of thinking ** is and is incredibly bloody and some unforgettable scenes and a complete attack on the senses. It looks like this is a movie of Lynch (especially ERASERHEAD), Buttgeerit and even a little "Begotten". What this guy does to his pregnant sister is incredible, but whether it really happened or the left and right sides of his brain have made a battle. It is the main theme of this art theme to draw a fine line between fantasy and reality and what would happen if the right side of the brain, dreaming and fantasizing, transcends thinking and the logical left side. And the music in this movie is an incredible, sort of electronic score that is absolutely perfect. Although this movie is totally shocking and pretty nasty in some extreme scenes (including hard core sex), you can see it in any movie, I watched it as a work of art and loved it. And this music amazes me, I have to try to find the soundtrack if it is available. Watching "unconscious cruelty" is a real event, not what the viewer simply forgets. And a note for gorehounds, it's black and black. <br /> <br /> Warning ... Be careful when buying this movie, as some prints have a picture of sexy scenes and extreme gore, especially the Japanese release of copies.
