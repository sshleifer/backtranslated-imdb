This film has a spooky, unpleasant edge that allows us to participate in a lot of action without a stylistic burden that tells us how we need to feel; "Blue", everything was publicly sad (firm, powerful as hell, but still); "White", it was a pleasant whimsy. But there are no such emotional clues or tips. It would be like a story that the story of a power source could work its magic without dazzling glare. I think this makes it the most ambiguous at first, but finally the most transcendental and redeeming. It has never been pointless, unpleasant honesty has been so beautiful.
