Based on Stephen Hawking's "A Brief History of Time", this amazing film by Eroll Morris records the life and work of one of the greatest senses in the history of astronomy. He has given more science, despite his debilitating illness, to ALS, if a capable scientist could only dream. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Hawking's childhood and how he was a poor student. recognizably bright. He broke his way through college and university, where he was diagnosed with a disease that would take away the normal functions of his body, but would allow him to continue living and thinking perfectly. From Stephen's point of view, from childhood to today, at one point, the mother tells her how - when she was pregnant - she bought a prophetically astronomical selection to read in the hospital. Hawking himself talks about the timing of his discoveries, while Morris interviews close friends and colleagues who are lucky enough to be friendly with a great man. <br /> <br /> He talks about how he was first interested in discovering that the Universe is expanding in the same way as the letter expands. We also know that the stars are dying and now become "black holes", if that is the case, will the universe fail too much, turning itself back until we reach the "big crisis"? like Hawking does. And when the universe begins to retreat, isn't it time to "turn"? When I asked this question, I began to think that death might not be the end, perhaps one day it would go back and our death would become our rebirth and our death would be our birth. The universe is one big cycle, like everything else in life. <br /> <br /> This is what Hawking tells us, everything in the universe recovers itself. It is perfectly logical and you may think in millions of ways to reflect. That's why I love this movie and why it's BLACK IT !!! 10 out of 10 ... Morris never ends!
