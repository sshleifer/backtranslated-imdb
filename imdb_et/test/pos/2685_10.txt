This is by far the most fun sitcom that has ever fueled TV. I own all 9 seasons on a DVD and literally they could watch them again and again. Anyone who doesn't find this example fun, heartfelt, entertaining and laughs out hysterically is crazy! Kevin James is absolutely one of the most talented comedies. My boyfriend and I like seeing comedy events in Boston (where we live) and seeing Kevin James and his brother Gary Valentine (Danny) twice. They are both so incredibly talented and just planning their work wisely. There are so many comedies that are just terrible, and Kevin and Gary really show the true side of true comedy. Leah Remini, though a real life (so I have read it), is an amazing actor and deserves more credit than any other woman in Sitcamis. He really does the show ... with Jerry Stiller! This exhibition must be visible and you get addicted to one to two episodes!
