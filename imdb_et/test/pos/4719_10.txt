"Beyond the Rangoon" is just wonderful. From the traumatic opening to the exaggerating end, you will be surprised how well this film is put together. Patricia Arquette is astonishingly Laura Bowman, whom we meet when we finish and give up on a desperate young doctor who is unable to mourn the loss of her husband and son. During the movie, when he is trapped in Burma, witnessed in the capital of democratic uprising and mass murder in Rangoon, escapes his life and saves the life of his tour guide (U Aung Ko), he can live back. It can be a vision or a heavy hand: it is not. John Boorman, the master of mental and emotional conflict, paints the film with a wide hit and often uses symbolism to capture Laura's emotional state and physical condition. Patricia Arquette, as usual, gives Laura the emotionally wounded with great conviction and credibility. What Arquette does amazingly, in any role he plays, gives us a window to his character's heart without words. Every time they go to the film, the audience will be given an overview of their character. She doesn't have to talk to convey emotions or be up. Some critics were harsh when it came to Arquette's film, when it was opened on August 25, 1995, finding that he was "flat" or "boring". I found his character dead, far from melodramatic, which is usually part of the actor's performance in the personal tragedy. He is in shock and is reserved for his feelings: it is as common as screaming those around you. I hope Warner Brothers will release this title from DVD very soon. With Arquette's very successful NBC drama "Medium", which brings her household name, not to mention Emmy's victory and now from 2007, it would be in the interest of the studio. Hopefully, there are extras that will stop exchanging. Don't go through this movie. This is one you will not see after that.
