The Truth and Reconciliation Process in South Africa is an important and probably unique human test. This film is a great job for the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa. I believe everyone should see this film because I think that few people outside South Africa understand their past and what they have been trying to do in the process of truth and reconciliation. Almost every country has a part of its history, which is still a source of continued hatred and bitterness. We all need to understand how to deal with the past. What will happen in South Africa should lead us all. I found it to be reliable, moving, and sometimes distracting. There were no outstanding exemplary performances, but it added the strength of the narrative. The BBC has once again contributed to the complex issue and the display of top-notch film.
