What to say is an anti-agency film created during such a colorless void, social indifference and authoritarian satisfaction. The first major independent film by Cassevette was not the success of the post offices and has still not received the attention it deserves. I compare the wave of American independent projects that consist of "Beat" filmmakers such as Robert Frank and Harry Smith in the late 1950s with the emerging scene in Paris, known as the French New Wave. <br /> <br /> discussed poetry and philosophy and vulnerability when the rest of the culture was obsessed with discovering American cultural domination; even at this stage, it is a peculiar, very spontaneous filmmaker struggle against the creation of political lexicons and bigotics that had to follow artistic development in the mid-20th century. <br /> <br /> The Cassevettes film looks at racial relationships and depicts a person in the eyes of love because we as a culture are blinded by our own race and prejudice. Most of Cassevettes' work is that his films have almost the opposite minimalist effect; the spiritual reaction arises through fine characteristic relationships, not so many shapes. That is why it seems that his work seems to be because he takes a more intimate approach to defining quarries that rely less clearly on explicit measures and more on interpretation. <br /> <br /> Although my favorite Cassevettes movie is Husbands, it's the most important one.
