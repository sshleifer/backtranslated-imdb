This cannot be denied. Sci-fi on TV is hard. There are so many problems that the genre brings. Like a good budget, solid writing, decent action. Perhaps the budget and script writing departments are where I feel that most attempts have failed. Does the "surface" succeed? Not entirely, but more than most. <br /> <br /> How I see it, a good sci-fi show doesn't really need a lot of CGIs to work and don't need much money. The need is the ability to create a greater sense of life. Feeling more than anything that makes me curious and ready to try and find out how it ends. Adding puzzles and sometimes "Aha!" is what makes or breaks such an exhibition. <br /> <br /> There were a few bugs on the surface. First, this basic assumption is not as exciting as it could have been, nor is the revealed story as exciting (or bold) as I originally hoped for. Also, the TV feeling is very much time consuming. The whole Crapist (CGI) (ranging from decent and terrible) to the quite variable quality of the acting department. It also sometimes seems a bit too family-friendly because it sometimes takes an edge and becomes almost cutesy. But besides these shortcomings, this is an enjoyable show. Perhaps not as spectacular as some other sci-fi exhibitions there. But it will keep me in the best of the season, and it also offers a few nice costumes between exhibitions. For me, the end is not tempting. I don't like showing this end without mentioning the unfinished, leaving the story unresolved. In this case, it is particularly regrettable because the exhibition seems to have been canceled after the first season (it is still undecided). HBO is a benchmark for high quality television for me. Their series have the best actors, the best product values ​​and especially the most solid writing. It's not HBO quality, but it's good what it is. Enough to desperately want another season.
