It's an appealing woman's drama that men can enjoy. The plot is followed by a young woman (Hope Lange) who goes to work for a publisher after college. We can forgive him to jump from the secretary to the editor (hey, this is Hollywood) and some other bugs. Here's one of the few movies that shows up with one big-time producer Robert Evans (here, a beautiful female rat). It also has a mature Joan Crawford and a terrible tool. Look at it.
