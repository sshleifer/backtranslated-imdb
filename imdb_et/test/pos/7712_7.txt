This is one of the animated narratives that are not directly related to the end of the war. One glorious plot of films, but the Trinity expressed by Carrian appears in it. it has a private detective who has been hired for a lot of money to look for a Trinity hacker. we see his search, which contains other PIs, only one he meets, seemingly crazy about his experience, trying to track Trinity. Finally, he contacts Trinity, who assumes he is, of course, a man - in narration and something that puts us firmly in our perspective, regardless of what we already know - in the hacker room and solves a riddle that forces him to catch the train in a hurry. he forgets his hat, but his loyal cat throws him ridiculous at the moment so absurd that it is fun. the agents used her to get to Trinity and Trinity tried to release her sent PI, which she didn't know, and which wasn't explicitly mentioned in the animation, which is the usual noir for filming titles, which often implies a lot of interesting back-story, subplots, developments, etc., but do not show more than a basic story and a limited perspective to create mystery and intrigue air. Almost everything in this short is black-and-white, the music resembles the film's dirty and dirty, old-fashioned, but dedicated detective is the perfect protagonist of the film's Noir title. The ineffectiveness of the IMDb records in this title also points to some references made by this title to hard-boiled literature, something he also lends heavily, to the genres of detectives, gangsters, and others who deal with complex conflicts easily and often. Studio 4 Â° C is animated and directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, this is a pleasant variant of the usual matrix story.
