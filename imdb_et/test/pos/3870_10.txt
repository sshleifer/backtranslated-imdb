Animation is still the first episode, the slightly firmer style of Simpsons roasting in the open fire, but already with this first regular episode, Bart the Genius begins to be more "layered", faster and more distinctive. it has already appeared. <br /> <br /> This episode firmly confirms Bart's "slacker" personality, and more specifically, adds the intellectual superior to the whole family. Although this is the main theme of the episode (Bart's and Homer's father / son relationship also has a pleasant secondary theme), it is given to us first briefly when the episode opens with Simpson playing Scrabble. Lisa comes up with the word "id" - short but something you need to know. She has to read her vocabulary for the rest of the family, which has been the way to support the sofa. Marge can only come "she". Homer is "oxidized" already sitting in his tray, but he doesn't feel it is a word, so he puts "tea" instead. Bart comes up with the word kwyjibo he calls. Similarly, on the line of the main plot of the episode, Bart deceives his IQ test, leading him to a private school full of talented children. We know it probably won't last long. <br /> <br /> "The Simpsons" have always been very fun to play with people with different intellectual abilities through their characters, and more importantly, as people with different intellectual abilities that fit (or not) are accepted (or not) and perceived in society. Aside from presenting Bart, Lisa, Homer, and Marge in this context, this episode is beginning to honor the jokes and geeks outside the Simpson family. Through a special school students' dialogue, as well as through some other references, including purely visual, this episode also shows that "Simpsons" does not pull any beats in writing or talk to their audience. It can be just a comic, but it's a comic that intellectuals, gays and nerds understand more than anyone else. And this fact, besides being a very funny show, is the key to the duration of the exhibition.
