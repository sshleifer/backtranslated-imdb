"Stripperella" is an animated series of girls named Erotica Jones (expressed by Pamela Anderson) who lives in a double life as a stripper in a gentleman's club called "Tender Loins" and a sexy criminal winner known as the Stripperella. Agent 69, working for a government organization. Like Stripperella, Erotica fights the forces of crime and evil, such as a plastic surgeon, who gives women breast implants that explode or make them fat, and Cheapo, a criminal who steals a 99-cent store and puts his two handguns on a gun. The creator of character and series is Stan Lee, the celebrity of Marvel (and the creator of Spider-Man). <br /> <br /> At the end of June 2003, Spike TV (known as the new TNN) appeared. There are three animated exhibitions on Thursday night. These exhibitions were "Ren & Stimpy: Adult Party Cartoon"; the new adventures of classical children show the adults Ren and Stimpy, made by the original creator John Kricfalusi, "Gary Rat"; a lawyer who has become a human-sized rat who plays Kelsee's grammar "Cheers" and "Fraiser" in fame, and "Stripperella"; stripper doubles as Superhero adventures by Pamela Anderson and Stan Lee. I remember all three premiums. I wanted to see Ren and Stimpy love the original show. I was a little shot. It was fine, but it seemed that things were going a little too far; seeing that they have gay sex was a bit much. Although Gary Rat was not bad, the three were the best with Stripper. The animation was really good, he had a fantastic intro song, a good talent behind it and it was funny as hell! The exhibition was just so stupid, I don't even know how to explain it! After four to five weeks (if not a little less), the animation block that was strange disappeared because I know it got good ratings and was promoted everywhere. I was disappointed to see Stripperella going, but several months later I found out about new episodes that sounded like at 1:00. I only saw one, and although it was funny as hell, and I was glad to see it back all this time, it seemed a bit off ... <br /> <br /> Its short start, "Stripperella", was a big animation. It was dark, moody, realistic and somewhat sexy. Stripperella's costume also seemed good, the character was well drawn. After a long break and the rest of the episodes, the animation was very different. Instead of a dark and realistic look, it was all that was now very colorful and comic. However, Stripperella was the biggest player. Before she had normal long hair, her hair was now larger than Peggy Bundy (with married children) if possible. Also, the eye mask actually shows your eyes; Before it was just white, you saw what was cool because it was superheroish. The upper part of her costume was also like a collar, vest type, and her costume was dark blue; which became her costume, which was a bluish-violet color and her upper costume is actually quite delightful. In a nutshell, the exhibition was already a comic and very silly at the top, but on the other side, more cartoons were made, and although it was still ridiculous, it became more engaging; for example, there was a beacon for a later episode ... yes, it was a beaver. <br /> <br /> Anyway, instead of complaining about the central series changes, "Stripperella" ran for only one season, but it was a very good show. Like the story of the Crypt movie "Bordello of Blood", it can be really campy, but it's really fun. As long as you are not a bride, you will see yourself repeatedly smiling. I haven't seen every episode because I don't have a DVD for two reasons: # 1. Released from Paramount and equipped with a policy of adding extra to almost all published TV shows, although it was a show (I would have liked to see a comment on maby, that explained animation change and interviews with Pamela Anderson and Stan Lee) and # 2. Now I'm not his fan, but this intro sang the WAS theme! If you are not going to pay to get any bonuses, at least the original intro song will cost you. There were also a couple of interesting guest characters like John Lovitz like Cheapo and Mark Ham as plastic surgery who hate models. Tom Kenny (SpongeBob) was also the owner of the striptease club in most episodes. Stan Lee is also portable in one episode. <br /> <br /> Breakdown: <br /> <br /> PROS: At first it was a great caution, FUNNY AS HELL, a very fun show, a great voice talent mostly, Chief Strogenoff (see the show and see some things he does), and was easily the best of the three previously shown animated plays. <br /> <br /> CONS: Central series animation change and previously described crappy DVD. Aside from the fact that some humor can sometimes be stupid, I have nothing negative about it. <br /> <br /> OVERVIEW: Stripperella is my innocent joy and it's just a shame running for one season. It was a very funny, sexy, packed cult race that I hope to see adults one day without touching the original intro and, if possible, give it another season, like Family Guy. Check it even when it's on a clumsy DVD. You laugh foolishly. <br /> <br /> Rated TV-MA: Raw and Sexual Humor and Nudity, Duration: about 25 minutes per episode, score: 9/10
