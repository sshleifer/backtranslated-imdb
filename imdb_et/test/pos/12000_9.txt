Sorry to repeat yourself again and again, but here's another great Columbo episode. I think that's why I'm such a fan - most episodes are really big! The best episodes always have a certain feature and in this case the murderer and his accomplice are probably the youngest ever Columbo villains. <br /> <br /> After watching many episodes where Columbo and his opponent act as close friends, it's good to see an episode of bullying and bad feelings on the floor. This gives the episode a little more drama and bite. Columbo quickly comes to the point that two students claiming to help him do not laugh at him very much and feed him the wrong tips. He is happy to play, deliberately worshiping them in front of him to humiliate him! Of course he knows as soon as they speak calmly. <br /> <br /> Murder itself is another complicated one, following the The Bye Bye Sky High IQ episode, where a complex chain reaction works to kill the desired target, while offering the assassins a seemingly waterproof alibi. In the intervening years of 1978-1990, technology has moved from record players and shots to remote control car locking systems and hidden cameras. Stephen Caffrey puts great performance like Justin Rowe, a terrible, corrupted student. Gary Hershberger is a low key but good as his "yes-man" friend Cooper Redman. And it's nice to see Robert Culpi as Mr. Rowe, Justin's father. <br /> <br /> Very satisfying episode in every sense.
