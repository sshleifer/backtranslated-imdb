Title: Opera (1987) Director: Dario Argento Cast: Cristina Masillach, Ian Charleson, Urbano Barberini, Daria Nicolod Review: The only other Argento movie I had seen was Suspiria and one blew my style, colors and spooky story. . Next I decided to go with Opera because I was told that it was one of his best. Man, I think I'll find out what is finally my favorite horror head. <br /> <br /> Opera is about a young opera singer, who gets his big break when the crazy star of the modern opera takes over Mc Beth against the car. Betty is a mystery so she can do her own. Too bad for him, he is a psycho, who makes him follow the brutal murders of his friends and associates. <br /> <br /> Wow, Id heard good things about it, but I wasn't ready for the film that this film takes me. Yes, the film has gaps that I can get later. But most of the time the movie was blown away by the film. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie is not full of colors like Suspiria. I was expecting it to be a little paused in this department, but no, it was a surprise to my look and feel. The film is in no way colorful. Certain scenes have many colors (such as a masterful kitchen / living room) where Argento fills the screen with lush green and blue tones, but most often the film is greyish, black tones all through and I liked having its own special look. <br /> <br /> The actual stars of this show are incredibly well-organized sequences of deaths. Wow. Every scene of death was like a work of art. Destruction of beauty. These are not only your typical consequences of cages and slashes, these deaths are carefully structured to get the shock and get the most out of your situation. Beloved by every other of them, here's a lot of blood and chaos, but with style. Don't rob though. <br /> <br /> Then there is the direction. Man, there are some really original and beautiful pictures. I loved the invention of the camera. You thought Tarantinos shot Kill Bill's vol. 1 where do we see the ball coming out of the gun chamber? Well, this is the movie he's raised! I honestly believe that this particular film was strongly influenced by Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol. 1. Heck in doing what he mentions, the entire scene at the Beatrix Hospital and Elle Driver who came to kill him affected Italian Giallosit, and here's my friends to prove. Anyway, Tarantino refers aside, this movie is some amazing camera shots like these scenes crows flying through the crowd of the opera house ... great things. And the main reason why Argentos became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> Most cast cast actors were fine, but best was Cristina Marsillach as the tortured young opera singer Betty. The faces in his eyes when the murders were committed were great. The rest was a bit of wood and stiff, but not something that would stop the movie from enjoying. <br /> <br /> Very few things I liked about this movie. The original logic was thrown out of the window in certain scenes. Especially those associated with Bettys reactions saw murders. It seems to me that he went into his business for a long time and did not tell anyone about the whole thing. Not even the police. I mean, if you see someone who murders your beloved person, you will not just go away from the murder scene and continue with your life. Someone would have linked her to the murders. He could even become a suspect himself ... but not. The end is also a bit anti-climactic. You have to understand this, but it seemed a bit unnecessary at the end of the movie, it seemed that it could have ended earlier. It would not have been so superfluous. But that's something, not real big problems for me because I enjoyed this beautiful part of the movie. <br /> <br /> I still have a lot of Argento territory to cover ... but I'm the way I would if I ate the most expensive caviar plate. This guys are really good. I think his films are works of art and I've only seen two mothers! Don't wait to discover the rest of her movies. Argento, you man! <br /> <br /> Rating: 41/2 out of 5
