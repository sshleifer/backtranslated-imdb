The first time I looked at it when it came out (1994), and the last time I watched it was just before it was written. It still makes me laugh at my brain ... after all these years it doesn't disappoint. Really the smartest Bollywood comedy. It's an Indian film that deserves its place in the IMDb Top 250. Aamir Khan and Salman Khan are probably one of the best comedians. The thing that makes it once less classic is its comic timing and wonderful editing ... The jokes are refreshing and not cheap. If you haven't seen it yet, SEE LOOKING !!!!!!!!!
