Richard Condie is a Canadian admiration and one that should be shared with the world. Be it in the early work of the intestine, such as "Getting Started" and the Oscar-named "Snit" through "The Apprentice" and digitally produced "La Salla", Condie is a valuable local hero. But no single job puts his career on the label like "The Big Snit". And did I mention it being nominated for the Academy Award? Darn Producer. <br /> <br /> "Big Snit", although a clearly dated messenger from the 1980s (a short spin around the Cold War nuclear attack, but don't worry about "hell") carries a greater meaning, like most Condie's works forever. Although the planet is screaming from Armageddon, a couple pairs of annoying habits (true Condie in fashion, she saws furniture when she shakes her eyes literally). And don't forget to watch it over and over again, â€œthere is always something to look at. With this surprise, Condie loads countless visual gags and memorable battle words. <br /> <br /> I encourage this incredible animation to follow. In Canada, this is usually seen on the video of the national film, which contains other letters (including the equally funny "The Cat Came Back" by Winnipegger Cordell Barker). Americans just have to dig a little deeper, but keep it? The reward is worth the attack.
