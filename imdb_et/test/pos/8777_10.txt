Hitchcock once gave an interview where he said he wanted to target scenarios that had a normal person holding his business, accidentally falling into a terrible chain of events that they could not get out of before the dirty plot behind their ailments was resolved. So the audience can feel compassion for the hero. We're sure to make this fine film. Barry Kane tries to help his compatriot only through acts of kindness and respect, such as helping Fryl with the letters he fell in the factory. Barry returns Fry later, lost $ 100 bill ... which was big money in 1943! It is the actions of Barry's Christian kindness that struggles him and will soon blame him for sabotage and murder, and will probably come if he cannot clean himself. Like the 39 steps of the plot, the hero travels across the state border, where he discovers the plans for further terrorist acts by fascist cells - an archaeologist who could not believe in a cabinet-nazi, and a beautiful blonde, Patricia Martin, who first suspects and hates, eventually falls in love with Barry Kane. Hitch's brand also touches humor. Patricia is a billboard model that is a variety of roadside ads that are helpful and comfortable for Barry when traveling with the bad, from Las Vegas to NYC. We meet a truck who is one man's comedy act "Somebody convinced my wife was stylish to eat three meals a day." Field workers in the fascist spy ring rush to forget or ignore "suits" just as they would work for a legitimate company. During the cinema during the chase scene, the audience members laugh at the trick comedy / gangster as the sabotage cells come out with this really good boy and kill killer with the film patron. Amazing dead old man, but funny! Hitch liked to use the famous monuments in his films and this is the best example where the Statue of Liberty is a background and an ironic icon! It works even better than the NBNW Mt Rushmore scene.
