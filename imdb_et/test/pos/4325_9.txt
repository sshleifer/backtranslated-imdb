Missing has been one of the most wonderful and exciting experiences I've ever seen. Not only is this the mother of coincidence, but also every time you think you can put your whole head in front of the head, the story takes a whole new direction. <br /> <br /> Take this accident, such as the US Sea, which Sayid gives you the chance to become a tormentor. Does Clancy Brown play a character called Joe Inman. In the last episode he plays Kelvin Inman, Desmond's partner in the hatch. Fate, uh? Yes, right! <br /> <br /> I think we all have to wait to see what next is strange people in this strange island, somewhere in the middle. Knowing that many of my favorite characters, Desmond, Sayid, and Mr. Eko, have an unclear fate, I believe that with 24 and Shield this is one of the best TV shows ever, of course, keeping Twin Twin in a special position.
