OK ... I've seen almost everything .... and some are considered a classic that shouldn't be (like all those Halloween movies that suck or even Steven's king) ....... and some are just considered OK, which are really big ..... (like the carnival of souls) ........ and then some are just ignored ............ like (evil ed) or (pumpkin head and brain dead "bud cort one"), some sticks with your head never saw and never miss ........... that's what it did to me ........ for my money is it's much better than the last house left ............ the last house was great until the end ... then it blew up ..... which mannequin give a blow to someone who just killed their children, totally stupid .. you will find the movie "bullying" or even "funny games" if you want realism and be out of the question ....... .. but this damn thing stayed with me for years ......... one reason Chuck Connors was always scary ......... two Tanya Roberts is the best female victim ..... ... three chicks are still one of the worst killings on the film ........ and 4th telinetic force pulled my mind and came completely unexpected ...... .................................................. .... dolls, etc ....... it should be there for psycho, last house, texas chainsaw etc ... ... it's classic .............. and so well ...........
