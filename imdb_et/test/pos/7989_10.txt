Batman's Return In my opinion, the Batman series's first Batman is just half of the Batman's return. Tim Burton's first Batman had only Batman and The Joker played well by Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. <br /> <br /> On Batman's return, we have what I feel best as a cast Batman film (yes even better than Dark Knight). Keaton returns to Batman and is in a perfect role that never goes beyond Batman's character, which is perfect in this movie when it comes to the two villains he is against. First of all, you have Danny DeVito, who is joyfully mad with the penguin. Then you have Michelle Pfeiffer Cat-Woman, who dares to say that this is one of the most interesting and sophisticated tips in Batman's films. I feel it for Pfeiffer because he gets the cat-wife he's going to be as a pretty pathetic mouse to Selena Kyle and then really dives into the dark side of his mind, and what you get is a great success for a woman trying to be a hero villain and then I think that back to the hero eventually. Also in this amazing pain you have the evil businessman Max Schreck, played by the amazing and legendary Christopher Walken. Being in a supporting role, there is something that I love and maybe this is the appearance of Schreck on a film that makes her presentation even better than it already is. Batman's returns have a lot more work at this time compared to the first Batman. Part of the reason I loved this story so much is that Burton dared to go a lot darker and more complicated than Nicholson's top. You have a story about the penguin and how he tries to deceive the people of Gotham to make this new hero and mayor. Then you have a cat woman and her fight to decide who she really is and what she should do with her new person. In Batman, I have the feeling that he is more of a leader in this, who keeps two stories together, but of course the ass at the same time. <br /> <br /> The film is that the film is dark and atmospheric. the story that is happening in it. Gotham City has never seen as good as Blu-Ray and HD, so if you have the opportunity to see it, then all the tools can do it because it adds to Batman's overall experience of return. <br /> <br /> So I all feel that from all of Batman's movies, I liked the fact that when I liked this movie on Heath Ledger's amazing game like Joker, I felt the film had nothing. Batman Returns has nothing, so if you want to see an amazing movie that I feel it's perfect cast, then this is Batman, who illuminates the Bat signal.
