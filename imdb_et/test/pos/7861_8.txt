It is hard to know which category this movie is to put on, most of these films in US history are western, but instead of western open plains, the action is almost entirely limited to the claustrophobic girls boarding room in Louisiana. <br /> <br /> The film opens with Amy, a young girl who walked in the woods, where she chooses mushrooms as she does when she stumbles upon Colonel John McBee, a wounded Union soldier who takes him back to school. We know that he is not a very nice person when he kisses him on his lips to warn him of a confederate patrol while he told him he was twelve. is divided on what should be done with his new guests, some think they should take care of him until his wounds heal, while others believe that treason is not to hand him over to the Confederate forces as soon as possible. The former group dominates and gradually returns. As he does, his presence affects all those girls who have not had a man on the spot for a long time, including a young teacher and headmaster who seems to have been with his brother. McBee talks about attracting them, emotionally, if not physically, it brings about a lot of jealousy for girls. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is estimated to be fifteen, it is definitely not for younger viewers with sexual content, but little has actually been shown, but much is indirect, and for a very exhausting scene where I had more than any other scene I've seen for some time. It is interesting to see that Clint Eastwood plays against the type, not heroic, but his character is both unpleasant and most of the time in the mercy of the women around him. Acting is a strong collection, not only of Eastwood, but also of all the actors, including the young Pamelyn Ferdin who played Amy.
