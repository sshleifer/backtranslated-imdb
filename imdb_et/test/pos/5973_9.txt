I agree with another reviewer, this is a shattering film that will soon be seen again, but only for quality it deserves to be repeated. The complexity of the characters, the incredible cinematic art and the great direction make this movie a valuable emotional price. <br /> <br /> There is one scene where two partisans drag the snow through to get out of the patrol. maybe just for the sake of physicality, the most amazing thing I've ever seen. In fact, though not episodic - the story flows - it's a movie of memorable scenes. Partisans, snow scenes, destroyed farmhouses, house meetings, interrogation, "basement" scene, "uphill" have passed. Everyone looks like a necklace with jewelry. <br /> <br /> For me, religiosity is not obvious. Frankly, I don't think it would be allowed in a Soviet movie. I see it as an existential parable of the value of life. Here is a story where the hero - and he is a real hero - becomes a villain and the weaker gets stronger. Is it a mystical process or a situation caused by circumstances? There's rewriting, but does it come from within or without? You have to see the film to understand these questions because they cannot be discussed without giving too much of the story. I can't act enough to say. I find it difficult to choose which one is more influential. I'm not familiar with Soviet film in the 70s and I don't know any of the participants, but they're all great. I also note how Director Larisa Shepitko uses children. They remind me of the angels of the Giotto children. <br /> <br /> After all, it's a bit confusing. Obviously, there is a previous relationship between soldier Sotnikov and interviewer Portnov, but it has been hanging. And the last scene is a bit unclear. However, compared to experienced experiences, these are disappointments. This is a film that marks you for life.
