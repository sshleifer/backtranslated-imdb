Someone says this anime can be offensive to girls ... not really. The embarrassing situation is funny; for the first time I see the series I was in a video store, people laughed around me, not age or gender. The teacher said that in order to get someone's attention in the book, the beginning must be fun and the end should not be obvious when reading the last page. In the first minute of the series, the boy hits the car, the same car appears at the last moments of the series. I don't regret buying these series.
