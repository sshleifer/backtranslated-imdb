Participate in the story of Sweeney Todd ... The Strangest, The Least-Backed, But Wonderful Broadway Musician. It's chilling, funny and moving through the most memorable and unbelievable results and sharp performances of Sondheim. George Hearn is incomparable in his title role, bringing a strong voice and the death of a legendary demon-hairdresser (no pun), while Angela Lansbury offers a comic when he cheers his victims with meat pies. If you allow yourself to enjoy it, "Sweeney Todd" is a real affection.
