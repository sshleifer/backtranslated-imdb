Jennifer Egan's novel was brought to life by a Canadian film director Adam Brooks in a film based on some of the comments in the forum, which is a bad proposal, but in fact it is much better than believing. > <br /> This is a story of two sisters who love each other dearly. Faith, a fair and happy hippie girl, takes her younger sister, Phoebe, under her wing. Phoebe loves faith clearly; when a parent decides to follow his boy Wolf in Europe on his Berkley summer vacation, he promises to send Phoebe's postcard every day. Faith does that until the cards stop and one evening, some time later, the family receives a phone call to inform them. Faith is dead in tragic conditions. <br /> <br /> Phoebe can't believe. Therefore, in a few years' time, he decides the same path that the older sister took. She takes cards from Faith and visits every place, starting from Amsterdam, then moving to Paris, and she wants to end her trip to Portugal, where Faith met her premature death. <br /> <br /> In Paris, Phoebe hooks with Wolf, who is now not a hippie and lives with his girlfriend. Wolf, trying to convince Phoeb to give up his trip and go home; he suspects that Wolf will hold the key to solving the mystery, and if he plans to leave for Portugal, he will make a discovery if he finds a picture that clearly contradicts Wolf's version he has told Phoebe. He feels guilty and decides to go to the town where Faith died, according to the wishes of his girlfriend. The story will change at this point and we will go back to the setback that Faith experienced in Europe and what happened in his last days. <br /> <br /> The best thing about The Invisible Circus is the premiere performance, something that Mr. Brooks must do. A big surprise is Cameron Diaz, who, by faith, chooses light comedy pieces when he can do a very good dramatic work under the right directors. Jordana Brewster is considered an older Phoeb and it makes a great contribution to the film. She is a stunning beauty that seems to be natural for action. Christopher Eccleston is Wolf and shows that he is also able to make a more serious drama. Sweet Camilla Belle plays younger Phoebe quite convincingly. Blythe Danner is the mother of girls. <br /> <br /> Henry Braham captures European locations perfectly. The film is also enhanced by the original song by Nick Laird-Clowes and Petra Haden. Elizabeth Kling changed very elegantly. Ultimately, this film shows Adam Brooks in an excellent form when he gives the novel the right tone and receives a prize if he has the right to do wonders.
