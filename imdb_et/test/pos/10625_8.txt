In general, I found this movie good: extraordinary action with disturbing scenes (some important, some useless) and weak side. Contains spoilers The film is divided into two parts. I thought the first half of the pianist was terrible. We will meet piano teacher Erika Kohut (wonderful Isabelle Huppert) and introduce her to the world. He is a lonely person who tries to find his space against a supernatural and frontier tyrant mother. We understand that it has lost or rarely experienced love as a physical + emotional chemistry: it protects itself because it is sharp and offensive to humans, releases its sexual tensions in sex shops, voyeur or sadistic self-harm. This first half is very clinical and builds incredible tension in the film, almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> Then Walter, a young, beautiful, and outgoing person (played by Benoit Magimel perfectly). Although she can feel Erika at the beginning of the cold, she seduces her and slowly erected Erika. She loves her deeply, but she needs her to fulfill her sadistic desires. When he falls to him, he is outraged by his world and finally we discover that Erika cannot love or feel anything at all (especially since Walter is portrayed as impossible to not love). This is the other side of the film, very touching when we see that Erika's inability / inexperience to love leads her to self-destruction. In this second half, Haneke seemed to feel less, and sometimes they had non-reliable (ie too shocking) scenes that paradoxically reduced drama. <br /> <br /> Of course, this raw film is at least in French: you can see pornstars, bold distortions and sexual scenes in the sex shop. The story we talked about between Magimel and Huppert was quite good, I thought, and it is central to understanding Erika's diseased relations with love. As for the actors, Huppert is wonderful throughout the film, Magimel is better and better until he is perfected, and Girardot (mother) is great. <br /> <br />
