On the plot of this episode, there are two groups of separate migrant workers, The Anticans and Selae, who try to defeat and eat each other at every turn. The two sides really hate each other, and Riker and Tasha must keep them and keep them in trouble. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, a mysterious anomaly around the ship will damage and kill some crew members. But at the end of the episode, the same spatial anomaly holds a valuable member of the crowd. Can they save him so they can continue with space exploration? <br /> <br /> Note: This episode marks the second appearance of Irish actress Colm Meaney in TNG after "Encounter at Farpoint".
