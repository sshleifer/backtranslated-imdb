Acting as a kind of centerpiece "Waiting for Guffman" and "Powerful Wind", "Best in Show" depicts a dog show and a variety of people who bring friends to their dogs. Some are weird, some crazy and otherwise, but they all make the movie good. Director Christopher Guest is especially funny as homosexual Harlan Pepper, trying to advertise his dog very much. Eugene Levy, Parker Posey, Michael McKean, Catherine O'Hara and Bob Balaban are also doing great jobs (I can't imagine they're not doing great jobs, at least not in Christopher Guest's movie). Like someone who has never attended an exhibition, this film is my main exposure to them. They will definitely look clean.
