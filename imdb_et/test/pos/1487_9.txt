This series is about a silly and unusual English gentleman who is getting up with all kinds of joyful accidents. <br /> <br /> I remember how Mr Bean looked back at my family in 1990 when I was still a child. My family laughed so hard for every episode and its content is still in our daily conversation twenty years later. The memorable scenes that are still in my head are Mr Bean, who is trying to get out of his car park by shooting the sheep and his pool. We bought all Mr Bean's videos from VHS, not when they were expensive. It was worth it because we looked at them again and again! It's so rare to see a very funny TV series that fits all ages.
