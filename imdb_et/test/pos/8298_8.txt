I am also serious, I mean, you can't get me wrong if you are not twisted for this type of Z-class, this is the function of a mad creature {why are you looking at my first thought?}, Then this rating is about 3 to 4 out of ten cups, but for me it's a special nonsense that takes me back to a nice time in childhood. You know what memories you will never miss. I suffer all this with youthful admiration, like Doug McClure and Peter Cushing under the tunnel coat, to fight with many creatures and human species. And guys !! Now we've all grown up, we can admire the most serious of Caroline Munro's wonders and her cracking. No wonder my older brother wanted to bring me to this cinema! <br /> <br /> Yes, the consequences are bad, suits, clothes benches, parrot monsters and exploding rubber frog as things entertain us very much. And yes, Cushing and the surprisingly slick McClure act as if they were really attracted by evil Meyhase on the "core" of our film. But that does not mean that zany and clunky and brilliant colors are, the Earth's core is a setback to a special pre-ILM time, as children like me queue around to see such a joyous mess. 8/10
