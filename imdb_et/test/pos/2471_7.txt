The strengths of the film were clear for the beginning and middle of the film. It showed how very violent, reactive power reacts to resistance. The film, which has been filmed with a documentary film, will hit what would have happened if the United States were to enforce the right to fight. Volunteering for a "punishment park", a place for school work for police, where you are bullied and harassed, would offer you this terrible scenario. It is between the prosecution judges and the police fleeing in the park, the training of the officers at their disposal, the judges in their free time, among many other things. It was a very strong, deeply moving film. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I had was the realism. Officials are often seen as holding pistols, as they were with a seven-year-old plastic toy (ie 90 degrees bent elbow when he saw someone's gun, or how one policeman just looks like it's hard to hit someone if they are?) Etc etc.) . It starts with an honest and interesting attempt to capture the very critical state of political affairs. By the end of the film, the viewer is slowly and again reminded of the prejudice of the director and the producers. The story of antagonistic characters begins with real, real people, and then progresses slowly to "stereotypical, objective evil forces." The mistakes they make are foolish, the violence they show is unrealistic, and unlike the way the real police act, the judges' trial has shown foolish and unrealistic mistakes among many other things. <br /> <br /> The parts of the movie began to break down when it turned out that it was just one blank check attempt to make the government bad. And it comes from an anarchist. After all, scenes began to hockey, unreal and a thousand times too dramatic. But for this earlier part, it allows a very moving story.
