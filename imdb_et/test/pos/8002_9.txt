I really wanted to make this movie 10. I've long thought it was a favorite of my four modern live-action Batman movies (and maybe it's still - I don't have to watch Schumacher again). I'm also worried about whether I am somehow unconsciously contradictory. You see, I always liked Schumacher movies. As far as I can remember, they were either 9s or 10s. But the common wisdom is that two Tim Burton-directed movies are much better. I had serious problems with the first Burton Batman - this time I gave it to 7 - and I apologize because I could just feel that Batman's returns have too many small directions, plot and script problems but scattered to justify 10. <br /> < br /> But Burton _supplies these problems with stylish force, and although there are many small bugs, Batman's return is still a great movie, especially if you're a Burton fan, as Batman's return has the same total Nightmare before Christmas (1993) and Edward Scissorhands (1993) 1990), like anything else in the Batman universe. <br /> <br /> The film begins strongly, Cobblepot has a child. We see their fear - people go out of the birth room, ready for horror. Later the baby is a small cage. Finally, they take the evening wage and throw it on the Gotham city. The baby reaches Batman's traitor (Danny DeVito). <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is a movie about "evil capital" that is comparable to Grissom (Jack Palance) in Batman. He is planning on Gotham City in different ways, and we see him emotionally with his secretary, Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer), his secretary. When Kyle discovers one unpleasant plot, Grissom tries to get rid of him, but the cats save him, becoming a cat owner. <br /> <br /> While all this is happening, Penguin, who has long been the only rumor that exists and is believed to be dangerous, starts a scheme that is presented to the public as a good guy, despite having less benevolent , rear motives. <br /> <br /> Before watching Burton's Batman films again this time, I didn't remember how few movies about Batman (Michael Keaton). It is almost the same as Burton does not feel that the character is interesting enough to focus. There's a lot more focus here on the villains, especially Penguin. Batman doesn't appear very often, especially at the beginning of the movie, and surprisingly we look at him with a penguin. <br /> <br /> While some viewers are mistaken for the above mistakes, I may not say I will do even if I would like to know more about Batman and see more of his story. The stories of the villagers are interesting, and when Batman's return is a "story of origin" for the two biggest Batman villains, it is more than complicated in terms of schedule. <br /> <br /> However, there are some character problems that I read in error. The penguin has circus artists doing their bids, but although they are often on screen, we can never learn anything from it. Burton has a symbol that is as intriguing as the ones available in Tod Browning's Freaks (1932), where actors are as interesting as Vincent Schiavelli, but he has no room for their use. <br /> <br /> He doesn't have enough room to explore Catwoman. The film plays as if Catwoman had both developed and as many scenes as The Penguin, but it would have been 4 hours long. So much of Catwoman's scenes had to be cut out. Of course, this leaves room for Batman. At Burton, Batman is very dark on this film, and it doesn't bother to solve it. When we know Gothamides still think that Batman is a murderous madman. This is an interesting development, but unfortunately it fell between this film and the next. <br /> <br /> In the scenario, although there are small problems, including some non-sequential and odd decisions (logic), made with letters, it is clear that Burton and the writers Sam Hamm and Daniel Waters are not catching the traditional story to tell. Many dialogues are committed, but often it is quite fine and / or complex (sometimes it is very coarse or transparent). It helps to look at Batman's return as a "more poetic" film, as I think it was an intention. It also passes to more general plot and referral decisions - the overall mood or style is served by a lot of odd activities, including small characters, and this style works very well. <br /> <br /> "Dark" is the easiest way to sum up Batman from a word, and whether it is positive or negative depends on your disposition. Anyone who knows me knows I love the blind. So for me, Burton's style greatly exceeds the plot and script errors. In many ways, Batman Returns is a crazy, creepy horror movie that is beautifully frightening. Like Batman, Burton still makes a number of references to other films, but instead of Vertigo (1958) and Star Wars (1977), he still refers to films such as Nosferatu (1922) (including Max. Schreck "was the name of an actor who played a similar character to Drakula), Motel Hell (1980), the aforementioned Freaks, Willy Wonka and Chocolate Factory (1971) (having a surreal, dark edge) and zombie films - which are most clearly expressed in Penguin in the last scene. <br /> <br /> In terms of visual and general atmosphere - and it includes story, features and so on - it can't be stronger 10.
