In truth, I'm not talking about Tamil and I don't understand this movie. My good Tamil friend Kaneswaran Kumarswamypillai (wow, what a long name) explained to me. What a great movie !!! After watching this movie, I felt that I should have seen many more films from Tollywood (the Tamil film industry). War scenes were amazing, the camera worked great and the plot was beautiful. Actress "Simran", what a beauty. Give her a prize for the best vision. Ding, Ding, Ding, come on the scent of OSCAR. I don't understand the songs, but they were great. Mani Ratnam is a great director and I hope his next film was successful.
