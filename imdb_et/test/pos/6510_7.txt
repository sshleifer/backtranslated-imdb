Okay, I think we all agree that Michael Jackson was a lower point. <br /> <br /> Also special effects. But please, remember that it wasn't a big budget, okay? Not every movie gets as much budget as Harry Potter or Star Wars. <br /> <br /> But I thought it was funny. B-? Nothing that I don't think will waste your time. <br /> <br /> Parodies are always fun to watch and just because it wasn't a big budget, doesn't mean it's bad. <br /> <br /> I think it was a good movie, in some points weak. <br /> <br /> I hope this comment will help. ~ Angela
