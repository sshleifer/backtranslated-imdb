If (as I just pointed out in GOATIS) Keaton observes that the comics are against the law, it is Langdon's short (last before he did TRAMP, TRAMP, TRAMP) with another comedy - married to his wife and trying to get some secret two timings. Laurel & Hardy did it in a number of films such as Fields and Chaplin. <br /> <br /> Do I have problems with this - why do these characters always marry such nasty women? And there is an interesting sociological aspect to the question - why don't you find female comics who are married to male colleagues? I don't remember any one except Carol Burnett's skit, where two pairs of odd members discover that they prefer someone to give it back as good as they can (sort of reciprocal sad-masochism, but also the certainty that they are not married with type approval) . As for the fact that comics are getting married, I think you can imagine they get what they deserve. Or are they? Ollie really deserves a woman who throws her pots and dishes? Yes, he went to this conference when his plans were destroyed, but he wanted to have a private time - there is nothing to suggest that he and Stan are deceiving their wives. In fact, he was stripped by Mae Busch because he lied to him when Stan collapsed and told his wife the truth. <br /> <br /> Here is Harry's wife (Alice Ward) who tells her mother how she keeps her under strict control. We see Harry at work (it's Saturday morning and work ends at noon the rest of the weekend - it was five weeks a week, 40 hours a week in industry). He works at a foundry where he would cube the shape of a red hot metal (early joke about Langdon - he is a small, light person, not a muscle weaver who shines with a shaving device). He just leaves his tram, trying to give the person light. He is calling home to explain things and to regret longing. <br /> <br /> At home, Harry meets his prayer with Steve (Vernon Dent), who has met two nice, sweet girls who would just love the date. Harry is hesitant, but agrees with it after talking to the girl (he agrees to pay for the forties of hot dogs - he has a silver half dollar in his pocket in 1926). But his plans seem to be on track when his wife discovers the cache of his hidden coins. He keeps it hidden under the carpet of the living room and finds it walking along the edge of the carpet. But his wife laughs at him and confiscates it all. Later he sees him talking to himself and pampering him. In contempt, he gives him a dime back and says he can treat his day with soda. <br /> <br /> But Harry has another monument that dresses up the date and goes out. He and Dent are probably late and Dent blames Harry, but Harry is trying to make him: he produces two prostitutes. They get into trouble when Dent (wisely) says they're not the type of girls he called "nice". Finally, the girls show up and the date begins. But soon Harry hides in the robbery because her husband is driving past his roadster, and girls' boyfriends are turning up - they hate their two rivals. <br /> <br /> Short works well and is fun and gives you a better idea of ​​what Harry Langdon has been developing as a comic strip artist. He is constantly on the side of others. She can't get her street because some strangers are asking for smoke and light, and eventually the stranger gets her own. A nice girl who is Harry's date is a small dog who denies her. He rests between two cars, both of which start driving and get around the mast. It certainly shows that Langdon had the personality of his screen down when he did his own peculiarities. If only he had to save the complex as a whole, these three would go beyond the first.
