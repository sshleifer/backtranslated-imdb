An interesting look at the experiences of immigrants, talked about as a fable with some very strange. <br /> <br /> I got this movie because it talks about Sicilian immigrants who traveled to America. I imagine as much as my grandfather did at that time. Driving with a steering wheel to provide ships with ballast, I can't imagine it was very comfortable, as shown in this movie. <br /> <br /> Immigrant-restrictive laws existed. I think these laws were stricter for those who came from the Mediterranean and Africa. Immigrants were supposed to be free from infectious diseases or hereditary deficiencies. In the film, we see physical and mental exams, the latter because low intelligence is hereditary. Individual women could not enter the country on the assumption that they would become prostitutes, so most married men in the country, as before, are in Ellis Iceland before entering. <br /> <br /> This is a story of a British immigrant (Charlotte Gainsbourg) who is arranging to marry a poor Sicily (Vincenzo Amato). He tries to get his family through with a son who is silent and a mother (Aurora Quattrocchi), which is considered weak. By the way, he had a fantastic role. <br /> <br /> You will also see Vincent Schiavelli, the most recent appearance of his character. I don't know if his last movie has been released. He plays a toy expert and is also very good. <br /> <br /> It was a strange but enjoyable movie. It is not for everyone, because I imagine that those who have no interest in immigrant experiences will find it quite slowly.
