If you like movies that think you are, this is one of the best. I always liked David Lynch and Cronenberg. They have always made quality films. <br /> <br /> Iain Softley has managed K-PAX perfectly. Film tears in feelings and mind and world philosophy. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges both offer great acting skills. It hit me, I didn't take off the screen during the movie. On the other hand, if you expect a special-effect sci-fi movie, it's not for you. The story is dragged a little bit, which can be a bit boring, but it also works as a way to build a movie theme. <br /> <br /> Enjoy this movie.
