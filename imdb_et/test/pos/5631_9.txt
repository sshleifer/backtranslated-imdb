I rented this movie for two reasons. The first one was all the good things I read about it. I was definitely impressed and I could no longer read to read all the comments. Another reason is that I know these men. I don't know Mark or Mike. He hasn't changed for many years when we knew each other. I know him from a local Milwaukee radio station (WMSE) as a "cleaner". How she's in this movie is really Mike 100%. He gave me one table he did. It was a little, about 15 inches, said Metallica. It was a strange thing if it was just two feet, sometimes it is the idea that counts and Mike first thought first.
