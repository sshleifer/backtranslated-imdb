Based on Tomas Rivera's book, "... And the Earth was not swallowed by him", which is the film for the eyes of most people. It talks about the exploitation of immigrant farmers to survive. <br /> <br /> Sergio Perez uses Rivera's story to depict impressionist methods. She uses wall and grayscale effects to portray some scenes, and she uses specific photographic techniques to make the scenes look like they were in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Perez also gives life to the movie using appropriate music, including ballading and guitar playing. <br /> <br /> I think this is a good movie because it shows in detail how the migrant workers live, what they do for entertainment and their beliefs.
