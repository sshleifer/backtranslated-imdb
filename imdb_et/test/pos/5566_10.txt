This series is significantly underestimated. Like many others, I came to Farscape after canceling the series. Bought the 1st season and was surprised to find a wisely-written drama with balanced proportions, intercourse, romance, wit and of course sci-fi. Immediately after the bat he got to 10 to be the first series or film that satisfies us, how our hero - and every foreigner he comes across - speaks in English! Okay, some others have deviated from this question, but Farscape did the best. The point is that the writers pay special attention to the details to show the exhibitions as credibly as possible. <br /> <br /> With so much bad programming out there, it's a shame that a balanced and fun series like Farscape isn't getting enough exposure and recognition to stay in production. Although we enjoy four-year-old and fortunately four-hour mini-certificates, maybe we can make enough noise to convince manufacturers to continue the show.
