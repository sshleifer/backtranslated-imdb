This movie offers you an exciting journey between today's most exciting city - Istanbul - and its musicians. Don't expect Turkish folklore or anything like that. Alexander Hacke, a German musician and cult band "Einst√ºrzende Neubauten", travels to Istanbul for a musical scene. His rare voice he is experiencing is the guiding line of the film. But mainly German-Turkish director Faith Akin lets different Istanbul artists talk - and of course their music. <br /> <br /> You will meet a wide range of personalities, big stars and street musicians, young and old people who play different musical styles. But this movie does not only introduce you to the sound of Istanbul. It also drives today the compelling images of Istanbul and how Turkey has moved forward over the last decade. The film characterizes its main character with subtle humor, but never with respect. All of them share a passion for music and faith in their power. <br /> <br /> Akin shows his talent again to portray diversity easily by bringing you completely different musical scenes. After winning the award-winning feature film "Gegen die Wand" (leader is), Akin believes in being able to touch, entertain, and instruct his audience in a documentary film with "Crossing the Bridge". If you've never been to Istanbul, you want to go there after seeing the movie.
