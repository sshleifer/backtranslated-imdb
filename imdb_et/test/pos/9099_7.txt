For those who loved "Wayne's World" ... "Blues Brothers" ... and hell, even "Raiders of the Lost Ark", you'll find a lot like (but probably not love) "Tenacious D: Pick" of Destiny, "is a fictional epic about the formation of the band JB (Jack Black) / KG (Kyle Gass). Two out of work losers who love rock n'roll meet in a dilemma when KG's long-term mother stops sending her rentals; JB and KG are playing Rock and roll to the Hall of Fame following a serviced music shop official (inspired by Ben Stiller) who talks to them about the zero picture (funny animated-tapestry sequence.) Along the way, our zeros come in contact with strangers (Tim Robbins), Sasquatch, stoner with security guards, corporation chicks and satan (ironically cast Dave Grohl), in a climate that must be seen believed (and preferably played with high volume.) Rarely do I see comedies in the theater, but "Pick" is a very nice change at a pace ... it may not reach up to 11, but it brings both raw and smart tuning for 90 minutes. And the songs are inspired by low eyebrows. Recommended. <br /> <br /> 6.5
