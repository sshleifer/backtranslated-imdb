Another masterpiece that needs a DVD, but some libraries have VHS and it's worth looking for. Just play a lot of things, especially euthanasia, "respect", religion and basic human relationships. The script effectively uses intelligent humor not only to cope with a problem such as a child with severe disabilities but to associate parents with love "Jo" and against each other. Like a couple, Alan Bates and Janet Suzman are perfect for life with virtuosity and deep, intelligent characters. <br /> <br /> I have recently seen Bates' great results "Butley", a few years after the film "Joe Egg" appeared as a film, and he plays the teacher in both cynical, intellectual and funny, although Butley is much darker than his Bry nature. If you miss such great performances as "The Go-Between", "Women in Love", "Whistle Down the Wind", "Caregiver" and "Georgy Girl", let's not mention the more obvious "Hearts King" and "Zorba Greek" and I'd say that Alan Bates had a career comparable to Peter O'Toole, Albert Finney and other great British actors of his era. <br /> <br /> One of my all-time favorites, The Ruling Class, which appeared in the same year (1972) as "Joe Egg", which includes a career year in anyone's book. He was a kind of spotted filmography ("Krays" was another highlighting), but these two gems mark him as a great director.
