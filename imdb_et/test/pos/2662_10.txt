This movie is definitely one of the biggest films ever made. It is a story that is spoken at a constant pace, no longer with words, but with cinematographic means of expression. The perfect combination of spectacular special effects and classical music brings to life the imagination of human imagination both realistically and poetically. The story itself is quite simple at first glance. As the title suggests, there is an archetypal journey, a motif that is repeated for thousands of years. This motif was always used to depict not only space and time, but also the distance away, but it also had a rich philosophical meaning. Film is poetic thinking about the most exciting eternal issues. It's not just human odyssey; this is the odyssey of our species. The film itself is great, but in my case, this impression always mixes with this book. I have read it at the age of 10, not really thinking about such issues as "what is the connection between human evolution and human morale development". But the impression was big enough to make me a science fiction genre. <br /> <br /> On the day I was studying '2001', only the special effects of the Oscar were given and even the best picture not mentioned was the day when "Academy Award" became two words, which does not mean anything to me.
