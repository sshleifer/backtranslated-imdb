What is the most violent film of all time? Rambo III? Commando? Robocop? Add these three very violent matches and you still do not equal any career in the Stabilization, which is the most wooded, hardest and worst acting film. Hundreds of minutes of things breathe and people die in tens of strange ways. It makes you laugh and rejoice, and if it is all over, you have more than a little exhausted. This film is a buried pearl, a cult classic, lacking a cult. <br /> <br /> The stabilizer is the nickname of our hero Peter Goldson (Peter O'Brian). He arrives in Indonesia in the footsteps of the poor and Greg Rainmaker. We know he's bad because he's just called his full name ("I hate SCUM like Greg RAINmaker!") And is using a killing method that's so terrible that I can't even say it here. Wait, yes, I can. He goes to people who are bright shoes. Greg Rainmaker: Cleat Killer. <br /> <br /> When Greg Rainmaker does not spend women on her sexual pleasure, she robs important professors and drives an immense underworld empire. Goldson (Jewish hero? Guse!) And his dirty team's task is to stabilize the situation by killing everything and blowing a lot of things. Maybe "stabilizing" has a different meaning in Indonesia. <br /> <br /> And violence, oh violence. It is a movie that does not want to, can not, without being able to let the five minutes of the screen go without any explosion, knifing, car accident or interrupting dialogue. Violence is extreme; not graphic and bloody, just very weird. For example, a stabilizer and a company penetrate one of the Rainmaker Warehouses (naturally, driving through a motorcycle solid concrete wall). By the balcony, when heavy lights come down below, the stabilizer does what it can do. He drives out of the balcony with his boy's head, his front tire slipping like a basketball. Amazing. <br /> <br /> Excessive beloved scenes (both major female characters create a bag with a hero of their choice, not two minutes after they first spoke alone) a badly dubbed dialogue ("Victor, you talented bastard!" ) The stabilizer has everything. These are old films, right from Citizen Kane and Gymkata. It is not widely available for distribution. If you find it at any price, buy it and enjoy the madness. <br /> <br />
