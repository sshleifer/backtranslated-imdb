In 2005, the most incredible year in the history of Dr.Who falls. Everything seemed to click; The first-rate new doctor and companion, big audiences (10 million first episodes and specialties of Christmas), great prizes, critical praise and idiots who spent years when they were apparently incapable of negotiating stairs with Dalek were well and truly silent. But then Christopher Eccleston dropped the bomb, ending only one series. It seemed that the honeymoon was over. Fortunately, the public seems to have embraced his successor, the great David Tennant. In addition, the show has a good S.F.X, like a spacecraft that falls "Big Ben" "Aliens in London" and with great storylines, such as "Teeth and Claws", "Rubber Army / Doomsday". The new Dr.Who is basically the same as the old one, which was only renewed in the 21st century. Some fans have blamed Russell. They must remember that for sixteen years he didn't show him until he came.
