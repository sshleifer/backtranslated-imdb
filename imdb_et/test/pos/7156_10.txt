the most "spiritual" movie I've seen for a long time. maybe ever. also one scene around the dining room table comic perfection. I understand that a release date will be published in the autumn. when it comes to your city and want to see a movie that makes you think it is it. Aviva is great in this, and she is definitely a future star - (Superb is now out where she is) - all actors are fully calibrated. This film has a tone that is used to surprise you. I don't know what to call it - it's comedy, but the insignificant message is so harsh and direct that "comedy" is not a big enough word for it. I love this movie. It's a comedy of a man of thought. but even this phrase is not good enough. The FTF has a message and this message has to be heard right away
