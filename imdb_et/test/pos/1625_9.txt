As a fan of the book, this work is fantastically adapted; source material and honestly show respect for literary work. The intrigues translate well into the film Ron Howard's good eye so they know the details and commit themselves to authenticity. <br /> <br /> I like Hanks like Robert Langdon. His portrayal is genuine and earthy, only "the day". She is a good dramatic actor and although I miss her comedy efforts, I enjoy her more serious performances. <br /> <br /> The theme is no less controversial than the DaVinci code and the Vatican never seems to learn their lesson. Like the film mentioned above, the Holy See also gave wretched revenge and demanded a worldwide Catholic boycott film, which naturally generated millions of ticket sales. <br /> <br /> While this is a story about "God Of Particles", it was dramatically played and science was written out of scientific literature that had remained in the fiction, was fun and very well done, and the truth is, people who haven't read the book , doesn't notice a story-related or smaller element because the screen version carries the main story independently. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is not necessary to see this first installment of the franchise to enjoy another one that should have been honest all the time, Although it does not reduce efficiency or interfere with the continuity or flow of this second job. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is good to see a Friday / Saturday night, although the exercise can be a bit harsh for the little ones. <br /> > 8.8 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
