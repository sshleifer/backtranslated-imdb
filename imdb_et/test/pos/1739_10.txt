I remember being so excited on Saturday evening when I was a child, waiting for dr. I thought it was the best exhibition ever made. Then I grew up, Dr. Who went out of the air and someone I didn't know would ever have heard of it. Then I found out there was a new series. I was a little nervous about it. Was it supposed to meet the expectations I had gone through because I was little? Do they screw? What dr. Wonder? Does his assistant wonder? Do they create a closer relationship with dr and his assistant? YES, NO, NO, NO, NO! This show is wonderful! I love the new dr. I love this example. And I find myself excited on Friday night, waiting for a "new" episode. I see the episodes of 2005 as I live, so I'm a little behind the others. I hope the next dr is as big as this!
