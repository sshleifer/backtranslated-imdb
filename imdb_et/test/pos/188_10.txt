The current cinema production, especially American cinema, has been trying to see Oscar winning foreign films. Then I found this jewel. Starting slowly, it rises nicely when war is declared. Basically this is done by the old-fashioned girl-boy-back-war-story, performances, cinema, so much more. Why Tatyana Samojlova as a young woman did not become an international star after me (although she has been successful in her country). You take with him a journey: a young, defiant young man who, due to the destruction of the war, becomes a very calm, harsh woman who keeps the shine of hope (her last scene is devastating). We love him as much as the camera does. And camera-work! Was it the pioneer of handheld cameras? It really adds the story right away. And its beauty (like when Tatiana's character runs up the stairs and next to the lamp fence). I'm humble and grateful to watch this movie.
