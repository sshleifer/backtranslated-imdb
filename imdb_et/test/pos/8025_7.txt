I saw this movie last night and thought it was decent. It has moments I think you would say. Some scenarios with special ops were cool and some location images were very authentic. I'm not going to put this movie in my DVD collection, but it's fair to rent. I think nothing has set the film to another level compared to the same genre. The action is good, the actor is decent, I think the women are extremely seductive and exotic, and the story is quite interesting. 7 out of ten
