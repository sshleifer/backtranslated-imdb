I really enjoyed this movie and I'm not a classical music fan. It was a good idea to look at the discovery of classical music and the heavy street boys who changed their way, without being sentimental or too unbelievable, although some details were scratching my head (Frankie and his dog could live in the basement of the school without any Does he eat? What does she feed her dog? The school owner didn't consider it important to report the missing boy to the police, but let her live in the basement indefinitely? :-)). But we can let this unrealistic detail move and just enjoy the touching, fun and slightly stopping (for me) story and wonderfully talented kids. <br /> <br /> I loved the scene on mothers permanent shoulder side steps that prevent police from going to school: I doubt they can get away from it today. And I liked the nice touch of Frankie's property to turn the tables to her (though it never went anywhere), and Frankie's friends who helped her out. <br /> <br /> All in all, there was a great movie for everyone!
