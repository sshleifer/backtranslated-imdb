GREEN ABBREVIATIONS (Anders Thomas Jensen - Denmark 2003). <br /> <br /> How do the Danes get those films that are consistently funny, sharply written, filmed and full of great performances? GREEN ABBREVIATIONS is a dark and maliciously funny comedy that is in many ways Denmark's opposite EATING RAOUL and DELICATESSEN, but it has more to offer than just laughing or parody. <br /> <br /> The film brings to us a chronic pothead Bjarne (Nikolay Lie Kaas) and a chronic sweating sage (Mads Mikkelsen) duo. The sick of these bad bosses, the two pals decide to open their butcher shop in a small Danish city, but initially the business is slow and customers stay away. When an electrician accidentally locks up and freezes to his muscle cup, Svend decides to turn the man's thighs into a fillet, which he immediately called "chickie-wickies". This special dish is suddenly flocked with its counter, and Svend - who cannot resist this unexpected leap - becomes a serum murder when Bjarne acts as his reluctant companion. But soon, under the leadership of their former boss, many people in the city start wondering what special ingredients the two men use. <br /> <br /> Without the extraordinary performances of Kaase and Mikkelsen, the film may not have risen above the average black comedy. On paper, the character of Svend can be limited to a caricature, but the portrait of Mads Mikkelsen is a serious, insecure and deeply twisted man, but Mikkelsen is able to scare, joke and move him at the same time. The cover actually plays a double role, playing its common friend Eigil. When watching the movie, I don't understand that it was the same actor. Other appearances are just as great with each of the city-style refreshments with some really great vignettes. <br /> <br /> The subject is, of course, a bit sick and the material may not be completely fresh by considering quite a few predecessors who dealt with similar material, but director Jensen gives him a fresh twist and manages to build some real characters in the strange duet of Svend and Bjarne with its wonderfully strange story of two social misconceptions. /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
