Here is an intelligent blend of typical Hongkongmovieshootouts, world influences and intelligent film making. Not that the script does not have its big holes and some professional factors are a bit ambitious. But cinema is an optical gear and the soundtrack is first-rate. The blend of quick consequences and colorful, slow, sometimes almost poetic parts has no comparison between your films, so the classification is quite difficult. The closest genre is a disaster or a terrorist struggle with deeper human and political remarks. It is worth looking at cinemas around the world. But I hope it is for so many other (mostly Asian) films and no one seems to believe me. Sorry.
