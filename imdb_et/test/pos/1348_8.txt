I hit this movie in the Los Angeles screening of OutFest in July 2006. It is rough around the edges (especially the sound recording is uncertain) and often very funny. The script is rather harshly episodic and ends abruptly, but Ash Christian infuses the movie with a lot of real heart. It is also a refreshing pace of change to get a gay movie that doesn't mean underwear models that are embedded in party and straight boys. Turning to the warm sympathetic Jonathan Caouette, who is Mr Cox, the tribal spirit of Rodney (Ash Christian), the lively and delightful Ashley Finke as Rodney's best friend and Deborah Theaker Rodney's mother, who is given the best liners of the script and steals his every scene. The film is like his writer / director / star lumpy and a bit strange, but also very sweet.
