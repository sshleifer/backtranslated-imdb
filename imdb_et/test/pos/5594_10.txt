Yikes! and we all thought that Joan Crawford was a dreadful mommy ... well Laura Hope Crewes as a mother in this passionate 4-seat movie delivering (and holding) this marriage to mangle mangle cracker ..... SILVER CORD is truly sensational the code, which was made in 1932 and appeared in 1932. So amazing, honest and honest is the interchange of each generation between one son's spouse (IreneDunne) and the other groom, as these two younger girls are fighting together - a cleverly angry mother clearly bleeding in front of her mother's older sons. Joel MacCrea and his younger beau / son paid gently and beautifully to 25-year-old actor Eric Linden. I think this movie played in many large theaters in 1933 with a lot of commendable respecters and even offers the audience a very fruitful melodrama in 2005, which was livened up by the splitting dialogue that is not afraid to call the mother just as it is. It would be impossible to make this film after the censorship arrived after 1934. Other viewer comments for IMDb support my reaction and you'll find almost everyone happy to see (and record) SILVER CORD agrees that it is an unforgettable and sharp script on a perfectly produced film. It would have been like the VIRGINIA WOLF of 1932. Laura Hope Crewes had to kiss RKO's stage for this vital role ... but more than her fluffy GWTW. Irene Dunne is as proud and casual and credible as ever, fighting again for her husband, and it is worth mentioning The Divorc√©e, made in 1929 as a companion to SILVER CORD. Joel MaCrea is definitely in the same league as Cary Grant and Randolph Scott in beautiful and lovable contributions. I've never seen Eric Linden in a real acting role (he played the leg amputator at the GWTW hospital's horror scene) and here he is amazing and youthful, with a great role as Robert, a younger and more sensitive son. Some verbal barbs that leveled him again would not stay beyond the code office when it was later done. This is a really good movie, and if the viewer delivers some of the newspaper's pleasures and lives for the stress-free spin-offs that are unsuitable for the 1932 film, you have a good reward. First of all, I thought that a mother's sore throbbing melodrama was dated until I realized that it was a great scenario that made the viewer laugh as if she were a weak little old woman ...... NO. .... but the other two women in this power do not play the movie, so a fantastic retort dialogue. This rolled ocean ship is LEVIATHAN, a US warship winning in the US, which was so big and clumsy that the crews were the nerve wrecks that were trying to wrestle with the Atlantic. It is notorious when plowing first tends to be in front of a colossal wave and over the brush at an angle where the spine is broken along the bottom and the vessel is divided vertically between the funnels. It slips into a harbor where there were robbing steel panels and outstanding rivet holes ... and a mentally broken team and passengers. It was broken in 1935, after being cursed with the mechanical problems of the horrors. Not such a war prize after all. <br /> <br /> In any case, the SILVER CORD dialogue has enough excitement for one night: eg: "Mom! The doctor said there was nothing wrong with you, in fact he said he would take the dynamite to kill you". Whammo!
