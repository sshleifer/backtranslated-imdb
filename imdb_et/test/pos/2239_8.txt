I just looked at 100 movies under IMDb users who see if there is anything else to see, what I haven't yet, and I found the legacy of this small screen. One of those cases when you see a movie that is ranked as one of the worst, and you just have to be one of the few who really love it. Well, I think I can get ridiculous and spit here, but for me it was a pretty good flick when I saw it. But it has been for some time, I remember it was on HBO late at night and I looked at it two or three times and I haven't really seen it and I would like to see it again knowing that Jolie was aware of it. The story is followed by a cyber and a guy who is trying to escape the clutches of this company and some hunter hunters after them. I think it's basically all that is, throw some scenes with Jack Palance and we have our movie. Some good activities here and there, as well as blood and violence. There is also a love story in the game, as well as a cyber of women and a man who taught him to fight each other for love. Sometimes the dialogue sometimes becomes quite bad and it is far from a higher film, but for a b-movie it is really good. I don't know if it was a theatrical release because it doesn't look good enough for it, but it makes one of the best videos if it was one of them.
