This sitcom was in 1984 - 1985. It was a time when people saw abandoned streets in most overcrowded Indian cities when Indian TVs had a sitcom. All this was the result of the establishment of TV stations in the entire Indian nation. This was one of the key elements in the modernization of the Indian television network strategy adopted by Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. This was also followed by his son Rajiv Gandhi. This series gave pure entertainment that much of India's television viewers watched with their black and white TV. The funny thing about this series is that it was sponsored by a local Ayurveda product company. A few days ago I saw some episodes of this series, but there was no general laughter equation. This proves that it can be over time changing. Entertainment material loses its charm and keeps people's minds.
