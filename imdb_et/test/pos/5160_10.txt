I really didn't see it. Roy Andersson was with me, I'm the perfect infant of the static camera (long-lasting King Borowczyk!) And smiled hysterically in the first fifteen minutes of the movie, he hit me directly between the eyes. You have to be a brilliant man who makes fun of himself. Andersson reminds me of a third companion, Moby Dick, a man in the flask, who took all his life as a practical joke that a good lord himself is playing for us. And the web of egotism of this movie is really fun. <br /> <br /> Satire levels are on the fever limit, you have one frustrated self-conscious dreamer harp about the cruelty of the world and then completely ignore the spiritual self-refinement that cries in torment. The very depths of the special request are tubular. I really didn't think it would be possible to go beyond that in Bergman's "Silence". However, the grotesque nature of self-confidence and self-esteem is fabulous according to the individual character of each film. We have been shown a presence where talented and idle trains against the world they believe are unfair to them, they are really legends in their dwellings. The people in this movie make self-deception and self-deception a great form of art! <br /> <br /> Only one woman in the movie seems to have some idea of ​​what's going on. The old woman who refuses to leave the chapel, kneeling in prayer for the forgiveness of all mankind, is the most condemned condemnation of her speech in the modern world that I have ever heard. With his prayers, he reveals that the world does not have to be wrongly set, there are only a few mistakes, an abyss of corruption that can only be corrected by immigration, and court day. Watching this film made me feel like a monk, stood deep in the middle of the cold river in the winter, screaming a thousand Kyrie elions for the sins of mankind. The other big deal is that it is clear that his prayers are meaningless, and in fact he stops all who go home at the time of closing. <br /> <br /> This is not a cunning movie, no one has been saved, there are no idols left on the altar, no group of people is the prize of another group. Never has our summation of sins been greater than surprising. It's a movie to the end of the world, it's a great life, a great human life with a funny practical joke! <br /> <br /> It is too difficult to choose a favorite from the catalog of images, I hit my thigh and almost fell under my chair at the cinema, shouting with a laugh when the man tried to pull down the designated service. I do not break what happens, but intercourse accumulates and something really unexpected happens. This is probably the funniest thing I've ever seen in the cinema. I'm quite reserved and I just couldn't control myself: it's the size of this movie. <br /> <br /> "You, Life" shooting is perfectly formal. We are shown an artist's palette, a dark brown, yellow, gray and luminous brass shock of a living sky blues. Never has a tone, it's like half an hour of the Whistlerian symphonic painting. An extraordinary thing is the obsession that has to place this color scheme. And no strokes are wasted, as with all great films, there is no stock of celluloid. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best movie I've ever seen is.
