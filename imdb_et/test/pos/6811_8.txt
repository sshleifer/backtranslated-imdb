The first new style of movies is Lamas-no tattoos, motorcycles or karate. One of them will leave them. But this is a serious movie. He plays for FBI profiles who have lived for so long when there are bad guys in his head who don't trust anyone, including himself. Gary Busey is either a big actor or someone I wouldn't want to be exposed to in daylight. Kristen Cloke deals with Lamas as hard as she continues to kill the serums. There is one surprise one after another, because the story is not the least. It never seems to come - the story is always another layer. Cloke and Lamas start as good boys, become bad guys and somehow heroes. But it is definitely worth the rent. For maximum enjoyment, throw in a candy bar, a bag of popcorn and a soft drink. You go to the movies!
