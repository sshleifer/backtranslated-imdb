This movie is a classic seventy cop who, for some reason, is unfortunately neglected. It is basically a French linguistic connection that corresponds to Bullit. <br /> <br /> Roy Scheider plays investigators of elite groups called "seven seconds". <br /> <br /> One of their men will be discovered during a secret operation and killed. <br /> <br /> Scheider and his team must find their killers. They are involved in the battle with violence. <br /> <br /> Highlighting a movie must be a chase of a car that is obviously involved in Bullit's success. But this car pursues Bullit's length, speed and excitement. It is a breathtaking ride of roller-miners, which ends quite unexpectedly and remarkably. Don't miss this little legacy!
