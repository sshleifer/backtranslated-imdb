Super original. Really great movie! James Franco and Sienna Miller are on the screen so well. I hope it will come out soon. I saw this for the first time in screening a movie. Because of my age and gender, I was asked to "talk". We all have to comment on the movie and many people didn't like it. I really loved it and I don't know why so many people didn't think it was so good. Go see if it comes out and decide for yourself! One thing you want to do when you see this movie is that he doesn't know anything about it. I knew nothing more than going to the screening as being called "Camile". It's really worth it.
