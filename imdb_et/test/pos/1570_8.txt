In Hollywood, this is a sad condition if you surprise a movie if you don't take the route from the first day. I literally had a clue as to how this movie ended because it went to the left when I waited for it to go right when I could wait for the zag, etc. It could have been easy to get rid of the general temporary thriller or white trash, but it was all the way to the end. But this is a sad story. Not because of what happens to Alice, but because of the sad world that surrounds her and leads it down. <br /> <br /> The plot has a quiet dignity that is usually reserved for the theater, but it may be some effort. In both cases, this is a very good movie, and for some reason I suspect sour grapes from those who are one of those flawless.
