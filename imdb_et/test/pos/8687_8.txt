This is one of my favorite films for several reasons. First of all, there are beautiful productions from beautiful Debra Paget as a princess / dance girl, Michael Rennie as a villain, a beautiful young Jeffrey Hunter who is investigating crime in his city and others. The film is an unusually colorful adventure, and we can even see the princess dance that she later performs (once). He succeeds in hiding Hunter before he learns he is on his side; also photography, Travilla costumes, Lionel Newman's music and film style are unusually good. Add to this racing action, the intelligent character and the good-looking veteran of the Gerald Drayson Adams manuscript, founded by Harmon Jones in 1249, and you have the pleasant ingredients of Grecianized Near-Eastern. But here's a lot of glorious unusual and well-developed story, because much more is praised than the fast pace of the movie, well-managed physical activity, and better technical aspects. Classically trained actors such as Michael Ansara, Edgar Barrier, Wally Cassell, Jack Elam and Dona Drake are not present in any B-movie together; there are also no exciting sets, different places and secrets offered here. One way to evaluate the film is: "If I were to live through the experience, would I decide to conduct these events and do these activities?" Since my answer is "surprising" in this case, this film will remain my favorite and highly undervalued cinematographic work. Could it be that the US critics all too often disdain the female as warriors and thinkers that in so many other cases, closed minds have been caused by the misleading tyranny and entertainment features of this estimated film?
