Evil Ed is a Swedish film about Ed's name (of course) and his collapse into a complete craze after a series of B-horror movies called "The Loose Limbs". Ed becomes so mad that he thinks he sees demons and monsters, but in fact they are the people he knows and the people who are close to him, like his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie back in 1998 and was amazed at what I saw. To date, this film is one of the darkest comedies in my opinion. Since the movie is almost funny with its gore scenes, there are still some awful moments. <br /> <br /> This is a cool scam, but you don't expect anything wonderful. It's just a fun movie that's good to show some of your friends for some laughs. 8/10 stars
