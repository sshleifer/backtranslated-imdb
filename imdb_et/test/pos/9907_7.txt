Sometimes the film is so bad that it is good. This movie was made in Germany and is dubbed in English so you have to get out of it. The way it was done was also stylish and forced, except for what the real rats did with the excellent work of the IMO. Clicking on a rat competitor. In any case, the mayor has decided to reduce costs and local waste collectors will strike as a result, leaving big trash bins everywhere. This story has been used in the past, not to mention in real life (too often unfortunately) and the audience is not surprised. But that's fine. We know what happens and when, and sometimes the audience needs a movie that does not need a lot of brain cells to follow. We have a hero, a hidden face and body, a half-hero (s), and of course our hero, who happens to be a doctor, but only under training, though it is he who discovers what is going on when so many people get sick and die , not just the rat bite. Of course, the villain must die (okay, all the villains, the serpentine) and the final scene is one of those that reminds the audience that there is a sequel in the work. This is one of the movies you just sit and enjoy what it is and what isn't.
