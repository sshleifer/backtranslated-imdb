This film deserves one of the highest ever Hindi comedies ever made. Rajkumar Santoshi is mostly known for his sharp, severe social dramas, but it is simply the simplest film he has made. <br /> <br /> The plot rotates around two small towns of Amari (Aamir Khan) and Premi (Salman Khan). They want to get rich and move to the big city. They hatch the same plan separately - rich rich Raveena (Raveena Tandon), daughter of a rich businessman Ramgopal Bajaj (Paresh Rawal). The one who marries Raveena gets all his wealth. but when they get to know each other's plan, Raveena is married with intense unanimity. Fun gags and situations arise during the battle. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Ramgopal Bajaj wants to lose his brother and sister, identical twin brother Shyamgopal Bajaj, and succeed in the family. Include funny characters in this selection, including Raveena's servant Karishma (Karishma Kapoor), the hero-butler named Robert (Vijoo Khote), headed by Bhalla (Shehzad Khan), who imitates the previous cable Ajeet and funny gangster Gogo (Shakti Kapoor) who sees More out like a pirate and rolling comedy, waiting for you. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time looking for the LOGIC movie. Leave your brain company and just ENJOY. Actors are so much in sync with the script that errors are not left in the room. Dialogues (Rajkumar Santoshi, Dilip Shukla) are smart. Music (Tushar Bhatia) and lyrics (Majrooh Sultanpuri) are memorable. "Yeh Raat Aur Yeh Door", "Ae Lo Ji Sanam" and "Dil Karta Hai Hello Paas Aaoon" picture and choreography (Saroj Khan) are suitable and will, in my opinion, remain forever. <br /> <br /> The film marked two superstars - in-the-making, Aamir Khan and Salman Khan (they finally became superstars). Aamir Khan is impeccable in his first all-comedy role. I welcome the feeling of his comic timing. Salman is compared to Amir but is still nice. Among the supporting characters, Paresh Rawal stands out in two roles of Ramgopal and Shyamgopal. <br /> <br /> The film surprisingly failed at the checkout. I don't understand why. I still recommend it to everyone.
