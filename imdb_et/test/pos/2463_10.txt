One of my wishes is to be a filmmaker and I just have to say that I can't compete with a powerful drama of civil war. The reason is that the actor is perfect and when you see the movie you know what I'm talking about. All I can recommend is to look at it, I'm so involved and very surprised. <br /> <br /> The Estevez and Sheen relationship on the screen was absolutely amazing. <br /> <br /> And so was his relationship with his mother (Kathy Bates). Some of the best scenes include 2. <br /> <br /> In addition to Sheen and her daughter's relationship with Estevez's sister movie. <br /> <br /> 10/10 and definitely my top 10. I want a DVD!
