Many find that BEAST STABLE is the latest "real" FEMALE PRISONER film, as it is the last Shunya Ito-run, followed by another film (GRUDGE SONG), directed by another director. I haven't seen GRUDGE SONG yet (but soon ...) so I don't know how it accumulates with previous FP movies - but it's interesting to see. How did BEAST STABLE really end, he didn't leave much room for his predecessor - but I think I discover ... <br /> <br /> This item is in Scorpion's hands with the police, where he hooks up with a street-whore who gets pregnant her slowed brothers baby (oh yes - it's not wrong ... i need to love those buggy story lines). Scorpion gets to the robbing of an old rival, but (as he is so good ...) gets away from fleeing and revenge against some people who have broken some of his whore friends ... <br /> <br /> I agree with some other reviewers is somewhat slower in points and "more serious" than the previous two entries. The story is somewhat confusing and sometimes complicated, but many of these 70's pink movies are - and I still love them. BEAST STABLE is quite disappointed with nudity quite badly - but I thought it was strong in other areas - story, cinematography, some good slippers, and so on. Definitely worth it for fans of this type, or who have enjoyed other FEMALE PRISONER films ... 8/10
