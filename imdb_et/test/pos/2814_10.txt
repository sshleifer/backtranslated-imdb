In the initial thinking, the concept of this exhibition seemed to be a joke and a gag, just for the entertainment of Stan Lee. I was expecting more than the Barbie wire's low-value animated version, which, in a short time, resembles adult swimming for short amusements, but can never be taken too seriously. The boy was wrong! <br /> <br /> Stripper has even better production values ​​than similar Marvel Toons. The animation is very good and it seems that they have taken this series very seriously and have given it the utmost effort to make it as professional as possible. <br /> <br /> Humor is also a sexy, suggestive and weak side. It's very similar, if not just like the Simpson style. You may come across clichés and lots of predictive humor, but it's still fun. If it works today, I would see it regularly. It is surprisingly one of the best shades ever made.
