I came out of the "Dark Blue World", which was "so sad", but it was definitely a movie that had to be done, and it's really well done in the Czech Republic. It's fun, despite the "sad" assumption. It is full of feelings, interconnection and undoubtedly a true friendship between the two leading characters - one mature lieutenant pilot (Ondrej Vetchý like Franta) and the young and forever eager pilot (Krystof Hádek Karelina), the inevitable triangle of love and now and then reminders of the events of Czechoslovakia in the 50s. It's all in one movie, Zdenek and Jan Sverák, the team leader of the father's scriptwriter and son (the previous achievement is "Kolya"). <br /> <br /> It is not as long as "East-West" (French "Est-Ouest") 1999, a heart-catching, multi-layered story of a returning Russian doctor and a French woman's bad fate after the Second World War in Russia. The "Tmavomodrý svet" (Czech) piece is quite simple and has light humor sprinkles. Music, World War II songs sung in the Czech language, the modest special effects of the pilots and the air industry in the sky - not exactly as Hollywood - the battles of bing, bang, boom are not needed to show the scenes of the air battle. The sadness was explained at the beginning (two paragraphs in English) and we followed up with follow-up. The film is not fully subtitled, only for Czech conversations - the rest are English, be it British or Czech accents. (So ​​this is a foreign-language film that contains English and includes British participants.) <br /> <br /> The three leading performances, especially the two Czech pilots, were perfectly delivered. There are nuances between the two, although it is constantly mature and eagerly young. I always appreciate Tara Fitzgerald: yes, against the 1996 Ewan McGregor and Pete Postlethwaite, "Brassed Off"; remembered the 1991 hearing "listen to my song" against Adrian Dunbar and Ned Beatty; Against Hugh Grant's "Sirens" 1994 and "The English Who went to the Mountain and came down the hill" in 1995, in addition to his performance in the mini series of the PBS Masterpiece Theater. <br /> <br /> "So sad" - the fact that heroes who defend their country can be so badly hit and so long (40 years). Thank you for the pleasant memories and unforgettable friendship signs. So break the sunshine through the window of the sheet (ironic or casual that it is the church where hard work was done) - a symbol of hope, never to give up? <br /> <br /> Other recent movies with stories must be said: "Kandahar" (with nelofer Pazira as Nafas, a Canadian Canadian who travels to Kandahar with his personal "mission") more than Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbafi behind the eye. "Everything Put Together" (with Radha Mitchell as a new mother facing SID - sudden infant death) A remarkable film by Swiss director Marc Forster and his many talks about the controversial "Monster's Ball" (I haven't caught yet) Halle Berry Billy Bob Thornton and Peter Boyle. Watch movies before your previous expectations or comparisons before the movies. Just look at it.
