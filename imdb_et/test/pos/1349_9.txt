This is a film that has all the basic elements of this genre. It makes you want to cry, it makes you ridiculous, it's nasty to you, it makes you angry, etc. The theme of the story is, fortunately, not some illness or drugs, what is the usual trend of homo. these days, but it focuses on social interactions between characters that cannot be considered a high school elite. The game and the direction could be a bit more complicated, but on the other hand it is somehow better because it really shows that they have experienced signs. This was a remarkable work and certainly an achievement if it was intended, especially for such a young director. <br /> <br /> This is actually a good story that gives you a little bit of inside, how it is a fat girl and recognize it for yourself.
