Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) is harassed by Mitch Leary (John Malkovich), a bomber terrorist who literally believes he will not be caught. At the opening, everyone in the Saw series is John Kramer (Tobin Bell), a modern serum killer. Through smart planning and influence, Frank is able to arrest Mendoza (Bell). <br /> <br /> Since then, this series is a chase of a cat and mouse. Malkovich is a huge actor and incredibly versatile. He again showed a different role in this film, he amazed me by his ability to change his characters to the next film. <br /> <br /> I see Malkovich playing Con Air as a threatening insanely smart Cyrus in Mice and Men as a tragically challenged bunny lover Lenny. He plays a very clever bomber terrorist who is very reasonable, but is disappointed to think that he can defeat his strokes. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood is not special to me. She's too old to really make a lot of movies, so the only thing she really amazes is her ability to create dramatic scenes. The characters he plays are simple and one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Rene Russo plays Eastwood's love for the film and fascinates me, actually supporting a bigger role for me than Eastwood. <br /> Although it may seem like an activity blocker, it is relatively slow and plays in anticipation. You have to wait for the construction and the end and it will pay off. You have Malkovich and Eastwood chemistry and their scenes from cats and mice.
