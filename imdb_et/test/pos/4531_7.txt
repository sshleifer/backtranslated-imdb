The 13th and last RKO Falcon movie begins with Tom Conway's mutual injunction, such as Tom Lawrence aka Falcon and Ed Brophy as Goldie of "No dames!" when they are preparing to go on holiday. Although you still don't know what they're going on on holiday because they didn't work after the first movie in 1941 (with Sanders such as Gay and Jenkins as Goldie), they collide with the woman and drag her to help her when her uncle is killed by taking an envelope , which contains details about the formula to make industrial diamonds for your Miami colleague. Everybody here suspects, except the local police who are after Lawrence? and Goldie's murder. For consultation, Goldie continues to paraphrase the travel brochures: "On a cold day, you can always enjoy the warmth of a cozy electric chair." Some beautiful thin nightclub scenes rub on their shoulders, especially due to bad behavior. Favorite Selection: A dignified ride-and-seek / intimidation game that is effortless and kissed on Lawrence with a sleeping sleeper on the train. The least favorite bit: the most embarrassing scene in the entire series of alligator wrestling houses? Surely the kids were thrown! <br /> <br /> All in all, this series is not the best in the series, but is another fun outing that has a common satisfactory plot and many episodes even in what makes me want them to go on for a few more years when Columbia did it was with Boston Blackie, although RKO burst them faster. There is absolutely no gender, not violence (in fact, not high standards of today), and a positive message does not make this type of film seriously for people who can only treat films as an art form that must depend on these three pillars. <br /> <br /> The three diets of Falcon were later made with John Calvert as a title, I don't mind them, but I could never read those main series that Tom Conway had done for himself. Unfortunately, it was that Conway, who moved to the TV, listened to the voices and even played Norman Conquest at Park Plaza 605, it was also in 1953. I don't know if they were involved? she lost her poverty and after her death in 1967 in her baby bed. For us, there are at least 10 fun Falcons in addition to many other valuable, even classic RKO films from 1942-1946.
