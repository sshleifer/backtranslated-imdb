I'm a 58 year old man. In the rainy afternoon, my wife suggested we go to see women. After reading the reviews, I thought it could lead in the afternoon. Wrong - this movie was my interest from start to finish. It was nice that we finally saw Super Ryan again. Let's face it, Meg seems a lot better with longer hair. Annette Benning seemed different to me in every scene. Candice Bergen shows her age as Carrie Fisher. Daughter Molly was an exceptionally young Indian. I could understand the dialogue that is harsh in many of the current films because of the quick call. Cloris Leachman and a woman from Finland were terrible as housekeepers who extended their usual tasks. NYC scenes were great to see. And Bette Midler had a short role, but as usual, it was terrible. So I gave this chick a flick a 9. Guys-Go look at it even with eye candy like Eva Mendes. It doesn't disappoint.
