One day a red alley cat escaped by people and dogs are attacking and blowing to make life better if it were a skunk. He then paints black under his back and adds some Limburger cheese. In her first year of life she could not have been better, the dog dog escaped and the butcher refused to leave the shop, leaving a cat on the walk. Just as he thinks everything is perfect, he has noticed a real skunk, not just any skunk, but too in love with Pepé Le Pew. Pepé injures the poor female skunk of a poor cat and tries to think her protest is just shy. Our poor cat thinks she has escaped when she throws her skin out of a tall building, so Pepé thinks she's dead, she first seems to be working, but Pepé sees her and forgets the dead skunk right away. Finally, the cat realizes that she has been beaten and attacked from the right to be amazed by the randy skunk ... too long a skunk is when her husband knows what she has done. <br /> <br /> This was a pretty funny introduction to Pepé Le Pew, who was just too gracious, but now looks like a randy sexually harassing stalker, although he was punished for his behavior in the end.
