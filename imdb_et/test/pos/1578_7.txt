Kazuo Komizu strikes again with "beautiful woman entrances", followed by "Virgin Bridges". This time, the story is surrounded by a psychologist (Megumi Ozawa), who decides to take Yakuza to apologize for the doped and raped patient's suicide, who runs one day at his fingertips. When he gets over and Yakuza hits him, he learns his cunning doping for girls' doping and enslavement. Obviously, it will end badly with overdose of cocaine. But he soon melds another body that needs to be destroyed to get dum, dum, dum? "Super Slime Hermaphrodite Zord"! This, he = he makes minced meat from yakuza and saves the day not really. <br /> <br /> Well, it's better than "virgin entrances" but not much. The majority of the film (67 minutes) consists of rape and sex blowing and the usual ho-hum. Almost to the end we will finally reach our cool groove with some cool queue (like an alien-inspired penis monster through the abdomen and nervous suffocation), but it still suffers from a low mortgage that makes it fun, but it may not raise it from the z-grade soft horror.
