I watched this movie years ago on television and recorded it where I never realized why my mother had been disturbed! It was because I was so young at that time. I've just sat down and watched this movie again, now I have 2 children and I have to try to fight back tears, but it didn't happen because I cried through most of the film. if you have your children! Such an amazing family, such as a heartbreaking film, is truly wonderful! Someone has said that another 8 are still in the news, are you all still familiar with what I know to know! Touching a movie everywhere!
