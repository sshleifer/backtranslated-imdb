"O brother, where art is you" is the Homer "Odyssey" gleeful retelling, placed in the 1930s by Mississippi and rampant magnificence, which is the trademark of the brothers Coen. Three unfortunate convicts make their escape to find treasure - and more than their share of the adventure - in this pleasant movie. George Clooney is a trio as a terrifying and friendly leader in a good, inventive form; but the actual actors go to John Turturro and Tim Blake to Nelson for their glowing but loving cohorts called Clooney's character "Soggy Bottom Boys" after they get baptized in the river completely. Three cut the record for this home nomenclature in cash and inadvertently became overnight feelings with real rock-star status. The film is accompanied by enough music and songs to qualify as almost music. And here are some incredible film making options: The FAQ rally scene is a real cozy and is so similar to the scene when Dorothy's friends save her from the witch's castle "Oz's Wizard" to almost reach cinematographic plagiarism. And what an amazing plagiarism job! Without giving up the final, I have to say that the movie's climax is one of the most breathtaking sequences put on the film in recent memories (in parallel with the magnificent 'Magnolia' final, which is another of my favorites). "O brother" is a must-have, perfect 10!
