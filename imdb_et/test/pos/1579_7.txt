BEAUTY GUTS is a bit better than its predecessor, VIRGIIN GUTS. Although this movie is not really a queue in the sense that it has absolutely nothing to do with making the first installment, I found BEAUTY a bit stronger and better assembled than everything when VIRGIN ... but then again it doesn't speak much. <br /> <br /> BEAUTY begins with a pretty tough and straightforward film. A couple of Yakuza cats keeps the young man jailed and starts gang rape. Because this nastiness is happening, the head tells the girl that they did the same thing to her sister and sold her in African slavery, and that they did it to her. Then they shoot some drugs and rape him. He's somehow going out and going to the clinic where the sister is listening. Rapee will end the stress of her previous experience and commit suicide. The clinician, who was moved by a young woman's story, decides the gang to revenge when she casts one of the lowest level boys and tries to hypnotize her to kill Yakuza leaders. This whole plan rebound, so now pr. The Vigilante-Clinic-Worker faces the same amount as our original rapee - only worse (some pretty harsh reverses with the expected rape of force ...). She is also a drug, but the drug has a strange side effect on our seemingly unhappy victim ----- it becomes her furious hermaphroditic BLOOD DEMON! (no sh! t, this really happens!) This is when BEAUTY really rises with some pretty twilight killing scenes - including a very stylish chest attack that looks like ALIEN and bad cross porn, and my favorite - headed - de-demon-vagina kill (with demonvin-lima ...) to be believed to be credible ... <br /> <br /> Certainly some promising things in BEAUTY GUTS, but still a very different feeling. BEAUTY seems almost like two different films being forced inappropriately. However, I have to give credit to the movie - rape scenes are very harsh and misognistic, and kill scenes are just out of the wall. Strong 7/10 for the "classic" of another mad J-horror.
