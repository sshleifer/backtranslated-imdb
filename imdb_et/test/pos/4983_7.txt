Western through and through. As Glenn Ford describes the character of the title, "No, I don't want to fight, but I want to be forced." This film is smart, strong and a struggle for your convictions. With courage, you will never stop striving for what you feel. Excellent action and mostly fast pace. Good to see Brian Keith in this role and Edward G. Robinson as an older Western man. Glenn Ford lives by his western image. A thoroughly enjoyable movie includes a strategic non-military war. Of course, it is violent, as the title claims, but not too graphic as the computer's timed movies. Mostly it is a clash of strong personality.
