Snap, crack, pop! Change in angle of each camera. And that does not mean that the white flashes and the truncated ends are almost every single sentence spoken. What on earth were in the editing room? Or may it be that this approach was deliberate? Definitely not. What purpose could it serve? Despite all his technical drawbacks, this is an interesting film that depicts the day when Joe, a hustler, lived, who decided to earn $ 200 for his wife's pregnant girlfriend. Joe Dallesandro is a prominent, simple, passive, modest young man who is ready to give the other person the most speaking when he listens to the eye. <br /> <br /> The story is weak and sketchy, documenting an insecure life led by a man who relies on random sex sex to support his young and female. One thing is for sure, Joe is forbidden when it comes to sex or the artist's disappointment. Understandably, he has a beautiful face and a beautiful body. <br /> <br /> The film has a scene that is remarkably effective. No sound, no dialogue. Joe sneaks naked, swinging on the floor to make a little cake for her little baby. In these quiet moments, you will be amazed at the beautiful serenity and tenderness. Another amusing scene is where Joe is strenuously trying to get a $ 100 loan from a gym friend very appealing approach. <br /> <br /> Joe tries to look at it with interest, but is hesitant to talk to him when an artist finishes his Greek and Roman art. This is a prerequisite if Joe gives up her clothes and represents a real classic style as a sampler. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, we get the impression that we need to know Joe's beautiful well. After all, he has discovered more than his soul.
