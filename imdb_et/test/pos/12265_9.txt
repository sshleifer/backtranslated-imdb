I'm sitting around going through movie lists and not really seeing anything I want to see. My appetite says, "Something like BROADCAST NEWS." That's what I want. Something smart and funny, with adult ideas and great acting and writing style that doesn't mean attention. It may be Hurt's best result (whether it is mine or the Great Future, in my opinion): but eccentric, Hurt is smart and plays unintelligent-no matter that the audience knows - Hey, I'm not stupid ... well, that's nice. Hunter is perfect and Albert Brooks is a revelation. (And she can read and sing at the same time!) Excellent, great work. <br /> <br />
