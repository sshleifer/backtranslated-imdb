This is a movie you rent if you are incredibly tired or otherwise damaged ... The functioning of this movie is so bad that it seems deliberate and to find out how bad the special effects are, there is one scene when the dolls come alive where you can see most of the dolls in your hand by moving it. The film looked like it was filmed with a camcorder. When I first saw this movie, fistfight erupted almost as my friends and I called each other's names on this flick, it was so terrible. If you enjoy crazy movies, I suggest you otherwise, to escape as your life would depend on it.
