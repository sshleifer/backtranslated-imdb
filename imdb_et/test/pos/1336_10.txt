I just called my brother Paulie and said he was watching Hoode and it was funny. So, as I said, never goes against the family! The demand for more lines is OK because I like to express my opinions quite often. If something is misspelled, it is probably my vision and not my brain. This gives me another chance to take my shots out of "The Departed". When we know exactly what happens in the previous scene without prior knowledge, it usually means it wasn't all that tense. All we need is a good leader, the same man I believe, who made my favorite movie, "Goodfellows", but completely different. I have to see that it wouldn't be better than "The Departed" Gibbs
