This movie is all about what Tenacious D fans expect. Director Liam Lynch works with "D" for a mixture of epic proportions. Of course you need to understand Tenacious D humor and form. When I saw it, there wasn't too much laughing at the audience, but not because of humor or lack of intelligent jokes. This film seems to have been published to an unsuspecting public who has not studied musical duo. This movie is not the root. For some of you who have seen the HBO TV series and heard the album, they have not forgotten what their audience loves. Like the TV show, people have noticed the scenes of the JB and KG apartments in the trailer and, of course, the open Mic nights that each tenacious D episode would start and end. The soundtrack is phenomenal and each song blows you away. <br /> <br /> ... And Dave Grohl plays fantastic Devil. <br /> <br /> This is the perfect movie for those looking for hard time and rocking music.
