I was just looking for "who loves my kids" when I got this website and fellow British! I am a big fan of this movie and wish and wish it to everyone. I find it comforting to find someone else who will find the comfort of others good. I also have a son with Aspergers (among others) and my fear of thinking something happened to me and my husband, that no one would just want to take my beautiful "daughter", but also my special and talented son. Absence of home and the ability to associate with people raised with the same values ​​as me have more meaning than you know. Living here in the United States, I have not yet met anyone who has seen this movie. So for all of you who read it, if you haven't seen it, do it. This is a very mobile experience, especially for anyone who is a parent, or even if you have sympathetic bone in your body, weep and beg. After that, you will read your blessings, and for anyone who has ever been through this experience or near it, my heart will go to you. It makes me realize, no matter how hard or stressful it is, just remember to always have someone worse than you. The amazing movie and what makes it more powerful is a real story. Don't put aside how sad it is, while this film is warming your heart and makes you feel encouraged by the strength and goodness of mankind.
