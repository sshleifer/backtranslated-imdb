This film is mainly based on human emotions and communication. In fact, only three locations are used (school, shop and coach house). This is mainly in the coach house. The film does not need special effects or amazing views to be amazing in itself. <br /> <br /> Four friends who had agreed on their basketball. One is rich, important and has no real love outside of money. One wants to be the mayor, but his competition makes him sour. One wants to be the head of the school and take care of his family. One is traveling alcohol. <br /> <br /> First of all, I love this movie actor. They were all household names for me. They proved their worth. <br /> <br /> One of the most important moments is when Tom, played by Gary Blue, blows to the coach. She screams and talks about how the coach won the game. He blows the coach whistle and punishes his phrases: "Give me the Father, because I have sinned!" It's amazing to look at the energy that just freezes. <br /> <br /> Very recommended for anyone who understands people's emotions and does not need these glossy effects.
