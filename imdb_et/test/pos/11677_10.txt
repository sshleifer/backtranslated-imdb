I saw it in a movie theater when I was 14 years old and it changed my life. I immediately cut off my hair and started to buy all the movie bands. These were some L.A. punk-rock bands captured at the top of their powers. Bands like Black Flag (pre-Rollins), Circle Jerks, Fear, X and Germs have little in the history of punk music. I can't believe that this movie has never been put on video or DVD. A great movie for punk-rock fans.
