I saw this movie in 1954 on a double bill at the "Kings Valley". These films helped to bring lifelong interest to Egypt. (I went to Egypt in 1975!) Today, it seems that "Egypt" suffers from a flat dialogue and touching some gauchi, but it is a brilliant film that, unfortunately, Hollywood is no longer doing - - and it has a great story ... not just normal boy meets girl or revenge-on-my thing. Too bad 20th does not release its re-restored images on the big screen.
