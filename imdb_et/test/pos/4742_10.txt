Recruitment rules are one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. It is well designed, perfectly cut and offers great materials to back up the claim it takes. The best quality of the film is that it is not based on knowing Dividi as much as it illuminates the public with the brutal mistakes and lies of the government surrounding the situation. I have the feeling of anxiety and extreme anger about how the government went and then covered such a tragedy. Kate is what really left me smoke. One thing is to make a mistake in the operation and admit guilt, but another to look at the American people and lie to them. I think it should not surprise me with the history of our beloved country, which has seen JFK's murder, the Vietnam War and other important events that smell that you have to keep your nose every time you drive a Washington DC airplane with special heat sensor technology and some organs autopsy show clearly that the FBI is in the public domain. One thing I try to make aware of when watching such a documentary is that I usually only get a testimony from one perspective. But again, this is undoubtedly one of the brilliant advances in the competition rules. He presents his evidence in such a summary that even if you were given FBI statements, how could you really believe them. I remember clearly how impartiality was in the way media introduced to Dividi because this crazy crazy cult toy with David Koresh, independently, was born, Jesus Christ, as their leader. None of them were actually factual, but rather a split story of bits and facts. They were just where they were entitled to carry arms and practice faith as American citizens. If you were an ATF and you wanted to look for a compound, it would attack a building where there are men who are armed with rifles and bulletproof, which suits how to do it? If you are an FBI, why participate in a psychological war and offer real negotiation to help resolve the situation? Why pour harmful gases when you want to save children? Why open large holes in the structure of compounds when you know how to start a fire? Why lie about firing weapons when it can be clearly shown on video? If not. If you didn't want the situation to end like it did. At the end of the scene, when the Dividians Star of David flag broke down the flagpole and the ATF was soon lifted, there was an emotional climate picture that made my head shake and my stomach change uncontrollably. William Gazecki, the filmmaker, deserves my highest congratulations. It takes a lot of courage to make such a movie, and I'm sure that the government has influenced it a lot. Because of his similar people, the public can be proved to be a truth rather than a rupture that is filtered through the media, which provides information that is hardly considered genuine. When I think about how I felt about the Dividias, because the media represented David Koresh and how I felt after seeing the film, it's really amazing. It reminds me of the line Jesus healed by man from the Bible and asked parents how it happened "before I was blind, but now I see," he said. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. You may need to look for it, but it's really something special.
