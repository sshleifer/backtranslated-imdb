Director Don Siegel really impressed with this film. It is amazingly photographed, graphical, without being visually graphical, all involved would have worked well and covered some of the most important issues of the taboo for a few days in the worker's, almost presumable normality that so far has not been viewed by another film. I didn't know what to expect to sit down to watch it: a civil war movie or a 70's soft core, where Eastwood's descent takes place in the South Girls' School. But none of these things really do, but rather research, exploration, and getting into the soul of men and women - a dark commentary on the civilized core. When one evaluator noted earlier, none - none - of the characters at the end of the movie is pleasing, and yet everyone is interesting, challenging and puzzling. Eastwood plays Cpl. McBurney, a Union soldier found by young Pamelyn Ferdin (you know this voice as soon as you hear it), a girl in a school that manages Geraldine's page in the middle of a war that was a civil war - especially in the south. Soon, Page, teacher Elizabeth Hartman, lovely young seductress Carol and even Ferdin (Amy) have an emotional / sexual relationship with Eastwood - each of them has their own needs and secrets and problems. Eastwood is not a nice man. She always plays girls with each other trying to gain sexual benefit. At opening, we get some real interesting things that came from hidden lesbian incest. The Beguiled, for me, is a masterpiece that transcends my hopes for every creator. This may be (except for the body's snatcher invasion) Siegel's best film. This is definitely one of Eastwood's best REAL performances. The page is always so good and Hartman, Fe5rdin and others are great. The Gothic Manse for school is actually claustrophobic. Some of the scenes with sexual side are disturbing. And what happens to Eastwood is a leg for a large number of competing, terrible, demented movies.
