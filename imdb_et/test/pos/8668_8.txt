At first glance it seems that the strange person has several other films / books. Kafka The Trial, Melville's Bartleby, Reginald Perrin's fall and rise, and the Landscape Day immediately enjoy. One man, Andreas, arrives in a city where he can immediately work in the office and find a new beautiful girlfriend. But there is a catch: his colleagues are all friendly, nice and completely characteristic, and everyone he knows, including his girlfriend, seems to be just one topic of the conversation - the interior. Welcome to the hell of modern consumption, where people cast themselves out of buildings and nobody raises their eyebrows, or spend their days reading furniture catalogs or eating anything that tastes nothing. <br /> <br /> Andreas is quick to understand his difficulty and spend the rest of the movie trying to escape, in many ways. Suicide is not an option, and if she finds a new girlfriend she has the same feeling as the old one - it seems the restaurant has a wonderful scene where she asks her to move and everything she can say is "I don't mind". In fact, much of what The Twoersome Man has to say is what has been said before, and after about 45 minutes you will feel that you are really deja vu in a sense. But the point is that it is likely to be repeated over and over again, that is to say, a life that is not worth pursuing is not worth living. This is complemented by a comprehensive contemporary theme of how capitalism destroys our souls. More than one character reminds me of the people I know, especially the obsession of his furniture, and when filmmakers have run out of ideas at the end of the film, maybe this is the point - the end won't come if you can't find other people who share your sense of alienation.
