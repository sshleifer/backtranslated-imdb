I remember seeing it in theaters when it came out, and he didn't know what it was and it was so pleasantly surprised that I promised to buy the video when it came out. <br /> <br /> Although I do not go too far to scatter this movie, I say I gave it 8/10 of all the reasons you can read in the reviews of other users. <br /> <br /> What I'm saying is: <br /> <br /> The first 10 minutes of this movie are incredible. It's as close to the textbook audience as I've ever seen. I put this movie once in a party where everyone was finished and ready to leave. I just wanted to see what would happen if I saw them for the first ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Everyone who looked at the opening was over.
