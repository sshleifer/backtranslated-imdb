A surprisingly good film, made for an exorist, about a young woman who changes in the spirit after she goes to a consecrated church to restore the size and life of life as a crucified man. The piece was Christ and the two thieves, but Christ had long been sold. The problem starts after it has been removed from the cross and it seems that it lives and the woman attracts her. From that moment on, it becomes a battle for girls' souls. Dreadful, scary and much better than the film thinks, because pouring it sells events that are definitely adults. This helps them to be real people who are faulty so that they are easier to associate with. I liked this movie and I saw it for the first time in at least ten years surprised how good it is. Certainly it is better than any one of these to look like Schlocky's headlines.
