I'm just watching this move recently on the Encore channel. What a great movie, as well as a big cast. Flatliners are very tense and unpredictable. In the film, there is a great scene from the ocean, a series of scenes that ask questions about life after death that offer a very strong original story. That's why Nelson, played by Kiefer Sutherland, was the first to pass the test to die and live. Then it becomes very dramatic when you bring back your wrong past life. Then all the above-mentioned characters went through the same experience, except for Randy steckle played by Olliver Platt. Then the story opens for a resolution and a basic understanding of life and the presence and meaning of God. David Labraccio, who is atheistic Kevin Bacon, ultimately questions his own faith in God. It is amazing to see Julia Roberts with Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platte, William Baldwin and Kiefer Sutherland in the early days of his career. One might wonder how we have no longer created such a big movie. This is one of the best productions by Joel Schumacher. I really enjoy this movie.
