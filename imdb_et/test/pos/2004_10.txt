I started to look at this sample at random, but I love it. The fact that the main character is in a wheelchair is something that is missing on television, especially for children. My five-year-old nephew (like most children do) just looked at people who were in a wheelchair or had some other deficiency, but after looking at Pelswick, he seemed to be an ordinary event for him. Every time he saw a wheelchair, he just said "like Pelswick" and go on with what he once did. And the YES animation is a little crude oil, but if you can look through the Simpson's first season, it's not that bad. "Genie" is actually an angel who is there to help Pelswick learn life. She can't walk when someone else says she can walk for a while, I've seen every episode and she never walked to my remembrance, she's paraplegic, she doesn't know her armpit (she mentions it in an episode). As for humor, if you get a copy of the "Ntalented" episode, which is sheep dogs, you will love this exhibition instantly.
