I think this is a great and very funny movie. The story is so funny. Daughter brings her father, Andrei, in some embarrassing situations. In an attempt to impress the boy of his dreams, the daughter claims that his father is his lover. Heigl is beautiful as Nicole, maybe too cute; I'm not sure why he should lie to someone? Gerard Depardieu works very well in this comedy film, he's so much fun to watch. If you like comedy and romantic movie, you just have to see it !!! I think you can see this movie several times and you still have a good laugh.
