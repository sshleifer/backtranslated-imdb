"Boy Next Door" is a fun romp through men's neurosis. After just over fifteen minutes, the film takes us on a journey that most full-length features don't fit. Great performances, great camera work and editing --- this short is classic from start to finish. Weave to Travis Davis to pull double duty under both director and star. He's more fun with nebbish from Woody Allen. And what to treat to see Richard Moll again. If you thought everything he could do was play "Bull", the bailiff "Night Court", think again. This cinematography introduces Stephen Garvey perfectly to the funny writings. Remember this name. Forget Charlie Kaufman, Steve Garvey is a peculiar comedy king.
