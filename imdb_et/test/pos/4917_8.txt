While most of us have sexual quality that is changing quality, I can't recall the film that made me what it does. It transported me to a scary area of ​​longing and desire. The whole compulsive attraction, the uncertainty of the result, the sensitive fear and the excitement that came with this state of excitement, was brought to fever by this flick. So French and what I think bold! Regardless of your direction, I think the danger of looking for your desire is completely front and center here ... much more, such as Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut".
