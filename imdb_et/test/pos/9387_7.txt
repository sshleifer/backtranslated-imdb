Death Bed: The bed that eats. <br /> <br /> Based on the title, you can guess what this movie is. And yet this film has a much more (background) story than one may suspect. <br /> <br /> Okay, so the main plot is about a bed where people eat food, but there are also some subplots. I don't break them for you, but they're a nice touch. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie is very mediocre. The fact that most dialogues have not even been spoken by the participants does not really help to improve the quality of the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Because there are many voice services. Character thoughts also appear to observers. Sometimes it works sometimes not. <br /> <br /> The effect is good. Of course, this can be much better than comparing it to today's movies. But you shouldn't really; just decide the movie as it is and don't take it too seriously. You have to admit that killer BED is quite creative. If you are easily caught, don't look at this movie. You may never sleep in sleep ... <br /> <br /> Death Bed: The bed that eats is a strange horror with a low budget, but I would still recommend it to fans of horror movies. /> <br /> Finally, I give this movie seven out of 10 stars for this creative story and unexpected twists here and there.
