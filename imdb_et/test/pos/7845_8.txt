Beguiled is one of those underrepresented films in the career of a director and / or an actor who can play better than expected. In the same year that Clint Eastwood and Don Siegel collaborated with Dirty Harry, they also did the little psycho-sexual drama set in the State of the Civil War Confederation. That's almost 180 of what Harry's listeners had. Here's a movie that is under radar and low budget almost no business compared to Dirty Harry. It is also a story where Eastwood is not surrounded by dangerous men, but women who, despite their first appearance, have darker sides. And there's even romance between some of the toughest and more complex scenes. But in a framework to make a movie, Siegel actually has a little more freedom to do things that have a picture style that gets more European; I am reminded here and there of Polanski's work in the 1960s. It all works quite well even with the initial suspicion that these two men's filmmaking figures (Eastwood obviously and Siegel, who have their niche B-knife and low-budget thrillers) are able to remove material that could be made in a Lifetime film. It was also an exciting and truly dark comic here and there to see Eastwood's performance next to these girls. He's doing a little subversive in his performance, still having the Eastwood mechanism when his stapled movie is close to such a thing, stepping forward to this little school for young women sometimes and not for others. To see Eastwood in a performance such as Play Misty for me (the second work of Eastwood in 1971) shows how cool he can with credentials in acting very well. There are four main female characters, each with different ages, each with different "Jankee" men. Although the work of Siegel, which manages all the actors, is in his first half, it is really the case that the story goes beyond the one-and-a-half mark (less successful than the director can) that the real juicy scenes start. Many of these are the best that Siegel drastically pushed, pushing the psychological and emotional edges of scenes where it was not expected. <br /> <br /> This is a tough movie, all praise for it, because it doesn't paint anyone as too reverent - the character of Hallie, the slave of Mae Mercer, is separated from what appears to be all too curious women and women. McBurney. Along with this, Eastood is in this role, which is and is not what he usually sees during the films during his true formative years. He is a hero here who was the trademark of his western and other thrillers that he did at that time. But unlike those films he does not really have, he is "more than a life" that he is a scammer and a compliant, as he is both a desert and a female, even in the most charming and pleasant moments. If this is not one of his best practices, which is difficult to put together in his catalog, it is worth looking for fans who could see his other side. It's credit to him, but also what he did with Siegel's co-operation, as both took the opportunity at that time in Hollywood.
