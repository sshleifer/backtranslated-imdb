I'm so happy to have it recorded on a VHS tape when it was in the Master Piece Theater. This is a movie I watch over and over again. Like England in the early 1800s, it's not hard enough, Prue was born with a "rabbit lips" and is out of date. The people in his village accept him somewhat, but are always afraid that he is a "devil's forge" and that he has quickly turned on. Especially when his family gets a lot of bad luck. He is strong and brave, but away from Kester Woodseaves, a traveler who is catching his eye. Partly because he fears rejection and also because he thinks he is so virulent that he should have a woman who is as beautiful as lily. Kester is a modern person who does not believe in the superstitions of the era and speaks his mind and follows his heart. The movie stays with Mary Webb's original story and is riveting from beginning to end.
