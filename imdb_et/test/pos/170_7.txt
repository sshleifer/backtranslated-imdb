Sorry for the "extremely smart" summary phrase. I don't know what I was thinking, but I really couldn't help myself. <br /> <br /> I've been thinking of seeing a "bloody birthday" for a long time and I have to say that it was a pleasant surprise to find a copy of this movie at random and for such a low price. And believe me, I live in a small South American village and these things are very unlikely. It is a real shame that some of these gems of the 80s are almost completely forgotten. "Bloody Birthday" is one of those films that surprisingly age well enough to be traced today. Surely this is not a masterpiece, but still fun and guess what? ... it doesn't really have funny scenes inadvertently. I know it is shocking when we remember that it is a low-budget flick since the early 1980s as a group of children who kill people. But trust me, the movie will be able to stay mostly respectable and observable. <br /> <br /> "Blood Birthday" is a story of three children who were born during complete shading. According to astrology, there is a saturn between blinds, the sun and the moon that controls emotions. As a result, the three children born on that day will eventually get lost and evil. Because they don't feel any feelings about their feelings, these 10-year-olds basically go to anyone who stands on their way, including their parents and siblings ... and kill them! The number of the body is increasing day by day and the police authorities believe that there is a psychopath around the place. Meanwhile, Debbie, Curtis, and Steven, do not hesitate to kill people because someone seems to have their sweet angels face is not a suspect (?) Is surprisingly NOT funny. I know I said it before, but I'm surprised. I had been waiting for some bad scenes, but the film proved me wrong. True, this is not what most people would consider as a "serious" horror film, but if I have to be fair, I would say that the story has been properly executed. One of the most important reasons to expect ridiculous situations (as I did) is that in films where the main villains are children, young actors tend to be just terrible and make the whole thing ridiculous. Let's face it: Children tend to be terrible actors that are understandable and we can't blame them. But surprisingly, three young actresses who played ruthless killers in this movie seemed very disturbing and not at all funny. The rest of the participants are also good and if you are a fan of George Clooney, you will see his uncle in this film as a doctor. Yes, I know right? ... who cares? Julie Brown, the great actor, singer, comedienne and gay icon, also gives a powerful result as a naughty older sister and if someone is interested in nudity she disappears from one scene and she looks very naked. Too bad it didn't have more time on the screen! Julie is "absolutely fabulous": P <br /> <br /> So this movie is basically good when you're in the humble 80s. My only objection to a "bloody birthday" would be to justify the motives of children. This is perhaps one of the lowest points in the movie. Let's see: if the children born during Eclipse are a heartless killer, how were the three who really killed people? I'm sure there were other kids who were born the same day ... and also during the other sunshine days, oh! In general, it's not a big deal, it's just a simple observation, it's all. I've seen worse, trust me. Take, for example, the "Children" (1980), where the premature killer gets his evil after the toxic cloud turns into zombies. No, believe me, "bloody birthday" is a lot more decent and if you enjoy simple slashers, you will enjoy it a lot. <br /> <br /> So now you know: you are invited to a children's birthday party ... and hosts serve a delicious poisoned cake for you and the rest of the guests. Come on, you can't miss it;)
