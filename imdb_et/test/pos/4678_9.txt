I don't know how many MINI Cooper cars were sold thanks to this movie? It did not help to add to the sales of this small car that comes with this film and the attractive pain. <br /> <br /> This is a very fun hunt-and-chase movie. It has a "cool" cast between Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Seth Green and Jason Statham. The best chase is at the beginning with a boat in Russia, Italy. Film does not move violence, is a rather intelligent script (with a few short exceptions). offers interesting characters and is nicely attached. Cat and Mouse game between Norton and Theron characters is great and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> But again, we are manipulating rooting for criminals depicted as 'good guys'. How many times has this happened since "Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid" in the 1960s? This is a Hollywood twist for you. Here, one of the criminals (Norton) stole and killed the gang leader and his father's figure (Donald Sutherland), so he is the worst bunch and movie villain. The character of Theron is also in Hollywood's usual over-expanded-feminist mode, where women can do everything that is better than a man. The third less excitement is Seth Green's cunning, smart ass attitude, which we should go together as it is clean and cool. Despite these obstacles, this is a very fun movie and it doesn't lose track or sex .... and yes, these little cars are cool. All I've seen this movie with, I've enjoyed it.
