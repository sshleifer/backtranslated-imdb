This Columbo is unique because we don't know exactly the end result. Our favorite dark horse detective doubts that a couple of identical twin brothers will kill their rich uncle; everyone points his finger to his brother. In the mystical series, where the crime is shown at the beginning of the drama, this twist can be used only one or two times, and that was Columbo's time. Apart from this crease, this episode works well with others. It has a brighter tone than some, Jeanette Nolan is a very funny performance that is a terrible and loyal housekeeper who doesn't like Columbus.
