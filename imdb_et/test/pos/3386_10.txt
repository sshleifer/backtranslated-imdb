I first saw this mini-series as a child and although I am no longer a child, I still love it !!! However, it is difficult to find professional copies if it is on a DVD, it's GO !!! =] <br /> <br /> Excellent casting, marvelous plots and lots of activities, romance and even quite well placed comedy. I'm not a natural historian, but I love this masterpiece of historical fiction!
