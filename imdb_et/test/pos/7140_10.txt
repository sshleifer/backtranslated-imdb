it's more than Sat. special afternoon. Especially well written, if you have a very low key here than you are looking for. Try a cat companion / scout for example. It couldn't have been just a comic book that should have been a comic book. The comic industry (as well as the film publishers) missed this boat. At least they really know great movies. The big script by John Sayles is a strong point, but it is good to work. Probably the best "super hero" movie I've ever seen. In short, special effects, but long faith. It's his keeper. I've never seen a DVD on this movie, but I still owned the VHS version. Good hunting
