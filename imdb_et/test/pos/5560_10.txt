Farscape is the best sci-fi time period, which is one of the main reasons everything you try to show is very good. From a technical point of view, the music is original and perfectly suited to the exhibition. Special effects are abundance and higher quality, almost everything you see on your TV. The actors are also big, too many exhibitions today use the American actress market for exhibitions. Remember the first time you saw the Matrix and you said wow where did this agent Smith come from? It's the same feeling that you look at Claudia Black, Anthony Simcoe, Lani Tuput, Virginia Hey and especially Wayne Pygram. These auctions are great and it comes through this great exhibition. <br /> <br /> The plot is anything. The next closest thing I can think of is Babylon 5 during the episodes of the shadow wars, but that's it. This is a real cure to get all the episodes consistently, the complexity of interpersonal relationships between characters is well-scripted and executed. The general plot is both original and fun. I'm always itchy for the next show. <br /> <br /> Comic episodes are funny, drama episodes and action sequences are tense. At the beginning of the second season, some of the great comic episodes that I laughed out loud, something that rarely happens to be watching television other than South Park, Sealab 2021 or Seinfeld. Drama is even more difficult whether Crichton meets his mother or the characters die, everything is happening with heart and intensity. Finally, it goes without saying that this is the top. This is sci fi. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Ben Browder owns.
