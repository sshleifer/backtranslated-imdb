Almost it remained. When you visited friends in Philadelphia sometime in the early 1980s, I was after everyone else went to sleep. It wasn't just Bogart, who had become obsessed; rather, the age of these old rails is very well known from my age. Add to this pattern a plot similar to Falcon - where so many different symbols were communicated with Sacch - and you have so much art in me. About ten years later, it appeared on TV and I recorded it. >
