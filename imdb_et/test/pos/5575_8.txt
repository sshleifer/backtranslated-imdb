I remember ignoring the TV series when it debuted for the first time because it was with Jim Hensen's knitwear. But recently a friend promised me to borrow my Farscape DVDs and I just understand what was a terrible mistake. <br /> <br /> Like all TV series, there are episodes that seem to be and those who don't. I'm driving adrenaline and emotional rush during major episodes and carrying them through the weak. However, I wear it regardless of the basic features associated with all episodes. I'm talking about the growth of the main characters and their love for each other. Let me warn you, this is something that is absolutely irresistible to look at. I don't remember any other TV series (Babylon 5, Buffy, Angel, etc.) that would intelligently and intelligently put together such a heartbreaking (uncommon) and intense ride. <br /> <br /> I think that at the end of the fourth season things have finally changed and I am shocked by the decision to cancel. I look forward to the release of the ministries and invite others to discover this incredible pearl.
