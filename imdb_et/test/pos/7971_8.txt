A great action movie I've ever seen. It was the first expression that I did twice on local television in my country, Indonesia. The combination of continuous shooting and great choreography well played by David Bradley. He was a good "American Samurai". His skills in martial arts were made above average. He managed to make fighting scenes look nice. Not just breaking and hitting like most fighters in their movies. David Bradley could use all martial arts techniques like throwing, crushing and hitting. Highly recommended for fans of activities. I am trying to search for a DVD but I still can't get it especially in my city. Can anyone help me?
