In the early 1980s, I recorded the Honky Tonk Freeway cable. Since then, I've been waiting for it to be on DVD. Yesterday I found it. This is one of the best humorous character studies I've ever seen. An old-fashioned episode is invaluable. At this time (4/28/02), only two have reviewed. One hated it, another loved it. If you have a DVD player, either rent it or buy it as I did.
