Yes, this movie is another remake. Yes, this movie can be considered a chick. And yes, this movie is not perfect. However, women are a smart modern update to the social behavior of all women with impressive A-lists, including Meg Ryan, Debra Messing, Annette Benning and Bette Midler. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the four main characters, Mary (Ryan), her best friend, editor-in-chief, Sylvie (Benning), Alex (Jada Pinkett-Smith) and Edie (Debra Messing) and the extraterrestrial creature responsible most of the film's drama called Crystal (Eva Mendez). Mary tries to deal with her deceived husband (who has never seen the film), following the advice of her friends and mother (Candice Bergen). <br /> <br /> Next to Mary is Sylvie, who is between her social life and her working life. He is determined to make this test his moral and ethical values. Then there is the writer Alex, who is a lesbian with a lot of dirty, but knows his words. And finally, Edie, with four girls and another child who loves children and has a golden heart, has a hidden secret that finally came to light. <br /> <br /> Together, women live for revenge, rest on each other, and give each other life-long learning. But it is Bette Midler, Candice Bergen, Cloris Leachman, Carrie Fisher and Debi Mazari, who show the cruel and ordinary behavior of women. Bergen plays Ryan's mother, she's harsh, silver, experienced and still feels she's gotten her daughter later. There's Fisher who shows you how to blackmail and test the limits of selfishness, morality, and betrayal. Mazar, a gossip girl who does not show mercy for what he says and to whom he says it. Leachman, who plays Ryan's sassy household, knows her place, when and where she needs it and how to offer a good single layer. Finally, there is MIdler, who plays the crazy, but smart Hollywood agent Leah Miller. He is one of the characters who gives Ryan the epiphany to whom he really is, discovering what I want. Despite the Midler scene, which stole performance and memorable quotes, he was underestimated. <br /> <br /> But with the movie, women show the audience what it means to live in the 21st century, without knowing exactly what you want to come when you answer that question. It deals with feminism, what it means to be a woman (fierce, ruthless, bad ass, sticky, clever, clever, smart, shy, proud, ashamed, self-conscious, careless, beautiful, strong, independent); and also what women want, why are women the way they are. It's funny, modern and in no way a masterpiece. But the bottom line is that it is worth the money and time to see the veteran and the younger actors teach us all the women.
