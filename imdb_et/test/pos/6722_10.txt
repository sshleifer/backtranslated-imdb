Daisy movie review James Mudge From beyondhollywood.com <br /> <br /> "Daisy" sounds like a dream of Asian movie fans, directed by Andrew Lau of "Infernal Affairs" and who plays the favorite favorite girl, Korean actress Jeon Ji Hyun . Unfortunately, despite the fact that talent is involved, and the fact that the team flew in Amsterdam halfway around the world, the film is a bit disappointing, being a cliché romantic drama that seems to be in misery and self-importance. <br /> <br /> The plot follows Hye Young (Jeon Ji Hyun), a rather naive Korean girl living in Amsterdam, spending her life in her grandfather's antique shop and portraits for tourists. One day, he begins to receive flowers at exactly the same time as a secret admirer who believes he is a mystery man from the past who once built his nice little bridge. One day, he will meet Jeong Woo (Lee Seong Jae, also "Holiday" and "Public Enemy"), who is not really familiar with Interpol, who follows Asian criminals in the Netherlands. <br /> <br /> With Hye Young Assuming Jeong Woo is responsible for flowers, these two are slowly falling into a romantic relationship. However, it turns out that the flower sender is actually the park Yi (Jung Woo Sung, "Sad Movie" and "Musa"), an assassin who works in the Chinese crime syndicate. Inevitably, the love triangle becomes tragic and two men are facing, while poor Hye Young is trying to develop which one is the love of his life. <br /> <br /> Although "Daisy" is probably a love story, it has a funeral, slow, fast paced and plague that bothered. Half of the driving time of the film is taken from the characters of the scene that longed for the rain in the window, with silence interrupting only the bouts of self-worthy stories. Director Lau seems to be impressive that the film is a massive Shakespeare tragedy, not yet another gloomy-hit man's love story. In this case, the procedure is quite terrible, despite the fact that the plot is predictable in nature and largely based on the prominent clichés borrowed freely from "Fulltime Killer" and John Woo's classic "The Killer". Almost every part of the movie is filthy, the three main characters suffer as if the weight of the world on their shoulders and refusing to do everything to continue their romantic tendencies. Especially the park Yi, which is the most emotionally socially slowed assassin of today's cinema, is weakly ridiculous, starting with his brutal incompetence in the workplace with his fun attempts to discuss Impressionist painting with Hye Young or his desire for flower growth. This filthy inactivity makes the film somewhat absorbed by the central romance, and Lau's attempts to make it a fate that brings characters together are rather a messy coincidence. <br /> <br /> Fans of Jeon Ji Hyun should note that his character is much closer to his role in the nervous supernatural drama "The Uninvited" than "My Sassy Girl" or "Windstruck", and while he is trying his best to to pull some clumsy faces here and there, its performance will definitely be weaker. <br /> <br /> The film is in terms of glossy production values ​​and Lau uses the Amsterdam landscape, playing contrasting city gray, almost gothic beauty and innocent blue sky. flowering fields in rural areas. Unfortunately, for some emotional scenes, he tends to overuse the slowdown that, with some postcard visual images, gives the film a sense of perfume advertising. Surprisingly surprisingly, scenes of violent action, although they are scarce and far away, and although they are well-staged, they seem to have been thrown away as an afterthought and do little more than briefly boost the pulse. <br /> <br /> Despite his mistakes, Daisy looks interesting, and the story grabs, despite being mostly sick, to see which men do not reach Hye Young, but see who dies on his hands. The self-conscious melodrama works well enough to mark all the boxes on the right-hand side of the genre, and the film works perfectly well for a pleasantly shiny, crying romance. </Amend> A film that shows that it differs significantly from the theater version, which not only adds 25 minutes, but changes some scenes, making the narrative less linear. Although this new version is probably too long, it is definitely better because without these changes the film would have been even more common and would have suffered even through the development of a more murky character. <br /> <br /> Wai Keung Lau (director) / Jae-young Kwak (scenario) CAST: Woo-sung Jung?
