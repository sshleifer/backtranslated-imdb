It's not a story. It is a set of psychic needles that reach your subconscious. If you are waiting for a story, then boring. But if you give it to yourself, you will get in the dream world in 10 minutes. A vague but disturbing picture of pain and torture in an abandoned landscape leaves room for your fantasies. The strange soundtrack that gives you the feeling of isolation, the visual echo of the crucifixion of Christ, the pulsating light, and the dark dark shadows, reach your subconscious to fill that space. I found myself trembling and unable to escape in front of my TV. It was like dreaming with the eyes. A weird nightmare, a bad trip, a religious experience ... it touched me deeply and celebrated me for life. It freed my mind and gave me one of those rare experiences of uniting the personality and joining the world of archetypes. Little freedom for the soul. But violent freedom ... Not a nice movie, but very strong and unforgettable. In my text there is literally no spoiler. For me, the big surprise of this film was its incredible intensity and its description can be understood as a spoiler. The less you know about this movie, the better.
