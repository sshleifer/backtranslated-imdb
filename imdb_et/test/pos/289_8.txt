I have to admit that I had little expectations of this movie. But I was surprised that it was fun, interesting and funny. It's a fun thriller, not a horror movie. There were moments that put my hair up! But even better movies were very fun, occasionally hysterical, comedic moments (you'll find out what I'm talking about). There are also some great special effects (and humor and special effects may not be separate). <br /> <br /> Working as a whole is very good - as good as a normal low budget horror movie. Especially the leadership (Jackie) and many of the smaller supporting roles (such as a lawyer, neighborhood couple, pizza man) work well. Had they not been, the film would not have been in my interest and I would have lost my story. It's a good, interesting low budget thriller and definitely worth renting!
