It's a good enough movie and you probably don't have to be disappointed, but again, Roy Scheider, just after he made the "French Connection", playing the police name "Buddy". They also use the same memorable "Bullitt" wheelman. At first, you think you've seen car tracking when you still have your face in your memory. Car chasing is great, but as with many movie scenes, it has some technical and editorial errors. Check out some other good, long and intense tracking "Puppet on a chain" and "French Connection II".
