I looked at the original external borders in real time when the first broadcast was and I was watching the original series again and again on the DVD. I think the new outer limit is more than just a remake of old restored episodes, as some younger commentators have suggested. <br /> <br /> Seven (7) years of programs versus just two (2) Over the course of the initial series, manufacturers and writers have definitely added a lot of new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer and very well produced (cable) TV series. The plots are intelligent, scientifically accurate forecasts of sometimes frightening and immediate future unknown opportunities. <br /> <br /> While most Hollywood manufacturers and leaders leave Sci-Fi unaware of horror and fantasy, this series of science fiction returns to the logical, moral, and philosophical predictions of current emerging technologies for their potentially fearsome near future. This series does it very well and remains unique to avoid the "shoot-em-up" video game monster mentally, most of the present generation. It has brain, history, message and good entertainment. It's an adult series without unbearable teenage know-how. Cheers! <br /> <br /> Now that we only get the MGM to release the entire new Outer Limits series from DVD, not just the six poor teaser discs, and the 1st season now only available.
