Takes dozens of movies of true crime every year. Every Saturday you see 3 or 4 during lifetime, and you can use it for a few weekends. So I started looking at Morrison's murders, I thought I knew what to expect: more or less competent retelling of real life murder. What I got was a subtle, beautifully acting drama that ended me from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Both brothers were completely convincing and Jonathan Scarfe was perfect in Luke's complicated role. The look and feel of Georgia was in almost every frame. If I had any complaints, it was Gordon Clapp as a sheriff. He just doesn't look or act like Byron Calhoun, a lawyer in the south of a small town. He looks and sounds like Medavoy, and Medavoy is not right for that part. <br /> <br /> But it's small in size: Morrison's murders are worth watching, not just in the rainy Saturday afternoon. If you go, record it. You won't regret it.
