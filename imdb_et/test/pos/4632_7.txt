It is a charming little film that resembles many similar factors from actual facts rather than actual dialogue. <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford (as always) looks great with a comic performance as a Penniless Air Force officer, marrying Debbie Reynolds after just one day of gold digging. <br /> <br /> After the first wedding evening and passionate life change in Spain, two quickly realize that apart from the strong sexual attraction they feel against each other, they have nothing in common. <br /> <br /> But if he decides to give his marriage, it will only take one month for a trial period and certainly not on the cards. <br /> <br /> Ford also drops its new $ 40,000 Lincoln Futura concept with a car (upcoming Batmobile), which he will win in the draw the same night he meets his new wife. br /> <br /> The car brings to it the unwanted attention of the air force, who sees it as a vulgar breaking of American wealth and prosecution of corruption and embezzlement. It also puts it in a 80-90% tax bracket and is uncertain as it is now facing a $ 17,000 tax law. Not as you should get money if your spouse is a person who spends more than $ 1,000 on a single purchase. <br /> <br /> Even if he tries to sell it, he will bring him an accident by selling as much as a cigarette or pantyhose to the natives - is punished by a court struggle so you can imagine that the $ 17,500 deal is practically polishing the polish. <br /> <br /> His potential buyer is also causing him problems as he is the newly-bullied Spanish fighter who has been attracted by the car and has a greater interest in Ford's wife, which is aggravated by the wealth of jet lifestyle offered what he's been looking for If Ford's sexual disappointment rises and jealousy about installing love rivals with Reynold's materialistic attitude and flirtatious behavior around beloved Spaniards who helped wedge deeper between the two, it seems that their whirlwind is any love and attraction they love two love birds first threw, can look out and keep them together? <br /> <br /> Not the best example of this movie genre, but thanks to its observable performance and enjoyable line it is definitely good.
