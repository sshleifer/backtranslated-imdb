One western I am very pleased about is that, apparently, the weak, who do not want to accept strength and respond to strong challenges, ultimately decide that there is no other option. In this film, there is a great moment when John Parrish (Glenn Ford) goes to the salon and decides to stand with fighter Wade Matlock. This is the type of scene that makes the audience praiseworthy. In my opinion, violent men are great Westerners. It uses a very wide screen, a spectacular mountain landscape. Women play an important role. Caroline (May Winn) deals with Parrish, but you feel that he is using him only to get out and move east. He wants him to sell a ranch at any price. Martha (Barbara Stanwick), is tired of assisting her exhausted husband Lee (Edward G. Robinson), but he does something to always get a bigger ranch and more power. Meanwhile, he betrayes his wife with his brother (Brian Keith). Her daughter Judith (Diane Foster) sees everything that happens, but the feeling of impotence is because she does not want to hurt her father. Parrish connects all the small farmers and uses the strategy learned in the army against Anchor Ranch. As he warned Lee, "Don't make me fight because you don't like my way of fighting".
