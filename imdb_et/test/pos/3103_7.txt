The film begins with a harsh old Broadway producer (exceptionally well played veteran player Richard Carle), led by a man who hopes to sell the story to the upcoming game. At the same time, there is a bad storm and their car stays in the mud, so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night. Fortunately, the mansion is close, although it seems strange that the inward people know the writer and he says he didn't know it was the man he knew (and despised). Though it seems to be bad and caused by writing, it is not .... as it is all part of the publisher's complex rose to act at home as actors out of their plot. At the same time, the manufacturer and his browbeaten assistant partly point out that the mystery of the murder at home is fake and I think the whole thing is pretty funny. What no one understands is that the escaped maniac is loose and intends to enter this well-established small plot by making some great turns. So if there seems to be a real murder, the actors are really scared, while Carle and his sidekick are convinced that it is all a scam. Although I have explained some of the plot, there are many more aspects of the film that you have to find out - and it is definitely entertaining and likely. <br /> <br /> Given that this is a B-film in the public domain, you will NOT be very hopeful for this small movie. However, I was delighted if the film turned out to be much better than the average - a very interesting and novel twist in an old clich√© plot in a dark and rushed yard that was carried in the mansion. In addition, although the drawing was very good, the dialogue was even better - with a lot of sparkling wine and a nice light. Perfect for pleasant surprises and your time.
