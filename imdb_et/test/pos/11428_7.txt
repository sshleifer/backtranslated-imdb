If you want to see Laurel & Hardy's comedies in Stan laurel's film, this is not the film for you. Stan will not find the nature and rhythms of these films for another two years. But if you'd like Rudolph Valentino BLOOD AND SAND to be good last year, it's a movie for you. All stops are pulled out of both physical comedy and title cards, and if the movie is not described together, the Valentino film plot will be used well.
