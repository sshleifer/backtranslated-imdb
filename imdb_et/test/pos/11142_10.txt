I was sorry enough that this movie wasn't even popular in Hong Kong at all. But for all the deadly Chow fans, this is a masterpiece that doesn't leave out. It is "Mo Lei Tou" (a comedy style based on Chow's unrealistic and ridiculous plot) with its excellence. The plot is absolutely 1000 times more ridiculous than any movie you can imagine. The dialogue is fantastic. No part of the film will cool down to stop laughing. <br /> <br /> Seeing a plot is simple but crazy to make u laugh. It starts with Chow, who marks the junior master (naturally spoiled) who has been imprisoned when he helps an innocent married woman whom she loves at first glance to dismiss her as a murderous evil minister whose son was a real convicted . Chow escape from prison and escape as a refugee. He plans to go to the capital to see the emperor and report his conviction. On his way, he managed to pull 2 ​​cute women, one circus, another prostitute, while he gained the highest skill to quarrel and thin Mama-san (who happens to be the future of the law). Finally, he was able to force the emperor to open the emperor by black mail, whom he met in a brothel. Emperor made him the supreme judge, who decided the case against the minister. He can set up some excellent but fun plots to force a convicting offender to be forced to fill him up while he is being thrown into jail. <br /> <br /> Plots are really fun and ridiculously brilliant. Also, don't forget the enormous dialogue that includes some great bad mouth quarrels between Chow and Mama-san, battling fat between Mama-san and sheer Mama-san to inspire Chow to learn later and quarrel near the end of Chow and the evil Eunuch Lee . In addition, some scenes are also great. Cantonese really well. What could be the reason why the early response to Chow's film gives a moderate response only from the Asian world. But when Chow's film began to spread its influence around the world, hardcore-like fans found that his film was no longer as funny as the old time.
