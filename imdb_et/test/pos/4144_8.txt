I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was crashed on a young plane. He was not in the old rock 'n role class, say, Chuck Berry or Jerry Lee Lewis, but he wasn't far behind. Who knows how big his legacy would be if he had been singing for decades. Almost every single person he posted was hit. <br /> <br /> So I was very pleasantly surprised by the good work of Gary Busey in his play and the voice of his song. He was proud of Buddy, as were actors (Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith) who played Holly's "The Crickets". <br /> <br /> Sounds reasonable, some of Holly's better-known songs start with a really good, strong finish, as Holly and the boys are shown in Iowa at her last concert. Busey not only sings like Holly, she's a dead ringer for her appearance department. Some things were the actress's best results and you didn't get any argument for me. <br /> <br /> I am also glad that they finished this Iowa concert movie with a congratulatory note instead of living his tragic accident. The end result could have been a real downturn, but they won't let it.
