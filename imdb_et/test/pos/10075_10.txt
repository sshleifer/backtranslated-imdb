Watching this little movie is a great pleasure from start to finish. The story is always entertaining, the tensions never disappear. The whole cast is wonderful. The work of Walken and Bracco is perfect, it is almost like a classical screw of romance. Bracco is very sexy and really funny because it is a scammer who fights for his independence. For some reason, did they give Walken a very strange part and a strange hairstyle I imagine? this is a kind of parody of what Burt Lancaster was in Elmer Gantris. For me, it added joy. This is the first movie I saw in Miguel Ferrer, probably one of his generation's least valued films. She is a very small Bracco pimp. Even Jamaican scammers are seeing. I can highly recommend this movie.
