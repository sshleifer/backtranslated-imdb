My first Ichikawa for many years and the first of his war films I've seen was very amazing and brutal. In the first scene, it is said that the nominal hero Tamura cannot continue with his unit where he has returned from the hospital. Do you have tuberculosis? but he is not sick enough for the hospital to take him, given their wounded war. But his old unit doesn't take him back; her CO gives her a grenade and tells her that if she feels herself disrupted, then it's a respectable thing to do. PFC for Tamura and everyone else. The hobby is odyssey or hell through hell? retreating forests, dead rocky plains and dead and dying Japanese soldiers who only hope to end in peace or death. Ichikawa's film has been captured with a stunning B & W range designed to bring out both Tamura and their encounters with what she is doing, as well as show how truly small and naked they are all in the midst of the huge part of mountains and forests? This little thing of people will soon end, the earth seems to have said, but I will survive and barely notice it. and spend the rest of the movie trying to stay alive, stay human and get out of danger. He does not manage to cope well in any way, slowly starving and finally doing quite repelling acts. Finally, he grabs two other desperate men who have lost or survived their units, and have used cannibalism? And in his weakened state with other armed men, the only way to live is to break everything he believes Ichikawa's film is as brutal, uncompromising and intense as every war movie I've seen. There are moments of humor and tenderness, but they are short and would not stay in memory, like a scene with a man in a mountain town who practically makes Tamura eat his meat? spoiled shoes fallen on a comrade for better skins? degradation that man can survive? A masterpiece that I probably don't look at for a long time. Viewed through a beautiful Criterion Collection DVD.
