I have to admit that when I first saw Madonna on a "Pops" holiday, I told my husband "one more amazing miracle of America to get the whole thing wrong!" Well she wore a wig and was dressed terribly. I've never loved her the way my daughter does, but I have to eat my words. I like some of her stuff and sometimes enjoy her filmed concerts. This Confessions tour movie is great even if the music is not (and not). I was impressed by the staging and concepts. Madonna's own performance was enhanced by the incredible dancers she decided to support. My daughter was at London concerts and was crazy about it. Lady (Madge) has so badly proved her initial assessment!
