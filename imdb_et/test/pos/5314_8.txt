I loved rye, it happens to be my favorite book. The sculptor author JD Salinger has the rights to the book and it is done so that no person can make a film with his permission. <br /> <br /> With this word, heres "Leland American States." A beautiful movie with a lot of meaning and depth in emotion. but many reminded me of the catcher, almost reminding me of the catcher. some of the stories reported by Leland in the movie, such as the visit to New York and his adventures, were very similar to those of holden trappers, and how Leland sees people and emotions like Holden is both simple and honest to themselves and others. The boss acts on credited don chead and Kevin spacy. great editing, everything falls together and loved this story together. recommend to buy or at least rent. good movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing he drags at some points but does it in the long run. give him time and appreciate a good movie.
