I saw this movie only quarterly, but this effect has never left me and I still remember my reactions to it. I was so much about the breadth and beauty of photography. I was surprised that an American studio could create such a European film at a slow pace and with its vague plot. The lack of strong characters seemed like a mistake, but I wrecked completely at the end of what seemed like it wasn't to give some plot cohesion and that was completely in conflict with the rest of the style. It was also refreshing to see the west coast, which did not give cruelty and exploitation, which was so often an unfortunate detriment to the American dream. Western scenes and sets also had authenticity, which was completely new to me and preferred the Last Deadwood series. The film was last cut to an American audience and it was my real wish that these days that Director Cuts would have the chance to edit in the light of reflection, this section , which could transform this disease into a crafted film masterpiece that had the potential to gain. I have seen that the first first paragraph and the social networking site are so meaningful, even though Christopher Walken is responsible for this mainly. If only De Niro and not Kris Kristofferson had played the lead, the creation of reality and atmosphere was still great to damage a good script. However, the camera was working so carefully that sometimes you could almost believe you were inside. And there were many special moments. Anyone who claimed in different languages ​​in the hall, trying to overcome their national differences and seek united action for a future catastrophe, gave a real overview of the US welding difficulties: especially when the threat was due to a combination of old elite and money. there was an amazing approach to Ella as opposed to the violence that was supposed to follow and there was one more. I had a special show with a large group of companions to see a new paragraph and we all enjoyed it with a different reservation. This review, and much closer to the true version of the events, was probably too much for the Americans when the movie was first released, but we all felt that it had a huge decoration and that its place in cinema history had to be made to make big changes too
