Emily Grace's great performance! I caught this movie while browsing my satellite list and was curious that the plot from my satellite service provider was a summary. I was in high entertainment and I had a lot of sympathy for the character Alice played by Emily Grace. The story guessed me what would happen to Alice and that wasn't predictable. The general story was refreshing and he had very difficult characters. The story ended fairly fairly. I buy this DVD to add to my library. I'm a new fan of Emily Grace and I hope to see more of my performances.
