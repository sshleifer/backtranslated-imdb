I got this exhibition a couple of times when I was young and I played a tilt, my parents loved it and now in syndicates I know what they feel. This exhibition did what the original boundaries and the twilight zone (new and old) could not do. This exhibition used some old ideas and some truly original ideas. <br /> <br /> I still can't believe Jonathan Glassner and brad wright did that. These guys were the manufacturers of stargate sg-1. The exhibition kept the audience alive and created a truly frightening atmosphere. It wasn't in the new twilight zone. Rod's frightening fire comes in addition to frighteningness, making the mood easier in the forest. <br /> <br /> Finish whether good or bad is done for a frightening time. You can never predict what will happen. I'm still trying to find the seasons on DVD.
