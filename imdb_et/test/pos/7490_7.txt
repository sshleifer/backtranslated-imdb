It resembles so many films such as PULP FICTION or RESERVOIR DOGS, which it is impossible to believe that Tarantino's films were not the source of inspiration for this FULL DAY. For a low-priced B-Series movie, it's not bad. The gangster plot is enchanting and funny and also has a bit of dark humor and sarcasm found in PULP FICTION. Resources were not very sure, but the film is well produced. Also works good. I enjoyed the scene when the girl sat on the couch, teasing the doctor ... At the same time it was hot and funny! Music is also nice. I didn't hear too many songs, but what I heard was like. I'll do it 7/10.
