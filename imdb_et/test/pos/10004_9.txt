I saw this movie on September 1, 2005 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges of the Heartland Film Festival, who is showing films for his truly moving picture award. A truly moving image "... explores the human journey by artfully expressing hope and respect for the positive values ​​of life." Heartland awarded this film with this award. <br /> <br /> This is a story about golf at the beginning of the 20th century. At that time, it was a top-class and rich "gentlemen's" game and working people could only participate in being in the country clubs. With this background, this is-a-true-story story for a young working class boy who takes over the golf course and the world's largest golfer Harry Vardon. <br /> <br /> And the story is inspiring. With all the odds, Francis Ouim (playing Shia LaBeouf's "Holes") will compete against the largest US and UK golfers in 1913. Francis is poorly prepared and has a child for the child. (Caddie is fun and motivating and steals every scene he is.) Despite these shortcomings, Francis in this world-class event shows courage, spirit, heroism and humility. <br /> <br /> And we learn a lot about golf early years; for example, the use of small wooden clubs, the arrangement of short holes, the hand scoreboard, the golfers sink in the mouth, the terrible conditions of green and fairways, and the game is not canceled even in the rain. <br /> <br /> This movie is an amazing direction and editing of cinematography and art. And without big movie stars, this story is somehow more plausible. <br /> <br /> This adds to the amazing list of "Miracle" and "Remember the Titans" movies. <br /> <br /> FYI - It's a truly moving images website that lists past winners who come back for 70 years.
