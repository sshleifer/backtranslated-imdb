If you liked Paddy Chayevsky's "Network", you probably like this black comedy because it's another brilliant Chayevsky script, a wonderful satire in metropolitan hospitals and the perfect vehicle for Geo. C. Scott. She plays the burnt medical manager on the most chaotic day she or his hospital has ever seen. His personal crisis is on his head and his hospital falls around him as the locals show the hospital and patients and doctors die at an alarming rate thanks to a biblical and murderous saboteur. The latter, who announces himself to be a "fool for Christ", "Kaborka parakleet", "Lambi anger" and "Hell of Hell", manages the head physicians, manages deadly injections, and exchanges the patient's identity, causing treatment and actions for the wrong people. <br /> <br /> This movie makes you uncomfortable because such deadly mistakes (like hopefully not so much, not so often and not in one place) and at the same time make you laugh at the priceless nature of portraits. One is Richard Dysart ("L.A. Law"), Dr. Wellbeck, a sort of celebrity surgeon who spends much more time worrying about his investments and publicly traded stocks than his patients who are deadly suffering from their great indifference and negligence. There is Diana Rigg, who is a free soul, hippie-ish Barbara Drummond, who seduces a fearsome medical officer (Scott) and tries to escape her. Then there is a misleading murderer who happens to be Barbara's father and who "works well" back to the Indian reservation where she lives with her daughter and even works in a clinic, but has been pushed crazy just by putting it back to civilization. The tallest portrait is far from Dr. Scott Bock, who keeps his soul as a genius of former boys, a failed father and a husband, a brilliant doctor and a responsible administrator who constantly dreams of suicide but has to withstand the demands of his work. Scott is extraordinary in this demanding role. <br /> <br /> Until you know the final scene, Bock leaves the Barbara India reservation and quieter, simpler life behind the hospital, whether her murdering father is caught or that the protesting local people are kidnapping and bringing the hospital to their knees. Observing that the work is a crazy killer, it is suspected that Chayevsky tells us that our mad society is doing things like telling us that he is a different person from cities and people. <br /> <br /> As my father was the chief administrator of several major hospitals, over the years, he has been thinking about the demands and responsibilities of his work. This story brings with it the responsibility that Scott is turning to the crisis. This is a funny and frightening film where participants meet the great demands of the Chayevsky script. It is also a movie that I get more every time I watch it.
