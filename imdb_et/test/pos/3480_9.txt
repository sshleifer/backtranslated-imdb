Who could have guessed that a non-disabled participant could act in the film both real and impossible? Probably someone. But no one, really someone, was able to compare their expectations with the amazingly emotional and powerful performance of the two filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Michael (Steven Robertson) lives at home with disabled people. He has a brain-Paulsy and, as shown to us at the beginning, has great problems in communicating. So it's really a lifeline, when a companion with a disabled member Rory (James McAvoy), who can speak normally, understands him. That's how friendship starts, mainly based on (ironically enough) communication. <br /> <br /> In a fun scene, they manage to move from home to home. When Rory was rejected, Michael applied with good heart to move to his house. Rory, who already had the "judges" bad name, was supposed to be his interpreter. <br /> <br /> There will be problems soon. They are happy to start with a girl who met in the pub some time ago, wanting to be their assistant to do the little things that matter. He is first of all reluctant; he doesn't know these men, but they seem to be safe; so it strikes another friendship, but not necessarily good ... <br /> <br /> In addition to the fact that this movie is not very amazing, this film relies on the participants. But that's not bad. For a disabled actress, you can see Rory, although she can communicate properly, frustrated how she is completely dependent on other people and who has no real life. But the real star for me is Steven Robertson. He works with such emotion, longing to fit, and sadness / happiness that really sees him across the film. <br /> <br /> Great. <br /> <br /> Total: 5
