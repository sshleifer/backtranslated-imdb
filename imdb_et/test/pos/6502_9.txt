Wow - most of the viewers just seemed to shake their heads through a lot of this documentary on the screen. <br /> <br /> The transition from the first days of the New York Black-American phenomenon to the present days is a racially diverse subculture (and largely on the west coast) well-designed. <br /> <br /> The humble player doesn't respect any traditional musical instrument, but it can be much more versatile and technically complex. These DJs, among other things, take the necessary skills for musical instruments - skill, rhythm and timing - and apply them to new technologies with multiple other variables. <br /> <br /> DJ Qbert's comment that he is photographing what "music" must sound like on the advanced planets and then it works out, seemingly silly at first, makes more sense when you look at these men and spit out the sounds that no traditional instrument can ever create! <br /> <br Some critics have said that this film focuses too much on certain "stars" and destroys the possibility of a wider hip-hop culture of the profile. One movie at a time for people!
