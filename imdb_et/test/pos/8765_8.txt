Saboteur is a 1942 film whose goal is to get American support for the war against Nazi Germany. Propaganda or not, it's a great entertainment. Leading actors include Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane, although director Alfred Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwycki in roles that would have made the film grow bigger. This is still a good movie, where Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane bring their style characters. As with other Hitchcock films, we see the director's neglect of socially viable and well-run films. He often depicted spies and foreign agents as a nice top-class people who, at the same time, collided with democratic values ​​and concepts as guilty until they were innocent. These top crust traitors are the last ones to be monitored or even suspected by the police. Hitchcock had the police all his life. He wanted to raise a normal boyfriend, a firefighter and a companion who didn't take himself too seriously. You can see that he wants Gary Cooper as Frank Capra's mold icon. However, Bob Cummings puts his son on his seal and works well. Priscilla Lane, like a bright female leader, looks like an American girl who can test her pretty nicely. Robert Cummings, Barry Kane, a defense worker, is designed to bombard his best friend. This leads to a scenic scenery that resembles other Hitchcock heroes. Hitchcock repeats some of the established formulas of earlier films - a reluctant woman involved in action, eg. Madeleine Carroll 39 in step and risking her life to refrain from the powers of her heels. We look at American scenes when Kane tries to find the real culprit he is blaming. We see rivers, bridges, campfires, trucks, Hoover Dam and New York. New York is a suitable backdrop for the climax when we go from Rockefeller Center to ocean liners (cut to ship to Normandy) and Grand Finale Freedom Column. Great movie with uninterrupted action. Don't miss it.
