The Sharpe Prize without Fight is the fifth entry in the TV series, which focuses on the English army rifleman during the Napoleonic wars and is based on Bernard Cornwell's books (which I recommend to read). If you start to look at it, then you would have the impression that Sharpe is not as many soldiers as the very centrifugal force that the rest of the army is rotating. If this is the case, I would recommend starting with earlier chapters, such as Sharpe's Eagle or Sharpe Company, but it is a worthwhile choice for another. <br /> <br /> This procedure is a story about espionage. When the French army retreated from Major Duco, Spain, the slender spy master was able to turn around. The British Army hero Richard Sharpe's assassination of murders begins to break the fragile British / Spanish alliance and turn things around again. When the Spanish nobles come to Wellington, who cry for Sharpe's blood, English is less than he wants to hang his best soldier, so he's deceiving his death and soon, he's behind a secret mission enemy line to find out who led the plot. It is also quite surprising for Sharpe's movie, there is a fantastic woman who will be saved. <br /> <br /> What this is, of course, is the adventure-style approach. Concentration is less than English-speaking military personnel in Sharpe and are more focused on their countryside escapades, getting into French patrols, baking Spanish spices and participating in cruel military positions. Sergeant Harper, his loyal right-hand man, naturally sends him, but the rest of the brothers remain in the camp without knowing their leader is still alive. Strangely enough, however, they get more attention than usual when they finish their sub-block, which includes Harper's child delivery. <br /> <br /> This slightly different approach makes for an intriguing episode, but is just a good thing in the long run. And should anyone worry that there is no ordinary battle at the peak, because the poor old French will get the right hit again. In addition, Ducos makes a fantastic successor to Obadiah Hakeswill as a bad man you love to hate. She is a duplicating, malicious and absolutely evil son of a female dog, who also resembles a strange black man who has disappeared from the lost Ark Raiders. Elsewhere, Hagman is strikingly visible when he gets more opportunity with the screen and this is like the person you would like to offer to his first-born, even if he looks like a Iron Maiden member who got upside down at random. <br /> <br /> In short, the second chapter of the Sharpe series is strong. Sharpe remains as heroic as ever, but much more bitter and angry, given the events of the previous film. This is not the best introduction if you have not seen any other chapters, but it shows Sharpe that we do not usually recognize a horse, not a professional soldier. And if that's not enough to tempt you, you should also look at the rather surreal vision of the raging Sean Bean who pulls the live chicken in a group of nuns.
