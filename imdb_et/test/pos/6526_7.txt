A £ 3.50 DVD can be a gamble and it was one that in turn paid off. <br /> <br /> A good Saturday night movie that is entertaining when you shine over the obvious plot errors. The special effects are somewhat small and with some repetitions (and why does London always look like it would be in the 60s?) <br /> <br /> If it were, for example, the Armageddon budget, then I'm sure it would be better at Box Office worked because the story is pretty good. <br /> <br /> Generally, Tycus is sent to B movie history, but when you see it for £ 3.50, it's worth buying.
