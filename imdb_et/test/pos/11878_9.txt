What's not there? <br /> <br /> I caught it again tonight and wondered if Hugh Bonneville had used ticks and cartoons to capture the character of Philip Larkin. the complexity of basic education and Hugh's biota. Her proud mother, her unresolved issues with her father and her inability to commit to a woman. <br /> <br /> His poems are intertwined and some scenes have been captured by reading them to a friend's spouse, to whom he later makes suggestions, but quite randomly, almost innocently. It is not difficult to see where his attraction lies with many women who fell in love with him (and knew each other, launched and continued to see him). <br />, jazz aficionado, loyal friend. It is always more than an appearance, women move beyond their baldness, deafness and myopia. Eileen Atkins is beautifully nuanced because her mother is an extra bonus. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
