I am a big movie enthusiast and an active rugby player who believes that rugby is the biggest game ever played. Forever Strong is a combination of coach Carter and sloppy rugby. This movie is full of great actors, well-developed characters, and action options that are right for you when you fall down and retreat, but more hands are captured than football football and almost every stroke when a player touches the ground in almost football. If you want your children to see a film that builds the character from the inside and can inspire the blind to see again, I can easily give it to 10 out of 10 if you want to see a great rugby movie that really shows you the sport, because Forever Strong is usually a practice, Running and One Patch, because it gives him 7.75 out of 10.
