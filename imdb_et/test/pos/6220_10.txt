The Year of the Rabbit is one of Jarva's political films. The life of a common person strongly opposes the status of the authority of today's society and how it is completely removed from nature by men. It challenges the concept of the freedom and prosperity of the entire welfare society. it is all in the desert of northern Finland - but to understand that the concept of "free state" is not all unambiguous, in other words, society has a person with balls. <br /> <br /> The Hare Year is both an extraordinary thing and a visual and humorous shine, however, it seems to illustrate the entire political atmosphere in Finland in the 1970s, as well as the Finnish identity as a nation. Vatanen is similar to the classical acne archetype in his kindness and social distance. Since nature has always played such an important role in the national identity of our Finns, JÃ¤niksen makes an emotionally moving movement from the time that modern society slowly removes.
