When I first played in the dream of Soul Calibur, I thought it was great. When I played you, I was hooked. And finally, when Soul Calibur III was released, I bought a playstation 2 and a game. <br /> <br /> It can really keep you for hours, having a lot of characters, loads that are unopened and not mentioned in the GREAT combat system, it's really the biggest fighting game so far. <br /> <br /> The strong points of the game are primarily vs gameplay, whether two human players fought against each other, either as one of the main characters or as a created and adapted character. The Create Creation option is great and allows the player to make thousands of different combinations. <br /> <br /> The only thing that disturbs me is that when you create a character that uses the fighting style "Grieve Edge" (only hitting) you must wear these ridiculous shoes. ^^ <br /> <br /> This is absolutely the biggest fighting game you could want. Now, I hope the planned movie is not messy.
