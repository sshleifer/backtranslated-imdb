I remember this movie for the first time with a friend on vacation in October 1977 in Anaheim, California. When we traveled by the city, we saw "ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX" advertising the tents of the city. So before you look at the Disneyland version of Lewis Carroll's classic half-miles away, our curiosity won and we made the threshold for this cinema. I remember even before the movie started, when I was surprised that I saw a movie appearing on the stadium in ultra-conservative Orange County. <br /> <br /> Thirty-two years later, I arrived at ALICE IN WONDERLAND to record a local video. I thought to myself when it was the same movie until I looked at the back of the jacket and saw the picture of lovely Kristine DeBell starring and decided to restore some pleasant memories. Subversive Video, which is their credit, has been issued by two packages, X and XXX. As it turns out, my friend and Anaheim saw X for X despite the original XXX ad there. The second time I see it, I understand what the delightful rostrum leader Bud Townsend brought to the screen. As an example of this man's scope behind the camera, he led two episodes of television shows on his salad days. <br /> <br /> Miss DeBell, released in April 1976 on the Playboy cover, is ideal as Alice. He brings fresh whole American innocence to the role of librarian for his twenties of better life. When her boyfriend is taken back to his next level, Alice reaches her turning point. This is a "musical comedy", but the melodies are quite memorable with the appropriate strings and brass to compensate for the broadly speaking words. Miss DeBell has a nice singing voice when she wants to be free. Then magic begins. The pace of this film is surprisingly liquid, given the existence of this genre and the supportive casting of Wonderland to allow Alice to flourish the female. Special attention is paid to TV veteran Larry Gelman, a white rabbit who seems to be the only sign that is not obsessed with sex because he is always late for meetings ... or something. <br /> <br /> Special features include comments noted by feminist lawyer Lena Ramone, who gives an overview of the film's visit to college, and, after graduation, influenced her adult career as an actor in her career. <br /> <br /> What makes ALICE WONDERLAND as such a haunted piece of equipment. Partially filmed in Vancouver B.C. The lush, natural glory of Stanley Park. You do not come to the feeling that you have been watching the nervous skin flick. At this writing, I haven't viewed a triple XXX version. Further superficial video material is likely to disrupt the overall flow and remove the light, windless atmosphere that appears throughout. <br /> <br /> Of course, Lewis Carroll's version is the best way to map and explore Alice's adventures in Wonderland. In a time capsule that represents the 1970s adult film archives, ALICE IN WONDERLAND is still worth the white rabbit to get a dirty ride full of strange chaos.
