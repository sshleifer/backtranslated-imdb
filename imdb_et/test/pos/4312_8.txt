it's good to see if you have time - dealing with three friends who get into an unnecessary bar and get into serious trouble. they fight with some shady people and can't deal with them. a very, very disturbing depiction of Japan, the arbitrariness of modern life ... some intense scenes, but the spoiler was a little pot. I probably don't know Japanese. <br /> <br /> The only other Japanese films I saw were kurosawa, who is different and far from this modern genre. so can not really compare. Otherwise, it better compares most of the Hollywood explosives intended for story and construction. <br /> <br /> Kill 24
