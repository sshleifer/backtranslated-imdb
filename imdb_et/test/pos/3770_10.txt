A 70's drug humor blend with a medical parody and a classic story line. As I've often said about this flick - if you don't get it - you're so flat ..... Classical lines like (parafaric) "I have this erection and it won't disappear how much I do, you're a sister, what do you give me for this? "Sister replies" everything I have 5 dollars and my wedding ring ... "Excellent soundtrack. Classic "Hyde has nothing to hide". Surprisingly close to the original plot - not that the original remains joking ..... Hasn't met anyone with an IQ over 115 that doesn't find it hysterical. <br /> <br />
