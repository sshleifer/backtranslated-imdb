The mere presence of Sam Waterston in Indiana is enough to put this movie in the black-and-black category. He is both beautiful and exquisite, without any line. She is gentle in her childhood and we see that she is among all young Indian men. Martin Sheen is just a stupid stick who decides to challenge Waterstone (White Bull) for an excellent white horse. Other sub-plots are really unnecessary. I don't understand the part of Caroline Langrishe, such as a poor girl who robs White Bull ... I don't know how she keeps her hands on this beautiful Indian man! But it's fun. especially if you're a Waterston fan. Man, he looks good in this! The role of Harvey Keitel is not really mentioned! But rent and have fun! In fact, I believe that if the music score was better, it would have been a more dramatic film ... the music is so bad it disturbs. Still - there is Mr. Waterston!
