For the first time I played it at about 98 'or 99' when I was with my friends. I thought the game was really big and loved it. <br /> <br /> The game is simple. In one player mode, you move around like James Bond and finish missions in different places like the Arctic wasteland or the city. My favorite was one tank. In two player mode, you and your friend chose any character and go out with the fight. In the area where you are, you will find ammo and weapons help. Hand guns shooter rifles and even your fists to work. <br /> <br /> In two-player mode, there are many places to go, and some to open. I find this game really fun, but also very tense. Because you never know where your opponent is, and it's surprising to see them behind the door where you go. <br /> <br /> This game gets **** (1/2) stars or ***** Very Good!
