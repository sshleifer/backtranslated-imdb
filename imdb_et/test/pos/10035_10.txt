The film is great. One of the most remarkable things is that Flynn is great. This is worth emphasizing because Bette Davis et al., As he often showed, was an actor. <br /> <br /> I remember this scene where Flynn gets drunk by Arthur Kennedy to bring him to death in battle. Little big horn. The cold, computational look of Flyni's face, if he does, is extraordinary - much better than the much-beaten Spencer Tracy or many other stars. <br /> <br /> Another remark is George's great power P. Huntley Jr as "Queen's Own" Butler. It is amazing why he ended up shortly after making films - it might have been thought he would have been a character for many years.
