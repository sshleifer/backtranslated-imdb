I like this film because it has a good approach to Buddhism, such as how Buddhist uses to care for all kinds of living beings, combining some fictional and realistic situations; in some respects, photography is a very good and a lot of freedom-related messages, such as a golden girl who is always present at all times, even in difficult situations. It is also a funny situation, like Swank's birthday and talking twice about Academy awards, his actors show us how people who live in such a culture try to have resistance when Miyagi takes him to a Buddhist temple and how he slowly changes his mind. And, of course, Pat Morita has always been great
