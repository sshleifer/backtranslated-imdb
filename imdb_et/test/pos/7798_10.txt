I find it hard to believe that this film has such a low rating. It is undoubtedly one of the best comedies ever made, and certainly the best Bollywood comedy of the 90s. The film did not work too well in the box, and people had diametrically opposed reactions after seeing it. I think most people do not expect this to be a challenging comedy and an ordinary movie is expected. If you love comedies, this is a must-see. And Aamir Khan is outstanding.
