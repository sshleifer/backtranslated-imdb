When it comes to political films, I usually go blank. They usually take a moral stand and have a clear and bad story as if it were some sort of Batman movie. <br /> <br /> But for Lumumba, this is the first film I saw, which showed the policy it is, and the real issues of trying to rule a crushed country, who knew no rule but violence. There were no good or bad interests and conflicts of interest. This is the only political film in my opinion that it can really learn something. Particularly for anyone who has a political career in mind, this film shows that you cannot decide what you want for the country, but what the state wants from you. <br /> <br /> That's why I do not agree with many reviews that say everything is bad, I think they are too idealistic (the Belgians want a perfect colony, Lumumba wants perfect unity in Congo, Tshombe wants wealth and wealth, America wants a perfect ally against communism, Russia wants perfect communism). And Congo? They come away and abuse, (the best example in the movie, when Général Janssens tells his black troops that your government lied to you and left them all in hand), pulled and always pushed to support that person. /> <br /> This movie shows politics error can cost you dearly and this film makes a mistake after it expands and ends with the destruction of the state. Their intentions may be good (or at least in the mark's opinion), but it is everyone's mistakes that lead to the fall of Congo. I don't think anyone in this movie is bad, I think they want too many people who have given up and want to start. <br /> <br /> In general, it's not just the best political film, it's a big movie in general. The action is fabulous (Eriq Ebouaney, because Lumumba was the perfect casting, which I really believe in him), the script is flawless, improves the perfect pace and the value of the output is higher than I hope for Central African film. Must look.
