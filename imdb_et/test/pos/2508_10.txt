Director Peter Chan, Script Maria Maggent. <br /> <br /> Based on "Letter of Love" by Cathleen Schine, director Peter Chan's film version, released in 1999, was not a big post office, not even for a romantic movie with some comedy elements. Although not so popular in theaters, it quickly became a beloved movie on cable TV and VHS / DVD. Seaport in the old town of the old United States (I forget the exact location), this is the story of a mysterious letter of passionate love, symbolizing emotions and confusion among the main characters, anyone who thinks the letter is addressed to them personally. At the end of the film, we do not know who the lover is or loved, but the power of the letter has changed the life of almost every small town. Great actors who have been well on television and film, including Kate Capshaw's leading role in medieval beauty, Helen, bookstore owner, comedienne Ellen DeGeneres as her friend / employee, Janet Hall, young hottie Tom Everett Scott as Johnny, young 20 who is Elder Hellen and Elder Tom Selleck, like George Matthias, a firefighter who has to talk to Johnny with Helen. The veteran old Hollywood actress Gloria Stuart, who is best known to today's audiences as the older Rose "Titanic" (1997) and the Kate Capshawi's own daughter (together with her husband Steven Spielberg), is accompanied by roles. The love triangle is between a middle-aged woman, an older man and a young man, who is both passionate about Helen and a mysterious letter to the writer. The conflict lies in Helen's indecision. Does he choose the right person? Which man offers him the most? Johnny is in a relationship with his age, who loves him with his passion and is actually a reminder of what Helen was like at his age. George is in the process of divorcing his wife and has lived a earthly and eventful life. A cultural intellectual, he takes on Helen's Opera Day, where the tragic death of Puccini's ultra-Italian heroine Tosca leads to Helen's explosive tears. The operator of Tami Reiker is beautifully decorated from a beautiful coastal town. The result is a paradise for romantic and lovely songs - "I've never loved before", "I'm in love", and "Only lonely". Ellen DeGeneres as Janet Hall, who is constantly late for her job at Helen's bookstore, who drives men endlessly and can't find the right man, is just wonderful. She has not lost her comic elegance, although at the time of her career she did not seem to be on television or on film, because only about two years before the mid-1990s, she was hit by "Ellen" because of her "coming" as a lesbian and exhibition new lesbian theme. Here you will find even the comedian Jack Black long before he made it big in the small part of the fisherman. It is a moving film about people's emotions and important decisions, the need for passionately consuming love and general love for espism, not only through books, letters and music, but through a truly loving and secure relationship. It's a great movie with great moments and an infectious romantic spirit.
