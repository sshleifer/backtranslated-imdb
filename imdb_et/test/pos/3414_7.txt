Warmly sentimental story from the author of Waltons. If somebody tipped me into the material, I would probably push that too into a stomach. But the dramatization here drives the tear without the anticipated torture. In the 1950s, nobody in loved hay seed was better than Arthur Hunnicutt. His appeal here is for perfect use as a mountain man who is faithfully believed in a loyal hunting dog. Their fate is bound up both inextricably and with each other's bond. Good. I see a delicate environmental message here. All critters go to heaven because we can condemn a poor devil who simply follows the instinct to live. There is no deception in the animal kingdom, and yet we are cruelly treating them. A strange satisfactory episode that confirms this important message.
