I am pleased that this was the work of foreign cinematographers because it cannot be blamed for unfair prejudice. For some reason, Jacksonville police in this case rush to decide and choose the first black suspect who is accused of murdering a white foreign tourist. They chose 15 a. an old boy who is almost as close to the saint as you could find by chance and then try the fools himself to beat him unlikely. In addition to the injustice resulting from a blatant prejudice, a six-month-old completely innocent young black teenager has been unfairly imprisoned. This raises one question as to whether, as a society, we should compensate those accused, imprisoned, and then innocent. This docudrama is well-produced, professionally recorded and presented in an exciting package that you don't want to take a one-minute break. If you care about social justice, don't miss it. He certainly deserves his Oscar.
