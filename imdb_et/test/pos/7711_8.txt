This is the fifth part of Animatrix, a collection of animated short films that tell us a little about the "Matrix" world. This time, they introduce Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) to a detective who has been hired to find her. Excellent black-and-white animation and interesting story is again wonderfully animated at a glance.
