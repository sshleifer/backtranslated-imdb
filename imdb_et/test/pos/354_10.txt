* THIS NOTE WILL BE POSSIBLE SPOILERS! I checked the spoiler box just when it wasn't needed because you know when I say you need a spoiler and I don't want to! * Wow ... the best game after Super Mario 64. the game the first day it came out, and before I got it, I went to some gaming websites to see my ratings (yes, they had already reviewed it) and was shocked. I was expecting something like Sunshine, because lately all Mario games have worsened and become worse. But it won other games completely. The results of this game even won Halo 3! It's just amazing. <br /> <br /> NATURE: Not the best, Mario games are never known for these plots and it is not really a big difference. Bowser once again plunders Peach, but this time it invades a century-celebrated festival that can fly to the plate and shoot lasers on the ground, and then place the anchors on the ground and blow up the castle and burst the castle and its foundation into space. <br /> <br /> GRAPHICS: Completely gorgeous, best graphics in Wii so far. Water effects are also really nice if you ever see water, it seems so real because they affect them. <br /> <br /> Music: Just amazing, music in this game is organized. Not all, but even those that are not organized are still very nice. <br /> <br /> GAMEPLAY: Very fun, keeps you wanting to play more and more and for me, as I tend to be very frustrated when I die a lot, I think I'm not the only one, but this game is mine there wasn't so much for it. It was still such a thing, but not a point like Mario 64, where I get totally crazy and finally turn off the game because it made me crazy, it's never done. <br /> <br /> ANSWER: There are two types of difficulty, because you can just technically win the game with only 60 stars, which I find easy, but to win 100% of the game, you have to get 120, as always, and that search is harder but at the same time very fun. <br /> <br /> LENGTH: Good length, definitely not too short. It took me about 15-16 hours to win it with just 60 stars, but 120 took me more than 45-50 hours. Now I didn't play that much all the time, I played for the first time a day, a few days a few hours every day, then the next two days I played it all day. However, I think the 60 star search was a bit short, so if you want a long game, I suggest you get all of them. <br /> <br /> PRESENTATION: Now, movie movies are great. How they are, just as much as I would see in theaters. They're still holding the best cinematic scenes in any Mario game. <br /> <br /> GENERAL: This game is definitely a great game, and I suggest you don't wait until Christmas to get it as soon as possible. This game is also a good mix of old and new, you have some sidescroller levels, where you just move from side to side or up and down, because they change in gravity, but even music has some old classics. This game seems like a masterpiece. For me, this is my favorite Mario game all the time, but others may disagree. But it's still a great game. I recommend to every player who wants to have fun with this game.
