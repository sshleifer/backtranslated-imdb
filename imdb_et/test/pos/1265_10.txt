I'm surprised that Memento (which is a great flick) in the Top 250 is so well appreciated and it doesn't even appear! What the hell is this ?? Frankly, when that movie ended, the knee-reagent was that the film was better than Memento. After a fabulous end to euphoria, I concluded that they were equal in their excellence. I'm just confused about why it's not Top 50 with Memento. I'm going to think that (unfortunately) this is because it is black and white, or because (again, unfortunately) that all the characters have British accents ... unfortunately, because it's not a reason not to understand such a big movie. <br /> <br /> I tell you that if you love Memento, you will also love the following. Brilliant!
