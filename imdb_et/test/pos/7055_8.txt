Wildman's chief adviser, Tripper Harrison (Bill Murray in his first lead in the form of a nut), runs a variety of funny hi-jinks in a North Star summer clip. Tripper with friends sad and lonely misfit child Rudy (nice and affects performance Chris Makepeace). Director Ivan Reitman funly combines wall comic art with endless speed and keeps an amazingly good-looking tone. This movie captures the middle of the medieval interior in the summer: friends, first love, twitching, competing in a sports event with a camp, a campfire site and, of course, an inevitable psycho-killer fleeing a frantic city refreshment. Funlessly fun, this picture is infectious. What's more, humor is always silly and occasionally harsh, but never too disgusting or exorbitant. Best of all, there's a clean heart to go with that humor (the warm relationship between Tripper and Rudy is really touching). There is an obvious ball that plays its pleasant signs: Murray's brilliantly gonzo and galvanizing presence keeps things moving (his crazy PA messages are completely sideways), plus Harvey Atkin says Morty, Kate Lynch Tripper's sassy old flame Roxanne, Russ is a miserable camp owner Banham as a friendly Crockett; and Matt Craven as hip hardware. Donald Wilder's cinematography gives the film an attractive, sunny look and makes the napkin enjoyable. The trick also makes Elmer Bernstein's lively and melodic score. A real rebellion.
