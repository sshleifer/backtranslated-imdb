Violent men are good west. Perhaps it is not the owner of the original robbers who are committed to crowding out small rivals in the valley it needs for its growing bovine, but the film has many ingredients that raise its level and are worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Highlighting is cast. There's a trusted Glenn Ford (John Parrish) as a former military officer, and now one of the small shepherds who is trying to get out of trouble until he is pressed hard. Edward Robinson (Lew Wilkinson) is as good as always when a big man and Barbara Stanwyck (Martha) play their deceptive woman in one of her usual female roles that she easily deals with (others were Double Indemnity and Blowing Wild). Brian Keith (Cole) does it perfectly when Robinson's armsman brother, an ambitious man who tries to take over his brother's big ranch, no matter what the usual 50-year-old western villain Richard Jaeck (Wade Mattlock) ends as usual (no surprise) Dianne Foster (Judith Wilkinson) plays Robinson's daughter who does not confirm her father, mother and uncle's way of dealing with her neighbors. <br /> <br /> Rudolph Mate brings a standard but acceptable direction that may have been helped by a beautiful and wide-opening landscape and a subtle and appropriate music score also helps. <br /> <br /> The inevitable final showdown between Ford and Keith is one of the best in Western films. shooting her s on the wheelbarrow and on the way to her target in the military) solves her differences once and for all and all times. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of Glenn Ford's best Western performances, the second only for the classic "3: 10 Yumale," he did two years later. It is probably cast, which puts the film "A" and, like me, enters the top 10 of the genre.
