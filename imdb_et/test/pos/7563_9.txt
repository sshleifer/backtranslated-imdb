What a great movie! This is a story about four high schools that grow in the 1960s. Throughout the decade, friends have been somewhat separated, but they go to see each other from time to time. There are many tragedies, but there are also many happy moments that make you laugh and smile. It's a heart-filled story of life, love and friendship. You must definitely show the drama fans.
