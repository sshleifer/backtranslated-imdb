This film was a new direction for Natalie Portman. Much of the role of adults, although he gets into the footsteps of the child himself in the film. Ann, (Portman) and Susan Sarandon, who are playing their newly divorced mother, Adele, are traveling from a small town somewhere in the middle of Beverly Hills. There, these tortured souls strive for their new life and new relationships as the character of Portman grows. Adele unknowingly grows up and becomes a better mother. <br /> <br /> Ann sees her mother as she wants to be an actor, or she thinks. Adele uses this crutch every time there are problems in their lives. We see their struggle between mother and daughter that they are in contact with each other and are left alone, leaving their old lives behind. <br /> <br /> The actor is both higher. They seem to be in front of the mother and daughter. You can almost feel there is a real link behind the movie. <br /> <br /> Although this movie doesn't really take us to new bases in this type of movie, it's a good thing, and the story isn't too bad, let me suggest it. <br /> <br /> However, I say it will soon go away, I don't think it will have a powerful Christmas that is necessary for the huge Christmas season at the beginning of the season. See it now before it happens if you like one of these actors.
