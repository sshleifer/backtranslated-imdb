I saw it in preview and it doesn't seem to have been published in the US. However, it was one of the most enjoyable small comedies. It concerns a competition between two funeral organizers in a British town. The [movie] plot gets a little out of the third window, but the characters are very enjoyable and memorable. <br /> <br /> Actress is very good. Of course, the blockade of the blockers is neglected, it is a movie that is worth looking at. I know I'm trying to catch it in theaters again and / or buy a video.
