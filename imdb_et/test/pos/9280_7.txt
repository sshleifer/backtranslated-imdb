Um .... a serious movie about worrying teenagers in Singapore, a country where I don't have much knowledge, but I have the previous wrong impression that all children are very disciplined and controlled by their family and government. Well, I think I'm wrong, like other cities / countries, they also have their worrying teenagers who also run drugs, struggles, bad language and so many surprising rebel lifestyles. is a bad boy. The surprising part of this film is not actually how these children run for themselves and for other problems, but rather for the subtle homosexuality that lies between them. The connection between these "brothers" can come from the tendency of these unconscious gays inside their boys. While it is not uncommon for str8 boys to communicate very closely with each other, but watch this movie closely, it should enter all kinds of gay movie festivals and I would not be surprised that it can win much more prizes in that direction!
