Fun movie! The script is terrible, but the quality of the participants saves the day. John Hurt is perfect, like Jane Alexander. Beau Bridges is fair and the actor who plays his wife is very weak. The story is a real star. Based on the actual story, the pace moves well and the whole East Germany escape concept sucks you and holds you. The joyous end completes enough elation to compensate for the script. Don't expect the quality of the Academy Award, but it's a great ride for the whole family.
