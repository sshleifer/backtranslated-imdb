When you set off Seinfeld, it's the Best Comedy, no doubt! Just Great! <br /> <br /> Queen of Queen quit her eighth season of home bliss. The exhibition in the suburbs of the New York Queens working class is held by Doug Heffernan (Kevin James), a friendly delivery man and his spouse, Legal Adviser Carrie Heffernan (Leah Remin), as they explore the daily challenges of love, life, family and marriage. <br /> <br /> Doug and Carrie deal with everyday domestic situations that reflect our times and allow us to laugh. Their love for each other will eventually carry them through every dilemma they face, whether it be Dougi's affirmation of food or Carrie's obsession with expensive clothing. <br /> <br /> Doug and Carrie also have to deal with Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), the father of a third widow of the Heffernan household Carrie, who lives in his cellar. His constant presence and often strange behavior add to their daily adventure. Doug and Carrie have stumbled upon an unusual solution to reduce their burden and keep Arthur happy with his usual excursion, the lightweight dog walker Holly (Nicole Sullivan). Dougi's friends Deacon Palmer (Victor Williams), Spence Olchin (Patton Oswalt) and cousin Danny Heffernan (Gary Valentine) rounded with their "man" humor and different perspectives. "Honeymooners," The Queen's King finds inspiration in everyday life situations. Last season alone, Doug Carrie saw a "loan" with a meaningless deacon to help thank dinner; Heffernanid suffers from mold and financial burdens that cause mold damage to your house; and Doug and Carrie tried to copy a couple whose photos are more adventurous than Doug and Carrie, whom they accidentally took home. We also looked at Arthur growing up for a jealous new dog, who added Holly to his route, and Doug discovered that his overwhelming parents replaced his childhood Rocky three times behind his back. The series introduces James' incredible physical comedy, Remin's hard sharpness and Stiller's unique comic. <br /> <br /> You can't ... You shouldn't leave it!
