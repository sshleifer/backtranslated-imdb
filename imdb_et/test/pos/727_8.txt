A raw nervous thriller aimed at great philosophical heights, which he could not fully achieve. I still enjoyed the movie enormously. It had great proportions, leaving me with this pleasant backbone with the chilli I was expecting from the thrillers, and it reached it purely psychologically without the use of expanding blood and gore. The soundtrack and the device were perfect for skipping. Sometimes it was a little polished, especially acting and character development. It could have been just a better film if we knew more about the horror of the past that the characters would see when they close their eyes, and why they thought it was necessary to find a "response" that was so inseparable. After all, they seemed to continue looking for it, even though they knew or experienced what would happen when they found it. I would recommend seeing this movie when you are ready to look beyond to see the potential of diamonds.
