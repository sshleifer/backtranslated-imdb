I think celebrity was the best movie I've ever seen. So it was funny and dramatic, but it does make a movie. It's true that it has some loose ends, actually a lot, but I think it's a great movie. Some funny things happen at the beginning of the movie. I think it's fun when a girl tries O.J. Simpson's "The Towering Inferno" and Raul / Ralph go around every art department, saying his father was big. He says his father danced with missiles and left Ralph with his crane locks. Rockets, as I know, are women. And the crane latches were just ordinary shoes with bottle caps on the bottom. Also, a man who read Rome and Juliet playing Juliet's lines was funny. One thing about the movie that just turns me on is music. I've never heard anything like this !!! My favorite song is "I Sing the Body Electric" and my second song is "Fame". Irene Caral is a great voice and a great actor. I like how the film focused on many ethnic groups. It showed all the people who are actually called "Guardia School of Performing Arts" there. This film showed the triumphs and trials of many young performers, including Angelo, Doris, Bruno, Coco, Montgomery, Ralph, Leroy, Hilary and Liza. They all had a hard time, but he did his way. This movie could have been added for about 30-45 minutes (before graduation), but it's still my favorite movie, no matter what !!!!
