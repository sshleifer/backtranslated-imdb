Beware of Scottish Play! In his riveting and harrowing opera, Dario Argento returns to the classic form, reusing the loss he lost when he filmed complex and shy psychococci, such as Tenebre and Phenomena. Indeed, the film is based on a simple narrative, which is compensated by rich sets, imaginary cruel sequences of murder and refined photography, such as the film we once knew. Opera's only real violation is the lack of Goblin scores, which gave unusual, iconic and timeless music to many of Argento's biggest films (but the opera options used here are excellent). <br /> <br /> Production meets several competent participants. Though she is not Jessica Harper, Annabella Sciorra sees Cristina Marsillach as managing enough torture and compassion to understand the role of the tortured heroine. Ian Charleson is interesting as a horror-film-helmer-opera director Marco. And Daria Nicolodi is fantastic, as always, even in a relatively short role (see how a DVD has featurette making a fun interview with Nicolod about her role - explicitly and outrageously in her relationship with Argento! -Ga). Stage Fright (another great 1987 giallo, directed by Michele Soavi, who was the head of the second unit of Opera) barely feels the last girl of this movie, Barbara Cupist, as a director here (I think it's the glasses that do that). <br /> <br /> There are often few things to do with me, and Argento's magic / obsession with lonely nightmare pictures makes him my ideal filmmaker. Opera is full of small details that left me smiling. For example, I love the fact that we never see the face of "Great" Mara Czekova. I also love the scene where the killer scratches the tip of his deadly sharp spot on a television screen showing Betty's action as Lady Macbeth. Finally, I can't even get the most grizzled slasher veterans to light up like "pin grates" being placed over Betty's eyes. In short, Opera is a clean, tense and tense thriller. With a strong performance, passionate focus, and literary cinematography, it wants to be in the same league as Deep Red and Crystal Plumage. Could Opera be the last big giallo?
