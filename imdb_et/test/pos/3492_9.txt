How did I find out about this movie when I looked at the American pie 2, at first he had Ali G indahouse trailer, looked at the trailer and forced me to buy a DVD, it seemed incredibly funny! so the next day I went to my local store and picked it up for Â£ 3.99 (Discount!). The film is about Ali G, who is from the West "gangster", a massive team who are eastern competitors. Ali has a Cub Scout children's package where he teaches them how to survive in the ghetto by teaching them how to swim and steal cars after Ali finds that the government is stopping money coming to a leisure center where Ali teaches Children, he runs MP for colors and falls to another MP for his attempts to get rid of the leisure center to make room for airport colors. The whole movie is laughing because Ali gets some crazy stuff! Borat will also appear in the movie for a few seconds, it is sure you have to watch the movie for all Sacha Baron Cohen fans there!
