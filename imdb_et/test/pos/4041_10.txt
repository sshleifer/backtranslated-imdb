I know a girl who was skating for a leading girl. He had dated his brother and he was always great! I also live in Cranbrook B.C, about 15 minutes from Steele Castle. Haha, which I used to practice when I was in primary school. It was strange to see it in the movie. I also had the opportunity to film when it was extra, because there was a call to the mall. But I did not feel at that time because I had no interest in acting. Now I want to be completely. It was such a fantastic movie that I bought from eBay. It never came out here (which is kind of weird to see it was partially filmed here) so I was excited. I really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask it off :)
