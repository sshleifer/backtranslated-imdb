All in all, this time and source is a great movie (from Warner Brothers, because it was craftsmanship and style just before World War II), provided you don't take it seriously at all. The film really does not claim to be historically accurate and certainly not more or less accurate or plausible than to say, JFK. (It may, however, be more honest about it, as it admits in principle that it is not taken in fact, but in a style that is semi-heroic.) It is worth noting that time was not na√Øve as it is today; The NY Times report admitted that target audiences "omit factual inaccuracies over the film," described Custer's biographical account of life as "vivid" and noted that presenting Custer's motivations for the final events was at odds with different historical accounts. They could have really gone overboard in building Custer, but they can perfectly portray him as not necessarily the sharpest or most caring man but appropriately defined, principled and inspiring. <br /> <br /> Flynn and DeHavilland, making their eighth movie in seven years (and their last), are so comfortable together and play each other so easily at the moment that it's not too hard to forget how thin their treatment is here . For the first time, it would be hard to imagine what Elizabeth could really do to Custer, but these two make it work. The film also has a board of its previous seven films (largely underrated by Michael Curtiz), but given that he had worked with them on the Santa Fe track last year, it is understandable if he decided to give up one. (They all started with a captain and a light brigade charge - so terrible - so we can't really blame them when they started to keep it fresh.) which are outstanding - and everything else outdoors. Interior scenes are a bit more uneven, but studio artisans can compensate for it well, such as the outstanding casting of Warner Bros' conventional suspects and new faces (Greenstreet, Gene Lockhart, Anthony Quinn, Arthur Kennedy, etc.). I would have liked it better if Kennedy's character had been a bit less standard (I generally like her work), but here she seems to be hitting about the same comments in every scene; some could have been better written - and I think they could have been sure what he could do because he had been in only one year's films (Walsh could have done it with a great Sierra). <br /> <br /> Various highlights include "apparently imaginative" "Garryney" generation of a cavalry toll. Particularly prominent is the last half hour, especially when the division of drivers repeats the end of their screen partnership, followed by the last battle scene. A thoroughly rushing adventure. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
