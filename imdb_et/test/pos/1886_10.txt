It's funny funny (well, unless Bruce is in a hospital that is a little sad). <br /> <br /> Ted Raimi and Stacy Keach are both great and worth a look. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not a big budget-fit controlled blocker, but that's all that promises to be and more, and BTW women are wonderful in their parts, even though I don't know them from other movies, I would welcome them again. <br /> <br /> The two brain walking scene is inspired and certainly the church for Bruce's outstanding physical comedy is one of the pretty guys! <br /> <br /> Thanks to Bruce for your brain, it's your child!
