The New York lights were the first talking film. Of course, The Jazz Singer appeared in October 1927 as the first feature film with a synchronized dialogue. However, this film, which appeared in July 1928, has virtually ceased its place in film. It had started in a short time, but gradually it began to drift up to 58 minutes - it was accidentally the first talking film. He opened a $ 1 million floor house and a surprise for Warner Brose. It was a good money back in 1928. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple. Two hairdressers in the country are buying naively at a hair salon in Broadway, which tells the gangster "The Hawk" easily. If they learn the truth they can't afford, because the younger hairdresser, Eddie, is all-mother-related. Kitty is a younger hairdresser girlfriend and a gangster Hawk (Wheeler Oakman) is on the lookout for her older girlfriend (Gladys Brockwell) for a newer model - Kitty Girl (Helene Costello). The police are killed when attempts are made to stop Hawk's men from unloading the unloading solution, and Hawk sees this as an option for framing Eddie, thus getting Kitty for himself. <br /> <br /> This early chat room is a load of fun for their pioneering enthusiast. Of course, the plot is elementary, and the dialogue is clever, but there is something you don't see early on - evaluating background music. Originally, Vitaphone was used for this purpose, and here they use musical accompaniment with dialogue. And there are song and dance numbers! Hawk's nightclub scenes are used as an opportunity to show you which movies you can never do before - musical numbers. There is also a wild-eyed emcee from a quiet era with some heavy makeup that needs to be looked at. <br /> <br /> Vitaphone couldn't go out at this moment because of a static camera cab, so the two lovers in the park between Eddie and Kitty are simulated - and cheaply. Greed looks like something outside of Ed Wood's film production, or the production of "Our City" high school. <br /> <br /> Gladys Brockwell, like Hawk's girlfriend, punches her lines. He is a real soldier, bearing in mind the features he has to give. Gold - "So you think you can have a chicken you want and throw me back on the deck!" Ah? anyone of metaphors? And then his last lines are "I have lived and I have loved, and I have lost!" Did anyone get a reward for writing this dialogue? Brockwell successfully achieved his speaker's career after evaluating some triumphs in silent films (the evil sister "Seventh Heaven"), when a fatal accident created his career in a short time. <br /> <br /> Then Eugene Palett - the older two hairdressers of our story. Her frog voice, natural line delivery and cuddly appearance gave her a long career character as an actor who usually appeared as a family member / business man of the generation who was golden and heart. In fact, Mr Palette is the only member who is still a significant career in films only three years after the release of this film. <br /> <br /> Finally, the question is "where is this microphone hidden?" Microphones were still stationary and it is fun to find out where they are hidden. However, there is one famous scene where everyone can understand a lot. Hawk is in her office where she talks about her two henchmen - who seems to be as slow as they talk - to "Eddie's Ride". If you look at this scene, you swear this movie on the table. It is front and center during the whole conversation. The microphone is probably installed in the phone. <br /> <br /> For those pioneers who are blind to the new sound technology, there is something heroic. You have quiet actors who are accustomed to using pantomime to express, vaudevillians who know how to live for the audience, but don't know how to make the same impression on the Vitaphone camera box, and you have dialogue writers trying to write the conversation as compactly as they did headlines or created movies with endless stories. <br /> <br /> Check it out. It's not boring, moving fast and having fun when you know what to look for. And no, I don't expect it to ever be on Blu-Ray, but I hope that the Warner Brothers people will soon add to Warner's archive so everyone can see it.
