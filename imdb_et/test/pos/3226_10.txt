This show is my absolute favorite. This show is intelligent, fun and always full of surprises. Lauren Graham is perfect as Lorelai Gilmore, a single mother who is Rory's best friend. Alexis Bledel looks like a beautiful and intelligent Rory Gilmore and Keiko Agena is kind of like Rory's best friend Lane Kim. I love spiritual dialogue, it makes this exhibition unique. Kelly Bishop is great when Emily Gilmore and Edward Herrman are terrible when Richard Gilmore. Scott Patterson is delighted because Luke Danes and the band members are any view. The community, Miss Patty, Babette, Mrs Kim, Taylor Doose, Kirk and others are always laughing funny, peculiar and interesting, which always forces one lining to stand out. This exhibition has changed so much over the years that it is never old. Gilmore Girls is an original and smart show that keeps you looking. It's so good. I'll give it a rating of 10/10.
