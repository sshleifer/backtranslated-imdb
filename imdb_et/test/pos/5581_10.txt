Somehow, I missed many of the early episodes of Farscape, so I see them in any order because they are repeated on different channels. First, I caught it - completely random - while in the hotel room. The first 10 seconds were completely hooked to me - that's what SF is all about. <br /> <br /> Characters are strong; and Moya / Pilot's living ship is what Lexx should have been. The quality of the plots is different, but none of them is, in my opinion, lower. And I have to mention Rygel - what a very careless nature! None of your smarmy sugar-covered Star Trek aliens here, this is the real thing - cynical, self-serving and disgusting with personal habits, Rygel is a genius. <br /> <br /> Last week, the SciFi channel showed "Out of Mind" (body-shift episode). True classic, I couldn't laugh from start to finish ... <br /> <br /> Farscape's grace can long be on our screens!
