Venice, 1596. Jews are separated from good Christians.Bassanio, young, but poor Venice loves fair Portia, who is a rich heir. So he approaches his friend, a trader named Antonio, that a thousand thousand ducks travel to Belmont and offer Portia. Antonio's ships and goods are busy at sea, so he turns to the Jewish faith, who is Shylock, who does not like Antonio because he has created his face. I don't care, but if he doesn't pay any money at that time, he owns one pound of his meat. Shylock's daughter Jessica also lives with Christian Lorenzo. The Venetian merchant is based on William Shakespeare's game, which is believed to have been written between 1596 and 1598. I read the game played last summer and now I have seen a film made by Michael Radford in 2004. I liked this game, and I don't completely agree with the accusations that it is anti-Semitic. The Jewish character is not evident as an inhuman monster, even as a thousand Ough he is ready to cut a piece of Antonio's flesh. There's a lot of depth in his character that all comes out of his speech, where he asks, "If you hit us, do we bleed?" There are many more people in Shylock's character than one in Antonio who spits on a good Jew. Al Pacino is surprising for Shylock. He gives such strong performance.Jeremy Irons is also terrible because Antonio.Lynn Collins is the most beautiful and brilliant in Portia's role.Zuleikha Robinson is doing a good job like Jessica and also Charlie Cox when Lorenzo is also very good. work.We can see Heather Goldenhersh in her role. Mackenzie Crook plays Launcelot Gobbot. When Shakespeare usually plays it, it contains the most brilliant dialogue. The film's colors are a fantastic image of the era. It addresses some of the major issues in Shakespeare's way.
