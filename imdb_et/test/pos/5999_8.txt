Swift's socialism and pacifism come through all its coefficients in this well-made re-evaluation. (Did you know that "well" does not have a hyphen? Fact.) He meets with military miniatures, socialist giants, clouds (literally) with philosophers and pacifist horses dominating Yahoos - almost neanderthal humanoids. (Is that where it comes from?) We also meet with dr. Bates, a dedicated Mary Gulliver, a sweet and dedicated son of Thomas, and a truly dreadful 19th century redemptive shelter. Suspending belief is easy, and our 7- and 12-year-old girls enjoyed it as much as my husband and I did. (Sorry for the length, IMDb requires 10 lines.)
