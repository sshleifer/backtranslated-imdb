The girl starts to notice that the people in her small town are fascinated by everything that is designed as a spiral. Soon, fascination will turn into obsession and things will die. Although I'm not saying "Uzumaki" was a great movie, I say it was different from what I've seen before. Throughout my viewing, I felt like I was watching a comic. There are funny blends between scenes and characters with digitally enhanced eyes. Later I learned that the movie is a customization of manga comics, so it makes sense. But just when you think you look at something that could be a child's film, you will be bombarded with nasty and gory visuals! The story is often lagging behind, and the end is somewhat steep and it seemed anti-climatic at that time, but I appreciate it retroactively for its originality. My Rating: 7/10.
