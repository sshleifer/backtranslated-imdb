I listen to Istanbul, intentions, eyes closed: At first, the gentle breeze and the leaves are soft from the trees; There, far, water-carrying watches endlessly ring; I listen to Istanbul, my intention, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I listen to Istanbul, my intention, my eyes closed; Then suddenly the birds fly, the flocks of the birds, the high, the colors and the crying. When nets are pulled in the area And the feet of the woman start to rub in the water. I am attracted to Ishim, intention, eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I listen to Istanbul, my intention, my eyes closed. The Great Bazaar is calm and cool, the hills of the hill markets are full of doves. While hammers are hanging and hanging in docks, spring winds carry the smell of sweat; I listen to Istanbul, my intention, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I listen to Istanbul, my intention, my eyes closed; Still dirty from the past, a seaside mansion with hardened houseboats. Listening to the southern winds between the doon and the drone, I listen to Istanbul, the intention, the eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I listen to Istanbul, my intention, my eyes closed. Pretty girl walks on sidewalk: four-digit words, whistles and songs, rude remarks; Something falls from his hand This is a rose, I think. I listen to Istanbul, my intention, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> I listen to Istanbul, my intention, my eyes closed. Your skirt surrounds the bird; Is Your Eyebrow Sweat? Or not? I know. Are your lips wet? Or not? I know. The silver moon rises above the pine trees: I know it all in my heart. I listen to Istanbul, my intention, my eyes closed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You, your companions, are all for you. you; Daylight is for you, moonlight is for you; Leaves in moonlight; Miracles and wisdom on the leaves, Myriad greens in daylight, Yellow is for you and pink. Skin sensation in the palm of the hand, its warmth, softness, sleeping comfort; Because you are all greetings and masts in the harbor; Names of Days, Names of the Months, Fresh Colors on Boats are for you Mailman's feet, Potter's hands Jumping on the foreheads, Bullets for battle; Graves are for you and for tombstones, Jails and handcuffs and death concepts for you are all. <br /> <br /> SEA NOSTALGIA <br /> <br /> The ships will sail through my dreams, over the roofs, the feast of the ships, and the poor, learning the sea all year round, watching and crying. I remember the world's first glance with the Mussella shell I opened: the greenest water and the blue sky And the elbow most ... My blood is still salty When the oysters break the skin. What crazy speed suddenly was our offshore foam! Foam is not malignant, like lips With adultery with men Not shameful. <br /> <br /> Orhan Veli <br /> <br /> I couldn't say anything better than what Orhal Veli Kanik said about Istanbul. I have only praise for this movie. A very nice and balanced introduction to the city and its music that united Asia, Europe and Africa at one point.
