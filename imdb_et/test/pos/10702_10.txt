The Canadian filmmaker Ron Switzer offers tireless horror with a vigorous and endless excitement with the superb 1991 science fiction film "Science Crazed". The terrible monster takes revenge on his mother, police officer and tenants of the apartment building. Brilliant practical make-up and special effects designs create a truly frightening monster, especially when lurking through the gloomy apartment settings in the atmosphere of shadows and smoke. The characters are developed beautifully with the band's amazing and surprisingly touching performances. Ron Switzer, a newcomer to Donna Switzer, also wore a film-to-pace script, knitting a gripping roller track with twists, turns and terror that keeps you up to the last frame. The science of Crazed will undoubtedly leave a haunt after a shocking conclusion. Highly recommended!
