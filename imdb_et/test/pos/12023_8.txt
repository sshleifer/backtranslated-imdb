Note: I've tried not to give away any significant twist (or end) of the plot, but if you are concerned about it, think about watching a movie before reading a movie - Thanks! <br /> <br /> was clearly a relatively large budget released by Paramount. The story follows the (allegedly true) use of the mouse-man Jack Shepard in London in 1700. He was a locksmith who sent the notorious criminals to evil "Thief-Taker" to save his brother's life. After Thief-Taker has crossed twice, we become a kind of Robin Hood and gain the support of the common people. He continues to escape from several prisons (including the notorious Newgate), but also the time to "entertain" numerous noble women. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the movie, although the plot was a little predictable. The film was filmed in Glencree and Wicklow in Ireland, and they were well done and seemed realistic. I think Clavell struck the amazing atmosphere of London in the 1700s and enjoyed his creative use in the corners of the camera. And unlike many of the films depicting this period, Clavell does not draw any shots to show us the regrettable conditions in which the poor lived (in one scene, many people are fighting meat pies that have climbed through the street slag). In general, I really enjoyed this movie. I admit that it lacks the wonderful landscapes and political comments that Clavell's next film, "The Last Valley," (the parable of the Vietnam War), but it deserves to be viewed or two. It is unfortunate that it is never published on my (known) video or DVD.
