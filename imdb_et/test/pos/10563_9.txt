The story was well drawn and interesting. However, I find it difficult to write a review of this movie without breaking it. To avoid this, I'm not talking about the story here. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is a good adaptation of Sarah Water's book compared to the previous "Tambi Velvet". I first read the book and later looked at the DVD. The film retained most of the books of the main characters' spirits. Of course, due to time constraints, the last 30 minutes of film seemed to hurry to cover part III of the film. That's why it couldn't show the scene well when they all met Mr. Ibbs in the kitchen and after that (even this book seemed to me that it was a quick scene for this kitchen). Nevertheless, the film did a good job of representing the story. It's really worth it. It is still unclear if BBC-America can broadcast this film. It's a pity. <br /> <br /> PS: I noticed that Maudi and Sue were 20-21 instead of 17-18; the latter is more reasonable, while the former is closer to the age of the actors.
