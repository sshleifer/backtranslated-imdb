This is undoubtedly one of the most successful debut films for each director. The film is only 90 minutes long, but you can say everything about life and death. Not much activity and dialogue is minimal, but the film flows perfectly and requires your attention, because everything happens wonderfully naturally. Drivers' performances are perfect, and even some supportive characters get strong emotional scenes. The film is somewhat lost to today's modern audiences, but it is all that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> Scratch my title, it's perfect!
