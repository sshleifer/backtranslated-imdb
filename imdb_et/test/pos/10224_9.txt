I wish there would be a category that would put horror on it. It's just not. This horrible moments are allowed, but I don't feel like this is a horror movie. I'll give this movie a better one. One million small things could have been changed to make it better. <br /> <br /> That I said I love this movie. I am often sad that people understand this whole point wrong. It has always been clear to me that the idea of ​​this film was to say ... things are not always what they seem to be. Sometimes there is no "evil". <br /> <br /> Barker was in Con where I went and then he spoke a little film. It was very interesting. Many of the things he wanted to put into the movie could not be, and the movie he thought was long gone was cut out. It was a piece that helped light to Boone and her girlfriend, as well as some other details. <br /> <br /> I know some people are upset because they don't have more information about the whole "breed" in the background, but I always felt like giving the movie "more real" more accurate. I've read a short story based on so many comics and many. That's why the movie always looked like a director of the whole story. Much more involved in the story, which unfortunately never lived. <br /> <br /> Despite all the errors, this movie may have thought it has a lot to offer. "Monsters" are wonderful, very imaginative. While acting is sometimes a bit rigid, there are some very quoted lines. When I look at it, I find something new. Keep and look at the Boones chest until the end. At one point, Decker pushes him and soon after Boone falls on the cardboard. He comes with a card attached to his chest. This card will remain for a while even when Lori pulls the knife out. It will stay there until Boone accidentally removes it. I love it. It was a lovely little detail I was thinking. <br /> <br /> Basically I want to say ... if you are looking for a horror movie, don't look at it. If you think that sometimes men can be more evil than anything we've ever dreamed of. This is your movie. This is a film about how people destroy what they don't understand or fear.
