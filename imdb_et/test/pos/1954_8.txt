I'm not sure if I like this movie or not. I think it is horrible and completely weird. Crispin Glover as always gave high performance than Layne. I think his performance was really good and one of his best, but I don't like that character. The performance of Keanu Reeves was really good and I really felt my character. Above all I think the whole cast gave great performances, just like the characters. I didn't like some, but I really felt sorry for others (Keanu Reeves). I would like to know if it was the original end that the film was supposed to have since it didn't stop the way I waited. I was disappointed and I do not feel that it did the rest of the film. If you're a horrible, weird and very different movie, go to it. If you like things that are common, please stay away.
