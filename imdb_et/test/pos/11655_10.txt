Susan Sarandon is unbelievable due to the lack of a better word. In my opinion (and yes, I understand that not everyone agrees with me here), he is one of the biggest actors in EVER and he should have at least 2 oscars on his credit. I thought it was an amazing performance at Lorenzo's Oil (but I think every one of his performances is amazing) and they gave it to Emma Thompson ... what was that? And by the time he got an Oscar, he was in the industry for about 25 years. I couldn't think of anyone who deserved more, especially that it would be great, like his sister Helen Prejean's portrayal. But then again he is Hollywood's artistry and does not need oscars - people know he's anyway good. <br /> <br /> This movie carries very deep, thought-provoking messages that are so unnecessary to say that it is not taken lightly. Of course, Tim Robbins doesn't get credit here. You think that the images made in this film would not be accurate because of the punishment of his personal death. However, both sides of the death penalty debate will be given weight. On the one hand, you see the interesting side of Matthew, the human side, which makes death more heart-like. At the same time, you will see how he saved his victims and understandably exhausted the constant torture of the elders. One word for Tim-BRAVO. <br /> <br /> Stylish film, and as I said, is a well-earned and long-awaited oscar for Susan.
