First of all: If you like watching movies, I suggest you don't look at it. Why? Later you no longer know any other movie so easily ... <br /> <br /> In fact, I don't want to create excessive expectations, but it's almost scary when the perfect, intense and beautiful Einari job is Gudmundsson. If in most films there is at least one aspect that violates the whole thing, like good actors, but terrible dialogues or a nice landscape, but low-cost cinematography? The "angels of the universe" are not something of such ambivalence. Really everything is just great, even (and not less) amazing with Sigur Rosso. <br /> <br /> In this story Pallet student who goes to schizophrenic after his girlfriend is pouring, especially dialogues (and monologues) deserve some attention: together (and sometimes with sharp contrast), the plots range from depressing and fatalistic to comic and completely absurd. What's more, they are often (with Hegel and Shakespeare quotations) so poetic in beauty that the film goes into a virtually surreal sphere and its incredibly authentic actors record them in the real world. <br /> <br /> One of the other remarks already referred to another point: this film is not a trivial entertainment for relaxation in the evening, despite the fact that there are several comic reliefs, it is very disturbing, partly cynical and bitter and most sad. . modern poetry about the life of madness for all the nonsense, rage and loneliness. <br /> <br /> Finally: when you see the movie? check it again. There are some great visual metaphors and hints that you only understand when you look twice and connect them to the story of morality. And of course: read the book, it contains a lot of smaller funny stories and also makes some things in the film a little better.
