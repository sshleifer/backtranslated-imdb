Not many TV shows like many fans like Farscape ... I know young and 30/40+ years old, fans of both men and women in so many different countries, if you think I just love this TV miniseries. It has elements that can be found in almost all other T.V exhibitions that are characteristic of a drama that could be the Australian soap opera; in the same episode, it has a scientific fact and fiction that would give even the toughest "Trekkie" for your money in brainstorming! Wormhole Theory, Time Travel in Real Equal Form ... Great. It includes cultures across the map, because the possibilities are endless, with multiple stars and thus thousands of planets to choose from. <br /> <br /> With such a wide scope; it would be expected that nothing can keep the illusion for a long time, but here is where Farscape really gets into its element ... It succeeds when all others have failed, especially Star Trek (universe) practically zero Chaos!) They went out of ideas quite quickly and kept them! In 4 seasons, they can keep the audience's attention using continuous consistency and constant character evolution with multiple threads for each episode that has unique personal touches on the camera that are specific to specific groups. This structure allows for a very large area, as loyalty is counterfeit and broken in many ways on many issues. I happened to see that the pilot (Premiere) was gone and just had to stick to it afterwards to see if Crichton would ever be "Get the girl" after seeing them all on television. admit that this was the only thing that keeps me quiet, but I had to do a 12-hour night shift and advanced chronic insomnia ... Farscape was the only thing that went through those extremely long nights ... <br /> > Do yourself a favor; Look at the pilot and see what I mean ... <br /> <br /> Farscape Comet
