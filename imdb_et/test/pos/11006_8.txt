The documentary on the nomadic tribe in Tibet, who goes to the dry lake to get salt, doesn't sound very appealing. However, this is not a popcorn movie, but a visual cultural party where you quickly participate in the disappearance of humanity. Superstitions, epic songs and poems, people of faith who truly believe in following their unique lifestyles, is something that was in the West during Homer, but unfortunately most of us are completely alien. "advanced" world. We have lost the spiritual peace that comes from well-established lifestyles, which often suffer in our ever more breathless society. Filmmakers are tightly woven from fabric of materially poor, but mentally rich and comforting sailors. And we saw that there was more to life than a shopping center and pop culture. So unplug your ground lines, turn off your cells, turn off the lights on the driveway and sit back and relax for a timeless adventure.
