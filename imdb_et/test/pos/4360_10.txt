Wow.this is about the story! First of all, I saw the 'Rescue Field. I didn't "like". And now I've seen a person, Dieter Dengler, about whom this story tells Herzog. Very enthusiastic.Dieter is a motivated person who met the most controversial emotions in his life. What an extraordinary life this person has led. His story of catching Patet Lao / Vietcong, and hence his suffering, is terrible, but the most impressive is his incredible will to survive. He impatiently talks to us about a full-fledged punishment for his terrible challenge during his imprisonment ... he is a great storyteller and Herzog does justice to what this brave man deserves. <br /> <br /> In my opinion. "The little dieter must fly" says it all! leaving something to the imagination, thus making the "Color of Rescue" a superfluous film. The fear does not become more real than the words of Dieter Dengler himself. He manages to take a full picture.
