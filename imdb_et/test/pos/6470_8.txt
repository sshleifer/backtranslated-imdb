Martin Ritti's first film offers an exceptional existentialist response (three years later) to Elia Kazan's more conservative "On the Waterfront". Although "Waterfront" has benefited tremendously from electrifying Marlon Brando, who inadvertently hides the offensive subject to Casanan in an attempt to justify the names (because Kazan was keen to house the Un-American Action Committee), "Edge of the City" is a proud young John Cassavetes and Sidney The structure of Poitier, who dares to confront the problems that the Waterfront did not recognize, namely the rights of workers and the racial relationship. <br /> <br /> The "urban area" dives into this (then) unknown area, and while the rather attractive black main character (Poitier) may seem a bit of a Hollywood simplicity, a bold fight with a thin reflection of hope and violence is hardly obsolete. One wonders when the original 1957 members were shocked by the explicit presentation of white-black relations (if some big disciples did not leave the theater early, they would have to beat from the left if not offended). <br /> <br /> The last roll of the film still surprises the viewers because it refuses to sink into the expected clich√©s, including those that "Waterron" broke. Only the most confused viewers do not understand the radical and entertaining movie "City of the City". <br /> <br /> What is the most annoying of this lost classics: how unfortunately it is not available in any way, for reasons that remain quite blurry. This movie should be seen in high school or college history classes across the country, but can only be found on low-light late night television, if any.
