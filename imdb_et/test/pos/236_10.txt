It was the breakthrough of Gene Kelly and it alone makes it memorable. Throw Rita Hayworth for the sake of your love and comedian Phil Silvers from all people as her sidekick and you have the ingredients for a true crowd entertainment that is just like it came out. <br /> <br /> Kelly plays with Danny McGuire, the owner of the nightclub in Brooklyn (Brooklyn is always on the wrong side of the 40s), with Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) interested in stars and love. Rita is cute and even has a double role like Rusty and Rusty's grandmother. Rusty has the opportunity at a great time through the mechanisms of John Coudair (Otto Kruger) who romanticized and lost Rusty's grandmother. <br /> <br /> The piece turns to Rusty at Danny's cutting, to the detriment of his club, because he has a chance he can't give him. But of course, this is not the way Rusty finally wants it, because, as usual in movies of this time, the right man is the only thing a girl has kept in mind. There are no surprises, but everyone is doing well. <br /> <br /> Kelly is the first to make her amazing trick-dance, this time reflecting on a glass window. He was a champion of such dancing, and one has to think about how they timed everything so accurately that he seemed to be in two places at once. Melodrama gets a little thick and there are some free warfare tips that are little but give the chance to sing or two, but Kelly will take this movie to the next level. It was before he became a mega-star and too smooth or his own. The raw strip of his character gives him incredible and almost poor air. <br /> <br /> Kelly's character in 1980 "Xanadu" was also named Danny McGuire. This film was the beginning of the dance genius at the end of the film. It is clear that this film meant a lot to him. Highly recommended.
