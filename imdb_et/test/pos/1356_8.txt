This film was a wonderful romp, intelligent, playful, mysterious, full of surprises, strange places with humor, and enormous energy. The famous film director (the main character) and the events he is trying to manipulate with the film come into exciting ways as he is an almost impossible prince who never heard him. Everywhere there are wonderfully rich pictures and paths offered, but they are not followed (exactly what happens to the harsh spouse of the pedestrian tourist guide). The end is so much better than it is unpleasant. Realism and logic are not what you should look for here. If we are going to move our weddings and imaginative lives to film directors, then we should be ready for a wild ride, this film seems desirable.
