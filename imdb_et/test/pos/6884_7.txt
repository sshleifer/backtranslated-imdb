Yong-ki Jeong's "Puppet Master with Frightening Parts" was the last Korean horror flick that I had the pleasure of watching. In the "Inhyeongsa" title in Asia, this film hit the scene as soon as I saw it online, with pictures that made me think of Puppet Master, Childs Play and other toys / doll-related horror in the past. But for some reason I didn't think .. "Boy, it's sticky," I thought it would be horrible and fun. Toysome's horror went well. <br /> <br /> The film starts slowly but I like it so it was good. The result, which is almost the same as I found with Acacia, was beautiful and reminded me a lot of the classic horrors of the past. I won't give away much, but this story was strong and I would recommend it to all Asian HORROR fans. It is not extreme, it should not be taken very seriously, but it is really good.
