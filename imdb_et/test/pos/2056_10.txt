I've seen this movie probably a dozen times because it was originally released by the theater. Anyone who calls this movie trash or terrible does not just understand the action films and does not recognize the good. Perhaps some cases and outcomes may seem far-fetched, but in my opinion, the scriptwriter Shane Black (Lethal Weapon / Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) has shaped one of the best-thought-out activities you will ever encounter. Above or not, this film flows like a watch mechanism and action continues. The final sequence is one of the best I've seen in every movie. The cast of this film is cracked. Genna Davis gave a tremendous result and the shame of this devil was never "LKG". Samuel L. Jackson is fun when his mickey mitch has tried his luck in the private eye to help him discover his lost past and make a few bucks. When you hit me, no one liked this movie. It packs so much excitement and so funny. The wisecracks of this movie still make me laugh as hard as 10 years later. In my opinion, the first Matrix films and Long Kiss Goodnight were easily the 2 best and most original clips of the 90's. By the way, Shane Black made a fortune when selling this script. At that time it was the highest sales scenario and worth every penny. It's so sad that the audience has never given this movie because they would have seen Renny Harlins being the best film and Genna Davis as you have never seen him. Long Live The Long Kiss Goodnight!
