This is a fabulous film. <br /> <br /> The plot is a good yarn and has been imagined from a number of setbacks and alternative perspectives. What was deliberate and what was coincidence? Who is in love, who? <br /> <br /> You have the ability to put yourself in the shoes of every character (sometimes literally), and it helps to define each character to a satisfactory depth. /> <br /> You can understand all the characters by following turns and twists; The main events of the film are from the point of view of different people. <br /> <br /> Take the opportunity to come to your arthouse cinema again; it looks great on the big screen. <br /> <br /> More than keeping you away, the plot pulls to such an extent that you just sit and watch what is developing - I don't want to predict! <br /> <br /> Aga> more likely you need more than one view - I saw it on three times in my original edition and it improved every time. <br /> <br /> The actor was a very good, special performance by Roman Bohringer by Alice, which is three characters in three other ways. <br /> <br /> Classic. The second best film of the 1990s.
