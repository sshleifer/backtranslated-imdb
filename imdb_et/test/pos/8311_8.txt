His John Dark-Kevin Connor fantasy adventures were the main days of summer holidays in the days before Star Wars: they weren't masterpieces, they had no top-notch effects, but they were just what the kids came back from the movie in the mid-1970s. <br /> <br /> In the main part of the earth, just the right name for the Burroughs pulp adventure, Victorian inventor Peter Cushing, and the inevitable Doug McClure underground world of Pelucidar, will fight for this evil telepathic struggle against dinosaurs. This time the dolls have gone against the men in monster suits, which is much more fun when you are ready to stop your belief and if you are not always Caroline Munro cracking. In addition to what may be the worst power of Peter Cushing, irritating, but his own movie Dr Who ("You can't remember me, I'm British!"), It's just John Dark-Kevin Connor's best. Doug McClure's fantasy adventures that are surprisingly well targeted and have the use of a color atmosphere. Alan Hume's photography is not particularly good at exterior images, because the studio kit gives it (the film is completely captured by sound recording) to paint a fertile living world that deserves a novel coating of cellulose. Not a high art, but definitely a great Saturday matin√©e fun.
