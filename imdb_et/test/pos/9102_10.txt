I loved this movie every minute. Jack Black and Kyle Gass surely certainly brought misfortune in this epic that tells about friendship, hard riding and fate. <br /> <br /> Filling to the brim with no sentence, no toilet, no humor, no general rule, this film must be important for the world's big D fans. <br /> <br /> We follow the journey of young Jables (Jack black) and Kage (Kyle Gass) as they try to get back to fate, win an open Mic night and become the planet's biggest band. Duo must overcome obstacles such as a room full of lasers, one leg and a man who performs his task. I'll let you see if they do it or not. <br /> <br /> The music itself is big enough and now we see D personally, making the experience even more magical. Must see anyone who calls himself a tough D fan. Watch out for the first album jokes!
