"Nemesis" was the last book written by Miss Marple written by Agatha Christie (the official last case "Sleeping Murder" was written in the forties) and I have always had a very soft place for it. I loved these characters and they have lovingly revived this great BBC customization with Joan Hickson, as terrible as ever, like Miss Marple. <br /> <br /> All in all, this book is very loyal. Some characters fall, the first (new) murder is slightly different and a few new characters. Personally, I felt that Lionel Peel's extra sign was unnecessary and quite irritating. The travel guide Madge was irritating differently, but often quite amusing. This is largely due to Lionel's failure to give 10 out of 10! Other characters are beautifully made, especially Helen Cherry's dignified Miss Temple and all three strange sisters, but especially Margaret Tyzack, who gives a cheerful result as Clothilde. He threatens to go over the top, but just avoids it. Women's bodyguards are also of good value and the episode includes one of my favorite Hickson lines ... 'Architecture?' <br /> <br /> This is another relatively early BBC Marple who looks wonderful and has a revered nostalgic feeling. Highly recommended.
