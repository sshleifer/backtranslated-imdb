The primary plus of this movie is the combination of Chris Farley and David Spade. It was the first film where this comedy duo showed his Laurel-and-Hardy-esque sense of humor. Farley's obvious physical comedy skill is complemented by Spade's sarcastic engagement in any situation where they find themselves. <br /> <br /> This movie is next to other comedy films. Tommy Boy joins Blues Brothers as a comedian whose individual scenes and bits come from the plot, instead of breaking the story and giving the film a distinct feel, like many other comedy films. Thanks to the excellent direction of Sagal, each scene is dense and immediately predicts or works out the story that is being spoken. He has the same amount of fun as Farley and Spade. Dennehy, Lowe, Ackroyd and many others (see Davenport's 22-mile petrol station transmitter) strengthen the film. may overshadow Farley / Spade. <br /> <br /> I believe this movie is very well done and it's a more fun movie I've ever seen.
