This film is a good example of why Shaw Brothers is one of the best directors (probably the best in the Kung Fu category). The film is well paced, the story is great and intriguing, and although humor may not be your face, it is inserted into character interactions. Once the story is built and the characters start to assess the situation, the whole tower collapses in one of the best fighting scenes (tiger, crane and crab Hung Gar is very present). There is even a scene that captures western social events of the 18th century and ends with clever and fun struggles. The movie ends with a sudden, cheesy moment, but if you are a Shaw Brothers fan, you realize that cheese is just a blank, not a movie main dish.
