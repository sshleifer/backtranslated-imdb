It's the best version of William Faulkner's fiction that I've ever seen, and I've seen many of the most outstanding. Filmed in Faulkner's hometown of Oxford, Mississippi, really captures the lessons of Jefferson and Yoknapatawpha counties. A dusty intruder is not one of Faulkner's best novels, but even if it is a clich√©, it would be the crown of any other career. He wins Harper Lee good but easier to kill Mockingbird fifty feet (I read it in ninth grade and that's exactly where it belongs). Two of Faulkner's most outstanding characters play a big part in the film, Gavin Stevens and Lucas Beauchamp. Stevens is probably one of the most common signs in all of Faulkner's fiction. She is a lawyer and she works just as a narrator because, unlike many other characters, Stevens is logical, not emotional (at least when she is older). Lucas Beauchamp can be the most important of all Faulkner's black characters (he plays an important role in one of Faulkner's chosen masterpieces, Go Down, Moses); unlike all other black people in Yoknapatawp, he refuses to be a white man. He is proud and many in the white population find the black man to be disastrous. One day, Lucas is found in front of a dead, dead white man in possession of a recently fired pistol. Most of Jefferson and surrounding areas do not see the need for a trial and everyone is sure that Beauchamp will be over or at least the next day because murder and arrest took place on Sunday. Beauchamp, on the other hand, declares his innocence and tries to help Stevens. Stevens refuses; the case seems open and closed. But his younger brother Chick Mallison, because Lucas had helped him before, is ready to help him now. it. Hollywood movies rarely persecute black people, but prefer to earn them. If you are an African-American actor, you can also give up and accept this role as a mommy, a servant, a servant, or a porter because it is the only way you work. A dusty intruder must find one of the most memorable non-porter roles ever played by a black actor, Lucas Beauchamp. And Beauchamp, as I described above, is not stereotypical, and perhaps it was difficult for the audience to accept it. Even today, black characters are usually simple, magical and kind. The last arthouse hit far from the sky is a good example. Beauchamp is a kind of jerk and he is very stubborn. Although he is perhaps a little less than in this novel, he is not a stereotype. He's a complicated person. Juano Hernandez plays Beauchamp extremely well. I haven't seen the film for a while, but it also appears on the cinematographic adaptation of Robert Aldrich's 1955 "Kiss Me Deadly", as well as the movie "The Final Story of the Faulkner The Reivers". <br /> <br /> All actors are big in the movie. I would also like to congratulate Mr Jarman Jr., who has a big role in Chick Mallis. The novel takes place from his point of view and is a normal hero of the image. Jarman is quite an actor; he captures this character (who also appears elsewhere in Faulkner's fiction, for example, telling about events that took place a decade or more before he was born in the 1957 novel City). The following year, he appeared under another big role in the undervalued John Ford movie at Rio Grande. The only other film I've seen is National Velvet, a pretty different image than Intruder's dust. His work here is exceptional; I really need to credit her to Faulkner for a perfect credit. The other famous Faulkner adjustments are too melodramatic (The Long Hot Summer, filmed in 1958, which I really like nevertheless) or too cold (Tomorrow, filmed in 1972, which I don't like; this frustration is the complete misunderstanding of Faulkner). The only other one who actually bases his own material is Douglas Sirk's great Pylon filmed in 1958 (indeed another Faulkner novel), the hidden angels. 10/10.
