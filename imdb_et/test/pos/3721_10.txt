If you think this movie is full and grabs you from the start, don't look at it. But if you like those meditative films that remain in your mind for a while, until you get the details, you will love it.

In this struggle they lost the ability to talk ... I don't want to write more to not spoil the movie for you, but trust me if you like SF authors like Lem or Capec or even some of the Orson Scott Card love this movie.
