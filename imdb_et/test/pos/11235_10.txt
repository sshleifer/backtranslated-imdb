Don't forget what this dependent person says, this exhibition is fun. This shows how many single men are in the bar atmosphere and also show that women are not as light as men think they are. <br /> <br /> The aspect of the race is how it is really cool and original. This is not an ordinary reality that shows that we are all accustomed to days. <br /> <br /> Give everyone the opportunity, we are just one episode, we finally have Canadian programming that is not an absolute mess. As Canadians we usually get, Bon Cop, Bad Cop or Corner Gas. Come to people to show that we are not all as proud as our previous reviewer. <br /> <br /> How to go to the Comedy Network, giving you a new show. The panel is funny and the competitors are still pretty good.
