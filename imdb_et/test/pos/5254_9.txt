This movie was funny from START to FINISH. All the cinema cinema laughed the whole movie out loud! The best characters were Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing, Will and Grace Girl) and Tanya Manicure (Debi Mazar). They had the best lines, the best attitudes, and so on. Jada Pinkett, who was playing lesbian, was really funny, she played it well and was very convincing. The only bad thing about the movie was that the other two main characters were not so funny, even if the movie focused around them ........ All in all, this is a great movie to see your girls (yes guys, this is a girlie movie and through!). Enjoy !!!
