Cecil B. DeMille led several domestic comedy dramas in later teens and early 20s. He found Gloria Swanson the perfect leading woman for these provocative pieces. In Swinson, changing her husband plays a boring housewife whose wealthy businessman (Elliott Dexter) pays more attention than to work. He is led by a beautiful rue (Lew Cody) until he releases and divides the eternal man for a new lover. <br /> <br /> Things will soon become familiar and Swanson will discover that the new spouse is as careless as the first. Worse still he finds that Cody has a woman on the side (Julia Faye). After a number of confrontations and convenient meetings, things have been resolved. <br /> <br /> It was a broken blow in 1919 and helped Gloria Swanson become a big star. Although she was only 20 years old when she was filming, she is very good, maybe a foolish woman. She looks good and wears a stunning bathrobe. <br /> <br /> There is one memorable scene that is 100% DeMille, where Cody attracts Swanson with promises of wealth, joy and love. As he did, he depicts scenes. Joy is a fantastic Swanson scene in a spidery hammock that moves through the pool while people are dancing. Wealth is a scene where Swanson is dressed like a queen of Babylon, because the servants bring their heroes that throw away. Love is a scene where he is a wooden nymph who loves a forest hill with a Pan-like character (Ted Shawn). Pure hockey, but great fun and Swanson looks good. <br /> <br /> Dexter is very good at being a happy spouse who strikes her mustache and starts working to win her wife back. Cody is also good for a fake player who is a liar and a deceiver. Faye is funny when the second female wife - named Toodes not the least - who gets her. Sylvia Ashton plays Ms. Huckney. Ted Shawn was married to Ruth St. With Denis and together, they were groundbreaking and influential contemporary dancers (at Denishawn School). <br /> <br /> Swanson impressed me every time I see him. He seems to have been such a natural actor and there is still the possibility that the camera will hit his expressive face, which is simply enchanting. He is glad to look. <br /> <br /> A very fun movie with many colorful shades to keep things alive. And many furniture is back in style 86 years later.
