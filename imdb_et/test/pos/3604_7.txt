A nice and pleasant film full of mediterranean landscapes (Cephallonia is a very beautiful Greek island) that retains many of the characteristics of the novel. I think the Greek landscapes add something special and magical to the film. One thing I didn't like at all was that the main characters like "Mandras" and Pelagia's father were not Greek actors, but foreigners. I mean, the actors tried to express the Greek way of life, but they didn't work for me and it was quite clear. Even their pronunciation, when they tried to use Greek words, was terrible and it was bad on the plot. Irene Papas was a very good, typical example of a mother who lived on the island during the 40s, who lost her husband and was trying to live with her child alone. John Hurt, Pelagia's father, also worked great. He reminded me of the Greek in many of his reactions.
