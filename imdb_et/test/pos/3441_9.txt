I finished the movie for the first time in its entirety (although I watched some parts when it was first shown in the UK in the mid-1990s), I believe it is a masterpiece of cinema from the late 20th century. Undoubtedly, this scale film raises many questions, such as why there are narrative differences between the 60's Hermann and Herman in this film? For example, on the first film, Hermann has a relatively significant relationship with his father's father (he finances Hermann's electronic music), while "Die Zweite ..." has little mention of his father until the final episode. Another point I am interested in; Reading Edgar Reitz I have hit the historical similarities between his and Stefan's character (spoiler coming) in the last episode that Stefan has won a prize at the Venice Film Festival (Reitz won his best debut work for his film "Mahlzeiten"); Reitz's film company is called "Edgar Reitz Film Production" and Stefan is also called. I am interested in Stefan's autobiographical character, because he is probably the least friends with Helga. Perhaps Stefan's red herring, I don't know what I know, is that I loved this movie and would like it to do more, except Michael Haneke 'Cache' and Werner Herzog's 'Grizzly Man' are not ambitious enough in today's cinema. audacity and passion. I can't wait to see number 3 now.
