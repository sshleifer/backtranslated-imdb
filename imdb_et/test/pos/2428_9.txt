I would not be so sure that I would agree with the DNA tests, which are indisputable proof against Anna Anderson. First, read Peter Kurth's book on which this film is based. Anna Anderson knew things that could only have been known to the true Grand Duchy of Anastasia (forensic evidence for Anna). Second, compare the pictures of Anastasia and Anna Anderson. Everyone can see that they are the same person. Third, visit the Peter Kurth website (below the URL) where you can read detailed information about DNA tests, as well as why Franziska Schanzkowska and Anna Anderson are not the same (go to the link below, "ANNA-ANASTASIA COMMENTS ON FRANZISKA SCHANZKOWSKA"). Even Schanzkowska's relatives believed that their sister and Anna Anderson were not the same person. <br /> <br /> I believe that HIH Anastasia Nicolevna Romanova and Anna Anderson were the same person; I must never be the opposite. <br /> <br /> www.peterkurth.com
