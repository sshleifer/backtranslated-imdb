I created this movie at the Glenwood Cinemas at the weekend as part of the Kansas International Film Festival, which as usual has given a cinematic and eclectic cinema. <br /> <br /> I've been against the Australian film for years, so I was glad to know that this movie was involved and I wasn't really disappointed. <br /> <br /> Great shooting, firmly targeted, this is a horrible story of one man and his journey into the heart of darkness as it was. It reminded me of Lynch's wild heart, it has strange madness in it, but I was glued to the film for other reasons - that is, it represents a portrait of Australia that is ... well, very plausible. > <br /> I have buried under the Land Down on many occasions, once in the 1980s and again about 7 years ago with my husband. <br /> <br /> I don't want to explain my vacation, but director Frayne seems to have a lot of understanding that I think it is Australia, for a country responsible on the one hand for Nick Cave and on the other hand for Steve Irwin ( Crocodile Hunter). <br /> <br /> One glowing spice - - I would have preferred even more unknown Australia. Much more really. But I also understand that it's only 1 and a half hours to do it ... "Sigh." <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is very, very well achieved.
