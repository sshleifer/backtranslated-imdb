I was very curious to see this Wajda-Depardieu trip and the time is definitely exciting. Being a fan of Wajda, I was disappointed and it could be an understatement. The film never took a cinematic flight - there is no basis for hostility between Danton and Robespierre. <br /> <br /> In principle, the script was weak (customized for "The Danton Affair"). And yet, the direction was masterful ... it's Wajda, later! There were also some amazing actors, but they never heard the audience as they should. Depardieu goes on a quasi-horse, a non-public Danton ... not exactly what we have. Woijech Psoniak is incredible as usual, but again the script raises restrictions, even if the actors of the big talent cannot break. Andrzej Seweryn and Bogoslaw Linda open up ... like Bourdon and Saint-Just ... and if you're familiar with Wajda, you know them. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was disappointed with this much acclaimed movie. Great cast, great director, but not high quality. Bad, dynamic script. We need to reach Danton (Walesa) and Robespierre (General J) thinking ... what are their motivations? Eh ... who knows? Do I like women, other powders themselves? Riiight. Ok, so if you are looking for a great French Revolution movie, I highly recommend "La Revolution Francaise" ... it's in two parts and oh-so-great! Excellent performance, comprehensive script, juicy tid-bitt ... surely a satisfying experience !! Klaus-Maria Brandauer is much better Danton than Depardieu ... wonderful Andrzej Seweryn probably took some remarks from Danton and is BRILLIANT Robespierre. LOOK AT THIS! NOW! As for the Wajda fans, you are better at Iron of Marble, Promised Land, and more. Cheers!
