Even an old cynical DOCTOR WHO fan, like me, can stay in the breath, watching my episode of my favorite exhibition. It happened earlier in the Eccleston finals and it happened in this episode. It does not happen often, but Impossible Planet is both an exhibition and an example of television at its best. It's a stunning television <br /> <br /> The doctor and his companion land in a mysterious place where they see a strange writing on the wall and the audience (many who move behind the couch) is immediately transferred. The door opens and the terrible monsters begin to trace the time. It could initially show the entire 25-minute episode, but it all takes place in its title. You can leave out the form of a longer exposition of the original exhibition, but at least this new series is tightly drawn and if we treat a disappointing story, at least it is usually only one week. <br /> <br /> There is nothing disappointing about the viewer here. This is DOCTOR WHO's most traditional best. Writer Matt Jones and director James Strong have gone out to make a story that will be held in the coming years. They do this by building a doom-laden narrative. Doctor and Rose will lose Tardis and they will be caught in the future with the main runners. It is interesting how many stories do not exist on a plot of the type where the doctor and his associates no longer have access to Tardis, which makes for a more interesting type of story. Undoubtedly, the highlighting is a scene where Scoot is going to look for Toby to find him on the surface of the planet he turns to and invites him outside. Everything that works, and the music of Murray Gold changes this scene that really shocks this audience. <br /> <br /> I can imagine immediately after this episode BBC switchboards received tsunami complaints from unhappy parents who said how their children traumatized were. That they took them for several hours so that they were behind a family sofa and that they would not come to sleep now. To do this, the complainant would have denied DOCTOR WHO magic. Yes, it can frighten and yes such pictures burn themselves into the child's mind, which they never forget even when they live a hundred. But I make my life contribute so that the same "traumatized" children would have spent a week begging to be allowed to watch the next episode
