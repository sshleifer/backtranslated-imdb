Chucky's bride starts late in the night when Officer Bob Bailey (Vince Corazza) jumps into his police station, amongst the horror films and jokes of jokes he steals from the remnants of the Chucky doll, which the serialist Charles Lee Ray returned to the child's original game (1988). He leads the remnants of an isolated area, where Ray's former girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) cuts Bailey's throat and brings the residue back to her trailer. There Tiffany seams & staples Chucky (expressed by Brad Dourif) back together and using the "voodoo for dummies" book brings him back to a murderous life. The thing is not because Tiffany had hoped that Chucky was not a man of his dreams, so he locked his board where Chucky was less fortunate. Although Tiffany takes the bath, Chucky flees, the electric valves use her and this book, she brings her back to life as a female doll dressed as a bride. Do not want to stay in plastic casings and work together to get to the New Jersey cemetery, where Ray's natural body was buried with an amulet, which is necessary to turn these spirits back into human bodies. Tiffany's neighbor Jesse (Nick Stabile) and his girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl), both of whom are led by Jade's corrupt uncle, Warren Kincaid (John Ritter), are doing well ... <br /> Director Ronny Yu I Love Chucky bride. The Don Mancini script is very fun, very fast moving, very entertaining and refers to many other horror films with a great affection. From the opening sequence where we see Jason Voorhees' hockey mask from Friday 13th, Freddy Krueger's razor blade glove in the Am Nightmare Elm Street series and the Michael Myers mask from the Halloween franchise. The Frankenstein bride (1935) used the staples when practically restoring the same scene. The Chucky bride does not take seriously anything that is just as good as there is a lot of one lining, self-referencing gags that Scream (1996) made a few years ago in fashion and it doesn't seem to be afraid to be afraid of herself and the genre of fear in general. I love this scene when Jesse & Jade has a cliched slushy romantic conversation that Chucky hears and makes funny deviations and gestures everywhere. That doesn't mean there's a damn good movie out there, because there is sure to be. Director Yu is able to create a good atmosphere and a real sense of fun, both human and plastic characters are pleasant and bright, because every pair suffers from a set of internal problems that naturally causes the corpse trace. Technically, the Bride of Chucky is a big part and has a large budget of around $ 25,000,000. The only thing I say is that some Kevin Yagher dolls are a bit stiff and convincing, I can't remember any CGI scene in Chucky's bride. Luckily, the film does not leave the blood and gore of the cracked cucumber in disrepair, the nail would probably hit Hellraiser (1987) on the face of someone, people who hit the glass pieces, someone who was destroyed by a huge truck, piercing lips and various carvings and punches. Action is pretty good & Dourif, because Chucky is very funny when he pulls out one of the liners. I also like the scenes that start with Tiffany and find him very sexy when he is wearing this fetish, I can't be the only one sure? Personally, I think Chucky's bride is a fantastic movie, all the entertainment from start to finish, great humor and horror equally, and after only 85 minutes it will never get boring or boring. My personal favorite, check it out as soon as possible!
