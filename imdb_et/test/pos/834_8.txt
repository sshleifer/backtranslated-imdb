Well, that's a good movie. However, you have to admit that Van Dame's films have not been so big lately. On the other hand, if you are a fan of the hardcore van Dame, you should watch it because the fighting scenes have a huge improvement. What I really liked is music's beautiful music. I'm sure it will kill time if you are a fan. As for Isaac Florentine, he doesn't believe he did a good job as he did with Undisputed. I can't wait for one day Van Came movies to hit cinemas before the DVD. Maybe one day :). <br /> <br /> Finally, it is worth watching if you don't have any other movies to watch, it can make your hour and half fun.
