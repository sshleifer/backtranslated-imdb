Hong Kong, 1920s. From the poor start, the young man dreams of being a hero, and spends most of his time learning and learning about kung fu and bodybuilding against his father's will. He helps the servant's girl escape from the merciless businessman whose ghosts come after them and terrorizes the young man's uncle's noodle meal. Uncle turns out to be an old, reformed Triad assassin who now helps the young man's martial arts. It's all-out Karate Kid style "Wash Wok" instead of "Wax, Wax away". Kung fu villain is the son of a merciless businessman who has a cool scorpion style that looks cool, though it is quite silly and certainly completely unreal. <br /> <br /> But the time-evolving story is epic good character, great kung fu and generally very fun. The young hero is very sympathetic and gives a good winner. However, the romance dimension has not developed, which is a bit of a disappointment. Otherwise a great movie. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 8 out of 10.
