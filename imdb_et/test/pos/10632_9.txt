After seeing "La Pianist" several years ago, I told myself that I would never see it as powerful and disturbing. Time went on, but I didn't get the movie and its main character, Erika Kahut. The story of a esteemed piano teacher at the Vienna Conservatory, a cool and gathered surface, an expert in classical music, the inner world is so dark and disturbs demons with fear, self-dignity and self-destruction that are strong enough to require more than one viewing. I read Elfriede Jelinek, the controversial Nobel Prize winner book "Piano Teacher" in the literature that the film is based and then I read the movie again. Another time, all the pieces of the puzzle came in the right place. Not so often, a remarkable harassing book is published with such magnificence as "Le Pianiste". Three actors gave great results. Franz Schubert's piano music, which is a "human race", is another bright star in the film. <br /> <br /> I have only one problem with Haneke's vision. The film has a scene where Haneke made some changes to Erika's character compared to the novel. The book was the furthest that he went to Walter, who had attracted a young student to the conservatory. As soon as he understood what he was doing and showed him how much he rejected, he stopped communicating with him. Erika never missed this book with her. He kept everything inside - he didn't want to act, he wasn't a pursuer - he loved watching. There was no need for a big scene in the hockey game. He tried to make Erika sympathetic (and of course Huppert was heartbreaking), but he took his surrounding secret - Jelinek didn't write this scene, it sounded and looked otherwise great.
