I don't remember exactly where I heard them first, but I listen to a little song and liked it. I went and bought a CD and finally found me a nice music. I heard this video and knew I had to do it. It has many video clips that they play at the concert. Let me tell you that watching this video doesn't even compare them together. I've seen them twice at a concert and never want to miss the chance to see them again. The other two things are some interviews and even one of their biggest songs. a few small lateral remarks ... I saw them in the ozz festival of 2001 and they ruled there, but seeing them in the smaller interior was much better (they had some very cool things that allowed the lights to be cut off) the other, if someone wonders, the voter is committed follower.
