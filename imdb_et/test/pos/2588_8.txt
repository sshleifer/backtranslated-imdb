We just saw this movie before appearing at the Norfolk (VA) Film Forum and a general deal on two issues: two competitions and others on top-notch drama showed great results: and secondly, the marketing film only brings catastrophe. We saw chains and suggested comments that referred to some of Wacko's sexual relationships between Samuel Jackson and Cristina Ricc, while the film has some real depth and some thoughtful ideas. What's sad is that people looking for porn are attracted to watching the movie, and they are frustrated because it is too "hard" for them, while people who would really enjoy staying in the theater. shows it. Damage. Good movie disappears.
