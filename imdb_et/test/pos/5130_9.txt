Hoot is a simple plain movie with a simple message. It seemed that this movie was meant for young children, but I know that adults like this film. The story is quite simple. A child who moved to Florida must help to build a football jockey and a challenging weather pancake. The message of this movie is great, especially for animal activists and lovers. The message is to do everything you can to save endangered animals. Acting in this movie is decent. All three children saw that they had good chemistry. Music isn't too shabby. I liked the songs of Jimmy Buffet in this movie. In general, this is a good family film. I appreciate this movie 9/10.
