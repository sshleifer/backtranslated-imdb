Recently, on the DVD (11.11.2008), Severo Pérez's film ... and the Earth were not swallowed (1994), based on one of the most highly rated and discussed novels in Chicano's literature. Tomás Rivera ... and I didn't spoil her (1972) is widely recognized by many critics and serious readers as a classic Chicano novel. Originally written for the Spanish feature of South Texas and also translated into English, the Rivera novel continues to be indispensable in the Chicano literature landscape. <br /> <br /> The Perez film, originally made for highly-rated American Playhouse PBS, has taken some time to get rid of the DVD. This question can only be admired because its high quality is not a problem. However, the film, and now the DVD, remains my knowledge that any Chicano novel is the only cinematographic adaptation, and it is a clear respect for the incredible permanent power of the Earth. This cinematic version also creates an exceptionally deep-rooted nerve, which I think is both ethnic and universally universal. Doubts about the Earth may have arisen because it is too "ethnic", too alien to the mainstream of America, too much of "foreign" art supplies that are too limited in economic resources. Yet Perez combines his artwork very effectively, artistically, and creates a sharply etched image of the collectivity of Chicano migrants, focusing on everyday family life. As for production with relatively limited economic resources, its cinematic work and haunting music goes beyond its existing funding. Just watching a movie makes the artistic value of this movie (or DVD) visible. <br /> <br /> In short, the Earth did not swallow Him, depicting the situation, suffering, and despair of the migrant workers of Chicano in a neo-naturalistic way when they followed the crops from Minnesota in South Texas in 1952. migrant worker north. This Chicano collective, like the depression period of Joads Steinbeck's grapes, is an epic rise due to economic need, instinct of survival, and irritated despair, and ultimately hardly flashing faith. A tribute to those people in the land, a collective hero, a DVD that focuses on a fellow family, and especially a young family member, a boy, maybe twelve or so. This work also works as a bildungsroman. Ultimately, the viewer will feel the feeling that comes from the protagonist's experiences, subjectivity and struggles. Poverty, alienation, child labor, illness (sunrise and maternal death), discrimination, school dropout (boy's escapism from the harassers of discrimination takes a beautiful and peaceful cemetery) are actually put into fact ?? , also symbolically. Worse, the problem of conflict between the young and his mother goes beyond the socio-economic and political conflict, into deeper areas of psychology and metaphysics. In a desperate but artfully fused struggle, young people fight as their mother, archetypal Mexican-American traditionist, divine will representative, pleased prayer, resignation, comfort and acceptance. Rebellious youth cannot believe in God, which would allow such evil and suffering to visit them. How can God be as cruel as he asks, because his little sister is definitely innocent to come to the field with a serious illness? Here, the boy must overcome the obstacles that are even more frightening than poverty and discrimination. Questions now include death, suspicion, and despair, and lack of meaning. And he has little resources to characterize, his willpower, intelligence, and a powerful survival instinct. In this desperate but artfully thawed struggle, the unnamed child, who is central, the need for his endurance, heightened sense of meaning, and the viewer hopes for renewed and strengthened vitality, which may be inspiration for Chicanos and others. <br /> <br /> This harsh struggle uses the plot device that the work that was originally made concerns to tie the episodic work together: there are no migrant workers in Mexico who leave no traces of their deaths, although this DVD does not deal with Mexico but Mexico migrant workers, there is a very existential work: agony and despair; quest; focus on the project; and redeemed all under the free will of spite of deterministic socio-economic and religious circumstances. <br /> <br /> Perez has a long list of credits that are basically a documentary. His many awards are affirmative. Producer Paul Espinosa is also well-known and respected for his work. The 1994 film won and earned a number of awards: the first in the audience's favorite Santa Barbara Film Festival in 1995; first place at Cairo Film Festival; and many other awards earned. <br /> <br /> I think it's Perez's movie and DVD, Earth, the best Chicano movie that has been made.
