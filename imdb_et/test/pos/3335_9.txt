This tiny little movie shows a certain virtue of time, place, and masculinity that we no longer want or even want. Holy is a paladin that has only the best motifs, nothing about polished vocabulary and dictation. No need to turn on the volume or read the dialog. George Sanders is so charming and yes, with a low key that everything that talent, intelligent, physical presence, and above all masculinity, seems to be almost normal. Some normal! George Clooney cannot start the scene, as Mr Sanders does (and without Mr Clooney's looting). He can play sniveler (witness Ghost and Mrs. Muir and Rebecca), but when he was good he was very, very good. Really, man for all reasons and seasons.
