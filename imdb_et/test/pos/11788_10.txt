Ah, yes, the show was great. Many women did not get shape, but many teenage boys also got excellent training. I am not saying that this exhibition was in no way suitable for viewing family members, but if you look at the works of other exhibitors, you will find more adult themes in your works that are also great. Many spectators waited for the show, both men and women received good information and excellent release from the training. The girls were perfect and beautiful, the show is classic and should work well in the syndicate. The exhibition should still be there because there are never enough choices for health and beauty.
