I saw this film for the first time in IFC. What is a great network for watching underground movies. I watched this movie and thought it was a pure drama and a story that didn't hold water. But it was really worth watching. The protagonist is in such a harsh form and you hate to deny him, but whatever you just can't hate him. His commitment to the Beatles and John Lennon is a great metaphor for his life and helplessness he knows. <br /> <br /> The film's atmosphere is also great. Sometimes you feel like you see what it sees, the feeling it feels in certain situations. This movie does not leave you with the desire to know more about or the inconvenience of a loophole on the plot. There are no gaps (in my opinion). I've always been a fan of foreign films, especially now that movies are made so badly in America. I really enjoy foreign settings because I feel that it can take you on a trip and sometimes understand another culture. This movie made all these things for me and more. Watch this movie and if you're new to foreign movies, it's a great start.
