In the 1960s, Hong Kong, a man and a woman moved to the apartments next door to their spouses. Soon they will suspect that their never-existing spouses interact with each other. A strange bond between a man and a woman when they start to deal with their sadness when they play each other's spouse before a more complex bond appears ... <br /> <br /> No summary can make it fair, Hong Kong auteur Wong Kar -Wai "Love in the Spirit" is no wonder. Story about sadness that can move and sometimes funny. Romance that never feels forced or fake. Undoubtedly, the director's method has a lot to do with it. <br /> <br /> From an untested scenario (although the concept is largely derived from Japanese short stories), the film immediately releases the freshness of its performances to encourage improvisation. The whole movie moves around it and the rest is pure improvement. At the heart of the film are two symbols that ease your heart and stay there long after the final credit: Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung are just amazing and the language barrier does not damage any direct and true fragments. Additional material is also top-notch: the movies are great to see (partly "Hero" Christopher Doyle lenses) and music is heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> This is something everyone has to look at, if only because it is by far the most heartfelt, mature and authentic "love story". Impossible.
