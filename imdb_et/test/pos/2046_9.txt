I think Shane Black is one of the greatest activities of all time. He gave us a fantastic (at a time) deadly weapon by shooting Mel Gibson's superstardom. Then this second best film was followed by Bruce Willis, who has ever been (The Last Boyscout). Slightly a bit with The Last Action Hero, but redeemed himself with The Long Kiss Goodnight. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of action movies, it's all ... Action, Comedy, Thrills, more stuff with Action, Comedy and Thrills. Geena Davies is great, Samual L Jackson is even bigger. Don't miss it! <br /> <br /> 9/10
