What I can say about this movie, which has not been said here by all the other comments, all in all, the people who love it, cherish it, the people who hate it ... well, they devastate it. This is Marmite's film equivalent. <br /> <br /> I've personally dedicated every second to memory, it's cyclic, claustrophobic, introspective, magical, and one of the most unique films ever made. Regardless of what many have said, I believe this is really a cult film, this is a dirty diamond that is waiting to be discovered, once unexplored, this fantastic psychedelic vision and incredible soundtrack is unforgettable, which in itself is an accomplishment. One of my friends who watched it was more musical, and in many cases those who did not fully understand the film context would probably have more of a look at it. <Br>> <br /> I always liked the monkeys, especially the TV show, when it was repeated in the 80s. My mother had saved Head for me when it was shown late on the television, as she knew I liked them, I looked at it a day later and it remained in memory until I got a copy of the DVD 2 years later, what I now love is a special edition, it would be a great impression of making this masterpiece. We can only hope.
