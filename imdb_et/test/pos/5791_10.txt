Firstly, this film is a reality that is well understood by art. Some combination of "American beauty" and "as good as it gets". And, of course, something specifically for all Russian films (of course, valuable, not dirty propaganda!): The problem of loneliness of man ... Especially recommended for people who really want to see all propaganda about communism (both positive) or negative propaganda!). The film about ordinary people, their problems, lack of satisfaction - especially young people - fears when you touch the real and too dirty face of society ... and counterfeit "solutions": alcohol and violence ... and probably the only real solution: true love ... Of course it is very "located" in the "Russian perestroika" space and time, but it applies to the whole society (except perfect, but don't worry - it's not possible to find it on our Earth!). Last time - definitely recommended ...
