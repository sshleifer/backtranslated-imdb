It is such a respectable and studied film, classic Hitchcock among many, it doesn't want to look at it again. But do you think it can hold on even if the plot's huge (and smart and amazing) trick is not surprising? <br /> <br /> Yes. <br /> <br /> And when starters have a beginning, deeply beautiful and slippery, which really tells the whole story, its content. Two taxis, two men with their shoes, walking with each train, sitting with each other, and opera, mistake, little crying and conversation started and we see the men themselves. They are interchangeable. <br /> <br /> The tone here is characteristic of Hitchcock, because it is in many horror and temporary films - cheerful and light. We know about entering the film, but that's not the case, so we're already worried. After all, what's wrong? <br /> <br /> A lot. In a truly Hitchcock way, this is a purely innocent person (almost always a man) who is facing injustice involved in the fact that threatens him the most valuable. The innocent in this case, the tennis player Guy Haynes, is played with the innocence that is plausible - his collegial politeness in the first scene, for example, when he realizes that another man is a small cue, is what you or I could do. A non-innocent person is a absorbed and intelligently intelligent corrupted child, Bruno Anthony, who played Robert Walker's glorious glory. (This unpleasant force is equivalent to another Hitchcock wack played by Anthony Perkins Psychos.) So the scene is the first on the train (and on the train, really proud!), We have two leaders and we have the pleasure of Patricia Highsmith's first novel, who also wrote behind two of Mr. Ripley's films, he wrote a little and completely simple and ultimately devastating plot. And it doesn't hurt that the scenario was written by Raymond Chandler himself, who knows something about economy and smart dialogue. And crime. <br /> <br /> And of course there is more than just the first scene. What to look out for? Well, this senator's daughter's smart (I thought she was terrible) is Hitchcock's daughter Patricia, who is still with us (since 2009 she also played a role in psychics). And the landmark of the film is a landmark - the Hamptons tennis courts that are known to us as the United States. The fantastic last full scene with the carousel is the only place where Hitchcock moves to a certain slow and steady assembly, creating an intermediate check, making it surreal. Fear begins to smile positively with laughing children and the crawling old. And when it collapses during the crash - it's all designed for the set, one of the director's more natural uses that doesn't worry about the realism of his back projects. <br /> <br /> Photography is ideal for Hollywood stunning, so it's not as stylized (as in some noir film), it is an object in itself. Look again at the first scene or Haynes's arrival (and editing) that enters the house, which the viewer sees as murder. It's a complicated construction. If we are not completely surprised that this is in Bruno's bed, it just proves that the director has our toes. Always waiting for something unexpected. <br /> <br /> Are there any disruptions? Who knows? It depends on what inaccuracy you can (or embrace) in a beautiful style. The scene where Bruno beats the old woman's party is so brilliant (the woman played by Norma Varden is a caricature that is so believable that it takes your breath away), and she's spoiled by watching the senator's daughter and being fired dead and her similarity to her past with the victim. This is the idea of ​​psychology from the mid-20th century, which penetrates many Hitchcock efforts. (Psycho End, Starters.) <br /> <br /> The Wikipedia article on the film highlights the continuous doubling of the film's affairs, from the main characters to the murder victim and the senator's daughter. It's a lot of reflection - two men riding on a tennis court, two men are accompanied by a victim park and so on. There may be too much of this, but it gives aesthetic continuity above and below our consciousness. Do not forget that these are two murders - this is the lack of another murder, the inability to double in this case, which leads to Bruno's disapproval. <br /> <br /> Walker actor had emotional problems and was institutionalized in the year before the film was shot, and just after that he died of a response to the treatment used to calm one of his outbreaks. Although he appeared in other films, strangers on the train are easily on their tour. Farley Granger had a long career that never saw him as a real starter, although his style may have a special nervous sweetness that actually works, especially for those who live at night. <br /> <br /> And if you look at it for the first or third time, look for a cool and fun scene in a tennis game where crowd leaders move back and forth - except Bruno. He looks without head to head without moving us. As the movie trailer says, do not talk about the "stranger on the train" after this movie.
