When I knew Donald Sutherland (Jack Shaw / Henry Fields) appeared in this film, he immediately told me that it was a good picture. Most of Sutherland's images are full of action and tension, and he can play quite cruel and can be quite charming and kind. In this picture, Jack Shaw did his best to be a good man and a bad boy when he taught Navy's offices to become a spy who had to change his entire identity and become a night different person. There are lots of car chasing scenes and lots of stunt men situations that I wouldn't like to meet. This naval officer lived with his wife in quite a community and was a father, but you do not understand this fact until the film reveals the terrible secrets it had to keep from its family and friends. Good spy movie and all the actors.
