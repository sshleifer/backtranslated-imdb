No. I'm not kidding it. He was a guest reviewer of Entertainment Weekly and gave this film positive signs. And who can blame him? It's a charming, lively and quite funny Disney movie. Who doesn't love kittens? Music Ev'rybody wants to be a cat is confused. It puts me in my fingers or something. Only years later, when cats did not dance, I have seen a movie that was musically fun. What Aristocats lacks animation and story is charming. Plus, everything is moving at a relaxed pace and even the villain is not as scary. It's perfect for a younger device, but it's not so happy that adults don't like it. If Snoop was here, I'm sure he would say the same. Yes, yes. Dig those CRAZY cats, man.
