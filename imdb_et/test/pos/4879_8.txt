For anyone who has problems with naughty, mad or cumbersome children, this is an important program. It's just the best behavioral documentary program, not just tips, but changes. Quite Attractive Jo Frost is Supernanny, who has fifteen years of nanny experience, now he has a program where he shows a family where children are very, very bad. Frost is a babysitter who doesn't let children win. Every episode has young children who are mad and very naughty, eg. throwing things, constant torture, killing relatives and parents, and many other terrible experiences. However, the episodes at the end of each exhibition become parents (with the help of Frost) from small monsters to loving children. It's just wonderful if the changes are successful, Jo Frost is a great supernanny. It was named the National Television Award's most popular facts program (twice). The top 100 television shows in 2004 were number 15. Very good!
