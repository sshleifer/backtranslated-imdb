My husband pulled me into this movie because I had no interest in seeing Anime comics. I was absolutely glad with a simple story and amazing animation. In the digital world, where the effects were created with the computer, it was refreshing to see fantastic, creative hand-drawn animations. The world of Sosuke and Ponyo is a blend of living fantasy and minimal reality. I have not seen such an animation because I was a child and it is wonderful to see that it can withstand and succeed. <br /> <br /> Participants who cast votes in English were stunning. The length of the film was PERFECT, especially for children who tend to go to the movies. In general, we have a very expensive joy of ticket prices today.
