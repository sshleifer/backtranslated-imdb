"The great other religion than the invisible power structure that exists in reality is the shortest definition of paranoia." ? Slavoj Zizek <br /> <br /> This is a review by Marathon Man and The Falcon and the Snowman, two film director John Schlesinger. <br /> <br /> Although Hitchcock and Lang brought "conspiracy thriller" to Hollywood, the genre only flourished in the late 60s and 70s, with films such as "Parallax", "Z", "Marathon Man", "Capricorn One", "Manchur Candidate "," Three Days Condor and All President's Men. It was Vietnam and Watergate's age, the public suspicious of all political leaders. <br /> <br /> The genre remained silent at the beginning of the 80s and 90s until "X Files "TV series are alive. With signs like" Truth is There "and" Trust No One ", a series of large plot and government plots were presented, a general man in the grace of all the ridiculously developed schemes." The only way out of the maze? " This was probably our duty to trawl through the information labyrinth, discovering some of the hard-to-understand truths that secured our own freedom. <br /> <br /> This trend ended with a boom in the internet, a conspiracy thriller that now give way to "conspiracy documentaries. The generation of the Internet created independent documentaries such as "Loose Change" and "Zeitgeist", while in the mainstream Michael Moore is awarded the title as "Fahrenheit 9/11". All of these documentaries believed in a "secret queue" of wealthy politicians and businessmen who fell to reduce human rights and enslave the world. They struggle to create a mono myth by combining various conspiracies and hidden agendas into a single, all-encompassing narrative that explains everything and purpose and the future. <br /> <br /> It needs to "align narrative", make it "more efficient", reflect the scientific community struggling to create the "Grand Unification Theory" and finally "Everything" theory by combining everything from Quantum Mechanics to Special Relativity one giant, all-encompassing formula. So "conspiracy thriller" is the introduction of a man's desire to gain control. A modern subject is one who displays direct cynicism towards official institutions, but at the same time believes in the existence of a conspiracy (invisible drawing others). This apparently contradictory link between cynicism and belief is strictly linked to the great other deaths. Its disappearance makes us build a second (conspiracy) to escape the intolerable freedom that causes the loss. On the other hand, it is not necessary to take another seriously if we believe in others. That is why we are allowed to show cynicism and faith in equal measures. Thus, one tries to control the universal universe, to create a kind of father's sitter (be it God, mathematical formula, conspiracy theory, explanation of violence / conspiracy / murder / war, etc.). ) who gives meaning and symbolic order. The great one gives the believer confirmation. It is a "lifestyle choice" that is similar to religion, where its place in the world depends solely on irrationality. The problem with most "conspiracy thrillers" is Hitchcock's "Topaz" innocent days to a modern ticket like "Da Vinci Code" twice. First of all, they are not wrong, suggesting that the "elite" or "the best people" are wrong, but they are mistaken in the individualization and personalization of social, collective and systemic processes, which means that it is just a matter of personal morality, not social structures. . Second, and most importantly, these "conspiracies" ignore the fact that Big Other simply does not exist. Symbols are not drawn by symbols. <br /> <br /> Some modern "conspiracy thrillers" ("Eyes Wide Shut", "Existenz", etc.) admit it, the truth of their untruthful lies, accidents, truths, and half, not something that has never agreed , it doesn't make sense, real and hyperreal, truth and desire, all blurred, without any identifiable zero, but these are mostly films of intellectual directors. <br /> <br /> "Marathon Man" and "The Falcon and the Snowman" are positively archaic compared to their modern "conspiracy thrillers". "Marathon Man" is about a student (Dustin Hoffman) who has been involved in his big brother's business (Roy Scheider), which unfortunately is related to spies, weapons, double agents, diamonds and evil Nazi dentists. Scheider is a savvy, Hoffman is great, and Schlesinger hits us with a clean visual (the Eiffel Tower is stunning), but the most interesting is how his different plot lines intersect up to the 1-hour mark. Even when it comes to thinking, it takes another half an hour. Unfortunately, the movie ends with a clique showdown between a cable and a good boy, all well solved and explained. <br /> <br /> Falcon and Snowman are a bit more ambitious. Sean Penn and Timothy Hutton are playing two friends selling government secrets to the Soviet Union. Hutton works with a civil defense contractor and smuggles information from his office and Penn, small drug dealers who have no sales to the KGB. Penn is doing it strictly for money, while Hutton is disappointed with the American government (especially its attempt to lead the Australian leader) and sells secrets strictly because he hates how his country organizes crimes and espionage games. In other words, the film is a conspiracy taken in response to conspiracy. <br /> <br /> "Marathon Man" ?? 7.9 / 10 <br /> <br /> "Falcon and Snowman"? 8/10 <br /> <br /> After the odd stalemate and the end of this clich√©, "Marathon Man" is an effective thriller with several clean scenes. "The Falcon and Snowman" is even better, turning Penn into a memorable one.
