My 5-year-old daughter is in the Barbie series. It has had different feelings - she didn't want her to buy all the Barbie dolls, and admitting that movies are a marketing opportunity to convince young girls to buy more dolls and make more money for Mattel. This morning, when he asked me to watch this movie with him, and - it's lazy Saturday morning and not much more - I agreed. I do not know if the films are made for the marketing of dolls, which seem to have lost some of their complaint about what I have heard or if the dolls are marketing (or more likely to be a bit both) movies, no matter what happens, I must admit - surprise me, it doesn't been half bad. <br /> <br /> This is a fun and imaginative story with magical places and people and memorable characters (both good and evil.) Essentially, Annika ("played by Barbie") has to find a way to build a "magic wand" to change wizard wenlock's evil weather, which among other things has turned his sister into a flying horse and his parents rock. Animation here was pretty good - not a Disney caliber (if anyone thinks of Disney as a standard), but in general it is pretty good, and although the film is obviously adapted to young girls, not middle-aged men, I still found it was quite difficult to wonder how it all comes out. It is true that the story was a story, or at least some logical contradictions, but again, the target group who does not really think of such things must be remembered. This is the film of the whole decent family. 7/10
