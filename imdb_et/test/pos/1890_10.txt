A completely Bulgarian man, a screaming brain man, is a fun love story between two rich ugly American guys and the murderous girl's gypsy gypsy. <br /> <br /> William Cole and his wife Jackie arrive in Bulgaria on a business trip and grab a cab operated by Hustler Yegor. Things start to scare when Tatoya, the maid, the murders Yegor and William and the crazy scientist implant part of Yegor's brain with William's head. Robots can finally take part, as do the gypsies with broken fingers, head injuries, Bruce Campbell, who rides pink Vespa with prissy small hoses, and the All-Of-Me-style physical comedy that characterizes the war with his brain voice controlling the party Man With a screaming brain is an incredibly funny movie. It has the most fun tracking I've ever seen (as Bruce Campbell's character, fresh from the lab and giant forehead and blue hospital pajamas, crosses the square and frightens the crowd) and falls - a scene of murders of stages, with a screening of the whole test, screaming laughing. The whole thing is the fucking rebellion from start to finish and I would recommend it to any physical comedy fan, Bruce Campbell or B-films in general.
