Like Canada, I didn't know much about the dismissal of Whitlam. I had read the Wikipedia page about these events, but that was it. Earlier this year, when Canada underwent a potential constitutional crisis (that is, luckily), which could have led to our governor's intervention, the press mentions the dismissal of Whitlam. While trying to learn more, I ordered this mini-series DVD via eBay. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed with the interesting account. The dramatic as well as the events could have been a very boring political drama. But it was a pretty stopping mini-series. I was also impressed by how understandable it was, despite the fact that Australian politics were not familiar. It didn't take long to figure out who they were and what their roles were. <br /> <br /> That said, it is not completely impartial. Malcolm Fraser is certainly portrayed as Machiavellian, who does not let any person or thing become prime minister. Gough Whitlam is depicted in the superb, almost sacred light. But the Whitlam depicting the bearer carries the nobleman in such a way that it is more than a pump. I thought Sir John Kerri was portrayed quite sympathetically. <br /> <br /> I have to warn people that the DVD is of very poor quality. I understand that this was done for television in the early 80s, but it seems that no effort was made to restore image quality or sound quality. It was very disappointing that no attachments were included. A documentary or even some interviews with historical figures would have increased the experience, but nothing is.
