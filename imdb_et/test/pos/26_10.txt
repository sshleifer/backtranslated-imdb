This film has its own detractors, and Courtney's fey dresser can offend some people (who, frankly, need a good main taste), but the film is all-encompassing: appealing, terrible, relevant. Of course, Finney is bigger than life. Courtney is the ideal foil. I thought the performances were terribly strong in both shades, and Courtney's character gave a lot of dark humor. The period is well caught, well-chosen. It must be seen and enjoyed as good-hearted. I want it already on the DVD ... (* ohk *) ...
