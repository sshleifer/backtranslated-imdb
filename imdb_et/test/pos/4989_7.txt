Too much added when too much has been taken away from the great western part written by McMurtry between Texas Rangers and India. This scenario will only take it away to fill this mini-series, which has many warm fuzzy relationships that were really secondary to the main line. It ends with a completely incredible and distinct end that is not written in the book, which puts you in doubt as to how we are being transported to Lonesome Dove. <br /> <br /> The main characters in the series were really good, shooting locations were great, but this mini-series should have been a big book.
