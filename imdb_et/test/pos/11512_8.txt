While reading other IMDB comments, I had great expectations before seeing the "angels of the universe". I wasn't disappointed and I was going to give it to 8, I'd say I can justify that class. Supporting actors also do very good work, such as patients in the mental body, parents, and Pall's siblings. Music is also worth mentioning, supporting the film in its entirety, giving depth and feelings. . However, if you want to see cheesy comedy or something light, it's not for you. This is the story of people with mental disorders, how they are treated in society, but the most important thing is the story of PÃ¡l. This is one of the best films ever out of Iceland, if not in Scandinavia.
