At the first twentieth minute we will be removed with a number of powerful imaginative emotions: a warm and overwhelming mother is a violent argument with her 40-year-old living daughter; a piano teacher (and a professor of music) against the love of his pupils expressed in critical assessment; joy that music can inspire both the listener and the performer. In this short period of time, our minds have convincingly convinced very real signs. We also have great music and we show the difference between high and mediocre performance, paying close attention to the nuance. This kind of material alone would have been the basis for a remarkable film of extensive appeal. But the trend in the French cinema is what it is, it goes deeper, exploring the repressed sexuality of the teacher, the expression of sexual freedom and the later distribution in the context of passionate attractiveness, and the inevitable cycle of actual abuse. We control his suffering and at least initially do not know how much suffering can be associated with genius, especially by composers. The piano teacher includes graphical dialogue and images of sex and cruelty in scenes that some people don't look at. The scenes are important for the dilemmas that the film is trying to raise and so it cannot be called free. A big movie can be, but the main thing to watch is not.
