1969 film from TCM overnight. I remember seeing the movie for the first time in Hong Kong, I really enjoyed the songs and performances of Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark. I love Clark's best at Francis Ford Coppola's "Finian Rainbow" (1968) against Fred Astaire, Don Francks and Tommy Steele. Just ecstatic to find out that this pleasant Irish flavored pot is finally released from gold music on DVD! Ah, "this is an old devil's moon (in your eyes)." <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole as Mr. Chips - yes, he sang - quite a release. He may not be a musical veteran, like Rex Harrison, but he took this role wonderfully. His scenes that resemble a PBS series, "serve them all their days" - a loving schoolmaster and a loving man, are flying over the picture's lawn, "Chipey. Clark and O'Toole gave us just the right exposure and situation. The songs and songs of Leslie Bricus are memorable as usual. The ensembles of "You and Me" and "Walking the World" stayed with me the most in these years, and there is "What a lot of flowers", "And in the sky smiled", "Fulfill the world with love" - Sometimes I think that if the world is in Bricusse's songs and words, then we would surpass all the earthquakes and "lovely" all our days! Yes, "Talk to animals" (Doctor Doolittle, 1967) < br /> <br /> The music is a blessing for the living world, they are somehow bigger than life, like the music and words of Sherman Brothers (Richard M. and Robert B.) who gave us "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" (1968) and "Mary Poppins" (1964) - who doesn't feel very happy just "superc alifragilisticexpialidocious ""? I was even singing with one song and dance number in Spanish film "Km.0 - Kilometer Zero" (2000). My all-time favorite is French filmmaker Jacques Demy's 'Rochefort young girls' (1967) with colorful pain with Catherine Deneuve and (late sister) Francoise Dorl√©ac, Jacques Perrin, Michel Piccoli, Danielle Darrieux, Gene Kelly and George Chakiris Michel Legrand. Live musicals.
