Double Shock is one of many good Columbo episodes that reach good movie levels. <br /> <br /> It has all the elements we like in Columbo episodes. We laugh when Columbo does something clumsy, and it happens more than once in Double Shock. I can almost ensure you laugh several times when you decide to watch this episode. <br /> <br /> We also get the mind as usual with a perfect murder, but with some murder troubles in Columbo. The end is normal; <br /> <br /> This is another good Columbo episode and I appreciate it 7/10. It's close to 8/10. <br /> <br /> "Just another question" - actor? Peter Falk is very good as usual.
