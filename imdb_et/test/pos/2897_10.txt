This DVD is treated indifferently by classical rock music devotees around the world because Rush isn't just cool. It is a shame that Rush has had to overcome the disdain for most of North American and British music journalists in his 30-year history, as it has left many people a real band. here is well represented and the song directory! We have "2112", the magical "The Trees" and the lyrical "Tom Sawyer", which is its last album "Vapor Trails." The musical generation is almost flawless, the show is remarkable and Brazilian fans are just insane (at one point they sing with the instrumental!) Each band member plays at a level that violates religious-true craftsmen who perform art. try instrument "La Villa Strangiato" or "Rhythm Method" for size and yes, the latter is the drum solo (which must be considered plausible.) <br /> <br /> The sound and vision production values ​​are very high than the Rush experience and you will also get documentary and multi-angle pieces. <br /> <br /> It is amazing performance and respect for Canadian rocks and all serious classic rock fans should have their own copy.
