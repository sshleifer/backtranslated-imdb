Great movie. Every moment Toyoda and his team are mastering. The actors give all kinds of reliable performances. Visuals are haunting, beautiful and sometimes haunting beautiful Japanese and urban landscapes. The sounds of the Japanese band 'Dig' are never too sharp, as expected from the band's tracks. It is a strange atmosphere and fits well with the scenes they play. All in all, they worked out perfectly perfectly .... Well, when they gave justice to hope, perfection is the only thing anyone could have accepted. <br /> <br /> 9 Seoul's true greatness is a convincing story. The prison to break the film may have something like a lost genre of the day and the film will lose its appeal due to the decline of the world. But this story just mixes two fresh two genres. <br /> <br /> 9 convicts are given freedom and a chance to get their places back in society. does society accept them? are they truly free from their darkness? and can they stay together long enough to stay alive and find out? <br /> <br /> Every convict has a history. Their crimes are as different as their obvious destinies. The feeling of brotherhood among them keeps the story high and provides it with comedy situations. And because their background is characteristic, violence is always something that awaits it to happen. <br /> <br /> After all, all I can say is to go.
