It has been a while since I've seen Cold Mountain, a little I knew I enjoyed it enormously. although this is happening in the last days of the American Civil War, it is not really a war movie. .and it works mainly thanks to presentations. I usually don't like Nicole Kidman, but I liked it. I thought he was very convincing in his role. I also liked Rene Zelwegger, who I usually do not have a Jude Law fan is good. This is usually supported by supporting presentations, too much to mention. There are also some breathtaking landscapes in the film. There are also some very nice musical works. the story is a sad and tragedy hidden, but it is beautifully well spoken. For me, Cold Mountain is 8/10
