The producer, Matt Mochary, hit the theme of the film, Anderson Sa (head of the AfroReggae music movement), on a trip to the Hewlett Foundation in Rio de Janeiro. Mochary was so moved by the story that he called his friend, NYC filmmaker Jim Zimbal, who finished his work and joined Mochary in Brazil to work on documentary film Sa, Rio favelade and the culture of violence. <br /> <br The first part of the movie shows the Rio culture of violence (hostile to the poor) through police raids and attacks by residents. The video is graphic and shocking. <br /> <br /> Charismatic Anderson Sa rising from Favelade's negativity, winning a potential career in drug trafficking to start the Afro-Reggae movement that combines elements of Afro-Brazilian culture, Reggae, ska and other elements of a fast-developed percussion game that is common to the rest of the world. Music can't help you, but even when you see that the local kids are taking part in the school he set up to get the kids out of the gangs of drugs. The rest of the film follows you meteoric rise and his positivity makes many of the child's lives look for a life that is not a drug. SPOILER: Just when filmmakers thought they were filming, the incredible life of a changing event, the resolution of which must be credible. The movie continues and you are stuck in your seat until the end. <br /> <br /> This movie is the answer to the "City of God" and its worth. The gloomy situation depicted in this film is offset by a real example of how favela residents can overcome a terrible situation and use their resources for constructive purposes. You can't help Anderson Sa succeed and rooting. <br /> <br /> This movie is amazingly captured, fast paced and quite absorbing. Judging by the overwhelming response of the audience's last night's SilverDocs screening, the film should be spreading in the US and an amazing soundtrack should also appear. Keep a prominent documentary - it's great!
