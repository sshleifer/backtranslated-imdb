This is one of those films where you need to give some of its obvious drawbacks (due to the date and location of its production) on one side and emphasize the positive. In many ways, this is a really great movie. <br /> <br /> Give the parody a single line, but the hardest hit was with an English speaker as I was surprised by the subtitles. The print that I saw was the subtitles of the 1982 Soviet "Movie Export", which consistently used reversed grammar, presumably to impress a 13th-century speech. Its pointless real impact is to make it difficult to follow subtitles, which means you spend less on viewing pictures. Given that cinematographic films are this film, this is a real problem. <br /> <br /> Other IMDB tags have written a lot about the Stalinist propaganda elements of this movie (just when the viewer doesn't let them know). They have also written a lot about the battle on the ice scene, which I think is great. <br /> <br /> The interest in love is almost completely absent from fineness and still strangely ..... almost no charm at all. But that's good, whatever and then eternal. <br /> <br /> I already knew Prokofiev's music before seeing the movie. Pictures and music complement each other wonderfully. And it is these pictures that will be remembered for a long time. Bergman clearly learned many of these images - images of his medieval pieces (such as the seventh seal, Virgin Spring) that were based on Eisenstein's ideas and increased them. This film was made in 1938 in the USSR. In this context, it is a masterpiece, although it is faulty. For today's viewer, I suggest you go to the stream and enjoy various shows.
