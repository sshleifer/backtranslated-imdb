This movie is a fairly fair adaptation of Prosper Merimeé's novel. In the novel Merimeé herself is a character, Don José is Navarra (Northern Spain and historically Basque Zone, they can speak Basque). They are based in Seville (Andalusia, southern Spain) and they only speak Spanish with Andalusian accents, but they don't speak Basque, but Carmen explains to Don José that he lives in Navarra. You can believe it or not, anyway, this is the book version, so you can't be critical of this movie, be with the book! You have to note that Merimeé and Bizet's opera is different, and this film is a customization of the novel, but there is still a Navarre Spanish in Operation Don José. Why do so many people think Don José is French? I don't know, but I think the novel and the opera are in French, although it should be in Spanish. <br /> <br /> The only significant difference between a movie and a novel is that in the movie, Don José also kills Carmen's lover and his novel (not the opera). I think they wanted to do a little more for the movie! I think the movie is pretty good.
