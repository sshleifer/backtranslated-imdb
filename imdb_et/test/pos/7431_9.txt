This movie is based on the game series Final Fantasy. This is especially true for FF7 or Final Fantasy VII. I loved the game and I was very happy to see it as a movie, I loved CG, it was fantastic. There are many fighting scenes, activities and signs to make the movie memorable. If your game is a very hard fan, you will love this movie. Personally, I'm not a fan of games, but I'm gonna get together. <br /> <br /> My favorite character next to Final Fantasy VII should be Cid. I love Cidi, I think she's cute. I was surprised when the real CG images were, it was amazing, this is a 3D game. I had the time to watch the movie and by the way, I love the aeon, especially the Bahamut, she's great! In general I gave this movie 9 because yes I loved it. I thought it was a really good movie, and yes, it's in my movie list. The characters were amazing, loved the CG, the story was wonderful, lots of activities and fighting scenes. All-in-all, this is the best movie I've seen on video games.
