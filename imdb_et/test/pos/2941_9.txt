Yes, I am ashamed to admit it, but this exhibition is positively DEVINE !!! It's so much fun and I have the greatest time to watch it.Ever since the 1st cycle it has been great and I have not noticed that it has fallen to the glory ALL.Tyra Banks, as you know, are a host and as amazing as it is, there are other judges and co-hosts such as J. Alexander, Jay Manuel, Nigel Barker and Twiggy. is for every girl who is invited to become America's next top model, has to work her way up, filling and winning photo shootings. It sounds good no longer, and let me tell you that it is great !! It's fantastic looking at all the different photographic shapes girls take, and each one is different, cool and bold. Anyone who hates this show has no idea, and I tell you that this show is a long time, so deal with it !!!
