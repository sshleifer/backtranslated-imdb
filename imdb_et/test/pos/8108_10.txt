I was surprised and impressed that this film appeared in 1940 before the United States reached World War II. On a surface that soothes both solemn and terrible when Nazi Germany might be misunderstood as a rash. But Chaplin's brilliance is not limited to making fun. In fact, the seriousness of his message would not have been nearly as valid, if not for the great use of that humor in this film, as well as for the great drama moments. Drama alone wouldn't bite and resonate that movie. Somebody's laughing (Adenoid Hynkel) may be the best way to attack them, but laughing at someone (Jewish Barber) may be the best way to love them. In the last speech of the Jewish Barber I forgot for a moment that the war he was talking about took place more than half a century ago. These are the words that mean now and during the war. I therefore believe that the film has done much more to gain than the damage, because it still has the same profound effect today.
