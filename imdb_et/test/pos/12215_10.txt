Someone asked why it was canceled. I'll tell you why Because "reality" makes money. the exhibition space was canceled so that they could replace this "reality" exhibition, it hit NBC, I and about half of my high school, about 1,000 people have promised to boycott NBC until they bring back the show. in my area (i don't know about other places), but they had a big thing that went with a Sci-Fi channel where the Sci-Fi channel shows the episode of the last weeks at 7:00 and then NBC would show a new episode of the week at 8:00 am it was great because it gave you a little update about what happened in the last episode. I was so angry when I found out that the exhibition was canceled and they just left them on such a church!
