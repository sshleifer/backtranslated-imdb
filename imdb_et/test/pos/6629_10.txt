Being a big fan of Bergman, I had to search literally for years to find this movie (below $ 60) and finally bought it a few weeks ago. The main prerequisite for Bergmann's films is the relationship between the characters and how they deal with their aspirations. So this movie is the same, but it's different because the setting is much different than most of the Bergman movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> It's set in wartime and heros are caught in the middle. br /> <br /> It is riveting from beginning to end and it proves once again that Liv Ullman is one of the best actors of the 20th century. Must see.
