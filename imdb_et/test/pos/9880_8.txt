I loved this movie when I was younger, and I've actually been looking for it again !! I'd like to watch it again !! The information is all right, but the cover doesn't look like it would fit - I can't say for sure. What I remember was a film about their children (Alyssa Milan, Tina Yothers, etc.) in the car class, and it also shows the inconvenience they encounter outside the class. Edie McClurg was the mother of Alyssa Milan. I remember that I really liked that if someone knows where I get a copy of the above movie (preferably DVDs) (preferably DVDs), I would like to know. Thanks :)
