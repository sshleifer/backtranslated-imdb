I love this movie. It has a very real feeling. I think it was never popular because of this topic, but because of this theme, it makes the movie much more important. <br /> <br /> This is an A-film and I highly recommend it. If you liked the "1984" book or movie, I think you like it. <br /> <br /> It's insignificant, including mental and physical acts of torture, some pretty vile. Not in the heart of the week or in the stomach. It's not gore, but his film is so great in predicting spiritual expectation that it doesn't need blood and courage. <br /> <br /> If you are not a realist or a pessimistic person, I don't think you enjoy it. It leaves you with an uneasy feeling about the people they are capable of, and the very real opportunity that our government (s) may not have a personal interest in your heart.
