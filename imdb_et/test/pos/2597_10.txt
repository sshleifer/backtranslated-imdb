For Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck - ALI BABA BUNNY, there is only one movie I think it may be as good or better. But the best thing to do is irrelevant - just look at both of them and have fun. <br /> <br /> I compared it to ALI BABA BUNNY because both have Daffy's absolute worst - greedy, nasty and very funny process. However, I think I would prefer RABBIT SEASONING just because the Bugs are also quite terrible - doing terrible things back to Daffy every time Daffy tries the dirty trick. Tracks to the Bugs hole in the hope that the hunter (of course this is Elmer) will burst the rabbit and leave Daffy alone! Bugs are still not over, take over all the Daffy tricks over and over and turn them around - and in most cases, it involves beating Daffy on the face! It's all very, very clever and funny and I don't care how old you are, this cartoon will make you laugh if you're not a storm. I love a particularly big and unexpected end, but I don't say more because I don't want to spoil the surprise.
