Four beautiful sisters in their last year of nursing experience all kinds of instability and excitement in their lives: sweet Susan (powerful brunette Elaine Giftos) is trying to bother with Greg (poor Darrell Larson's moving performance), eager but neurotic Phred (lovely blonde Karen Carlson) talks about beautiful gynecologist Jim Caspar ( Satisfied Lawrence Casey), Free Enthusiastic Hippie Priscilla (stunningly proud Barbara Leigh) gets impregnated with a comfortable drug dealer Les (solid Richard Rust) and compassionate Lynn (nicely played by Brioni Farrell) helps angry Mexican revolutionary Victor Charlie (excellent Reni Santoni). Despite the fact that this film is made for New World Pictures for legendary use by Roger Corman, it is nothing more than your usual pointless piece with a soft core. Instead, it is a very pleasant, charming and even often thought-out time during the social and political upheavals of the early 1970s (Lynni and the revolutionary sub-block is particularly strong and provocative). Special rubbers are designed for the director Stephanie Rothman, who brings the material to a welcome and refreshing intelligence and sensitivity. What's more, four attractive and appealing female guides all sound and commendable work. Scottie MacGregor also impressed the sensible tutor Ms. Boswell and everywhere in the 70's trailer voice man Ronald Gans supplies an off-screen voice to a psychiatrist. Stevan Larner's polished cinematography, fantastic rock music, and the fragrant folksy'n'funky score by Clancy B. Grass III are all faster. Real sleeping place.
