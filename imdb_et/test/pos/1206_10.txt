I've seen this movie more than 50 times in my life and every time I watch it, this movie is as entertaining as it was for the first time! George Berger (played by Treat Williams) leads a small group of anti-war hippies from the 1960s to 1970s that live in New York. This small group is made by a young man, Claude Bukowski (John Savage), who has been drawn up by the United States Army in Vietnam. Despite his best efforts to convince him, Claude finally reports on the basic training of the army. Still, if he is abandoned, the hippie group steals a car and rides across the US to visit Claude "... in a matter of hours", according to George Berger (a member who was placed at the entrance gate). The military base of Claude is temporarily placed in Nevada. The result is really touching, so I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen this fantastic movie yet. The musical result is equally fantastic! Don Dacus (from Chicago Chicago), part of "Woof" - one of the hippies, is not a key sign, but the film wouldn't have been the same without him. Beverly D'Angelo (who plays Sheila Franklin, a hippie group friendly girl) is sensational in her role! HAVE TO BE A FILM !!
