As you know, Norway is the most advanced country in the world (with regard to HDI; Human Development Index). This film opens up our future for us. Our future would be Norwegian because we are all driving to achieve the best and the least. The life shown was perhaps an exaggeration, but comparing current concerns with our ancestral concerns is far from being a real justification. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie from all our prerequisites can be found on both our faces; the one who laughs at Andreas's lady and his girlfriend in a glorious scene and look through the magazine and lessons to choose foolish chairs with stupid chairs. <br /> <br /> With the hope of nature's idea, the second great idea of ​​the film was easy. Little glory; the only one and the efforts made to achieve this will bring us closer to Andrew. <br /> <br /> Although I was mostly attracted to the idea and production of the movie, Trond Fausa Auragagan played pretty well and the film's atmosphere was quite appropriate.
