This is one of the best action films I've seen. Gene depiction of harsh nails, "Charly" / gentle mother "Sam" was great and Samuel L Jackson keeps you laughing with all his classic linings. Of course, the actual story was a couple of holes, but this fast stamp will keep you on the edge of your seat to the end. <br /> <br /> I felt that Geena was the perfect choice for Sam / Charly, and her versatility as an actor is evident in her role as mother in her latest film, Stuart Little. Both Samuel and Gene were well supported by David Morse, Brian Cox, cute little Yvonne Zima and newcomers, sexy Craig Bierko and Melina Kanakaredes. This film highlights the deviation of a strong female character and traditional male / female stereotypes, as we see Sam / Charly (Davis) and Mitch (Jackson) from one disaster to another. Although I and many others loved this movie, it is fair to say that there are always people who do not and that is good - everyone has their own. I recommend this movie to fans, for their fun scenes and fast pace.
