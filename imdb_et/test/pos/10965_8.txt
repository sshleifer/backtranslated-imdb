View 1 of 8/26/2001 - 8 out of 10 (Dir-John Cassavetes): Cassavets' well-made early independent film introduced a style that was much different from what Hollywood audience shows. This film also introduced very taboo themes, in particular actual racism, which apparently had spread across the country, but which was mostly not shown by white controlled filmmakers. The only black actors who were honored at that time were those who acted and showed personality like the White (aka Sidney Poitier). In addition, the idea of ​​ending a movie that did not really start a relationship is a bit of a confusion for many movers, but in reality, viewers realize that life is like that (it continues ...). I prefer this type of end because it makes you think more about the characters and what can happen next and the conclusions are not just intended. The film follows people's lives (especially a couple of people with short relationships and contradictory skin colors), let's see what happens when a white man understands what he's done. It works very well and makes the movie very special. Action is said to be improvised, making the film even more amazing. I think you can say that I liked this movie if you can't say that. If you find it, check out this classic early independent film.
