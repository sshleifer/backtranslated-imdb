Being a very spooky fan, especially the Asian horror, I've seen many movies, but it's outstanding. Why? It has a plot (which unfortunately is quite rare among fear films). The participants did a good job. It looks like a real documentary (even if it's not). It is not for a moment boring. The director connects the plot intelligently with certain Japanese magic culture (maybe this cult was never there, but still it is believable). It reminded me of a big movie "Forbidden Siren". br /> I recommend this movie to all fans of high quality horror. <br /> <br /> 9 out of ten.
