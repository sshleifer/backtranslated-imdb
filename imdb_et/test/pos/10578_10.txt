Having read the book before seeing this adaptation, you think it would have lost some of its excitement. But this story is so clever that I could never tire it. <br /> <br /> Sally and Elaine really put their hearts in their roles and brought out so many signs. I fell in love with this story and the women all over again. Regardless of the speed of the TV, I do not feel that something important has been lost in transit. It was on the edge of my seat, where there were many wonderful moments of stomach. Enjoy it thoroughly. This is the kind of television I've been waiting for.
