This is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films and one of his undervalued. I believe it will surely exceed "Psycho" or "Birds" for technical art and brilliance. It's a spooky, tense, dark-humorous product that leaves you scary for a while. are not the most sons of Hitchcock villains mommy?) Bruno. This is a disturbing, stunning power that shines the entire film. His character is obsessive, probably homosexual (see those who deliberately laugh at the bonds and hear how he is called 'Europeans'), strangely charming and dangerous to overcome. Farley Granger certainly knows this when he gets into Bruno's network after a few meetings on the train. Bruno, knowing some of the inside information about Guy's things, offers two "swaps" for the benefit of each other. Walker kills Granger's slutty, a congenital woman who suppresses her marriage with a beautiful Anne, while Granger murders Bruno's father, whom he hates so intensely. Everything is happy, right? How does it win, as Bruno claims? Wrong. Granger forgets the indecent proposal, but the obsessed Walker is not. He commits his murder and has decided to go to Granger until he finishes his deal. "Strangers" turn into casino and mouse riveting, stopping games in Hitch's capable hands. We have a whore, Miriam, a stranger from Granger to another man. She gently slides into the Faroese ice cream cone while eating eye contact with Bruno. Anne's sister Barbara Morton is a deceptively sweet but smart and clever young girl who comes out with the sharpest notes of the 50's. Senator Morton is authoritative and self-absorbing. This is one of the most daring movies of Hitchcock that has ever been made, and it is typical of Hitch's film that is detailed in detail in sexuality. and fraud and hidden cinematography. Walker nut is one for ages, and Granger makes the main character convincingly difficult. Roman might be weaker than the other two, and I never believed his relationship with Granger. However, the positive negative negative results are reversed and can safely be said to be one of the BEST American films ever made. <br /> <br /> See what Hitch does here - originality, technical skill. We see Miriam's murder, which is reflected in her broken glasses. The tennis game becomes one of the most exciting, intense images you will ever see. The innocent exhibition center becomes a place of murders and malformations. Walker shows a young boy's balloon (Hitch probably liked what he saw in "The Third Man!") The joy of children riding a carousel becomes a scary, quick fear. Hitch makes ordinary everyday events like no other. <br /> <br /> Camera-work here is one of the best visions of Hitchcock films and the premise of on-die-for. It is slippery, softens complexity and damn charm. The clipping between Walker and Granger characters is great - Granger's tennis match is as important as rescuing the villain Walker from losing accusatory evidence. Hitch rebuilds his offender into a disgusting, reluctant, but sympathetic and strangely charming (did anyone else find him strangely attractive, more than a Granger?) Work - we're just as tense as Walker in our hope that he will get out of a lighter outflow. We need her anyway. He holds the key to the story. <br /> <br /> You will never see a foreign approach once you see the movie. <br /> <br /> Amazing. <br /> <br /> 10/10.
