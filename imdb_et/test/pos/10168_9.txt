Many reviewers prefer The Man Who Toew Much, which I have not had the opportunity to watch. Independently, the '56 version is a very well made film. Since the mid-fifties, the launch of Hitchcock films (including "rear glass", "dial M for Murder", "Vertigo" and "past capture", as well as this movie) is one of my favorite periods in his career. In the Inmen Who Knew Too Much, Jimmy Stewart throws himself into his role as always. Doris Day is very credible as a very atypical Hitchcock blonde. I thought there was nothing wrong with his actions. His character may not be as strong as the original, but he is certainly not a passive role, "Yes, dear", the real thing with Jimmy Stewart. <br /> <br /> Some were really wise lines written to Hank (a couple of sons who were later kidnapped) on the bus screen, it's too bad Christopher Olsen reads them out of wood. At the same time, the good work of a child artist of the 1950s is rarely seen. Most of the other supporters of the film were very competent, though the most important assassin (played by Reggie Nalder). <br /> <br /> Some small touches that make this movie indisputably Hitchcockian - a non-English dialogue, especially French (something Hitch did on a much larger scale "The Catch A Thief"); counterfeiting, use of Arabic music in a hotel when an assassin appears; Stewart and the day speak to each other in church, sing their words to the anthem; Albert Hall's scene featuring musicians and an assassin accomplice who were tensed, as well as percussion players who got their thimbles ready; and finally an assassin weapon that appears behind the curtain. It moves so slowly and accurately that it must be made mechanically (the effect also used at the end of "Spellbound"). <br /> <br /> Everyone who knew too much is having fun watching a movie. It is not as deep or symbolic as some of his films ("Vertigo", "Strangers on the Train"), but all this is one of my five best Hitchcock masterpieces.
