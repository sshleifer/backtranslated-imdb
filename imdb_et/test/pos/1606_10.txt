It may be difficult to explain, but this film is a masterpiece. Perhaps, because I never imagined that such a plot or a film with so few words would convey all of that poetry. Man's passions and obsession with real poetry and aristocracy. Bogard is amazing and it goes without saying that Venice is used as a perfect landscape: dark, sinking and tough as the soul of Bogardi. And classic music is more than a simple background for the transmitter's human feelings. In my opinion, it is the classic masterpiece of European cinema.
