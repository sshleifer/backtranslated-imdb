It has nothing to do with Virtual Encounters 1, so it's not really a sequel. These two videos simply share the general concept of people who have virtual reality simulation with a virtual machine. So if you really hit the VC 1 story and dialogue (yes, better) and waiting to continue in VC 2, you just need to be warned. All actors and actors are new, but it has the same great director, Sybil Richards. <br /> <br /> But as with VC 1, you'll also get lots of beautiful women and lots of great sex scenes that push the envelope. soft core almost as far as possible. <br /> <br /> If you have VC 1 and you liked it, then you like VC 2. If you don't, but like a really good softcore sex, get both.
