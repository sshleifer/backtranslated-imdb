I love love to love this example. Do you say it's because I'm tired of the brain or not. I think this exhibition is very funny and fun, although sometimes Bami's uncle Vito scares me. And so I really think that if you are "omg .. what an idiot" type of humor, then this show is for you. It's really funny to see how spectacular people have vision and many Bam House musicians. Buy It Causes That Rocks! You should buy it. yes. And Bami's brother is in the CKY band and they are really good and sometimes come to the show. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is .. look.
