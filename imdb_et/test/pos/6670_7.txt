Who is the man I hear? Kevin's surprising cry? Well, if you are not accustomed to "normal suspicion", I would recommend changing your prescription. Anyway, it's not a first-class film, but a very well-produced story that is almost plausible. Considering this about an alien, you probably don't know what? All acting are the ultimate things, and the first thing I've seen is a balanced, sarcastic Alien. Just enjoyable is everything I can say and almost for the whole family (if not for the movie later). SEVEN STARS
