This is one of the best and most enjoyable Vampire Tales ever! I really love this movie. The character is great, even the locations and the story. Indeed, the picture is not a big budget, but it is absolutely worth it. <br /> <br /> OK, there are some bugs in this movie (especially castle and location names), but such bugs are typically and almost every horror movie. <br /> <br /> The terrain is perfect for the story and is close to reality, I can say it's honest because I visit them once when I was in Romania during my vacation. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the best part of the sub-series.
