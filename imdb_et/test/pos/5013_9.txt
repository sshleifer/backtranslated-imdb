According to many accounts, Stu Ungar was not a very nice man. He spat on the dealers, remained calm, and he was verbally abusive. <br /> <br /> Many filmmakers can pick a man's sugar chips by making him a hero of sports who would win despite the accidents. But the High Roller doesn't. And it's a hard line to walk on. <br /> <br /> Instead, we have to look very carefully to see that a man who has never matured went from the streets of New York to a frightened little shop, despite all his progress. And the only true affirmation he ever gets is death itself. Very bold (because people don't get it) and very touching (if you do). <br /> <br /> What is bold is the use of Scorsese feeling. "Aha! How do I derive," people say. Really? But there is practically no violence. And Stuey LOVED gangster movies. Maybe the feeling of a man Stu and not director Marty? And if it's really a small budget film and looks so good, bravo! Wow, it will stop. But not only does it work, it works exceptionally well, even for those who do not see the link with the "Seventh Seal". (In PROOF: SS, Knight plays death with a game break: Stuey says in HR: "We can play cards, we know ..." Death says, "Never good on the cards." complicated effects or camera. There is no shaking camera. Something trendy at all. Just sure and tight storytelling. <br /> <br /> Maybe it makes the movie too easy and somehow wrong. But then again it was a man. It makes it almost right. <br /> <br /> 9/10
