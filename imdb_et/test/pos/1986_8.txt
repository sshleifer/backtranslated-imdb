I always believed that a film that is a graph focuses on a virtual reality video game that never sounds like it would be something special, but eXistenZ proved I wouldn't have been wrong anymore. This movie is incredible and offers great fun, but offers much more. From start to finish, this movie will have you conceptualize to the point where you have so many ideas, you can't make a final conclusion. David Cronenberg has this talent because he does so many things. <br /> <br /> eXistenZ is pure Cronenberg; how it is written and how it is directed is very unique to its style and it can only be good. Cronenberg set himself a clear goal with this film, and it was supposed to keep an audience that he obviously easily thought of. His love for the grotesque is not as dominant in this film as it is in "The Fly" or "Naked Lunch", but there are some other elements, such as play shops and how they are made, which can boost the audience. In its earlier work, eXistenZ is a combination of more videodrome and less violent scanners, which is a pretty awesome combination. Setting up a movie in the not too distant future was really a good decision because it allowed Cronenberg to be extremely imaginative with the film environment and allowed him to visualize more concepts, allowing fewer obstacles. It was important that the film didn't get confused and Cronenberg kept it very well, keeping things relatively easy. Besides, if he wants to make an unobtrusive movie, he knows how to do much better. <br /> <br /> eXistenZil has very talented character actors and everything is great. Jennifer Jason Leigh gives the designer a display that spends more time out of reality than that. Leigh is sexy and led her role in Allegra and she really gets her teeth. The emotional range shown in the film is particularly impressive, making it completely believable (if you can believe something). The Jewish law is also good and very persuasive for its character's fear of implantation. The chemistry of these two is very electric and adds value to the film. Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe are just two strong supporters who add depth to the film with very colorful performances. The majority of the film is not great, but eXistenZ certainly has "quality better than quantitative" ethics that works very well. <br /> <br /> In addition to being entertaining and thought-provoking, eXistenZ deals with social issues such as self-control and loss. It further demonstrates the film as an intellectual ship and can also explain why it wasn't a big Hollywood hit. eXistenZ has so much to offer and, although it is not everyone's taste, those who like Cronenberg's work or who love science fiction are almost certain that this movie likes it. This is one of those films that needs to be followed openly, but it's really something special.
