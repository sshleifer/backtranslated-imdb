Since others have complained about Sherlock Holmes's modern placement, I'm not doing it. Basil Rathbone could have used this voice to fit any era that its own faire. This is a nicely assembled mystery based loosely on The Dancing Men, one of the best Conan-Doyle songs. Instead of the original plot, it makes men part of the Nazi plot. Holmes becomes a spokesman for British war aspirations. His opponent is Moriarity, who seems to be dying often enough to rival the average of Friday 13th film. He's definitely creative, but Rathbone Holmes is uncomfortable. Watson is just for this journey. She doesn't give this film a lot of stupidity and it's a real plus. The plot is complex enough to keep their interest. There is a final speech that is almost a parody itself. But then I cannot take a critical view of the great time. If they need to call Holmes, then be it.
