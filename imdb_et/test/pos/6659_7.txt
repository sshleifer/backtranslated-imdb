This movie worked for me because I see this movie exactly the opposite of "The Wind". Farm owners, not plant owners. Scarlett fights and combines what he wants; Ada becomes depressed and turns herself up until Ruby (Renee Zellweger) appears to save the day. Sort of, around. Deserters instead of officials are trying to return to their families, the listings will continue and on. Even the love story was the opposite. If that's what the manufacturer and the writers were trying to overcome, I managed to succeed with me. <br /> <br /> There are only two things I didn't like about the movie, the rest I thought it was well done and I liked it enough to recommend it to friends. First, I didn't see the attraction between Inman (Jewish Law) and Ada (Nicole Kidman) strong enough to allow Inman to come back. Inman said he had only written to him a few times when Ada wrote to him almost continuously. Second, there was something or someone who killed or died in almost every scene, a little. I have to say that it was full of action, but after the second scene I knew something or someone died on the next scene. I like to surprise the next scene, do not know what will happen before. <br /> <br /> I thought all the actions were well done, Zellweger was the best. He deserves the credit he got. I thought he was playing a very good mountain girl. He must have done his homework. Zellweger even said in the movie that he was wiser than the people thought he was. I think it was true. The law did well when he had to go back to Kidman. It must be much stronger to go through everything when I thought it was. Now she showed many emotions during her experiments. There was something to do with Kidman's part because I chose the other two results. Unless he was depressed, he didn't show much emotion, I don't know if it's part written or if he felt that part. He still did a good job, I thought the other two were better. <br /> <br /> I liked the Zellweger, Kidman and Cock scene, although it was one of the scenes I mentioned above. I thought the "home guard" was exactly as they probably were. Although we don't hear much about them, they were part of that time. I thought the landscape was beautiful. In the film everything was necessary to be a good historical romance.
