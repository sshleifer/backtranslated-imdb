CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (Gyllenhaal) sees his first secret on-the-spot interview when Anwar (Metwally) is charged with a known terrorist bomb maker. Anwar's husband (Witherspoon) is foolish about the man's whereabouts. <br /> <br /> Do you just hate it when the movie's title sends you to the dictionary? I have to have an old edition because this display is not a musical piece. No, it's the government's way to legitimately take a resident or citizen to some place to question him and use some of the information he wants. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, I reminded me of a similar story to the Crossing Jordan TV show (now out) and I hope we'll see this story again. It's inevitable. 911 events are catalysts. <br /> <br /> It's tough to watch, because we don't like to see people tortured and our government doesn't talk about the truth. We like the idea that whatever happens or that we can find answers, but when this door is closed, we are really lost and hopeless when Anwari's wife was. <br /> <br /> All performances were first-rate and it is possible that we will see more of Igai Naori (I have no idea how to pronounce it) because she reminds and can act like Telly Savala. Without joking. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes, Sex: No, nudity: No, language: Yes
