I was fortunate enough to review this movie at night. I have to say that I was expecting a terribly cheap movie with bad behavior and a mediocre plot. I was totally wrong. This movie was not only incredibly fun, but I just loved it all. Bruce Campbell was as amazing as ever. The biggest surprise was nothing but Ted Raimi, you know Sami's little brother. He played most of the crazy doctor's handbags. Somewhere between physical comedy and smart dialogue he did nothing but shine. But I really can't ignore the magic that is Bruce Campbell. Though I thought Ted Raimi stole the show, Bruce did the best he could on the big screen. Somewhere between the American businessman and the tragic victim he scanned the same energy that he has always shown to the audience incredibly attractive. The film itself often interrupted the applause of the audience. The crowd was definitely for every small turn that the film took. <br /> <br /> This movie may not be an Oscar material, but my goodness was amazing. I would recommend it to any Bruce Campbell fan. Also, someone who loves campy sci-fi movies, do yourself a favor and watch it. Can't wait until it goes to DVD. <br /> <br /> Take it as you want .... <br /> <br /> - Feed
