I remember this movie when I was 13 years old, and I fell in love with it, and I was a big fan of the movie and the characters I adored. My favorite character was Stacey (Heidi Holicker) because she made me laugh when she didn't show interest in Fred (Cameron Dye) who really liked her, and I hoped they would finally get her boring boy, Ralphie (Christopher Murray) because he ignored him and hung up with his friends. I love the cast and the story. I always love that part when Fred tries to get along with Stacey, and I always remember when he drove him around the car. But it was so good. I always remember it in my teenage years. Now that I'm 33 and I took my copy of the DVD and look forward to it.
