In my opinion, it is remarkable that the story of the bomb problem and its development was so few in the decades since the Manhattan project was completed. My suspicion is that this was due to the serious fears in the film and entertainment sector (from the 1950s to the 1970s) with McCarthyism and related national security phobias (including the Hollywood blacklist). In the 1950s (with Robert Taylor), there was one film about Colonel Paul Tibbits, who flew into Hiroshima bombardment with Enola Gay, but otherwise it was nothing else. A glimpse of the tragedy (US drowning Indianapolis soon after the bombs were handed over to Tinian) in Robert Shaw's description of JAWS survivors' attacks. But the real trials and misery of Grove, Oppenheimer and their team were not considered impossible. And then in 1989, two films appeared. I've already reviewed (DAY ONE), which I think is better than discussing the long technical and emotional and political problems of the Manhattan project. Brian Dennehy's acting as General Groves and David Strahairn as Oppenheimer was first-rate and nicely balanced. The small side signs that touch the Tyler (Michael Tucker) Crusade against the Bomb help to make the story well. <br /> <br /> This is a problem here. Paul Newman is a great actor (like Mr Dennehy), but Newman turned to Groves in a different way, though not as terrible as Dennehy's intelligent but soft military brass. Newman seems too dirty to see the gun as the biggest stick to other boys in the post-school yard. Yes, it certainly was, but the true Groves would have been more like Dennehy's mind in the future, but in creating this great toy. The performance of Dwight Schultz as Oppeheimer helps to maintain the film's most interesting and good production, assisted by Bonnie Bedelia. But the most interesting aspect of this film is the rebuilding of the two tragedies of Daghlian and Slotin, especially the latter, according to the character of John Cusack's Merriman. Inevitably, people are killed in all technological advances. It's just that the two tragedies (in addition to the tens of thousands that had disappeared in Hiroshima and Nagasaki) brought the threat of a new unrest, even in a so-called peaceful, controlled trial. Two tragedies (especially the slow, agonizing death of Louis Slotin due to radiation poisoning) showed how much is needed when using atomic energy - and how most likely options can cause disaster. The only really different thing I saw in Cusack's work (and in the script) and the actual case with Slotin was that Slotin actually took time after the accident to find out where all his associates were when they were exposed to radiation. accident (he was able to show that only he got the full effect of a random blast, so others would need only a relatively small treatment). Perhaps the complete story of Slotin's actions was too technical for the screen, but given that he had finally suffered, he had time to think about what he really was.
