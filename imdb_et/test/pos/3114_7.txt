George Cukor is and always is one of my favorites. His generation is a worshiped hero. No one mentions Cukor in the same breath as John Ford, Howard Hawks, William Wyler or Billy Wilder. From the sparkling comedies "The Philadelphia Story" "Adam's Rib" "Holiday" Psycho Melodramas "Gaslight" "Double Life" The Great Half-West "Heller in Pink Tights", not to mention "My Fair Lady" or "Travels with my Aunt" he did not let himself in front of the camera. I feel a certain tenderness that looks at the "rich and famous" flashing of the old masters as yet very evidence. For the first time, Candice Bergen gives us a glimpse of the wonderful comedian she was going to get. Jacqueline Bisset is a setback for Greer Garson and Loretta Young and Hart Bochner's days of bullying us, promising something remarkable that will eventually be realized in 1989 by Apartment Zero, Meg Ryan when Bergen's daughter is already Meg Ryan. Both tired and formula, it remains Cukor's film and what I'm one of Almodovar's favorite movies.
