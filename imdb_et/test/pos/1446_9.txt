Frank Sinatral is one of the best roles as a reformed heroin addict who returns to his Chicago district after extensive stay in the clinic. He's about to prevent drugs and find a job as a drummer, but he can't avoid getting his old friends out. He was arrested initially for no drug-related charges, but because he was caught in an illegal poker game. His poker skill has earned him the nickname "The Man with the Golden Arm" and the men who control this game, one of his former heroin connections, wants him to be back in business. Meanwhile, Frank has to take care of a woman he was injured in a car accident, Zosch (Eleanor Parker), and fills his old girlfriend Molly (Kim Novak). The film is great when we put us in the spiritual state of Sinatra. When he felt confident in the beginning of the film, I felt good for him. But if the authorized phone call does not come one day, he falls into depression and goes back. Later, when he finally listens, he comes out completely. His embarrassment, if he is unable to win, is devastating. She had such big dreams and other musicians didn't turn her attention out of the room. The film moves quickly and shows Frank's drug problem in a realistic light without becoming a social message. Participants are equally good. Elmer Bernstein's score is one of the best. The only thing I don't like about the film is the end. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Although I really like Zosch and Parker's character in the movie, they could have done a little more to fill their backplane. The end is a bit too pat. Although there are definitely stamens that remain after the film closes with characters, Zosch's death binds all the loose ends a little too properly. Frank is free to love Molly and she doesn't go to jail. His reseller is also dead, so at least the immediate danger has disappeared. Well, I think there is always a desire in Hollywood to tie up any clean little package. It is a little damaging to the movie, but as it is, it's still one of the best and adult movies about drug addiction that I mean. 9/10
