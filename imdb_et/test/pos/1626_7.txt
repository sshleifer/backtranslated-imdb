He hasn't read any Dan Brown books yet, but I looked at all of his film adaptations. I do not play the game to evaluate it with the previous factor, because the scope is not really the same: in fact it is a thriller, racing with a time full of puzzles. <br /> <br /> The plot is very complicated, imaginative and excellent: I've never been a big fan of Hanks, but it does well. I noticed his jeans (the one that had flowed with the blood) because I was looking for such a thing in vain! The Italian seeker is a brilliant newcomer to me, but I really praised Ewan MacGregor's portrayal: his inner faith and peace are really impressive. <br /> <br /> I really like the debate between science and religion. Vatican activity seemed like a holiday. Finally, I am not sure that it will help to add new converters to Christianity. Everyone with gold and human beings shows everyone what charity means and why women have left the church so much while they are half or more believers.
