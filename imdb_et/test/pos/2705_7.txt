This film was made fast enough after Karen passed that Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen felt a little guilty about how they could contribute to his health problems. Since years have passed (almost 25 accurate), it must be banned in some way more easily. Richard has spent many years, after Karen's death, remixed and compiled his recordings with him. She married her cousin Mary and what I read, she seems to be able to design her next generation Carpenters with her children. He seems to have regretted making this movie, and that may well be the reason why it is not available in any form. It seemed to me a fairly honest assessment of the tragically short life and incredible talent that Karen Carpenter had.
