This film strongly demonstrates the struggle of two beloved women in a culture that is so deeply rooted in ritual and tradition. All of this is in the background of India itself, which is for the same values ​​of freedom. This film is both political and personal and never too preaching or idealistic to either side. It's easy to understand why "fire" has caused unrest in India, but still tragic. A true film like this deserves to be seen by all the people in the world, not just the privileges.
