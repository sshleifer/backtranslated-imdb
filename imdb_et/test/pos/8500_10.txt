This type of example does not have to be on television. It is a type reserved for typical independence films. This should only be done by HBO. The fact is that Denis Leary has managed to come up with one of the best TV shows that easily connects SOPRANOS, OZ, ED, and more. Kudos is an ABC gang to show that NYPD Blue was not a fluke and Mr. Leary and his gang create a truly unique viewing experience. My only complaint is that the show is not long enough ... the hour would be better, but I can't wait for the next episode!
