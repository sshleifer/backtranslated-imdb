This is a film that deserves another picture - if you haven't seen it for a while or the first picture - if you were too young when it came out (1983). Based on the game of the same name, it is the story of an older actor who leads the Tours Shakespeare repertoire company in England during World War II. He is working on his stress to try to meet Shakespeare's problems every night, such as bombing theaters and a company of older or physically disabled participants - young, capable people into military service. Her relationship with different members of her company, especially her clothes, is also discussed. So far, everything sounds pretty boring, but nothing can be further from the truth. Although it is tragic, the story is talked about with a lot of humor and all the emotions are high. Both men took both Oscar candidates as the best actor and honor. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the human book, the theater - especially Shakespeare, or who has somehow worked backstage. The films on the back make another aspect of the film, which is exciting for most viewers.
