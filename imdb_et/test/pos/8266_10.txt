I've copied this video to a DVD so I can always enjoy it and make it a very successful (and rare) wedding! It's just a very wonderful adaptation of a very beloved novel. All this is perfect and is amazingly outdated. This old one always has the chance that it may appear a bit passionate with modern dramas, but "Precious Bane" is more than its own. Surprising Prudence and Young Clive Owen, who stab around as quiet Gideon Sarn. <br /> <br /> I try someone who would look at the final sequence without being very romantic. This is the perfect movie to watch when it's cold, and you've come across the couch. <br /> <br /> I can't really recommend it.
