I recently attended Sundance, as I have often done in the past, and was treated with small indian little pleasures, blind comedies, and now predictable portraits of dysfunction. But then I saw Mark and Michael Pool's "Northfork" and I remembered why I was so in love with movies first. "Northfork" wipes over the screen with visual impairments and ponderes the original beginning of Terence Malick's and Antonion's existential landscapes. This is an impossible film that is easily explained, one of its many strengths. Suffice it to say that it is an adult fairy tale with many carefully stratified levels of meaning. It restored my imagination and put the shadow of concealment on everyone else I saw this year. It is a careful finishing and complexity of writing that most American films don't see. I plan to watch this movie repeatedly when it comes to my neighbor visit. Because it is a buggy magic and mystery, a haunting work where you can get to know the Montana plains in search of angels and the nature of heaven and earth. The cast fills this luminous piece with a striking conviction, especially with James Woods and Nick Nolte, who remind us of nerves and bold career paths. Maybe "Northfork" helps us find a new American cinema wave, where cutting-edge crafts and writing become more common than the exception. See if this is your way and ask your friends many questions, and the thoughts and feelings that "Northfork" sees, awakens memories of a great movie that you have seen in the past, and now hopefully he can come back. Polish brothers.
