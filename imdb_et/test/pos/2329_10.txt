I love military comedies (Sgt. Bilko, Stripes, In The Army Now, Major Payne) and Down Periscope is fun, but also at heart. <br /> <br /> The Stingray SS-161 (USS Pampanito) was great. The work of art is absolutely beautiful. So it was a diesel engine, what? I found out that the USS Ranger, the carrier of the aircraft for Star Trek IV, was "normally powered", which could mean that Ranger was also diesel. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene: Pascal: Jesus, Buckman, it may have been in Korea! It may expire in 1966! Buckman: (takes your finger and tastes it) What's this thing, sir? It still tastes like creamy corn. <br /> <br /> Pascal: (Yelling) Except, it's bad! Buckman: That would be a problem. <br /> <br /> This is a story that may be tense, it seemed plausible. Winslow respected Dodge and seemed to care for him so he wanted to give Dodge a chance. He gave him a beaten but still seaworthy Balao sub-member and assigned him the task of using a diesel subgroup to avoid the nuclear navy and the attack on Charlston Harbor and Norfolk. The 2-star admiral Graham (with his third star on his eye and Dodge against him) was awarded a dirty team, hoping they would start to lose Dodge. Can Tom Dodge get the team up and work as a team and can he take the old, outdated sub-winning and best of the navy?
