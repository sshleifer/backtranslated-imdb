As a fan of Natalie Portman, I had to watch the movie. I liked it every minute. It plays very sincerely. Throughout the film, it seemed that Natalie was a mother and Susan was a mother. Susan's character was left to bad decisions and had to burn. <br /> <br /> I heard that Natalie and some sons (in love outside Providence) should have had a love scene, but Natalie only accepts the script when this scene was removed. And I think it's great. I think the scene of love would have destroyed the film's tone. <br /> <br /> Natalie must have a good skill in choosing good films because I have not seen her in a bad movie yet. So, every movie with Natalie Portman is definitely visible to me. <br /> <br /> Good movie. 7/10
