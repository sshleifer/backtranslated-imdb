Before that, the music videos were only played by the artist to display. Michael Jackson "Thriller" created a whole new part of music videos that can be honestly called minifilm. "Triller" follows a couple when they drive from the movie to the girl. On the way they come into contact with the zombies proclaimed by the immortal Vincent Price. My favorite thing is where the zombies step into a couple and the girl turns to see that Michael has become one of them. Then they do a little dance. The more frightening thing about "Thriller" can be that it is consistently more fun and enjoyable than many movies made. For twenty years it's the main music video. <br /> <br /> P.S. My Music Video Top 5: 5 - Madonna "Like a Prayer" 4 - Guns N 'Roses "Sweet Sweet of Mine" 3 - Nine inch nails "Closer" 2 - Peter Gabriel "Sledgehammer" 1 - Michael Jackson - "Thriller"
