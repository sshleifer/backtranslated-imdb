Here's another entertaining action movie by Clint Eastwood. I'm not his special fan, but I have to give him a hand: he knows how to make entertaining movies. This is another example. Nor did it hurt John Malkovich as his co-star. Now is an intense actor! This story is played by Malkovich, an assassin, and he is interesting to watch, thanks to his various disguises and terrible dialogue. He is also an interesting voice. <br /> <br /> Rene Russo is rather low (for him), but it's good and Eastwood plays a normal loner-cop role that his bosses don't recognize but shows them all in the end. I think he couldn't finish playing Dirty Harry-type figures, but he played them well. <br /> <br /> This movie, however, had some negative names: reliability in some, because the couple had a couple If it had been real, he would have killed Eastwood. There were too many holes in weather conditions in particular. There were too many abuses here because of the Lord's name. <br /> <br /> It's generally a good, convincing ticket price.
