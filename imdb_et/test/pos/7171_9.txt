This film was viewed on the seventh channel - Australian TV - today. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it was very interesting to see how the Nazis treated Russian Jews as brutally as anywhere else. Kellie Martin did a very good job and his tears and frustrations as "Frusia" were quite convincing. <br /> <br /> The Holocaust is part of our history, which we must not forget. Schindler's list was not the first - and it was not the last - this five-year nightmare survival and courage. My family is a Dutchman, and I always applaud all filmmakers who want to keep candle life alive, talking about someone's courage to stand and help those who have been abused, violated and murdered because they were "Jews".
