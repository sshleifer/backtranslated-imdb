Thank you for giving me the opportunity to be one of the first to actually watch the movie. It really grabs you. John Paul finally has the opportunity to see the light and make life for himself when he is connected to the apron lines of his mothers. <br /> <br /> I think these days there should be as many families (especially children who leave home from parents but I wouldn't say smarter), very sad parents who haven't really got their life and who do their own life poor. <br /> <br /> I think this movie should definitely have a wider audience. I would also say that other participants also played great parts. It's such a deep movie and very touching.
