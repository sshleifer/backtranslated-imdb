For all episodes of the series, it is closest to Roddenberry's original belief. According to the book "ATTENTION STAR TREK," he tells Roddenberry's writer's guide to his story writers that every alien, no matter how ugly, incredible, benevolent, or malicious, MUST keep some kind of humanity, so that watching the public can be accepted by the public and / or or related to it. The Devil In The Dark HORTA, which resembles something more or less than a large cattle dog, is the mother who protects her children, the spherical silicones that miners find in mines and destruction because they have no idea what they are! This is one of my absolute favorite episodes, if only that!
