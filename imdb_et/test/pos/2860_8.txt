Nurse Betty is a really interesting movie. I think we all know someone who is so convinced that the characters in the soap shop are real, that they can't be explained in any way that they are just actors and not real people. <br /> <br /> Sister Betty is not a sister at all. In real life, he is a regular housewife working in a canteen. He escapes his terrible husband and his unhappy life and has become a very dedicated fan of soap opera. After seeing his wife murdered, he goes to some sort of shock and loses reality. She thinks she is in love with one of the soap opera characters, a doctor, and decides she will visit her and start a family with her. But men think he knows too much and goes after him to kill. <br /> <br /> As I have already said, the subject is completely recognizable (if you leave professional men and murder out of it)) and the movie was funny. The story was well targeted and the actors did a good job. It was all I always wanted to see in comedy watching. I'll give it 7.5 / 10.
