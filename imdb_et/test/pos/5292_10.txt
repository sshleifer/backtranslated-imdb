Maybe not Miyazaki's best work, but I couldn't love it. A five-year-old boy finds what he thinks is a goldfish attached to a bottle. He saves his life and keeps it in the bucket as a pet, but it is really a magical creature, the daughter of a human wizard and a sea goddess. Ponyo, when the boy calls him, takes his father back to the sea, trying to return him back to the country and become human, but he gets into his magic elixirs and does what he wants to do. The story is simple and cute. When a movie really lives, it's a huge work of art. The drawings are more childish than any of Miyazaki's works, but the beauty is its simplicity. As with all of his films, Miyazaki creates that imagination world that I was so awe-inspiring. Seeing in the theater brought back memories of what was like when the requirements for opening the score of Jo Hisaishi's princess, Mononoke, washed me and gave me goosebumps just a little ten years ago (the score here is equally wonderful). I wanted to live in this world and never leave it.
