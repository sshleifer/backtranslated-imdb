Style over matter. But what is this style. "Cell" is the internal version of most serial movies. Sorry, the story does not support the visuals. <br /> <br /> Psychotherapist Catherine Deane (J-Lo) goes into her patients' dreams with artificial means to discover and help them come up with their phobias and obsession. The FBI draws attention to the new patient who fell into the coma. He is a sequential killer who sinks his female victims and then presents his body in grotesque scenarios, such as Mannequins. Deane has to enter the killer's mind and move through her sick fantasies to find and save her last victim. <br /> <br /> Director Tarsem Singh has incredible visions and pieces for this production. Every dream sequence is like a nightmare on the move, between landscapes and costumes. <br /> <br /> But the plot suffers from a lack of characters. Stargher is the only person with a thorough background and the last person you want to take care of. Without him, you basically have a film that only moves in the current tension, which is a shame because the film is both visually stunning and truly scary. Lopez is wasted, but he's not that amazing actor, though he's as proud as ever. And Vince Vaughn? I don't even know why he was chosen. It's not her forte and she's moving to launch. He tried to get too character and he showed. Stay in comedy, Vince! Even so, this film is so visually frightening, I'm still watching the movie with lights and never get to sleep.
