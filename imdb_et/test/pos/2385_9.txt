I am a Talent Manager. I've been around for 15 years. I've discovered some great talents. They have been in films, commercial lines, Braodway and television. I think Eddie Monroe was cast. I love to see the ability of real people. Not just a name. The actors in this film were very natural and plausible. This movie was very entertaining for me. I love the movie with a few twists. I also like the puzzle at the end of the movie. I would like to know what happened to the big amount of money. I would like to see this movie on the big screen. The video was really good. The New York landscape was New York, which I know. Be happy in 2006 and get this movie in awards.
