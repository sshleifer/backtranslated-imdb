NORTHFORK is first and foremost a masterpiece of widescreen art. This film alone is worth it. The harsh, wide open plains and green areas of East Montana are caught in autumn or early spring in hidden tones. The main character of the movie is the giant cement cement Fort Peck Dam. The film commented on a little as well as finely about ten Western landscapes. The dialogue can sometimes try, but the images and concepts are capable of raising the film. The period of the 1950s works so well and is performed so well. I think the passing years are kind to this movie.
