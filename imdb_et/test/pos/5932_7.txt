This royal rumbling was basically the wrestling of these lands. The trick and the picture are more popular than wrestling. <br /> <br /> HBK vs Edge. A pretty good match. A lot of warmth for Edge, who started to wear again, and what better way to match the game with HBK. It was a bit slower than usual. Generally, this game gets 6/10. Undertaker vs Hedinreich. Not a good game. Undertaker had to carry Hedinreich through this game, who seemed to be really lost and his moves turned. It was interesting to see Raws Gene Snitsky and a bit later Kane came into this game. In general, fans seemed more interested in ending the game. 2/10 Kurt Angle vs JBL vs Big Show. At first, this game was slow, but at the end it was pretty good when Angle was able to speed up the game. Kurt Angle made some very good wrestling and proves he is the best wrestler. The JBL and the Big Show put on a slow game. The end of this game was bad. Over this whole game was 5/10 due to Kurt Angle. Randy Orton vs HHH. Randy Orton had seen a surprising heat in this game. Randy proved that he could limit any top note. This competition also marked the first game that HHH has landed, where no one ran down and saved him. All this game was about 6/10. <br /> <br /> Royal Rumble Match was OK. Some surprises. Some not so good surprises. I was such that Kurt Angle didn't have enough time in this game. But throughout this race, the man I never thought was so quick. I'm not saying who wins. I'll give this game 8/10
