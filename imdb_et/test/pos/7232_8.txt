Once upon a time, Troma, the company that brought us the cinema classics, such as: Toxic Avenger, Rabid Grandmothers, Poultrygeist, Redneck Zombies, and Surf Nazis Black Die, decided long ago to adjust Shakespeare's famous "Romeo and Julia" game. This adaptation decided to build the story by adding kinky soles, extreme violence, genital monsters, body piercing and incest, and managed to create a strange but fun movie. Anyone who goes to Troma production should know what to expect, and this is an unfair and perverse comedy that has a lot of political injustice. Expect a lot of tricks against other Troma movies and lots of recyclable gags (cars and head scatter). Many may think that this seems to be the ultimate nonsense that only the Morons will find it funny ... they may be right, but at the same time you may need to ease and enjoy the madness and despair that Tromeo and Julia have. > <br /> With great pain, a funny script (James Gunn and Lloyd Kaufman), with a suitable soundtrack and plenty of great visual gags, Kaufman has again managed to turn what's right upside down and bounce hell out. for everyone. Get some popcorn, grab a beer, invite your friends and enjoy Tromeo and Juliet, which is Shakespeare's customization with lots of balls. End. <br /> <br /> 4/5
