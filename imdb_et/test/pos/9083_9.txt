From the beginning to the end, this film is excellent when it comes to group students who come together and literally kill each other, stopping their hearts and reviving themselves. It then examines what happens to the "near death" experience. As everyone undergoes this experience, they become worshiped with their deepest fears that seem to materialize. It extends from dead children who are hockey, to dead fathers who seem to be up. I'm not a big Keifer Sutherland fan, but even he does a good job. It's a movie I can watch over and over again!
