Flash Gordon is undoubtedly the best American serials. At the beginning of 1936, Universal was able to make such an entertaining story, and twenty years later, when I first looked at it, it looked at me in a great adventure and emotion. Buster Crabbe was a hero we always wanted to be in our childhood, and Jean Rogers, a beautiful girl we always dreamed of. Dragons were also dragons, octopus, monsters, gorillas. Charles Middleton was a great presence like Ming, Merciless. The true predecessor of George Lucas Starwars.
