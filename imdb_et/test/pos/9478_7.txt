At the beginning of the film, Cagney tells Johnny Cave's character and weight office that last year the owners of unscrupulous shops cheated American consumers for more money than a national war loan! Then he goes out and purchases for him a short sale of a particularly greasy green food, which is four ounces (oh, horror!) And one skinny chicken, which on his butcher's scale is quite generously proclaimed six pounds. , after which the fur - or in this case the feathers - flies. Er, fly. When a politician's clothing trap attempts to rob the exploration of the investigated bird workers' practices, our hero becomes a single wolf who uses the mass war on behalf of housewives throughout America. After all, four cents here and a quarter are there and before we know it, we have anarchy! The word of his reluctance will soon reach both the mayor's and the governor's offices, and Cagne will become a noticeable man. If it sounds stupid, it is not - dishonest retail practices are just a primer (or as Hitchcock would say, McGuffin) and an unknown, but it works here as well as any treasury representative or an G-man anthology that struggles against sham fraudsters, acting outside the common good of the State. Production standards are decisive for Class B, but this is Cagney, who makes this film a joy, because it was his first film about Warner Brothers after he asked for the court to release his unreasonable contract, and he seems to be lightly enjoying himself enormously - here performance is intelligent and splits with its unique energy and solid charisma. Mae Clarke's presence gives firm Warner a sense of all production. Supporting players turn to specific performances and the story moves wisely after a stone introduction that seems to be starting at three or four rolls, but sit back and enjoy it at Cagney's presentation and involving a capsule of depression that is.
