Here's another pleasant surprise. When I hear the reinstatement of the movie, I stab. Movies like Gone in Sixty Seconds and Jackal Day get remade and the results are smaller than the stars. So, when I heard that "Italian work" changed, I was expecting it to be bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I was able to calm down, read some comments and finally see the movie. and it was wrong. In this case, it's not original and predictable, but it's definitely fun. From start to finish, you have a very fun ride. Mini-related scenes are great and the characters themselves enjoy. <br /> <br /> So, even if there are some mistakes, will it take care of it as long as it is fun? <br /> <br /> Overall, 8 out of 10. The only lost points are perhaps some details and a lack of realism. But you have so much fun that you don't even have the chance to stop and announce.
