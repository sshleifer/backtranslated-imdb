The family is the best TV set. EVER. It has accomplished great things that no other animated sitcom or any other exhibition has even reached. <br /> <br /> For animated sitcoms, this should be called "Animated Sitcoms". because there are so many and almost every one of them is released from the DVD. There are some good ones (ie South Park, Futurama and Simpsons). Every animated sitcom has its own style / technician to create humor. For example, Futurama is funny because he comments or always acts on what just happened to humor. The Simpsons is also a great show because it uses the same Comedic technique and style that Futurama does, but Simpsons deserves credit because it was airborne before the Futurama and still remains in the air using the technique. South Park, in my opinion, is a funnier show next to Family Guy, because it uses clever confusion about vulgarity and stupidity as it is a technique for creating humor. <br /> <br /> But enough for other animated exhibitions. Let me tell you what makes Family Guy so funny. Family Guy uses a comic style that has never been used by any other show. It uses a technique whereby every joke can get after the setbacks. Not only does it make fun, it makes it more funny. It also moves very quickly. These two criteria make it the most fun on television. You have to see this example to believe it, but if you see it, you probably agree. (FYI, the two funniest moments in Family Guy were: 1) a 5-minute chicken fight under "Da Boom" and 2) Dick van Dyke under the "Holy Crap".) Also, I think the Family is a very modest show because other exhibitions create humor when they are familiar with their shticks / routines and characters, most of the family guy jokes are based on current events and pop culture stupidity. It also shows that the Family Guy is besides modest intelligence as it shows that the exhibition has an overview. And this technique is extremely effective because they link their pop culture references to the specific plot of an episode they find. <br /> <br /> The family can be enjoyed at any age, as younger children may not understand the references to pop culture, the fun, stupid characters, especially Peter. However, the show is a bit more vivid than the Simpsons and Futurama, but it's less vulgar than South Park. So, in terms of vulgarity, the family son would have been associated with the above examples in the middle, but that would be in terms of humor and intelligence of the 1st class !! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was last revoked not because it was not popular, but because FOX changed its time slot so no one knew when it was. Fortunately, we have a set of DVD boxes (which, by the way, sell like crazy) and talk about Cartoon Network Adult Swim at our disposal.
