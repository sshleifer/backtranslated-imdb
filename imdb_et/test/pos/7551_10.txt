FOUR FRIENDS were first presented in HBO 82 as a sleeping bag. After hearing the term "sleeping place" when I was 14, I wanted to see it. (!) Boy - I was surprised! This movie! I wasn't really in love with the non-special effects movie outside of SIERRA MADRE TREASURE - much less "hypipill" ... but I had grown up a couple of hippies - I understood Mr Penn's movie behind. FOUR FRIENDS are definitely unique. The script is so nice - and it's cast !!! Craig Wasson defines Danilo Prozor well! He just personalizes the "writer's type" path - both smart and clumsy (in the scene window ...) and strong, but very vulnerable. For me - he strikes what it would be so nice to last over ten years ... and I've always found the character - and in the movie. During the 80s FOUR FRIENDS was my partner as an offender - and I caught the movie whenever I could on HBO - even if I had to stay till 5:00! And still, always at the end - there is a loss of loss when all these wonderful characters are part of the spectators on the beach. Jodi Thelen personages "this girl" to the hilt - she hasn't felt so harsh. This movie is really a test of time. Every time I watch my video ... or show a friend ... and this STILL gets a strong reaction. I know women who absolutely fall in love with Georgia! So many levels ..! Just an incredible little 60-year-old mankind. Very special, very magical. Recently, I found Robert Grossbach's four friends NOVELIZATION - and it's even more detailed that film! Actual dates of events, etc. A real find! What's more - haha ​​- I found a novel when used a little, used in a bookstore ... Omaha, NE in all places !!! Guess you keep an eye on her! When I was 92 in L.A., who worked extra - I went to the ruddy lil in the memorabilia store - and the movie was TON !!! Unfortunately - I was broke and couldn't ... but boy, these photos from Georgia and the guys all went straight through me! I met with director Joe Sergant in SKYLARK with Emporia, KS 92 summer ... and we were talking about four friends - very cool! Also ... in the Omaha video store, a woman who was a relative of Jim Metzler was waiting for 98! He told him that he was saying that there was a child in Omaha who was simply fanatical about the film - and had completely got out of it. Again, the movie records everything in the heart of Danilo's character ... great, great work --- one of Tesich's and Penn's best efforts. Steve Tesich is seriously missed. An incredible writer.
