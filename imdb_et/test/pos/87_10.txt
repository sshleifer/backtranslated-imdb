It has been years since I have the privilege of seeing this movie on TV. I just wish I could see someone again. I married a man of three children and two had a fetal alcohol syndrome. I didn't know it, but seeing this movie helped me better understand my problems and how I can love them and help them overcome their difficulties. My step-son is now 35 and I thank the Lord for blissfully blossoming, but still much after the birth of an alcoholic mother. We talk about alcohol and drug addiction every month to Rehab patients, and this sharing has really changed the monumental changes in its behavior and is trying to start a new life that is not dependent on drugs and alcohol. Please let me know how I can get a VHS or DVD for this movie or when they show the movie again on TV. If you have not been in these shoes, you will probably never understand this value. Thank you very much.
