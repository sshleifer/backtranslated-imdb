I like Dylan Moran's work in Black Books, although I found that some of his billboards are really pampered by a long cluttered loophole ... but I was interested in seeing it in the movie starring and Michael Cainel and the curiosity got better. <br /> <br /> I was stunned. <br /> <br /> Dylan's vocal class and the film of different people he played in the film was absolutely perfect, more than just a stand-up comedian and really really parallel to alec guinness, John Hurt and other greats - really he was qualified with his imagination. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine was a very convincing prima donna and a standard British movie device with a hand-insignificant child to be too smart and busy - the only aspect I really disliked was Dolores and Dylani played by Cockney Gangsta Hard Man Incredible plot. Moreover, it was great. <br /> <br /> I also like the non-cop-out, where it ends happily, but MC got beating. Okay, it's not exactly your goolies and beijng disembowelled (which is what a real crime boss would do if you nicked Â£ 50k off them), but it showed at least a small dimension in reality story. /> <br /> I liked the movie, and would recommend it to anyone, but I would warn them not to turn off after 15 minutes because it started a little slow. If you shut it down, it will all come back. <br /> <br /> And with respect to the oath, they are in Ireland. This would not be otherwise.
