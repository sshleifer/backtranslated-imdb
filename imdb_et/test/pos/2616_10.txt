this episode is not contradictory as the other person said. the source agreed to help, because he did not have to hold his word when we pay attention ... he says if he (phoebe) agrees to stay there in hell, "CAN RID OF HER AND BALTHAZOR, so I DO NOT WORK IN FUTURE". .. and he did not let COLE WARN MAKE THINGS AS PHOEBE TO CHANGE QUESTIONS, that's why PRUE DIED because he hit harder than PIPER and head. and PHOEBE did not need to be invited to LEO this time, and in the past LEO WILL BE ALL THE HIGHEST. pay more attention next time! and after this episode there is no "CONTINUE ...". it is the end of the 3rd season, and in the 4th season they can't show anything about PRUE because it has its "PRUE" rights, so producers should pay for it. this is the last episode he is!
