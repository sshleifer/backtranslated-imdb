Who doesn't love the muppette?! It is impossible to watch them without any kind of warm, fuzzy feeling inside. So, I guess what's important is that this movie seemed very successful, making the muppet so special. I do not remember much of the plot details, but I remember the moments and characters of the film quite fondly. In fact, the whole film had a rather nostalgic atmosphere, but not in any way self-conscious. Refreshing for someone who may have been too caught in the details and techniques; "magic" crosses all other things. "What are really movies. <br /> <br /> So how does this movie do? Hmmm, nice question! Am I? Let's see. Really, I feel it's pretty easy. Filmmakers believe in their materials and not take yourself too seriously in this process I probably wouldn't say that the movie has a lot of really inspired moments, but it has a certain life (it is pretty much a lack of "real people" movies.) Strength You really want to believe in these funny people and their They also have a certain innocence against them, which makes them even more pampering. <br /> <br /> In general, I get the impression that the people who made the film are not afraid that they will try to feel the right time for them Such as a really accessible and enjoyable extended jazz session, a lot of talent, little predictability and a lot of warm people have come in. Of course, there were beautiful surprises. Maybe I don't feel I have much to say, because I was half asleep when I saw it (and / or when I write this review). Anyway, I'm half-repetitive here, but I really liked the fact that the film had a family feeling. I think you could say you're full of love. Again, the nostalgia feeling that many films cannot achieve as effectively or effortlessly remembers. <br /> <br /> And once again, one of the best charms of the movie is its very relaxed and friendly atmosphere. As Nathaniel Hawthorne cites happiness as (like) a butterfly, Muppet Movie succeeds in part if it doesn't seem to try it. Same as beauty is best discovered or untouched or compulsive or something like that. Anyway, if it sounds gentle, I think it was quite fun. <br /> <br /> So this movie was very funny, moving and hard not to smile. In addition, it offers great music! Highly recommended for all people, young and young.
