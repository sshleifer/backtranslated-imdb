What is the original work. I have always enjoyed the "actress" by Liev Schreiber, but now one has to evaluate on a multidimensional level. How did he get this sunflower? Whether it was computer-based, it seemed really real. And how do you hear the dog knowing that you will get this kind of activity? Does the academy have a category of animals? I think what I say is that I really enjoyed this peculiar, dirty, little indie movie. The great pain (one never knew that Eugene Hutz was not a pro actor) for the operator (some beautiful shots) of music (bought from the CD at the exit of the theater) and of course two "D" (direction and DOG). All in all, "10". <br /> <br /> /
