A good movie for horse enthusiasts and most others. This is a horse racing film, and it's a "little man gets his chance" movie, and it's "how far are you going?" Movie. Walter Mattau proves his adaptability again as an actor. He's just like Lloyd Bourdelle, Louisiana Cajun horse. This film gives you a rare look at the Lousiana Cajun horse racing competition. He has a young quarter of a horse who is the best chance to compete. "There was nothing but a gas station and a good horse." Bourdells use the opportunity to make it big when taking a horse, Shadow, to New Mexico, Mexico's Ruidoso, to get ready for the American-American future. But how far does Lloyd go to win fame and happiness? This film is also memorable with Lloyd's saliva-free tobacco juice scenes and is waiting for his truck to start.
