Really, this movie must be published on DVD. I just got a copy that I thought was a studio movie and I was completely happy !!! It was on my movie list because it was just cast. Three of my people, Michael York, Olivia Hussey. Both were in Rome and Julia and John Gielghud. Sorry for the bad spell, I was there that I thought it would be good for the small amount I spent. Boy, I was right. I'm not going to give it any, but you already know the story, but I just say, can you get a copy in any format ... Do it! . JPC
