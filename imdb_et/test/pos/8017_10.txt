Okay, so I love Aidan Quinn, even with a bad script. This is not the case with the task. As other viewers have said, it was a film that I stumbled upon the cable and got it so I didn't want to end it. Take one of the Cuban American Navy Ofc (Quinn) who is upright, a tough soldier and a family member. Add a crazy agent (Donald Sutherland) who looks for the most notorious terrorists in the world and adds Ben Kingsley and you have "Task". Sutherland is witnessing the most infamous terrorist Carlos activity at the caf√©, where he is a beautiful day when he is so deeply struck by the man's evil that his only reason to live is to get this man as long as he breathes. <br /> Take one soldier in Israel, who is this man's dead ring and kicks and keeps Kingsley until they realize they have a plan. When you take Carlos, being with him or being forever responsible for not helping him get rid of the world, he is doing a very difficult task and a mess. If he does not help in his own country, he is a tied man and his military duty to choose wisely. So the training begins. Let's say Carlos training is there with the Academy of Arts and the Holocaust. When I say the best of this intense and wonderfully cast, scripted and executed film rate, I am not underestimated. All three participants were able to save almost every script ... together, this is a movie that needs to be viewed from one frame of credit. I'm not terrorism or movies about it, but I got stuck! Bravo again to Aidan Quinn, who once plays hard, which can be held by any actor, including Gary Oldman. This is a compliment. Rent it and get a lot of popcorn. Oh, did I mention sex? It works better than "Last Tango!" And its education.
