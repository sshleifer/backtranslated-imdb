It's a Hollywood movie. The credentials of those involved are not revolutionary. This movie doesn't change the world. However, it is well done, well-drawn and well-functioning, which is a lot to read. <br /> <br /> This is a cat and mouse story about an unpleasant former CIA assassin who knows a spoiled seeker secretary who defended John F. Kennedy when Kennedy was killed in Dallas. The agent is understandably disturbed by this failure in his years in his career, and if the film lives in 1992 or certainly in modern America, then this surprising assassin Mitch Leary (John Malkovich with a stormy force) where he gives a transformative result) has been disappointed and angry and decides that he is going to kill the president. He thinks he has a common cause with Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood in his cool, peaceful, benevolent hesitation) whom he believes he should be scared as he does, because the Warren Commission, who accused Horrigan unfairly, believes Leary President Kennedy for murder. The tensions collide with some phone calls from Leary to Horrigan-Leary, who want to close Horrigan but not to betray their location and plans. <br /> <br /> Rene Russo is great because Lily Raines is a co-author with whom Horrigan develops adult relationships. It's nice to see a relationship between two equally competent peers (even if Russo is younger than Youngwood when filming). Russo is a calm, capable agent capable of driving in Horrigan's friendly torture. For Russia, this is a great part of allowing him to play the role of capable professional women and not just the romantic interest of the older man. Leadership, Wolfgang Peterson's competent direction, thoughtful use of music in parcel development, and excellent cinematography make this a movie I can watch again.
