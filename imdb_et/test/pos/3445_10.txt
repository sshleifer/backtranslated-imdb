This epic perfectly combines a talented cast and team, narrative depth that is better than many novels, great music, philosophy, and a link to LIFE, which I find difficult to explain. Die Zweite Heimat's diving for me is similar to a spiritual experience that is similar to honest when looking at the stars at night in the sky. The language and use of both color and monochrome segments increase dramatic effects. The film inspired me to go to Munich and visit some locations, including the Edgar Reitz office. Since then, I promised to improve my German skills - after Die Zweite Heimat I feel almost in German, as if I was head of the characters. I also try to match Henry Arnold's (Hermann) piano game, but that's one thing that won't always let me down! This drama is incomparable and I am fortunate to see it in BBC2 in the UK and SBS Australia. Sequel, Heimat 3, is now filming in Germany.
