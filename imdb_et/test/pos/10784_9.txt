WOW, a masterpiece of a movie that shouldn't be missed. <br /> <br /> I had no idea what this movie was like when I started watching it late at night. I didn't find it to be a stone film until the movie ended in IMDb. Looking at it, I was mesmerized. Cast, especially Eric Bogosian is just great. One of the best scripts and camera ever works ... The movie pulled me in and kept me entranced until the end ... huge budget movies with tons of activities and special effects created by your computer can be so incredibly boring. Don't miss this movie ...
