I first saw APOCALYPSE NOW in 1985 when it was first broadcast on British television. After seeing this masterpiece, I was shocked by the shock, and despite the fact that FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING likes similar competition, this film remains my favorite for almost 20 years after I first saw it. <br /> <br /> This leads to the problem of how I can even comment on a movie. I could congratulate the technical aspects, especially sound, editing and cinematography, but all others seem to have praised (rightly) those achievements in the high sky, as well as the performances generally, and especially Robert Duvall, and all others have mentioned it. Dou long bridge coarse pictures and boat upward after crossing the border <br /> <br /> How about a script? Francis Ford Coppolat is best known as a director, but he is an eternal screenwriter when he was a director, I said "was" in the past, because making this film seems to have burned all the creative brain cells with his head, but his victim was worth it. The John Milius original project has a script that is as crazy and annoying as on-screen, but Coppola's participation in the scenario has injected a narrative that accurately reflects the war. Check out how the scenario starts with any yingoist and macho by Bill Kilgore, who wouldn't have been in GREEN BERETS, but the more the story progresses, the more shocking and madly it becomes so much that the time reaches Kurtz's outpost, the audience watches the second movie similarly, the characters have traveled to other dimensions. When Coppola says, "This movie is not about Vietnam - it's Vietnam." What started as a patriotic war to defeat communist aggression in the mid-1960s, was the setting of the film (Manson's trial shows that it is 1970) has changed America's position both from the world and from the world and from the American worldview. It is APOCALYPSE NOW mad beauty , which turns it into a cinema master and says more about his working time of conflict with brutality and the hypocrisy of politicians (which you in the Vietnam War, Mr President?) than Michael Moore could count on in his lifetime. I haven't seen the version of REDUX, but looking at the original print that I didn't know, the story didn't touch anything that was just as easy as all the really great movies. In fact, the prerequisite may be for many other genres, such as the western part, where a military officer must watch and kill a renegade colonel, a leading war party or sci-fi film, where the UN assassin is a UN companion. soldier who guides Mars on the resistance movement, although this is probably Joseph Conrad's original novel <br /> <br /> My favorite movie all the time and it's very good that I chose this movie for my thousand views in IMDb
