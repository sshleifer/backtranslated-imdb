This movie must be as close as John Ford's film. The film is magic, a masterpiece, the reason Ford, well Ford. If you want to know why Ford was great, this explains it. <br /> <br /> Photography is, of course, excellent, black and white black and white should be wonderful, not over shoulder talk pure Ford, great moments, big and small. Ward Bond's famous ripped pants. Probably two dogs invaded and fought so that Ford wanted to use them in the fight, but instead of fighting with one dog, he ran away and the other attacked Ward Bond and hung up his pants causing Ford to end. The whole scene around the rope. Ben Johnson's way of burning strikes his rope, his excellent fortune-telling and the finals. Harry Carey's naive trial with Prudence. The usual Ford line about intimidating and not showing it. Bond's horse accidentally fell into her and left the movie. Johnson and Bond are fantastic in this scene. The Lord will help all Ford actors who are not on the camera even when the horse falls on you. like the leaders, not to mention the girls, how many times the cameras focus on Ben Johnson's rather pleasant back. <br /> <br /> Many old timers who got ranks and roles, Cliff Lyons, Frank McGrath. Some wonderful character studies mostly face staring, all the villains and main stars. A set of villains that rival any group in any west. <br /> <br /> Many many Fordian faces, groups, kids, women, little things, fans in the background (Ford looks like loving foal pictures), women aprons that allow wagons to cross the rivers and the camera at the moment. <br /> <br /> This is probably not western as the artist's picture that takes place in the West. <br /> Happy to have a movie made in 1950 because it is impossible to imagine that such a movie could ever be made again, but then it's a work of art that would be a sacred sanctity
