I read the reviews of this movie before watching it and did not expect much, but in the case of the B movie it is curiosity. I think you have to be the kind of person who enjoys this kind of thing, but I thought it was fantastic. People should only look at it because of the experience, because it is completely different. Don't expect that much. Action is bad, transitions obviously occurred on the computer, and so on. Definitely a B-film, but it's worth checking out. Very funny. Light gore and some questionable topics, so apparently there is nothing to show your Grani, but for a more adventurous viewer I would say it must be visible.
