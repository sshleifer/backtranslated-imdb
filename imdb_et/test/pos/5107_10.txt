During the Christmas of 1969 in London, the musical version of James Hilton's famous story was opened by critics. The same reception welcomed it when it was opened in the United States, inviting MGM to withdraw its "Roadshow" status and cutting almost all of its songs. What's wrong !!! <br /> <br /> Years later, when the trendy world of the '60s and' 70s has turned itself on, it is GOODBYE, MR.CHIPS, full of joy. First of all, Peter O'Toole gives one of his greatest performances. To see her hated, cold, emotional, Latin teacher at the boys' boarding school, the man who finally sees the colors of the world (after the music star Catherine Briskit falls and marries), can see the genius at work. (If you can, look back at LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, LION IN WINTER, MY FAVORITE YEAR and CHIPS for several days or weeks. Then you will see what a great actor O'Toole is and how great he is in CHIPS.) <Br / > <br /> Catherine, played by glowing Petula Clark at its height of popularity, is always a human dream; beautiful, loving, reasonable, with great voice. Most of the songs are beautiful and fit the story perfectly, while the later direction of Herbert Ross brings life to life. <br /> <br /> Okay, this movie may be too romantic for some people, but for those looking for a beautifully-acting, sung and directed love story no longer looks. (If you get a widescreen version of the laser beam, I'd rather be looking forward to the CHIPS debut on DVD.)
