Meatballs are a classic comedy with so many smiles that it's impossible to read. <br /> <br /> What was the only predecessor that was coming, the rules of Murray's screen, which can only be described as comical mastery. Tripper Harrison is one of the biggest comedy figures in the past 50 years. Squirrel all the time, wise, if she has to be, stern when she has to be, and taking care of it when she's fit, Murray infuses it with the eye of SNL. <br /> <br /> CIT's are just frightening because they are under the comic gene that is Mr. Murray. <br /> <br /> Summer is not summer without looking at meatballs. One of the best comedies ever to love the screen.
