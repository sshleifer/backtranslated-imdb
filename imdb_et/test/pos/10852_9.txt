I loved this movie. Not because there is a romantic story between women, but to visualize human power, despair, and liberation. This movie must be visible. Entertaining! Emotional! Exciting! All the characters are very well written and depicted by very talented actors. This story is a story of self-discovery and sexual awakening. Mind, body and soul journey. You will find yourself identifying the characters and even some points in the story. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I recommend watching the movie first, then reading the book. If you read the book first, you are a little disappointed. Scenario customization cut out a lot and some things changed. Some are better and some worst.
