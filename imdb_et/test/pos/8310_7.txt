The main criticism of the YEAR is that it is cheap, special effects are bad and so on and so on. Yes, some special effects are painfully bad, but what many people forget is that it's really quite fun, which is very important in my book. STAR WARS: They have the latest and greatest special effects created with the latest technological advances that are capable of producing great visual effects as far as imagination of a person can imagine. funeral. As Yoda would say, they're not fun! In other words, who cares about whether FX is the biggest if the movie's spirit is fast paced, humorous and clearly set. I love everything from the ground: the contrast between Stodgy Victorian England VS, which is Pellucidar's natural, colorful, colorful, characters, lost rural concept, telepathic Pterodactyls, human slaves, rebellious, Jubal ugly (lol!), Peter Cushing ( who is great!) and Doug McClure-inspired teaming, great music (this is really good), amazing Alan Hume filmmaking and last but not least, Caroline Munro. She's sexy in this movie. One of the sexiest B-movie babes ever hit on the screen. <br /> <br /> Seriously, anyone who doesn't like this movie doesn't know what's fun. Set at any point in time START STARTING WHAT IS ATTENTION! At least it has Caroline Munro, which no CGI fx ever can.
