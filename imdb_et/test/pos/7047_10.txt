I saw this movie in the mid-80s and thought it was a funny movie. As I am older, I watch this movie for a variety of reasons. I like to look at it when I feel sad / nostalgic for my "lost youth". I was a teenager when I released this movie (14) so ​​I can identify with many of the same problems / dilemmas that the campers / CITs have. I like to see the clothes worn at this time and hear the same old urban innovations as they said overnight on a canoe trip. The film is also full of funny liners. I recommend this movie to anyone who was a teenager in the late 1970s to the early 80s.
