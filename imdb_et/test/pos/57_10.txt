I gave this movie to my rare 10 star. <br /> <br /> When I first started seeing it, and realized that it wasn't a hard-core movie, I almost turned it off. I'm very happy that I didn't. <br /> <br /> This is a character-like movie, a real story that revolves around Rachel's "Nanny" Crosby, a strong, beautiful (inside and out) life. A black woman and how she touched the lives of so many people in the Lackawanna community. <br /> <br /> Not only is the strong character of the babysitter and the people living in the boarding house very interesting, but it also gives us the look and feel of the life and community of African Americans in the 1950s before the good and bad aspects of integration and segregation. how it ultimately affected and changed the black community. <br /> <br /> In addition to great performances, all cast members are a fine song and dance of this era.
