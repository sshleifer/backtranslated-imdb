For the record, the 1949 version of "The Blue Lagoon" is not the original film, as many have said. <br /> <br /> This story was filmed in Britain in 1923, right after the novel. As far as I would like to see the 1949 version, I would thoroughly enjoy the opportunity to see the true original extract of this film. <br /> <br /> The 1980 film, Christopher Atkins, Brooke Shields, and two young people were filmed with beautiful cinematography. Action did not look like this film for the first time, but after a couple of times watching it ... it turns out that two children who grow up on the island without adult guidance would really be a simplified way of approaching life .... is it in their language, appearance or daily activities . <br /> <br /> Although some have been happy to look at the 1949 blue lagoon, I can't help but know if there is anyone living who remembers the release of this story for the film in 1923.
