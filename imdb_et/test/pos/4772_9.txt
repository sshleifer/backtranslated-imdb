SPOILERS <br /> <br /> As you know, I have commented on many silent short films in recent months. Now, I have no idea why I comment on Steamboat Willie, I think I just want to comment on something so I looked at it and now I comment on it. This or, of course, one of the first cartoons and I believe it is not the first sound art. <br /> <br /> Here's a drawing. Mickey Mouse rides the steamer when Pete throws him down and drives it. When they stopped, Minnie Mouse tried to try but failed. Mickey gets him up by the crane. Then the goat eats his piece of paper with Turkey on its side. They use goats to make this song. When I say I think they used goat Victrolana. Mickey plays a list of songs for instruments on the steamer. Then Mickey and Mickey are angry at Pete's potato room and are forced to peel the potatoes for the rest of the day. <br /> <br /> In general, this is another groundbreaking silent short film. This is the third Mickey Mouse comic. Yes, third. It is also not the first sound comic. I believe there were two more before that. In both cases, this film is really groundbreaking. Mikcey was also more violent than she was mowing. I mean, he throws a potato on the bird and maybe he's killed it cruelly. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br /> Featured Movies: Plane Crazy.
