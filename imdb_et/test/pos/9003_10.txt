First of all, I don't know much about rugby, so even though I found the rugby aspect of this movie interesting, it could have been a sport and I think I would have enjoyed it as much. The fact that it's like rugby didn't make me better or worse. <br /> <br /> What made this movie great is the story based on the Highland Rugby Club in the last 30 years. Coach Gelwix is ​​a coach that every parent wants their children to be cared for more than sports (although they have won 17 national championships and lost over 9 games over 30 years!). The more I have learned about the coach and the team, the more I like this film and its message. <br /> <br /> I have seen other sports movies that seemed big at first, but then I only looked at the details to find that most of these films were 10% and 90% fiction, with 10% of the facts exaggerated. Not so with Forever Strong. It may sound too good to be true, but it is so amazing. If it were a fiction, it would be just a pleasant story and more. Instead, the film is inspiring and makes you want to be a better person. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie because of some negative criticism from a professional critic. I've read some of these reviews and most of them have given the movie terrible comments. These are, in general, the same critics who are hauling films that most people hate. In fact, I would be worried if some of these critics would have approved the film because I almost disagree with their opinions. <br /> <br /> Go look at this movie and post your rating (positive or negative)! Currently, most of the audience's comments are enthusiastically positive (here and on Rotten Tomatoes and similar sites) and I am interested in whether this trend continues. Thank you!
