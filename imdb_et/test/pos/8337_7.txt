... Our grandfather's hour. <br /> <br /> More than gangsters, this is a detailed depiction of the American family of 1930: Dad, proud of his work, who is worried about his son who gave up high school, his mother everybody wants, a daughter who forgets at dinner your squeezing hands, and twins who are absolutely loved ("Don't go to bed, please!"). <br /> <br /> And there's a grandfather playing the Yankee doodle on his flute. Have you noticed that this voice plays the same role as Doris Day 'Que Sera Sera' Hitchcock 'Man Who Knew Too Much' (1956)? And there is this grandfather who is finally the family's most brave person. As old as he doesn't even tell you his age, but he's proud of his country and is in conflict with the hateful blackmail of the gangster. <br /> <br /> Wellman's good movie.
