Last night I saw A PECK ON THE CHEEK (with English subtitles). Oddly enough, it was 137 minutes long - a little longer than the time listed in IMDb. <br /> <br /> First of all, I found myself losing interest in this film because the rather confusing style of the movies lost me. There was no context what happened, and I'm glad I stayed with it. At first, the young married married and soon after the wedding breaks out in his homeland in Sri Lanka and lovers are separated. A month later, she is a very pregnant and refugee ship to India. In the Refugee Center, you see a woman who is going to give birth - after that the movie's headlines will finally appear. <br /> <br /> The entire focus of the movie changes completely - to a young girl who is about nineteenth, in Madras, India. You see her in her home and she talks to the camera about her life and family. It doesn't seem to be interesting or important, and you don't know what's gone - how about the woman who had given birth? My wife and I were discussing it and finally we thought this little girl was the child of a woman in the first part of the movie. Somehow, he was accepted and talked about his life with mom and dad # 2 - although he didn't know that these people were not his biological parents. they themselves are idiots (one of the complaints I had about the film) because they decided to tell this very girl about the truth about their parents and say it in a way that was emotionally twisted and confused. Despite the stupid decision and talking to her in the worst way, the parents supported it by agreeing to help her find her biological mother. Seeing that it all affected the girl and the parents (especially the adoptive parent), it was impressive to look and definitely create my interest. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Sri Lanka has been involved in a very, very long and cruel civil war with Tamil fighters for three decades. The family's decision to look back at her mother in Sri Lanka was really noble, but sometimes a little stupid - because they took so many risks and almost killed over and over again just jumping blindly into the middle of the war! It was all exciting and enchanting, but I also continued to admire the peace of mind of the adoptive parents - first tell him that he is not your biological child and now you take him in the middle of a war zone !!! Of course, the boy wanted to meet his biological mother, but it was really silly in the back. If that were me, I could have been tempted to pay the unemployed actress to play and fool the boy, avoiding the war in the middle! <br /> <br /> Despite their complaints, the movie was nice to watch and was very rewarding. Far from being perfect, it strikes an emotional civil war. Also, while I was expecting it because I have seen several Indian films, many Western peoples are a little surprised by the lively songs that seem to have come out when it is the IS standard in most Indian films, including Bollywood films. (Bombay) and Tamilwood / Kollywood (Madras).
