East Lupino is trapped in his own home with Robert Ryan, "Beware, my lovely", the 1952 film from RKO. Lupino and Ryan made three films and worked well as a team, being both perfect professionals and strong performers. In this movie, based on Broadway's "Man", Lupino is the first world war that rents space in his home. She is very active and well-liked in her community and although her husband has been dead for two years, she is not ready to move on. The man who rents his room goes on vacation and Lupino hires Robert Ryan to help him with some heavy cleaning in the house. He is friendly enough to start, but later scares him, locks him in the house and doesn't allow him to answer the phone or the door because he grows violently and without touching reality. <br /> <br /> The character played by Ryan is shown at the beginning of the movie when he discovers the body in another house where he works. It is not clear whether he is a killer because he sees a surprised body to see. He may be a split personality because when his personality turns to Lupino, he seems to have no memory of his actions when he gets out of it. He does not know that he has the keys of the Lupino house in his pocket and does not know why he has tickets for the party he bought from the small children who came to the door. <br /> <br /> "Cautious, My Lovely," is a very suspenseful movie, and both leaders give terrible performances. The voltage stays at a very high level and ends in a way you don't expect.
