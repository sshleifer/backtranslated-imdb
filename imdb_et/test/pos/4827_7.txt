May contain spoiler !!! In no way does this film change the form of this movie of fear. Not long shooting. Nonetheless, it gives a horrible atmosphere, incredible signs and gore. <br /> <br /> The story is simple and barely free when it needs it. At the beginning of the 1900s a number of children were killed in a mining accident. Since then, they have lurked and killed their sleepy little PA city living in the mountains. <br /> <br /> Simple: They want a revenge man who caused their death years and years ago. Of course, her big, big, big grandchild in town and she's a real prick. <br /> <br /> Together with her husband, her mother and her two daughters inherit after her husband's death. The oldest daughter is rebellious, unpleasant ... typical teen. The younger is curious, with a bright eye and goes to the ghost for children. <br /> <br /> The most tremendous part of this tremble is the emotionality of the children, and they will be the victim of their victim. Great action. It was so horrible! I mean, corn jokes are one thing ... but it went beyond any of them (like horrible kids). <br /> <br /> Care. I bought it before I saw it and I was not unhappy. But I'm through and through the horror fan.
