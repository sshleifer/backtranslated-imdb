An erotic big league baseball player is forced to continue his career in Japan, he claims to have a foreign culture, probably a humorless leader, an attractive Japanese woman and his own professional and social insecurity. There's some exquisite charm that flows through Tom Sellec's performances. There's humor, sometimes softly underestimated, as in this movie, sometimes strikes like "People!", But always seems to have a higher goal. Throw yourself a full of doubts about fighting your own personal hardship, holding fast the "right thing", and you will get the movie both funny and thoughtful. Cast is matched like a championship team, and even if you didn't cast or film awards for your efforts, they leave the viewers well (and maybe it's the best results). You want to watch this movie more than once and every time Mr. Baseball hits home.
