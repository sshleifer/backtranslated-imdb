OK, so this movie is not very well known and was not very well publicized. I discovered that this rather brutal gangster went into good movie due to an accident in one of Skyss' millions of movie channels late on some eternal evenings, but I'm glad the opening sequence of this movie is fantastically comic in a very dark form. It actually makes me think the overall tone of the film. The critics and the filmmaker who actually saw this movie have been a little unfair just to write it down in a lower budget gangster movie reservoir. This is an indisputable similarity between Thursday and another genre of crime genre that has been compared but fairly, I think this film takes a much darker comic picture for this type of film and the end result is an attractive, well-made, funny, if not entirely original film. Jane is good at this point and is worthy of what she will hopefully thank her for the scammer is realistic, funny and just cold enough to think that Casey was a bad ass before reforming. This is another thing that makes this film stand out for me. Attention! smooth, charismatic, but very cold driver (Nick), a triggering happy blood-loving sexually predatory female (Dallas) and a psychotic mountain with brains against torture (Billy Hill). never seen on screen, nicely played by Mickey Rourke, and you have a recipe ... well on Thursday really. It's sometimes dark comic, sometimes brutal, sometimes unoriginal, but always enticing and worth watching.8 / 10
