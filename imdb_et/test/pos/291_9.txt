This is a classic war movie. One of the best, sharp images of flashing lights, harrowing dark backgrounds and rechargeable fans of the helicopter. Martin Sheen is a mercenary who was sent under the river to murder a general, erroneous, sadistic dictator who was unbelievably played by great Marlon Brando. There's also Robert Duvall as the top DI who wants "morning in the morning" or at least the smell. Dennis Hopper is a sharp photojournalist whose view of war and his leader is inclined. Also in this amazing movie you will see and come stars like Laurence Fishburne, R. Lee Ermey, Sam Bottoms, Albert Hall and watch Harrison for Ford ... <br /> <br /> The lens is Francis Ford Coppolla, who offers a movie there may be more intensity and drama than the acclaimed godfather movies, he brings out the war in the most basic form, which is usually something you can't see, you can only feel the boat carrying up the river, the feeling of war tension is quite intolerable. The feeling is rather claustrophobic and makes the viewers unusual. Frankly, movies have never felt like that. <br /> <br /> Criticism is hard to find. The biggest rating is that Brando earned tons of money for ten minutes, but it is fairly unreasonable. It was a well-earned money, a role that physically restricted him while being a bad person, and the role he actually did. I can't see this role better. And if you get the Apocalypse Now Redux version, there's a big guy out there, and I think Redux will make the movie miles better. <br /> <br /> The final impression is that if you are lucky enough to get the Redux version then you will be blessed with a totally satisfying movie that has cooled down for 49 minutes. If not, you will not be disappointed, this film is at the best level and deserves great recognition and a firm place as one of the 50 most important films ...
