A really scary movie. The whole story of the fucking teacher James Kunstler led me to recently formed blogs such as Life After Oil Crash (LATOC), Energy Bulletin and The Oil Drum, and Hubberti's peak theory. Like this film, LATOC and Kunstler paint a gloomy picture dead or upside down. I hope they are premature, but in mid-2005, petrol prices, rising oil prices, Chevron's willingness to join us in the campaign, when BP is moving beyond oil and even T Boone Pickens testifies to the idea of ​​being top-notch for oil production. A thorough study of limited data, oil investment banker Matt Simmons has said Saudi Arabia may no longer leverage its massive but aging-related output. Saudi Arabia has not responded to higher demand (mainly from the US and China), despite previous assurances. Global production in 2000 and 2004 shows that light, sweet crude oil has indeed reached higher levels. that is, refining becomes more expensive. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be aimed at the baby boom generations, but younger people, our children, must also understand the future effects of energy loss.
