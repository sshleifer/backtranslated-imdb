I caught the end of the footprint of the flick tape I was with the film I really wanted to see again. When I saw Raquel Welch's name in the opening offers, I decided to look at it. It was actually a little entertaining and brought me back to the back of the machines that the Hollywood films pulled out in the sixties are much the same as the current Austin Powers. Oh, the operation wasn't great or the plot, but it was worth watching. There was a nice landscape, even though Mrs Welch was the most pleasant. Record it when you get the opportunity and watch it if you have nothing else to do. It's not a snoozer, but it doesn't have to be moving in the corridor anymore.
