I watched this movie at the first show that was available in my area, and it was quite clear that most people didn't get the movie. Even if you don't, it's a good movie with an interesting character. It is a profoundly human story of some very imperfect people in the southern city, and it really talks about blues. If you don't know what "Black Snake Moan" is when you leave the theater, you didn't get it. And no. It's not just a song. Christina Ricci does a good job and is convincing in her role as Samuel L Jackson. I think it's her best result since her role in Pulp Fiction and probably her best, including her character in BSM. The rest are sure, a couple of brilliant performances here and there, especially John Cothran Jr. as Rendl RL, I'm a very selective film observer, and this film honestly appreciates its favorites because it's an honest look at the race. sex, religion and neurosis in the south of rural areas with his cinematography, in my opinion.
