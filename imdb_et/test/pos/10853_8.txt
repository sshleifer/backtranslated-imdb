Velveti Tipping (2002) (TV) directed by Geoffrey Sax on BBC television. The main plot is an aging story for the protagonist Nan Astley, well played by Rachael Stirling. Noorana works for Nan in her family business. Everyone is waiting for him to stay home, to marry a suitable husband and live a family life. Nan is also waiting for it. <br /> <br /> Everything changes when Nan meets Kitty Butler (Keeley Hawes) with a beautiful and talented performer who dresses men's clothes and captures the hearts of their audience. The audience includes Nan, who is sexually minded by Kitty in a way she hasn't attracted her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> The remainder of the movie is followed by Nan, London and his structures (sort of) and his downs (terrible) as a lesbian and sometimes male man. As is typical of the BBC, every role plays no matter how small it is, a great actor. The BBC has deep and wide-ranging performers that are truly wonderful. None of the supporting actors in my mind distinguishes me - they were equally good. Both Stirling and Hawes are wonderful and their action carries the film. <br /> <br /> It is always a sad thing to remember how difficult a life can be for a person who does not fit the mold of society for what is normal. I know that lesbians are not easy even today in the US. Imagine the obstacles of the love and happiness of the lesbian lesbians in England. We have come a long way, but we still have a long way to go.
