I love this movie. I saw it for the first time about 10 hours ago and I had to roll it back so my sister could see it. This movie is so funny. There are two times that I laughed so hard that my parties hurt. I didn't expect the movie so funny; I just wanted to see it because Laura Fraser is in it. I saw him for the first time in Titus, which is also a fantastic movie. <br /> <br /> As other reviewers have said, too many people are waiting for a deep moving movie. You don't get it. What you get is humor, eye candy, and the opportunity to ask yourself exactly what your perfect companion would look like if you could create them. You can also ask what would be the opposite sex. <br /> <br /> The fun series includes Justine himself as a naked man. I was cracked. <br /> <br /> I swear that this movie is the most imaginative teen movie I've ever seen, and that's my favorite now. <br /> <br /> Remember why the movies were originally created; entertainment is not a philosophy. Remember this and you have a great time looking at Virtual Sexuality.
