In 1983, the phenomenon seemed strange; two competing Bondi films. "Octopussy", starred by Roger Moore, was part of the official Cubby Broccoli Bond franchise. The "Never Say Never Again" compiled by the competing manufacturer is besides the terrible "Casino Royale" - the only Bond film not included in this franchise. Its great attraction was that he brought back the original Bondi, Sean Connery; its title derived from Connery's comment after "Diamonds Are Forever" that he would never play a role again. Some have complained that Connery was too old at the age of 53, but she was actually three years younger than her successor, Moore, who did not just make "Octopussy" the same year, but made another Bond movie, "The Slay to Kill", Two years later. <br /> <br /> The film owes its existence to Ian Fleming's film rights. Perhaps it is regrettable that the terms of the agreement contained a clause that the new film must be a "Thunderball" remake, because it was not perhaps the biggest of Connery bonds. ("Dr No" or "Goldfinger" may have worked better). The plot is much the same as in the previous film; The terrorist organization SPECTER, who works with the megalomanic Tycoon named Largo, has stolen two American nuclear warheads and is trying to keep the world's governments ransomed, threatening to explode if they don't get big money. Of course, Bond will fall to save the world from missing missiles. <br /> <br /> The film is lucky to have not only one, but two of the most beautiful Bond girls, Barbara Carrera as seductive but deadly Fatima Blush and Kim Basinger as Largo's girlfriend Domino, who is carrying Bonda after her knowing the lovers' evil plans. Several Bond films have a plot that hangs on the hero's ability to win a villain mistress or female accomplice - there are similar developments like "Goldfinger", "Live and Let Die" and "The Living Daylights". In the official series, Bond's ally is usually considered to be a female leader, but here is Carrera, who plays villainess, over Basinger, who was a relatively unknown actor at that time. Of course, Basinger has become one of Hollywood's biggest stars, while Carrera is one of many Bond girls who have somewhat faded views. <br /> <br /> Blofeld Effective, SPECTER Chair, but Klaus Maria Brandauer seemed too stupid and frightening as Largo, except perhaps during the Domination game, was a more complicated option for those violent computer games such as Space Invaders, which were so popular in the eighties at the beginning. Brandauer can be a great actor in his mother tongue, in films like "Mephisto" and "Oberst Redl", but he doesn't come so explicitly in English. <br /> <br /> One of the qualities of a movie is that it follows both the standard Bond formula and sometimes it differs from it. There is a standard plot of danger to the world, sequences of chase, a series of exotic places, glamorous women, an unfortunate villain and a specially written song based on the title of the film. However, there is no extended pre-credit sequence and we see some familiar signs in a new light. For example, Bond boss M becomes a nervous, supernatural aristocrat, his American colleague Felix Leiter is shown in black only once, and scientist Q depicts Alec McCowen as a frustrated claw (despite his inherently higher class Christian name) of Algernon) is clearly a work-class accent. Also, Rowan Atkinson's fun rumor is a British diplomat. Although Connery was probably not quite as good as he was in his earlier films, it makes this one of the most memorable bonds the sound of the changes made in the familiar theme. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Stupid. According to Rowan Atkinson's character, he is Nassau at the British Embassy. However, as the Bahamas is a country of the Commonwealth, there is a high commission in Britain, not an embassy.
