At first they didn't like how the director constantly changed from the past (gulliver tours) to the present day (gulliver of crazy shelters). But it's really the best way to film the story, though it was used to it. Danson is remarkable because the title character and the fox are going to make a wonderful villain. The worst part is mary steenburgen as a woman of gulliver. He has never been proud of Hollywood, and for some reason they seem straightforward in this film. I will never understand why the directors will smile if it adds something to the story! Plus you want to strangle her because she's so fucking stupid when she believes the wrong sons, Bates, tell her. Even his son sees the bastard. Still a good show and I appreciate it B +.
