No blood, no sex (though it is fluttering), no special effects, but just one of those pearls that come across on your movie screen when you're not really looking and grabbing your attention. <br /> <br /> Great actors, big sets, great music, beautiful storyline. If there are many more such films, <br /> <br /> Sets move us through time and make us feel like we were there. <br /> <br /> Looks like a real life and raises us to the level of awareness of the "babysitter" whom no one has lost, at least all of his own "halfway" house dwellers. <br /> <br /> It is the real story of misfits that learn to "fit". I was somewhat jealous of the good times everyone appeared in the movie! Can we all spend time in Nanny's house?
