I thought this movie was good, I loved the plot, I loved to shoot scenes, except some, they weren't needed and I also enjoyed the character, she was a rider who liked it. I have to say that in this gangster movie, the actors were chosen well, because sometimes some participants just don't fit. But even though I hate to say it, but I hated it, I felt it should have gone in another direction. It would also have been a little more detail, based on a real story, but there were so many facts that were left out, but not that it was good. When you enjoy movies in the past, you enjoy this movie.
