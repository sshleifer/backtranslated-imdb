Oceans 12 <br /> <br /> 'If you steal fifty million dollars, they will find you.' (Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber, Die Hard) <br /> <br /> This sequence will definitely sound at this stage. Terry Benedict has been told that Danny Ocean and his companions were the ones who hung him and now he wants it back. The ocean gang needs a lot of money and speed, but can't work in countries where Benedict is impossible for them. So it's outside of Europe to make kidnappings, trying to avoid the Catherine Zeta Jones super policeman, the old flame of Rusty (Pitt) past. <br /> <br /> The first strike in Amsterdam reveals that those on their wheels were "Night Fox," a legend of a superb power. He gives them a challenge that can either deduct their debt in full or hedge a Uma Thurman-Kill Bill II-buried alive. Interesting? Well. Slow? In some sense. Entertaining? Mostly. Necessary character development scenes? Much. The ocean and its cheerful band are charismatic, if nothing else, and because it is a sequel and we are all old friends, we see many more "odd" situations and conversations. Too much. Damon Linus is more nervous than before; the cousins ​​are tempted, as we knew they would be; Bernie Mac speaks too much and Don Cheadle's cock-special accent is as bad as ever (I like Cheadle but couldn't hold it). Pitt and Clooney talk like old friends, filling each other's glasses and reading each other's thoughts. But what worked so well in the last film was the lack of character development compared to how the whole fucking op. And as far as these actors work well, Zeta Jones fits into this movie like a big square dense 11-sided hole. He just doesn't fit and his chemistry with Pitt is nonexistent. <br /> <br /> The stars of this movie for me, however, were Vincent Cassel as night and Soderbergh's choice of places. Cassel plays bump and riches as if he were both born. His nightly fox is lofty, with "terribly other people's lives" (Danny Ocean) and a completely opposite ocean gang. This is where I think the film loses its way. Cassel and European locations are too realistic contrasts with American actors and the first film style. We want slippery, drunk and fast; not sharp, weighted, and intellectual. This is where the film doesn't work. <br /> <br /> If you can't repeat the same formula at a time, but moving left or right will do more harm than what is in the mainstream movie. .
