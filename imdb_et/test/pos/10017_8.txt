I went to "Hunted Night" without knowing what to expect. I was really impressed. <br /> <br /> This is basically a mystery / thriller where the girl who doesn't remember anything "saved" the man who happens to the past. These two quickly become friends and lovers, and together they try to understand what is happening to him. Through some vague setbacks and events, they finally reach its bottom and the end is pretty cool. where there are many gray skies and tall buildings. Very big city. Groovy soundtrack and lots of nudity. It was surprising in 1980; it seems somewhat ahead of its time. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 kids.
