Let me start by saying that if you expect exquisite humor, you're in the wrong theater. It has a low angle and hard hitting. But he doesn't want to knock his funny bone. He has a rod and he pulled his head. But don't be afraid. Movies are going, it's a rather gentle education. Oh, it's hard, but once again, Mike's judge, not Fred Rogers. <br /> <br /> Was this film an 'intellectual democracy'? F *** no. Gem, the essence of Mike Judge, is that he has the ability to laugh people. Beavis and Butthead were the most popular among teenage boys, just the ones who have fun forever. <br /> <br /> With this in mind, I do not believe that the humor of this movie is directed to the super intelligent. Maybe you are too smart to get it. But he doesn't want you. He's trying your middle Joe. And he has a message: take your action and for God's sake, study the botany! It's a bit separate and the narrator will be a little irritating after a while, but again this movie is for people who need a lot of narration ;-) It's funny. It has a message that he wants to make sure we all understand. <br /> <br /> I ask Luke Wilson to choose 100-IQ as a man. Sometimes he is unable to play his character level (what he has got, like 104?). In lightly forced times. <br /> <br /> Kudos at Dax Shepard in this. I remember him in Zathuri and thought, "These guys look like an idiot." In this film he makes a great idiot. Maybe I'm psychic. <br /> <br /> It took some time for Maya Rudolph to warm up, but I gave her some freedom. After all, he had to play a straight man across the planet. But when he got a little screen time, he made a firm contribution. <br /> <br /> Terry Crews played the same psychotic, aggressive character he played many times before, but he still does a first-rate president. Another bonus is that the place was virtually empty. When I was reading my girlfriend and I, there were literally six people in the theater. We could have had a grill cake and mariachi band. So there is no annoying person, as seems to be the usual "talk-age of TV". <br /> <br /> All in all, it is a good prerequisite and competent delivery, given the intended purpose. Lots of laughs over the sprinkles. <br /> <br /> What made this movie scary was that when we left the theater, it was like a movie still playing. We saw a lot of idiots directly around the people we could see from the dose they received in the theater .... <br /> <br /> They are all pods, all!
