Women's Movie? Of course. How many times .... Predictable? Yes ... worth a look? You wish! I was pleased with the images of Sarandon and Portman, which are otherwise in the familiar story line of the stock characters. I am a big fan of mother / daughter stories. What makes the difference between good and weak is performance and character development. Although it is not the best in this genre, I buy it and look at it again. I felt the characters were believing and the actor was better.
