"It all depends on how you look at it? We are either heaven or half-hell," says priest Rev. Harlan "Northforkis". The Polish Brothers film is ambitious, which makes all intelligent viewers sit when they have the patience and basic knowledge of Christianity. The layers of entertainment the film offers, the viewer looks beyond the surreal and absurd picture that is obvious with less obvious socio-political and theological commentary that should provoke an American who contemplates current social values. Receiving a movie from surreal (coffins that emerge from the depths of man-made lakes to swim and disrupt living homes that almost "cross" their feet on the wooden floor of their home, angels who need to read several glasses, etc.) and absurd images (half-life, half Toys that are alive, doorbells that make the harp the most sensitive to the musical output, the blind angel who writes unreadable cues, etc.) can make the viewer unfamiliar with the surreal and absurd literary and artistic traditions thinking of what film is for entertainment. Although European film has more credentials in this area, Hollywood is in the past the "Cat Ballou", Lee Marvin and his horse tilted against the wall to fast for a few years ago. "Northfork", a place for outbound citizens, seemed to pay tribute to the "Citizen Kane" line of cars, taking Kane and his wife off as a picnic. <br /> <br /> Film is a difficult, most interesting epilogue (one of the best I remember) for a sophisticated or impatient filmmaker to hear at the end of the credit. Directors seem to leave the best moments for those who can end up with the film. If you have the patience, you will enjoy the film layers if you pull or swallow what Poland is bothering about, then you will miss it with many tastes. <br /> <br /> What is a movie? ? On the most obvious layer, the city is freed to build a dam and hydroelectric power plant. Even cemeteries are excavated so that mortal remains of the dead can be taken to higher burial sites. Real estate advocates suffer from the lakeside features of more than 6 people who can drive out of urban areas. Of the 6, it seems that only one has a conscience and therefore it is possible to order chicken content while others cannot get them. <br /> <br /> On the next layer you will have the citizens of Christianity and its interaction with the city. Most of them are godly Christians, but in many, instincts lie to survive at the expense of true Christian principles, such as the priest. Many want to accept the adoption of children without meeting the responsibilities associated with such activities. You realize that the world of an unknown angel who keeps a comic book about Hercules and his mother's dreams finds one androgenic angel called "Flower Hercules". While the filmmaker gives hints that Flower is an extension of the shameful imagination of a young angel, the following Flower activities will not do this. You are indeed in the world of angels - not in the gods, but in the pure spirit and therefore not in the world of the living world. The softer focus of the camera in these frames is proof. <br /> <br /> On the second layer, Irwin's toy block is a real plane that carries him and his angels into the sky 1,000 miles from Norfolk. <br /> The final layer is a social comment? "The country is divided into two types of people. Fords people and Chevy people." Are there any differences? They think they are different, but both are consuming. <br /> <br /> Religion says "Pray and You Can" (Fr Harlan's words quoted by Angel Flower Hercules). The film tells the consumer that "what we do with our wings that separate us" (all 6 evictors have wings, one duck / goose feathered in their hats, but their activities often differ from angelic, as suggested by various reactions to the car scratches). <br /> <br /> Film is definitely not the best American movie, but it is definitely a remarkable distance - a great visual, amazing performance (especially Nick Nolte) and a loaded script that offers a variety of entertainment levels to a mature audience.
