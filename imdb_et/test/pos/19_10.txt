This is one of my three favorite movies of all time. My only mistake is that director Peter Yates had too many cuts showing the actors individually, not together as the scene, but the performances were so big that I forgive him. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are absolutely wonderful; brilliant. The script is great, giving a very good picture of life in the theater during World War II (and what it was in the 1930s). A lot of great, fine touches, lots of broad-based strokes, all over, it's all done. The scene after the scene just blows me off and then the heartbeat tip.
