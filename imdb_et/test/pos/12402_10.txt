I just looked at the BORN BAD DVD version and found it to be tense, sharp and far too graphic to make the heart weak. Justin Walker (Clueless) and Corey Feldman turn to higher performances. For a low budget movie, this picture offers. Depth of character and intelligent dialogue are two things usually not seen by Roger Corman. Watch this on DVD!
