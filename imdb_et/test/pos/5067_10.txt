To solve a difficult problem, you need to start by asking the right questions. Without them, even the largest collection of information is useless. This film does just that - if other films control your thinking on the board, this film will draw your emotions and understanding of justice and what is allowed. These questions will drag you all the time, challenging your assumptions when the characters evolve. This movie is important. It is relevant and must be seen by anyone who is up to date with current events. The fact that it is very entertaining and includes movie stars only improves performance. My advice: Check it out for a serious crowd or better, yourself, not the way you read your favorite magazine magazine. In this case, there is one difference: the answers are for you.
