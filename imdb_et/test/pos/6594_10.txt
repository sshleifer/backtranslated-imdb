Filming more than a documentary on a skateboard does not recognize many important aspects of Dogtown. Peralta (a well-known skateboarding figure herself) has produced a film that not only discusses what we now know about skateboarding, but also explores the socio-cultural and economic circumstances in which this sport developed and widely attracted. In addition, his film is quite personal: the primary link between Peralta and this cultural phenomenon is both an informed cinematographer and an involved participant. In this role, he is the main "participant-observer", gathering at the same time a wide range of personalities who were an integral part of this movement, and those who were deeply influenced by roller skating as a competitive sport and subculture. The film uses a unique style of film and sound editing, and the story (Sean Penn) and interviews have a fairly incomprehensible form, similar to an anarchic, nihilistic walkway. The film has a long-term kinetic attractiveness for sports and music video, which is the sensitivity of the archaeologist to the importance of time, place and circumstances.
