Compared to the competition, the soul of the calibur 3 games is a god - a real work of art. However, compared to its 128-bit predecessors, the last namcos is a better slash em up series - its attempts to improve perfection are not quite successful. <br /> <br /> I praise the fact that I try to raise the series to new heights, but they just make things harder. Examples? Well, character creation mode is theoretically a great idea, but in reality it is full of constraints and is not adjustable, like in wwe games. The chronicle of the sword regime is somewhat fun and meaningful provocative, but eventually drags and feels like a clean up to earn money, not a truly fun game. It also seems that the story of the soul mode, which is basically an arcade mode with small unreasonable stories and shenmue-style QTR bits, seems slow. <br /> <br /> "OMG !!! YoU SaYiNg" is probably the more you think, but you can't twist it - I don't hate this game - this game is great! Its still got this classic game (though some characters have changed), absolutely stunning graphics and this epic soundtrack which games are known for. And on the good side of things, there are new characters (especially zasalamel), all of which are cool in their own way (except for Setsuka-yes, I know I'm nitpicking). <br /> <br /> It's just that comparing the soul to caliber 1 and 2 seems to be trying to be much more than it really is. This does not mean that it is not classic, but it means that it will be a bit short compared to its high standards, despite the fact that more characters are moving in stages and better graphics than ever before. <br /> <br /> Still, soul calibur 3 sweeps the floor out of 95% of the games - and it counts! Oh, and all those who say "helpful" to this review feel painful that I insulted my precious stuff. Listen well fanboy / girl: SHE Only REAL! And even if he had been, he would not have caught you.
