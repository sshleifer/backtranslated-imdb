Francis Ford Coppola "Apocalypse Now" is not a Vietnam war movie. Don't mix it with one. It is set at the back of the war, but it is a metaphorical exposition of the worsening of the war on the human psyche. It is also one of the most remarkable films ever made, produced or even created (another ring for the Lord's trilogy. To name this masterpiece is an ambitious underestimation of the film production level.) <br /> <br /> The scene that plays "End" as hallucinates of Martin Sheen's captain Benjamin L. Willard on images of helicopters and napalm, is the essence of the plot in the first 15 minutes: Willard's mission is to "end ... with extreme prejudice" Colonel Kurtz Kurdz is a misleading columnist, who is now worshiped by a large number of followers, \ t who has duplicated him. The operati seems somewhat better managed than the actual fight, but the trip he Intending to take is a personal search that challenges the limits of his human behavior. <br /> <br /> Joining a team with a small crew, rickety on a river river river. On the way, Willard teaches himself in all Kurtz things. During Sheen's oily voice, he described his thoughts on the abundance of material he had read. Kurtz was a highly decorated and respected green Beret. He was a normal man with his family until some of him was left in the horror of human cruelty, and he drove along the road that Willard was driving. Going into the jungle is characterized by a mesmerizing aura that repeats battles that are not taken far. In the end, their senses are attacked by the experiences of groups such as drugs and individuals. But Willard seems to be disappointed and unrecognizable in finding Kurtz. When he reads this mythical figure, he is directed to the man's power and why he has received what he has received. We know that Willard's slow decay is parallel to Kurtz's. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando has been honored for decades. His presence: unmatchable. Her genius: indisputable. But for those who are not familiar with their ability to act and their physical nuances, Brandot can feel uncompromised in the eyes of the film visitor. He's definitely not. Brando was hard to work with, difficult to interpret and impossible to understand, but his talent for incomprehensible beads and incomparable monologues is undeniable. The man probably knew what he was doing, even if we didn't. His colonel Kurtz is the essence of unrestrained disillusionment and continuity. <br /> <br /> When the movie is any reference to hell travel, Francis Ford Coppola's real experience in making this masterpiece is the one man's real life account. a fanatical struggle to create a movie. It has been reported that, according to the film's schedule for the 200-day photography, Coppola considered suicide. The film was not only an indisputable fight; this is a tough movie to watch. Coppola's sweat and blood penetrate through the pores of the steaming local inhabitants and his dedication filters through Martin Sheen's haunted soldier Willard openings. <br /> <br /> I can't help but feel warm nostalgia for this type of movie. . At the dawn of all the original and unprecedented films, both disputed and stimulated films were common. Audacity aside, Apocalypse Now is a pure film. My respect and admiration for Mr Coppola is in the highest order. But I despair of return, which has become the norm for today's film standards: lack of innovation. It's not just a common name in the cinema world; this is the fact that no one seems to care to tell the story anymore or to tell them with heart. But we still have great, like Coppola's masterpiece, a film that swam the ability to give us something deeper than what we could understand. <br /> <br /> This depth of Apocalypse is now a step into madness. Slaughter can be disturbing. The loss of innocence may be lost. But it is damage internally; countless pictures that irritate, irritate and remove us from our daily lives and memories that cover our deeper thoughts that ultimately separate us from humanity and force us into instinctive, wild and animal life. If the idea of ​​killing does not provide livelihood, the killing operation gives people the basic catharsis.
