It was a movie that made ya think. Some parts a little cheesy, some parts pretty good. The thickening of the plot at times and just when you thought Angella (Sandra) found a friend whom a friend was deceiving or dead. I have to say that DENNIS MILLER should have been in the whole movie. His character was the best, very refreshing after Angella went through. He would have raised me and Angella through the mines.
