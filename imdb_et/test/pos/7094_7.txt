One real thing rises above its potentially toxic material to give us an overview of the family of complicated relationships and the inadequate, real people. It opens with Rene Zeleweger, who is discussing her mother's death with a district commissioner; to save us from "cheap" movies and cheap movies. It looks at the family system, where everyone plays with a set of unexplored rules and uses the mother's cancer to show what happens when all the rules change. <br /> <br /> William Hurt as Independent Father and Meryl Streep as Suzy's Mother at Home are both excellent; the nuance and not what they seem to be. Zeleweger persists, frustrates and surprises himself. Tom Everett Scott doesn't have much to do, but he does it well. <br /> <br /> The story is predictable and takes at least one bad stroke that it doesn't have to take, but performances and the view of the family as a place where anger and love are equally blended make it valuable.
