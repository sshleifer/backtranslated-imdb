Motorama viewers should already eagerly make other successful b-class desert films such as Baghdad Cafe or Repo Man (which is more or less in the desert). It also shows some odd humor (and especially the eccentric footprint) of the writer Joseph Minion's "After hours" comedy. Gus (well played by Jordan Christopher Michael), an expensive 10-year-old boy who arrives at his piggy bank, steals Mustang and has a metaphor of fantasy, temptation and redemption in the desert. . It starts as a journey through salvation (visible to John Diehl), but when he is involved in ridiculous games called Motorama, he easily becomes tempted and loses his childish innocence. He goes from one madly imagined state to another opportunity to get Motorama cards from participating gas stations, just to find out the award-winning MOTORAMA and get a $ 500 million cash prize. Along, he's armed with dozens of strange characters like Flea, who plays high tight busboy, Meatloaf who plays crazy biker and Mary Woronov and Sandy Baron (Seinfeld regular) as two violent robbers. <br /> <br /> Reclaiming a DVD can be very deceptive, as well as previous attempts to sell this film to a non-cultural market first by taglines that compare it to Home Alone and Thelma & Louise. The newest, calling this story of love, that is, the movie is from Jordan on Michael Christopher's adventure to meet his dream girl, which, despite the size of the picture on the DVD cover, is actually just 1 second of Drew Barrymore as a fantasy girl whom Gus dreams about. Why didn't they just market it? Probably this may seem completely odd at first sight, it is actually a well-designed narrative. <br /> <br /> Motorama is an excellent material for fans of strange b-class comedies. This was a rather interesting story, and especially because of the strength of the leading actor - Jordan Michael Christopher (who unfortunately has some other screen credits) and a plot-wise metaphor. Hopefully DVD recovery will make it easier for cult fans.
