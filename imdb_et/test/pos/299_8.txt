This is the film that puts people in the classical - Apocalypse Now, now re-cut, renewed, Redux 22 years after its initial release. <br /> <br /> The film is based on Conrad's heart Darkness, the main plot (if there is one) is Captain Willard's trip with a naval ship through a Vietnam conflict on how to stop a rogue colonel. (Colonel Kurtz) We see the characters and the situations he is facing, and he tells the story of the colonel along the way. <br /> <br /> My initial feel for the film is that it is not very engaging, especially early, but at least a good comedy dose is put in the form of a surf fanatic column, Kilgore. As the movie progresses, Willard's reading has built up a lot of tension made on various reports from colleague Kurtz to the end when everything comes together and the film's atmosphere reaches an incredible level and keeps it at an amazing level and keeps it until the Normal aspects of every human being with decent film is looking for a good standard. Cinematography is particularly exceptional, and I found that the performances of Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall and Frederic Forrest deserve special attention. The score I found originally sounded, but when the movie progressed ... I'm not sure if it really improved, or if it was better, or when it just grew up with me, but finally a movie that I enjoyed. <br /> <br /> This is the second time I saw the Redux version (I've seen the original about four times). I say now that I saw it for the first time I was disappointed. I was expecting a "classic" movie with a lot of war. The fact that Willard got the mission at the beginning of the film and did not finish it, was boring because all the character interaction in such a way that the film is IS seemed unnecessary. This is due to the fact that the plot is not fully defined (as the focus is more on nature and travel than on the plot), in most cases a second look is needed to fully evaluate the film (like all films that are more character-based than plot) Like the second time, you know where the plot goes. I had a similar experience with this wonderful life, which is now one of my favorite films. <br /> <br /> With four large Vietnamese films, Apocalypse Now wins the rest of the atmosphere, but has no activity and involvement from the Platoon, The Deer Hunter's emotional intensity and can't really be compared to Full Metal Jacket (probably my four favorites) ). Apocalypse Now is a great job, especially at the end where it becomes incredible, and it is recommended for anyone who enjoys a good character-based film and doesn't mind some casual violence.
