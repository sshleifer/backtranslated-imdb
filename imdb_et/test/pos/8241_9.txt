A really good Australian movie. The look and feel of Sydney is beautifully created, as it was in the 1950s. This movie made me very impressed when I first saw it at the time of my first movie release and it is still very good. Phil Noyce-led work, wonderful camera work, thoughtful lighting and some fine performances all over the table. Absolute "Black It" for any 70's Australian cinema students. One out of the box!
