It must be admitted that Harold Lloyd's best work ended with his last great silent comedy "Speedy" in 1928. After that he moves into sound films (like Chaplin and Keaton and Laurel & Hardy and WC fields) and does better than Keaton, but not the other three. Chaplin was rich enough to make his films as a producer (but he watched his films, so there were five years between productions). Laurel & Hardy was protected by Hal Roach, so their short and sound production standards were pretty good. Fields worked first with Mack Sennett as with Paramount, and then freelancers. Lloyd tried the Chaplin route, but less successfully. <br /> <br /> He produced his own films, but unlike Chaplin he doesn't own a studio. His first two choices were also not good (especially "first legs"). But he started to choose wisely and "Movie Crazy", "Cat's-Paw" and "The Milky Way" were all good choices. These three (and perhaps "Harold Diddlebock" sins) were his best sounds. They are all entertaining, but none of them are "Safety Last", "The Freshman", "The Kid Brother" or "Speedy". <br /> <br /> Of the four best soundtracks, "Cat's Foot" is the most controversial. Ezekiel's Cobb's solution to liberate a city that chooses its mayor is very extreme for the 2005 season. Or is it? The film is dictated by the policy: "Cat's paw" since 1934. The second year of Roosevelt's New Deale (especially the controversial involvement of the heavier government) saw a movie like "Gabriel White House" and "The Phantom President" where our leaders made unconstitutional measures to liberate the inner enemy (and force disarmament around the world). Even Cecil B. De Mille got into this "This Day and Age", where a number of teenagers use rats to force the gangster to admit their crimes. <br /> <br /> For us, the use of violence is forcing someone (even a bunch of goons and boodlers like Alan Dinehart's gang) to admit that it is repugnant. After all, the Supreme Court has defended us for the resurrection. We forget that the reforms we are thinking about will not happen until the Warren Court and the Burger Court have done so. For example, while justice in Sutherland's opinion in Powell ("Scottsboro Boys") in the 1932 case guaranteed every defendant's right to a lawyer, Gideon v. Wainwright did not extend it to a judge who paid accused lawyers until 1962. Miranda Case, now known as the Self-Injury Warning, has been around since 1963. Nothing like that was considered necessary in 1934. <br /> <br /> When you study other movies from 1954 (and even until 1960), tricks are used to get confessions - Kirk Douglas admits his crimes to witnesses during "I Walk Alone" while Burt Lancaster keeps him weapon. When Lancaster leaves, Douglas contests that he confesses the confession but sees the gun down. He suddenly realizes that (legally - in 1948) he has admitted that he is not terrible. You hate to say this, to all civilians who read this remark, but what Cobb / Lloyd does to Dinehart and his friends when he signed up for "Cat's paw" was not only legal, but would have led to their imprisonment in 1934. it can be called heavy, fascist or frightening, but it would have been legitimate.
