A warning to potential viewers of this experimental film: The nature and effects of images are such that it is one of those films that should really be seen on a film that is projected. The pixelation created by digital transmissions absorbs a lot of depth and already adds a lot of noise to the abstract and grainy film. But because this movie is not quite accessible in any format, I think you have to do what you can. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a great artistic endeavor for the man who finally gives us a vampire shadow. It is the formation of the elements of the dark and dirty film (insofar as I can read the names of the characters) through a frightening and surreal process. It is a very good example of what is called the art of absolutism, a stylistic approach that tries to mean visceral meaning more than thematic. <br /> <br /> And the visceral describes it. There are not many things technically happening in the movie, but the emotional level you pass through is innumerable. The very repetition of some images creates a spirited party. Sound editing and scoring are particularly impeccable and make the images incredibly good. <br /> <br /> The fans of this movie would do well to watch the collections of short films distributed through other cinema DVDs, II and III. Such films make me increasingly confident that the real horror is in abstract, absurd and non-narrative terms, as in the horrific preaching of ghosts and ax-heroes. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
