Assy McGee is an example that you really have a certain age to evaluate. Otherwise, it is likely that you are missing references to the 80's police films and just think it is a running anus about walking. Think it is pointless, childhood humor? Go see Stallone's movie "Cobra" and see what I mean. In fact, this show has a very subtle sense of humor, which says a lot about both the adult swimming show and the walk. <br /> <br /> All common genre clicks are in place, making films like Dirt Harry and Cobra so big and mature. Sanchez is an Assy partner who is flat by genre and constantly apologizes for killing his partner. The police chief is, of course, a hard-working firefighter who lives yelling "I want your sign on my table first tomorrow morning!" The global, and sometimes totally pointless, way in which the 1980's Renegade Cop film is parallel, works well. For example, if you rob a bus robber, one of the criminals stops to ask Assy, "Hey, where are you going, asshole!?" To which the title character clicks with a one-liner: "I'm going to shoot you." <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended for anyone who loves 80's action films and has actually seen enough to understand humor.
