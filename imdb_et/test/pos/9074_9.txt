Five Medical Students (Kevin Bacon, David Labraccio; William Baldwin, Dr. Joe Hurley; Oliver Platt, Randy Steckle; Julia Roberts, Dr. Rachel Mannus; Kiefer Sutherland, Nelson) for enlightenment. The heart of each medical student is stopped one by one and restored. <br /> <br /> In times of temporary death, everyone has strange visions, including forgotten childhood memories. Their setbacks are like nightmares for children. The revived students are disturbed by remembering the unfortunate acts they had committed or opposed to. When they experience life after life, they bring real life experiences back to today. As the experiments continue, their memories intensify; so much, some are physically overrun. So they study and transcend the post-mortal experiences that seek to find a cure. <br /> <br /> Although the DVD was released in 2007, it was released in 1990. Thus, Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin, Julia Roberts & Kiefer Sutherland were in the early stages of their adult actor career. In addition to the extraordinarily intriguing plot, the dense climax of the dense building and the script are tense and convincing, all the young actors "Flatliners", which are now the perfect cult-half-sci-fi stop. Who knew 17 years ago that the career of this young actor group would start to rise? I suspect that Director Joel Schumacher did it.
