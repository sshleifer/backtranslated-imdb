Alex Benedict (John Cassavetes) is an orchestra conductor who has a secret matter with his pianist. If he threatens to expose him and create a scandal if he does not leave his wife, he sees that he has no choice but to kill him and see that he has committed suicide. Too bad is our terrible detective, colleague Columbo (Peter Falk). <br /> <br /> Stephen Bochco has written another sharp episode for this series, following admirable details. We'll see that the offender has committed his murder and set his alibi for about twenty-five minutes, and we're completely at fault. When Columbo appears on the scene, it gets even better. <br /> <br /> First we see Columbo after the murder (as usual). This time he's with his new dog with a vet. Comic relief scenes alone are the weakest in the show (I think Columbo's discomfort is "Suitable for framing" for the model). Columbo is cheerful when he deliberately kicks or worships his career; but too many writers make a mistake by showing it a ridiculous light when it comes to non-suspects. In contrast, Bochco Columbo shows a little uncomfortable and a handful of scanty scenes with his new pet, which is a funny and artificially integrated story. (And I'm grateful that he didn't make the effort of Columbo to give the dog a name. As far as we learn, the dog will not be named.) He is a particularly good monologue, where he expresses the belief that anyone can kill himself, much less the brilliant and beautiful young pianist. And he's even better off playing his scenes with the cat-mouse Cassavets. It is expected that these two long-time friends and associates will play each other perfectly; and that's what we get. Note how Alex Benedict can't help but admire the deceptively-tuned Columbo, even if the brilliant detective tightens the noise around the neck. <br /> <br /> Bochco uses the best of every situation in your script. If Columbo questions Benedict's propulsion mechanic, of course? of course! ? he asks the man to look at his beaten pile. And if Benedict finds that Columbo is in the Hollywood bowl before trying, of course? of course! ? he is on the piano "Chopsticks". And what should our cruel lieutenant bring along, but the victim's typewriter with a fake suicide note that is still in roll. <br /> <br /> Columbos also has good scenes with an uneven little girl (Dawn Frame) and a lovely Blythe Danner who plays Cassavets' wife. It is nice to see that Myrna Loy appears to be Dann's mother, although she does little to her small role. <br /> <br /> Director Nicholas Colasanto (who also acted as a "Cheers" coach) does a completely reliable job, although he follows the leadership of almost every other "Columbo" driver, adding one or two foolish blooms. Scenes end, focusing and focusing. Then there is a little where Cassavets sees the carnation that he fell into the scene of the crime? and we see the zoom in the sunglasses. Myrna Loy also has one scene and a group of old fogs, all of which have been hostile, except Cassavets. <br /> <br /> These are quizzes, however. This is a great fun episode that made me a "Columbo" fan.
