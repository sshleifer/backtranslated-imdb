I can't read the order I watched, and although it's different from the story in the book, the mood is still the same. The fact that two such diverse people give each other over tests and years is immortal. And that female prisoner element was the real event that happened to real people. The story is about the nature of ordinary people, the people who just tried to survive a terrible time in their lives. And it also showed Australia in real mode. The country is like all countries, regions that everyone loves, weird areas and abandoned areas. But it gives Shute a step in transforming Jean from a low backstage into a family community.
