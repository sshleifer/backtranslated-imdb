this is one of my favorite films! With casablanca and cannibal holocaust, it is an almost perfect cinema. rex allen tells this wonderful story about a tree that just needs some love. Includes activities, adventure, intercourse, comedy and riverbed chaos! SEE THIS MOVIE WHEN YOU ARE TAKING TO DO! you can't find a better cat picture somewhere where the "space cat" arrives not as close as the other. charlie's performance is great. even includes cruelty and intense logging of animals! You need to love Disney for all moral failures!
