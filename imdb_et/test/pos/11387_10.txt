Sometimes I watched a video by Paul Thomas Anderson in which he expressed great interest in having porn movies and how this industry could have produced better movies and, consequently, a complete genre, and not just in videotape. Paul Thomas Anderson put his beliefs in the porn industry in an amazing way with Burt Reynolds. His name is Jack Horner, a director whose biggest dream is to make a "real" movie that can keep the viewer from a dramatic story and at the same time beautiful beauty. and "big cocks and tits". Soon, when he meets Eddie Adams (Mark Walhberg), he believes he has found a new star for his films. And so is the story of the young Eddie of the porn industry. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a walk in the nightclub, where we see all the people who are part of Eddie's life and later see them outside the porn industry, living their daily routine. But soon we will see them in the porn industry, and after only one party, the story of Eddie begins, the story of Dirk Diggler. All of them taste real success with Dirk as the main character, winning many awards and helping Jack make his biggest dream of a new character from Brock Landers. This exploitation film is an amazing success and Jack is his first "real" movie. But here is the beginning of the end and the beginning of the "terrible 80's" when it comes to $ ex, DRUGS and Rock & Roll Dirk and palettes. But we all know that superfluous people can destroy all individuals and erectile dysfunction can destroy all porn stars, and here the film focuses on its life after its full success and how everyone has a real bad time with lots of problems with the bad eyes of society for the porn industry and many excessive periods. In Dirk's decadence, after catching the music industry and failing, there is a brilliant sequence that can continue perfectly as things go to Dirk and his friends. This sequence is one of his first drugs, the appearance of Alfred Molina, which ends with complete confusion. It's funny for us and a terrible experience for Dirk and pals, but there is always a solution when you get back what you know and when Dirk is back, Brock is back. <br /> <br /> Well I did not mention most of the characters in the summary, but I have to say that everything is amazingly well developed. The cast is just great because I have Mark Walhberg's best show. Julianne Moore has a strong movement in a truly moving character; Reilly, Macy, Hoffman, Heather Graham, Guzman, etc. are just memorable, all their characters funny and sad. <br /> <br /> Finally, I love Anderson's amazing cinematic style with a unique view of the porn industry of the early 1970s and 80s. I said "Magnolia" was my Anderson's favorite, but right now, after watching everyone except "Sidney", I can't say I have a favorite because I love them all! <br /> <br /> PS: Somewhere I read that movie is Anderson's "Scorsese movie", so I'm more confident that if you love "Goodfellas" and "Casino" you will love it too. I love the love of "Boogie Nights"!
