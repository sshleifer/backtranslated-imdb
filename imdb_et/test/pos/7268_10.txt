I am surprised that I have a real affection for it because I am not an action and adventure lover. But hey ... it's wrong with Robert Carlyle's movie. I have read a number of poor or moderate comments about this film, drawing it on the development of this timeless or unlikely scheme, but no one seems to mention a rather intriguing transition of character that characterizes how hardened, sub-on-his-luck (Carlyle) becomes quite as a noble, self-conscious hero, and how a real boy, the cowards (Miller) develop a real taste of the road man's life when he "gets that feeling." Plunkett & Macleane is a fast-paced and very enjoyable cinematic artwork filled with a lot of bad-boy humor, rich scenes (especially the use of the former apothacary Plunkett fireworks) and a charming eclectic musical score. It's definitely worth the time to watch CLIMAX SCENE ALONE! Shoot 'em up, guys!
