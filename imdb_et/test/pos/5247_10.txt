In contrast to the comment below, the Big Trail (1930) was not recorded in a three-camera process, "like the later Cinerama". It was Napoleon's (1927) finals, a different film! Simultaneously, Big Trail shot in both 35 mm and 70 mm (Grandeur) versions, and both versions are occasionally featured on Fox Movie Channels, making it easy to compare them. The Grandeur version (which is sent to the inbox @ about its original 2-1 ratio) is cinematically its wide-angle panorama film, but suffers from the same problem that the former CinemaScope has, the lack of close-ups of leaders Raoul Walsh focus on the problems. Scenes involving individuals, not crowds or long frames, are much more effective in the standard version because the camera can move towards the players, thereby gaining greater visibility for the viewer. Simultaneous viewing of the two versions gives an accurate idea of ​​which shots Walsh chose to take close-ups in the standard version, but didn't get it in the Grandeur version. There are also a couple of sequences that include El Brendel: a chorus game with Ian Keith and some business with his wife and jackass, which are in the Grandeur version but not in the standard version. <br /> <br /> The record, The Big Trail, is the only one of the three Fox Grandeur films that have survived on their original wide screen. (The other two are Fox Movietone Follies (1929), completely lost and Happy Days, which only remain in standard format.) Other studios experimented with a wide movie at that time, but the only other one still known in both formats is Bat Whispers, which has been filmed so 65 mm and 35 mm, released by United Artists. Other broad films were MGM's Billy the Kid (1930) and The Great Meadow (1931), RKO Danger Lights (1930) and WB's The Lash (1930), all featured in their standard formats in Turner Classic Films. WB's Kismet (1930) was also filmed as wide as standard, but seems to have disappeared completely; it is declared lost. <br /> <br /> Why did a large film fail in 1930? Due to the October 1929 stock market accident and installation of audio equipment, theaters were rolled (red), making them harmful for installing additional new projection devices and new wider screens. only a handful of movies that were captured in various systems that were not always compatible with each other. It was only in 1953, when Fox, now Twentieth Century-Fox, would try again and this time with the introduction of a wide-screen CinemaScope.
