Flashes blink; sprawling cemetery; Adam's "Batman" West: Everybody opens up on the screen before the opening credits are even over, and despite the rather naive elements, one dark night is not as cheesy as it may seem. Meg Tilly (Jennifer's sister) plays a real student, Julie, who is reluctant to spend the evening alone in the mausoleum as part of her initiative for exclusive high school clocks at The Sisters. What Julie does not understand is that the "sister" of others is going to worship her somewhat, or that the last body that is grasped in the mausoleum is "psychic vampire" Raymar, who feeds life. the power of scared young women. <br /> <br /> This is not really the most original, but luckily there are enough inventive solutions to help you compete on this movie, my favorites are seeing everyday items on the walls of Raymar's apartment and the horrible way the molded bodies float through mausoleum during the excellent finals of the cold marble corridors. Hal Trussell's impressive filmmaker and Tom Burman's wonderful macabre effects add enormously to the cooling atmosphere.
