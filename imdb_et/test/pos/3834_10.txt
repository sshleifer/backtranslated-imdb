It must be one of my three favorite models from the original TV series. <br /> <br /> What makes it big is the foolish battle between Romulan's commander and Kirki, as well as the top mark that Mark Lenard, who later played Spock's father in other TV episodes and movies. This is a case where they have risen to the level of talent around them, and Shatner, Nimoy and the whole cast are great results in this episode. <br /> <br /> Writing and plot are also excellent, and I love the direct approach that has been used to show signs and feelings and thoughts of their characters and how freely these actors express them. <br /> <br /> This very fun episode is from 10 out of ten.
