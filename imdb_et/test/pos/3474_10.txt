Damien O'Donnell has a good experience and in this film she is very sensitive to the sensitivity of the subject, but she is not able to become the film's schmalz. <br /> <br /> It's a fantastic movie, it's funny and sad, and it makes you look at things differently. Tell everyone you know to see it now - FANTASTIC! <br /> <br /> Actress is great and Dublin plays a key role. This movie changes the way people look at the disabled and gives you a very fun night in the cinema. I can't wait for it to appear on the DVD.
