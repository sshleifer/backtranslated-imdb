The real best picture of 1947 also concerns anti-Semitism and is better than Elia Kazani's GENTLEMEN AGREEMENT (which is the winner of this year's Academy Award) in virtually every department. The almost perfect direction of Edmard Dmytry, John Paxton's Tiger Script and the expressionist lighting of J. Roy Hunt's experts have been cast in an excellent ensemble. While Robert Young (playing a simple, methodical and very pleasant policeman) and Robert Mitchum (who actually has a random visual note) is the nominal star of the film, Robert Oscar and Gloria Grahame are nominees for the Oscar - as well as Paul Kelly, who is in the gloomy spouse of Grahame. but in the central role - who gives the most memorable character of the film; Ryan was so persuasive as killing racist, that he was finally a forecast for some time, offering the same shameful roles in films such as COMPETITION ACTIVITIES (1948), KAUGHT (1948), RAKET (1951), CLASH NIGHT (1952), NAKED SPUR (1953) and BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK (1955). The film is also remarkable for its atypical structure, because Ryan's "setback", complete preparation, is literally made, while the true truth is apparent from the blurry, distorted memories of the actual film's main character, who has not even played any movie stars! CROSSFIRE was also originally obliged to homosexuality (like Richard Brooks' source, "The Brick Foxhole"), but this taboo topic was unacceptable to the Hays office at that time - far from the current situation (at least) for this year's big Osars themed movie! <br /> <br /> Warner's DVD transmission print shows some regrettable signs from time to time, but the commentary by Noir's experts, James Ursin and Alain Silver, is good, although I do not share my opinion that Dmytryk's career was constantly falling after his HUAC worries such as excellent pictures such as SNIPER (1952), CAINE MUTINY (1954), BROKEN LANCE (1954), YOUTH (1958), WARLOCK (1959) and MIRAGE (1965); Having said that his co-operation with RKO with producer Adrian Scott and scriptwriter John Paxton - MURDER, MY SWEET (1944), CORNERED (1945; hopefully, this part of the next Film Noir Box Set from Warners) and CROSSFIRE - make his best work . In any case, in my opinion, the latter is not only one of the main films of the 1940s, but also one of the best journalists ever made.
