Pot-looking pre-teen Joshua Miller (when Tim) throws his sister's doll into the river, while Daniel Roebuck (like Samson) drives and smokes after killing Danyi Deats (like Jamie). The doll washes away, but a naked young woman is on the "river" to see all the passers-by. Watching the corpse is twenty something young, mostly naked body classmates. Stoners Keanu Reeves (like Matt) and Crispin Glover (like Layne) are most worth the camera. Friends know what to do for their guilt, a friend of a beer jumping killer. Hopper killed one woman. He lives in a sex game with one size of life, whose mouth is probably ready to act. Ione Skye Leitch (Clarissa) is a livelier doll and she expects Reeves to kiss her. Their copulation is particularly cross-sectional due to the breakthrough. The real teenager, in her first role as a function, is the daughter of Don Leitch, Donovan's sixties singer. Make other peculiar connections. <br /> <br /> Depending on your mood, you can read the movie a lot. Some character backgrounds may be a little too fine. Obviously the killer teenager was bullied; Note his nickname, weight and attitude. Some relationships and motivations of the characters are too vaguely defined, but the cast will certainly keep the material interesting; and director Tim Hunter, photographer Frederick Elmes and writer Neal Jimenez are probably qualified. <br /> <br /> ******* River's Edge (8/27/86) Tim Hunter ~ Keanu Reeves, Crispin Glover, Dennis Hopper, Joshua Miller
