This film reminded me of watching old black and white films with my father. More real life symbols looking for love, love and losing it. Old story fresh view. Larenz Tate was in the style of Cary Grant because the character could have been in a clumsey situation, but the actor kept her looking stupid and cut out like a cardboard. Nia Long has always been my favorite, she's sweet, even if she's tough, almost like Kathrine Hepburn. It is one of his best works and shows that he is better than always an angry black man. <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic, great actor, well-written, true love story, located in Chicago, what else can you ask? <br /> <br /> SuperB Black Love Story
