Mishima is one of the greatest films ever made. Now I think Paul Schrader is the greatest screenwriter of all time, but I don't like the movies he has seen (except for this and the temptation), but it's an amazing, disturbing and very three-dimensional character study. It follows the life of Japan's most famous writer Yukio Mishima, combining his life with the last day with setbacks and his fetus. I do not know how, but Paul Schrader can combine all of them very artistically. Action is great, so is the perfect result of photography and Philip Glass. Although it looks confusing at first viewing, it is one of the few movies that gets richer in every viewing. Really an underrated pearl of the movie.
