The largest period of the cinema began in post-war Europe with the neo-realistic movement of Italy. For the next 2 or 3 decades, the new French waves tried to draw attention to everyone and there was always Bergman on their deserted Scandinavian island somewhere, making bitter masterpieces. But in 1971, Luchino Visconti brought an art form full circle, geographically, with his wonderful work * Death in Venice *, which can also be called * Europoean Cinema's death *. After the wounding of the sixties, the big European filmmakers, with some exceptions, were generally exhausted and gave the torch to the new American generation Movie Brats (Coppola, Scorsese, & Co.). This film seems to be completely concise not only about Visconti's special obsession, but also the overall attempt by European filmmakers to achieve aesthetic ideal in films. And you can rest assured that you won't find any stranger than the Visconti here. He doesn't play the crowd, people: do you get behind him and follow, or you fall behind. Stimulation is a challenge: slow but never without emotional weight. "Incidents" are little and far away, but everyone seems to have a symbolic meaning in space. <br /> <br /> We are unlikely to ever be in such a rare company in terms of film: one of the greatest writers of the century who inspired the story (Thomas Mann), one of the biggest filmmakers (Visconti), one of the leading executives (Dirk Bogarde) and swollen almost constantly in the background, Gustav Mahler's 5th Symphony. Taking full advantage of Mahler's ability to inspire romance even in the most cynical breasts, Visconti turns the main character of Aschenbach into a novice writer as a fraudulent composer, even making Bogarde up to Mahler (geeky mustache, specs, shaggy hair, duck-walking). By the way, Bogarde offers the greatest performance of an actor in the history of the film: it is largely a silent performance, and the actor must give meaning to the gesture or gaze - a difficult trick without abductions Chaplin or just acts like an animated body. <br /> <br /> Cinema just doesn't get better. I ignore the complaints made by Ritalin drug addicts, who say it is too slow, but even more legitimate with some of Aschenbach's setbacks against this antagonist friend is in the wrong place. Memories are well suited to the thematic issues of the film (i.e. what is the better way to aesthetic perfection: passion or discipline?) And the astonishment and contraction of these interruptions help prevent sleepiness among viewers. (Of course, some viewers sleep through this movie anyway.) The flow of the Mahler and the beautiful, dead Venetian would be nothing more than a beautiful picture; but this movie is actually something. And what is it mainly about suffering: especially romantic (capital R). Visconti, a victim of romance, knew what he was talking about. <br /> <br /> [SPOILER. . . I think if anything else, see * Death in Venice * for this outstanding opening. . . and its unforgettable end when Bogarde jet-black hair drips from his sweating, dying head and chalky face. Meanwhile, the young Tadzio, the object of the dying desire of Bogarde, stands in the ocean and points towards the horizon as the Michelangelo sculpture. The climatic sequence combines with the agonizing economy everything that the film has: love, lust, beauty, loss, the end of life against the beginning of another life, and cold death in the midst of warm, sunny beauty. * Death in Venice * is a wonderful work of art. <br /> <br /> [DVD Tip: As the Visconti masterpiece * The Damned * is simultaneously released, I suggest that you turn on English subtitles when watching a movie. It is seemingly in English, but the sound of the DVD seems to be mud and a lot of Italian is spoken during the movie.] <br /> <br />
