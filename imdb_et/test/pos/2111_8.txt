I had the privilege of being one of the "Grand Champion" photographers and enjoyed every 42 minutes when I was working on the film. I've been in the photographic industry for 25 years and worked on 16 films and I can't think of the time I enjoyed offering my craft. The children were wonderful to work with and little Emma Roberts has so much energy that she is a real trip. He even grabbed one of my camera scenes during the trial run of the scene and started shooting. Some of his pictures were used for PR. I could have made more money for higher budget production, but I doubt I'd have had fun and had so many great actors and great people from West Texas when I was.
