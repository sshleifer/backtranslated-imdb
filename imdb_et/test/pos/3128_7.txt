The West can be divided into several sub-genres. One of the most common areas is that Western and Western Western countries. Most western countries are a combination of both, but at one end of the spectrum there are pictures such as High Noon and Rio Bravo, which take place almost entirely in settlements, rarely being released from the real outdoors. At the other end are such as the Wagon Master, where the desert is barely an observable farmhouse. <br /> <br /> Director John Ford is usually "a little bit" in both western worlds, photographing the emphasis of the interior on their small and limited levels, and then confronting with a wide open look that seemed as exciting as dangerous. The Wagon Master has a typical Frank Nugent script that has some contact with experienced old and green youths, but still presents Ford with fresh challenges. In this picture there is no danger of the harshness of the landscape, they come from the group Cleggses. What's more, the lack of actual interior scenes means that the outdoors can lose its effect over time. <br /> <br /> But Ford was a real maestro in manipulating space. He takes camp scenes or wagons so that the frame is surrounded and we get the same space as we would in a real interior. Compared to his other western countries, he does not really discover the space too much when the wagon runs through canyons and passes, not to overcome the harsh and empty plains. One of the few moments in which he opens up the landscape is when the Indians are noticed and there is a danger externally. <br /> <br /> Wagon Master has some surprisingly effective moments of comic stripping and some great contributions to exotic pains. Harry Carey Jr. designed by a subtle actor like her pa and it is one of her best early roles. Joanne Dru was disappointed when he wore a yellow ribbon, but it seems to be a bit of a sneaky character, and it's really pretty good here. Jane Darwell, who won ten years earlier Oscar for John Ford-driven grapes, appears here as the only task to fill the running gag, where he sounds a weak old horn. However, he does work with great timing and movement. Francis Ford is one of his many brother's pictures of one of the many mocking drunk tasks. <br /> <br /> And now we come to John John. Although he was in no way a bad actor, he never became a big star like John Wayne. And yet he was one of the most authentically "Western" players with his effortless horse-riding and light-weight pulling. And this brings me to my last point. This was probably one of Ford's personal favorites, even though it seemed quite uncomfortable. The Wagon Master has no big topic or dramatic intensity, it's just a genre that plays out. I think it's Ford's love. This is a picture of Ben Johnsons and Harry Carey Jrs, not John Waynes or Henry Fondas. Small scope but worthy of its class.
