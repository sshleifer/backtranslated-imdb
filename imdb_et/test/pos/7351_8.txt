This is, without a doubt, the biggest spin off ever made for Jack, hell, it even blows out Jackass's water. <br /> <br /> Image of this: You have a group of men who just didn't want to grow up, throw a ton of money and some serious cool stunts and you have Viva La Bam. <br /> <br /> This show, it's family-like and it's not just a gang running around, being full of nerves (like Jackass), for example: Bami's parents, April and Phil, are in every episode where Bam is obese uncle, Don Vito, to get started! The reason why the Margera family laughs at us is simple: someone in our family may be involved April: a woman who wants to live through the book and follow the traditions Phil: A man who is trying to be a good father and finally Bam: That son who has never grown out of high school. Buying DVDs is definitely recommended! The second thing that is surprising is how random Margera is all over. He has said in interviews that for most episodes he doesn't act, but only acts on instinct. <br /> <br /> Most of all, I liked the whole thing under Margera's influence over MTV. He wanted Slayer to play in his backyard, MTV did it. Dani Filth with one day and have a Cradle Of Filth account in his backyard brother, this happened. </p> and his brother's class CKY, and there's a whole bunch of head beating. <br /> <br /> If you liked Jackass, you will love it. I borrowed from a friend of Season 1 last year and I would give my feet to meet Viva La Bam's team. You don't have to be disappointed, and I can let you sew at the end!
