Sean Connery is very good at Big Race, Lord of the Reef and Faithful Defender. This is an adventure movie with Arabs, Germans and USMC, all of whom are in one place or another. The main and supportive characters also affect a lot of humor. The story is based on a real case where Raisul kidnapped a wealthy Greek-American businessman in the early 1900s. Milius has been replaced by Candace Bergen and her two children as victims of kidnapping, and opens up a lot of literary licenses for the story. viewer of two TR's most famous (though mostly forgotten) political quotes. Brian Keith (very good as TR) says, "Pedecaris alive or Raisul dead!"; and John Huston (also Good Head of State John Hay) asks the Japanese Ambassador to the White House at dinner: "You like knife, do you like forks?"
