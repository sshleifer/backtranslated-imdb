I thought it was a great movie. Gary Cole played the role of a soldier who is trapped and dissatisfied with his wife, who is foolishly fooling his death! Everything, I thought the movie was great, definitely not boring plot! It's sad to say, but I think many men can feel it. I think he should have just separated the divorce and asked him to go to the extreme, but he felt there was no other way he would have done his death. I thought it was clean that a woman in Cole's real life played a woman she wasn't happy with in the movie. I think this guy was extreme, but the movie was great! Be sure to recommend it!
