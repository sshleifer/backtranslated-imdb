... and usually I don't like surprises! Watch this movie at a random South African motel, a three-week motorcycle holiday in ZA. In addition to being well-shot and working, it helped me understand the problems of the countries enormously. I just watched "Million Dollar Baby" and had to look for Hillary Swank because the name seemed somewhat familiar, and her acting was great. He didn't know he was a "Red Dust" lawyer. Well now I'm not worried that he will disappear from so many other sides of Clint before ... Now I am asked to write ten whole lines of comments that are quite ridiculous because I've written what I want to write. OK, here it goes: I think that if you are from Western countries, especially from Europe, watching will help you understand somewhat better why what is happening is going on there! So hopefully it will fill ten lines.
