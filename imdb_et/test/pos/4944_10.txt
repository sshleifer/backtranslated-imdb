Soul Calibur has always been my favorite fighting game series. And SCIII is my favorite. <br /> <br /> Graphics are very well done. Much better healing in the dark polygons of Soul Edge / Soul Blade. The characters have facial expressions, the hair blows in the wind and they even flash. <br /> <br /> Soul Calibur has always been known for its interesting land and characters and SCIII is no exception. Each character has detailed and well-made background information. My favorite character is Chai Xianghua. She's cute, she's funny and she's a strong woman. Yeah, I know he's wearing a pink and he's got a boy (who gets to the BTW), but he seems to have more. Xianghua, like all the other characters, has its own individuals with drawbacks and disruptions, so no sign is perfect, not even good guys. <br /> <br /> Music is beautifully made for a fighting game series. It doesn't sound like a goat (Vampire series) or sound like an old school porn movie (Mortal Kombat). Characters have their own themes and many topics are made to match a particular culture of this world. I don't think this song has a song that I don't like. <br /> <br /> Another cool thing in this game is to create your own anime-like character (Create Soul). You could see her as cute as sexy or even ugly if you want. However, if you found a nice character to customize, don't forget to make notes or else you will not remember how you create it. I found myself very dependent on CaS. That's all I asked. What else do I want?
