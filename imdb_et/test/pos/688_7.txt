It seemed to me a film that is a small budget, which is bad cinematography and not all that is a great editing work. This may be of interest to those who know something about submarines during World War II, but I recommend that everyone else warn. Many of the scenes in this movie were flat and some actors were a bit weak. The story of men being recalled during a short vacation is realistic enough, but the story is not a real pace or tension. I also had a hard time understanding what the actors said, partly due to some strong English accents and perhaps some smaller sound recording work. I'll give it 55/100. Most people want to "clear" clear.
