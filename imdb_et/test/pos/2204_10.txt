Even if you are not a "theater character", I suggest you see it. Christopher Bond's game with the same name (based on an old London legend), Sondheim did an excellent job of bringing it to the stage of musical theater. The result is simply amazing - far from Sondheim's best and probably one of the best points ever written for music. The exhibition was cast very well, my only complaint was the depiction of Betsy Joscely from Johanna. It's good, remember, and he's a very versatile actor, but he just didn't sing "Greenfinch and Linnet Bird" too well. But besides, it's all phenomenal - Angela Lansbury * did Mrs Lovette's role and she just does it so well. George Hearn was a good substitute for Len Cariou and Ken Jennings is a great substitute for Tobias. The end gives you chills. Biggest signs for a great show.
