Thanks to the good, not all Dutch people are so merciless. I think most people are rated Jason as just a famous father. Maybe he's not as big as some of these actors, but he's definitely not as bad as he suggested. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie a few years ago and I really loved it. I knew Jason was from other movies and of course Robin Sherwood. But I have to say that she really liked her acting on this movie. It was really good! <br /> <br /> During the movie I forgot that he was his son. Sean .. who? <br /> <br /> And if you are a Shakespeare lover, I can recommend this movie. I'm sure you will enjoy it!
