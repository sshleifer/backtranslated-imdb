This is one of Chaplin's first national films, dating back to his famous reciprocal shorts and mature United Artists features. Even richer than reciprocal films continue Chaplin's effort to improve his comic book. Most people forget that the movie is actually the dream Charlie waits until it is sent to the front. <br /> <br /> The Limburger cheese has a lot of strokes for enemy gasification and Chaplin's invasion of enemy territory dressed as a tree. <br /> <br /> At this stage of this career, the great man had become so inclined as a film expression that his films gave him an impression. This was undoubtedly not the case, but still it provides such a convincing realistic view of life as I remember, albeit ironically in a humorous perspective. <br /> <br /> I'm concerned to know that Chaplin's work should be a prerequisite for all cinephiles - don't delay!
