This is a great Valentine's Day gift. A gorgeous boy and a beautiful girl who is trying to win the race at the competition. Very romantic. I'm a true fan of Costas Mandylor since his Picket Fence days and he hasn't lost his complaint. Lauren Holly is still cute and divine and still has great chemistry. The support cast was also good. Seeing that all these wonderful desserts were made, it was a tasty vision. I loved Costas and Lauren competing in baking competition and love. This is a film that soothes all tastes, romance and otherwise. Hallmark always shows excellence in programming and it is no exception. The whole family can watch this movie. It also shows that sometimes love can be won. I found myself a victim and want more and long for this movie for these wonderful desserts. I recommend this movie to every age. Great treatment for everyone.
