The shine of this story gives each audience at least one skilfully designed message. This story is a success, it's a failure. It concerns the choices you make in life and the choices others make for you. The story deals with self-realization and decision-making on such a large scale that the camera angle cannot cover it. Within the perception of each scene, there is an element marked with imagination. Remember this when watching a movie; it is more than an eye candy. Sexually suggestive, rarely expressed scenes are only meant for the annoying process of intrusive and entertaining development.
