Although it may not be Cassavetes's best work, Minnie and Moskowitz are perfect in almost all of their endeavors. The plot is lively and charming, surprisingly dramatic, with an impressive array of emotions - much more drama than comedy, as opposed to IMDb's profile. Yes, the story is strange but not arbitrary; it succeeds unbelievably, although it is forced - what I return. All artistic aspects are in the form of a true Cassavets: cinematography and camera work are joyful, and the soundtrack - albeit barely there - is free. Plus I believe I noticed some arrows for Godard and such editing - as I have some Cassavetes movies (namely cutting one song in a scene suddenly) that are interesting. <br /> I feel the plot is nicely built, with the first half being especially enjoyable. For example, Seymour's conversation with Morgan Morgan (Timothy Carey) in the dining area is wonderfully funny and exciting and sets the philosophical commentary on the film. This philosophy - the tradition in Cassavets' films - is what made the film for me. Seymour's amusing and deep monologues immediately eliminate the first impressions he may have as a hippie simp - although his character is curiously similar to his face (1968). However, it drew me (in another view) to the view that it was against Cassavete's best work. I got the affection for this movie, which I watched at first viewing. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are several aspects that make this movie imperfect. I think the plot is out of balance. As I said earlier, it will be fine, but it will reduce it here and there, especially at the end. Because of his spontaneous style in which Cassavetes worked, and especially the freedom he allowed his participants to improvise, his product quality can easily go. In this case, it is controversial. I appreciate that most of this movie was improvised and most of it beautifully. However, one or two scenes unfortunately do not work. Especially the Seymour scene fights after Minnie's work outside his house. During the most intense scene of the film, Cassavete allowed his participants to travel freely - assuming that some of them had been planned in advance. It was a mistake in my opinion. This gives the impression that Cassel does not know exactly what to do, as he speaks repeatedly, often fails to understand and move; it all undermines the development of the scene and character. I understand that Seymour is meant to be a bit stupid, but Cassel's attempts here are wrong. Why did he cut off his mustache? These shortcomings are due to: the lack of a part of Cassavetes; lack of understanding and understanding of Cassel's part; lack of samples and preparations; Apparently, Cassavets failed to learn from his mistakes, as he promised to do the same in his next film, "Under the Influence of Woman" (1974) - an offense and ending. <br /> <br /> These shortcomings are not minor, but they do not destroy the movie. They just make some scenes worthy and unrealistic, break the film's flow and damage its potential. But I am very, very fond of Cassavets and all of his actors, especially Cassel, despite these mistakes. This is a very enjoyable movie, although it proves the uncertainty of the Cassavetes style.
