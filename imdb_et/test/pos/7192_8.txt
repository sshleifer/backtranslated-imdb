The second live Asterix competition is much better than the glued elements of the ten different songs, called the first film, rather than staying close to the original comedian. <br /> <br /> In short, Queen Cleopatra has contributed to Caeser to build a palace in Egypt to show that the Egyptians are great people. Royal Architect Edifis wants Asterix, Obelix and druid Getafix to do their job. There is a lot of laugh out loud, some jokes that only the French can get (in the 35-hour week in the jib), while others are more universal. Big special budget effects are remarkable, but overshadowed by the original comic jokes. <br /> <br /> Depardieu and Clavier are still working perfectly as a pair, while Monica Bellucci makes a perfect cast on Cleopatra. Also for fans of comics, fun pirates can see the lack of them on film 1.
