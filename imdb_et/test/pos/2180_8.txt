VIIS STAR FINAL was one of the best films of the early 1930s. He played Edward G. Robinson and was a very dirty story about a stupid newspaper and their willingness to do something ... NOT to sell newspapers. In particular, the pages are stained with an old story about an innocent woman and it helps to destroy her happy life now - many years after she was unintentionally involved in a scandal. The reason I loved the movie so much was that it was unshakable and pulled out of shots - showing how low the publishers could sell the papers. FINAL LAST FINAL - Some Changes. Instead of Robinson, this film marks Humphrey Bogart and is a radio station, not a newspaper programming manager. Otherwise, the story is essentially the same - except that it is a little less tense and has little original and sensationality. This does not mean that the movie is bad - it just doesn't offer as good as the first movie. In other words, if you have to see one of these movies, look at the first - though this movie is also quite powerful and enjoyable. As for me, I loved this story so much, I saw both movies and enjoyed both of them. <br /> <br /> Two worlds start with the UBC radio owner, complaining to his programming head (Bogart) that all "high heels" indicate he has put down, are low ratings. The owner requires many rumors to get more listeners. One way they discuss is to make a multi-part dramatization of the famous killing that took place two decades ago - although the killer was acquitted and killed only in self-defense. At the same time, they decide to play the story as if they were guilty and they would even go so far as to send the writer's wife home, pretending to be a minister (!) And forwarding their current name and location. Needless to say, it destroys a woman and leads to a terrible tragedy. Then, and only then, Bogart feels such a waste of real regret - it leads to a dandy finale of journalistic integrity and dignity. <br /> <br /> A well-functioning, wonderful storyline and message that is as important as it was in the 1930s, this is one story you have to look at. Particularly note the wonderful and very emotional confrontation of the scene where the daughter attacks the owner and Bogart - this is one great example of exemplary and writing.
