Lou Gossett, Jr. is great as "Chappy Sinclair", a super US Air Force pilot who can access a nice but un disciplined "Doug Master" (Jason Gedrick), trying to pilot a son who has decided to borrow a few F-16 winners who are trying to get their father save the enemy overseas dictator (David Suchet). <br /> <br /> Better than "Top Gun," this is an excitement and a lot of explosions in the air force airline - you know all the cool things you want behind a modern military adventure movie. <br /> <br /> Cool music, including Twisted Sister's Dee Snider bow, "We're not going to take it" and King Cobra's great "Never Say Die". <br /> <br /> Goal High! Air Force!
