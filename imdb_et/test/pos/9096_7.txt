Originally I was a fan of Tenacious D's first album and of course P.O.D. and was quite disappointed. After watching the movie, my view was changed. The film is pretty funny from the beginning to the end and found it to be the same, although it was a really stupid story, as KG and Jaybles were in the film. Much more fun and enjoyable than the movies I've seen in theaters recently. ex. Saw III (dull and dreary), Casino Royale (the way to a gay erotic) I've really enjoyed in the previous sections <br /> <br /> If you like Borat, you enjoy the story The Greatest Band on Earth
