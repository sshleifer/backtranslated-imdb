I tend to go to anime and go out of love because the more you look, the more you notice that many exhibitions are just a few of the pearls or rhythms of old formulas. But every time a time comes, one real gem comes in and its originality just blows you away. Haruhi is really one of these shows. Many of the anime series are originally manga and sometimes the animated exhibition is quite poorly translated and does not take advantage of the animation with static drawings. Haruhi is actually based on all the cylinders with light novels and fires, beautiful animation, great voice, great music and a complete and well-functioning story. See that you don't have to be disappointed, and I would recommend watching it in a broadcasting arrangement that works so much better.
