Given that it is basically a small budget, it is surprisingly good for the life and death of the budding pioneer Buddy Holly. Gary Busey stands for Holly, one of the first to use an electric guitar for his music. With his Crickets' support, Holly had a number of hits and became a burglary with Richie Valens and The Big Bopper before his death. The film is followed by its meaning, marriage to his beloved and possible death. I like this movie and I believe that too. Charles Martin Smith does a great job in this film.
