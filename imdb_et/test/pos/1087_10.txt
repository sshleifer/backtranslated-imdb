Satya was great .... The company was just as good, but polished, probably due to the money from the previous films. However, Ab Tak Chappan is even more interesting. Dialogue is sharp, raw and sometimes fun. Nana Pataker once again appears to play a role that only she can fulfill with authority, but the support cast is very talented. The direction is dense and the story develops at a satisfactory pace with a very dramatic climax. As a picture of reality, it can be too dramatic, but at the end of the day it is a movie, so the balance is on the ground. I've ordered my DVD and can't wait to see it at home again. As a lover of this type of gangster, it is very delightful and is highly recommended to refresh "non-Yash Raj" with Bollywood gangsters.
