As everyone now knows, 15 Park Avenue is a story about a schizophrenic girl and her stepfather. <br /> <br /> The manifestation of schizophrenia is still considered a disease that people often feel ignored when ignored. There are also those who, although far-fetched, may appear as shown in the film, think that the disease is manifested as a result of some supernatural effect. I think pr. It deserves much praise for "15 park discovery". He has made good moves not only for the general public, but also for those involved in schizophrenia ... with relatives, social workers, psychoanalysts. The film actually helps to dispel many myths and misconceptions about the exact nature of this psychological disorder. I am saying that the film is largely based on his own personal experience with a very close person who suffers from this spiritual suffering. To do this, I am sure that none of what has been shown has been blown proportionally ... on the contrary, it is the actual representation of the facts. <br /> <br /> Performances are good as expected. Konkona Sen Sharma, Shabana Azmi and of course Peace Bose are really very good. They become very "real" characters that are reliable enough to be identified with them at times. People may think that I have a terrible mistake, but I think there are moments when we would know by Meethi! I think we all have "madness" inside of us. Maybe some more than others. These are the people who are out. After all, do we all have our secret fantasies and dreams? Possible, sometimes? Would we mention that we are "our travelers" if people could look at these areas? Is a person with low self-esteem considered to be schizophrenic because he complains about the company ... preferring to live in his own world, because that is the only room with a sense of security? <Br /> <br /> Konkona, like Meethi, is outstanding !! His performance is so relaxed ... he lives his part. He has shown the ability to listen to the audience to forget the gap between reality and action! One example is the section where he is troubled at the scene of television shown during the arrest of Saddam Hussein. His reaction seems to be so unobtrusive and intense ... as if in this tragedy he was really broken! Also his Indian English English brand is so spontaneous and natural. But the same cannot be said for at least a few other participants. Kanwaljeet and Waheeda Rehman, both great actors, have their own dialogue in English. Their dictation is less than perfect ... tended and affected, the fact that they make the greatest efforts becomes more than obvious. Transferring their dialogue is a jarring and tends to break the story of a smooth flow. <br /> <br /> Brutal Rape (Konkona) rape seems somewhat unnecessary. Any other case would be quite enough, I feel. Here it is important that something is caused by the extreme manifestation of the disease. As the psychiatrist explains, it is impossible to claim with any conviction or certainty that the rape incident was important to bring the hidden tendency towards schizophrenia to date. Then why are we subjected to a scene where Methi is bleeding and unconscious. Was Mrs Sen trying to make a social statement about the politics of our country, where the voices of the masses are silenced by some people who use violence to stay in power? If so, the rape scene is justified, but not strictly in the context of the film's core. <br /> <br /> The end seems somewhat steep. Does the audience expect a solution? Where's Meeti disappearing? Is pr. It wants us to feel that maybe what the psychiatrist says, whose reality is more real and so plausible? In other words, is he trying to say that we are not without bias when we decide who is between this entertainment and the madness? I'm not very sure. <br /> <br /> It is worthwhile to look at the provocative film as a whole. But if you are a person who likes things to be clean and tidy ... any cut and dried waterproof solution to any problem that comes up ... this movie is probably not for you!
