Just before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it, being a much less spooky nightmare than I thought. Instead, the director Jeff Lieberman surrenders a wonderfully memorable and irritating atmosphere to the movie for great stretches, constantly building tension until I was really sure what was happening, but ended the spring when he was expecting it. Lack of activities in many parts gave him the great freedom that was blended with Texas Chainsaw Massacre's atmosphere, and when the action really strikes, it is truly shocking and dramatic without ever having to really need it. The characters are about such a movie, though somewhat more likeable, and a bad guy memorable. Photography and intercourse are the true winners of this film and they will never be boring (as suggested). I highly recommend this to horrible fans. Don't wait gore, wait for a creepy backdrop that has several fantastic moments and a great dreamlike atmosphere.
