I love everything from a family member. <br /> <br /> My favorite characters in the family are Brian and Stewie, and I like episodes if it contains mostly "Road to Rhode Island" (season 2) because they communicate very well. The comments they just make are stitches. Peter's behavior is also very funny, because some of the things he does "are just so brilliant that they have slowed down." Vote is great, especially Seth MacFarlane, because he gives half of Griffin's family and their perverted neighbor Glenn Quagmire and how he controls this range (especially singing). I just don't know. He deserves his two Emmy's to give the voice of Stewie's evil baby gene. Adam West also steals the exhibition with his funny and completely mad ordinary Quahog Mayor. I like Chris (which was expressed by Seth Green) is what he says he takes his father after intelligence and common sense. <br /> <br /> The only thing I've irritated is that UK Fox has decided to change seasons to boost DVD sales, which in no way reflects the program, but rather the marketing. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy Family Guy, I would recommend Seth MacFarlane's second American Father who uses different humor but is still very fun.
