CELL (2000) Rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> The cell, like Antz, has to be reviewed twice to evaluate it. The first time I saw this movie was that I thought it was mediocre, but after the movie I had such a lasting impression, I decided to rent it again. I did and found that the film was much more pleasant. The cell is not for everyone, but it shares its stories in high quality and is a visually intelligent film that dreams about images and draws ideas that could not be matched. The film's scenario may be cumbersome at times, as is the actor, but the visuals are brilliant and bring an inclusive story to an exotic and intriguing life. The Oscar nominated make-up is also bold and cautious, while beautiful costumes and a completely brilliant set of ornaments remained unnoticed. Tarsem Singh, who has also directed music videos, is going crazy with his direction and that's fine. He has a great talent and there are many opportunities for this film if you give him a chance. Generally, Cell is powerful, distracting and avoids too sticky, which makes it a great and pleasant watch.
