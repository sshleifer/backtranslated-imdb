Hmmmm. I'm sorry here. I know I know that I liked the Death Bed, I know I'm spreading the death gospel to all my friends and acquaintances, and when you read it, I ask you to see Death Bed, but I can't really tell you why. Maybe it's the secret of this charm. <br /> <br /> Plot? Well, sort of. There's a bed that eats people (and fried chicken, apples, flowers, suitcases and any other thing close to it) to suck their digestive stuffed mattress. Among the almost unlimited powers, Bed has the chance to catch Aubrey Beardsley's mind behind the picture to track and tell the film's events. The Bed's abandoned mansion ends with different people (the bed's habit of eating something that moves, giving a bad reputation) and putting down sex or swimming, or because they don't feel well and eat, sometimes first trippy dreams. And finally, we have the final explosive confrontation between Beardsley, the bed of the mother (you had to be there) and the bed. <br /> <br /> It seems pretty easy to put it like that, no - well, except for Aubrey Beardsley's part. But something seems constant, and the story seems to have slipped from one scene to another, even when it has attracted cheap smiles or strange gore effects. Imagine Bunel crossing Bergman, then Herschell Gordon Lewis got into a big soak. The story shades from horror, fairy tale, comedy, existential meditation, without break - an amazing achievement for a film by a student who was not filmed in the Detroit area. <br /> <br /> All of all, the amazing little movie that quite probably can never make any review fairly. See it for yourself.
