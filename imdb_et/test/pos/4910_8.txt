The story of a widow (Claude Rains) who is raising his four daughters. Emma (Gale Page) is a beloved big hunky Ernest (Dick Foran). Thea (Lola Lane) is a romantic old but prosperous person. Kay (Rosemary Lane) wants to become a singer. Ann (Priscilla Lane) is romantic. Their dear Felix Deitz (Jeffrey Lynn) is staying with their father. All the sisters love her. Then the difficult cynical Mickey (John Garfield) enters the picture ... <br /> <br /> The very entertaining film was a big hit and was nominated for five prizes. It's beautifully managed by Michael Curitz, a pretty good (as predictable) script and a very attractive cast (especially Lynn). This was also John Garfield's first film and made him a star. It was so popular that there were three or four sequences (which I never saw). It's a tempting, fun, great budget soap opera - it's worth it.
