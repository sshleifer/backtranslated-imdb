Battleship Potemkin is a masterpiece of celluloid. <br /> <br /> The direction of Eisenstein is truly outstanding. The film crowns a ship of shameful ships who are tired of abuse by their senior officials. <br /> <br /> Finally, the sailors will end up abusing and receiving <br /> <br /> officers packing. There was no film in the Soviet Union during this time. The government wanted to send its messages to the people to start a national film company and one of the members of <br /> <br /> was Sergei Eisenstein. Movies were shot in miniature <br /> <br /> budgets, and due to lack of film, Eisentein was forced to be careful <br /> <br /> and make a choice with his filmed movie. Ultimately, Eisenstein was able to record video to make a feature-length image. <br /> <br /> The most famous action in this movie is many <br /> <br /> about the massacre of steps. This scene was in counterfeit bananas <br /> <br /> and most recently in Brian De Palma's The Untouchables. If you want to learn how to make a movie, I strongly suggest you look at Battleship Potemkin. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most important. <br /> <br /> A +
