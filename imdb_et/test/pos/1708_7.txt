As they say, Larry King Live is not bad, and because he occasionally gets good guests, this is an exhibition that turns on, but not compulsively. If Bill Maher, former President Carl Bernstein, or other important guests sit in front of him, it's not too bad. At other times, he tends to host guests who are involved in the latest celebrity scandals, which do not provide the country with intelligent information and largely feeds the uneducated public who wants to hear the latest rumors about film and TV stars. At the time of OJ Simpson's trial, it seemed that every other of his guests was involved in the incident. But is that the press? Or in a tube with a national investigator? Sometimes it's a bit like garbage television - Jerry Springer is sitting in an interview with phone calls, not with a live audience. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the royal show is definitely better than Bill O'Reilly, whose show is nothing more than the best political platform for Rush Limbaugh's. This means that Larry King is not a bad interviewer, but unfortunately he is not big. The king will not always come out as he fully understands how intellectual material is presented, especially if it is a fine aspect of a new book by a scientist or historian. It always seems that the minute the King is unable to deal with the problem at hand, when he turns to phone calls, maybe I hope someone in the country has a better question than he has. He may interview someone like David Gergen, but may not read any of his books. Sounds like a filmmaker who never reads the script. <br /> <br /> If this is a celebrity entertainment, there is no problem. He may come out as he is thoroughly aware, because the material is not so substantial. Speaking to Elizabeth Taylor about her relationship with Richard Burton, it is not rocket science. And I notice that he's usually seen the last movie of the star. Watching a movie takes much less time and reflection than reading a book. But if it's like John Dean or Bob Woodward, then the king comes out a bit like he didn't finish his homework. So the phones are off. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a real in-depth interview, Terry Gross is probably the best interviewer in the United States. He reads and / or examines everything that has been written or written by his guests and has the skills of these areas. I don't see the king quite that. It is likely to have a 1000 times larger audience than Terry Gross, which can speak more of an American audience than King. In short, Larry is better than Bill, but not as good as Terry.
