One Dark Night has a typical teenage horror film with a rather unique twist. This small film, which gives, greatly adds to the musical score and gothic / claustrophobic atmosphere. Meg Tilly is a great "Julie" and takes us through the mausoleum labyrinth, giving her feel and loneliness. Other teenagers are equally effective in their role as the final hero of the film, Melissa Newman. Special effects are excellent, though dated. This film has been neglected, but it may be good that it never endlessly destroyed. Through this film, great and dark magic flows; If you've ever come across, you'll get it really and you're fun. A DVD with two discs is available, although no initial negative was found to restore the movie. Maybe one day it will be. I think that in some ways, some of the spots in the carbon can help to give the film, giving it the respect of the old school, and eventually making it unexpected when there are many effects. a tough cut / alternative version of the movie temp-version, which gives more explanation of the death of two girls, very poe-ish ("Amontillado box" comes to mind in a new way!). I'm not sure if it was a hit for the mainstream audience, but it certainly worked for me and very scary. there is also a documentary that is interesting because it provides information about what happened at that time to the actors, the team, the director and the writer; honest material, current logos, discussions of frames and scenes, samples. It is very unique that this stuff exists for a small movie.
