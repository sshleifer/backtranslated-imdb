This exhibition was very good in many ways, although it was definitely an atypical west where the hero (?) Traveled on a motorcycle, not on a horse, thanks to the 1914 setup, which was very late for the West. Between 1866 and 1890. I remember some inconsistencies at the time of its annulment, but did not follow it when it was in NBC. When I saw and loved it, it was ten years later when I was in the army in Germany and it was shown every week from the beginning of the television of the armed forces. By that time, Margot Kidder was famous as Lois Lane, but I always think of her as Nichol's girlfriend. In many ways, Nichols was much like Maverick; both were much more tempting than the little effort to get rich when they fought. It was in a tiny television magazine that they spread on PX (not actually the TV Guide as an authorized edition, but that resembled it as accurately as possible without copyright issues), so I first learned the actual story of revocation. I really don't know what would be the more violent twin next season if they were really planned. Of course, at the time of this exhibition, the TV's "Western era" had fallen for about ten years; One day I hope I can write that "the time of reality" has been diminishing over this long period of time! Although "Gunsmoke" and "Bonanza" were still in progress, they were both running out and years after the new West was really caught; I think this trend has done a lot to keep "Nichols" behind, and this was the main reason NBC leaders doubted it could ever find a big audience. But for me, a good West, unlike today's timing, is somewhat timeless, as are other "periods"; Changing fashion and the like doesn't do anything to make them more "dated" when they were supposed to be, and I think watching this exhibition, 10 years after it, is really what brought it to me. It is also an early mating of Garner and Stuart Margolini, who is really one of the greatest sidekicks of all time, not just in Western countries.
