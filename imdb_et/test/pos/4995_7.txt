I think the consensus is quite unanimous in this recent TV show: it's okay, but it's far from "Loneome Dove". The latter is simply compared to the fact that it is the prequel of this famous story. <br /> <br /> Commanche Moon is definitely worthy of any western fan. Just don't expect it to be as intense as "Loneome Dove". Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are not Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones and their characters are not as strong as Duvall and Jones portrayed these two men. Some say it is unfair because of the criticism of this film, but you have to compare it - this is the story of the two leading Texas Ranger characters: "Woodrow Call" and "Gus McCrae." <br /> <br /> The main difference I found was that this prequel is slower and more relational (two Ranger and his wife) at times. But I didn't know that because the two main women were pretty ladies and people generally like and liked it. They were played nicely by Linda Cardelini ("Clara Forsythe") and Elizabeth Banks ("Maggie"). They helped make this long movie tasty. If you have seen pictures of old western women, none of them was half-beautiful as Cardelin and Banks. They were the joy of their men's eyes. Maggie's son "Newt" was also a great boy - a boy every parent wanted ... <br /> <br /> The most interesting character I thought was "Inish Scull" played by Val Kilmer. Like Western film, "Tombstone", Kilmer almost steals the exhibition's leaders. "Scull" is really original when I ever saw it: a strange guy indeed. Actually, all the actors here supported the work of Keith Robinson's "Deets" for Wes Studi as "Buffalo Hump". I think Studi is exciting, no matter what role he plays. I want him to have a bigger role in this minisers. <br /> <br /> One thing about this film is "Loneome Dove" and other good Western countries: landscape and photography. It is sometimes beautiful and is a pleasure to watch. We also have a great director of this movie: Simon Wincer, who directed "Lonesome Dove" and another outstanding TV western crossfire trail. He also made two of my favorite films, both in his home country of Australia, "Phar Lap" and "Quigley Down Under." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, although I enjoyed it, "Commanche Moon" is not as good as the above-mentioned movies. However, if I looked at it all and I was sorry if it makes sense. It made me look again at Woodrow and Gusi, this time with Tommy Lee and Robert. <br /> <br /> Note: The title page says it is 360 minutes. It must also include TV commercials. The DVD version of the two discs I saw was about 4 hours and 40 minutes.
