Talking about E! Hollywood's special about making Dirty Dancing, which many women, including my dear friend in their fifties, are one of his favorite films. Maybe music, dancing or melodrama around the Baby Frances plot will turn into a dance-lesson with Johnny Castle. Of course, this film was created by Jennifer Gray, whose biggest role today is the annoying nurse on Ferris Beuller's agenda. Patrick Swayze is perfectly cast as the heart that drives a man who sweeps the child literally. Dirty Dancing is all about getting Broadway or West End hit. It has a love story, music and most dancing. Jennifer and Patrick could easily revive their roles. it is nice to see that Jerry Orbach plays a doctor instead of a police and a Kelly bishop. All this happened in the 60s in Catskill, where many Jewish families broke out during the summer holidays. At the end of the film, it is sad to see the next generation of hotel owners, Kellerman. It happened anyway! Most people prefer cruises and travels across Europe than in the summer in Catskill. These old big hotels are becoming Indian gambling. Let Broadway bring Dirty Dancing alive and well. After all, they could do Footloose and Saturday Night Fever, it should not be a brainer! I know this movie is one of the favorites that won't be tired after 800 times. There are people who have probably seen this movie 1000 times. Somehow looking at Dirty Dancing's work and story, it made me a long 13-year-old childhood day. Dirty Dancing may not be the greatest film ever made in history, but its universal appeal still attracts crowds and repetitive observers, such as the 800 clubs whose members have been watching it many times. I look at it gently now that Baby is in the first days and his first true love with Patrick Swayze, Johnny Castle. No one was able to portray this small film as a big hit at the end of the sixties music, two sound tracks, and even the 80s. I hope they bring it to Broadway's musical. This would work if the audience were part of the movie. No wonder it still attracts children and even adults, especially women of all ages, to watch it again and again. Both in Australia and London, both have been Dirty Dancing productions. This seems to be coming to Broadway in 2007, precisely for the 20th anniversary.
