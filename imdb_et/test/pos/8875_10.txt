This movie is extremely funny - momma characterizes me again and again to the movie! I can't get enough of my dry line ... as if he tells his son Owen to bury his friend in the backyard before he smells of the place ... and his suspicion that Owen is trying to kill him by giving him salted nuts! This is fun! <br /> <br /> If you like movies such as the National Lampoon Holiday, Uncle Buck or Airplanes, Trains and Cars, it has a similar humor. It's great, a whole laugh ... must see!
