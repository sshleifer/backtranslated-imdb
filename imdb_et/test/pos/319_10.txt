My favorite movie all the time. It was Coppola's erroneous work and seeing the documentary "The Heart of Darkness" made it even more weighty. At this point, Coppola was the King of Hollywood after "godfather" and "GodfatherII" and had developed an ego, which is even necessary to dare to make a film like "Apocalypse Now". Through proper arrogance, he went to a partial script to Phillipine and thought he knew what he was going to get there. Just as Captain Willard thought he knew what to do when he moved to the Kurtz compound. And like Willard, he didn't know what he was getting when he got there. It is a masterpiece of American cinema, beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and story. I like the most Apocalypse now that it does not provide answers or conclusions. As a result, because of its open end, some of the viewers who love their movies are much more obvious. <br /> <br /> This movie violates the category. Some call it a war film, which is not at all, in fact, it is rather a personal investigation of a person. The best picture of Vietnam is, in my opinion, a "platoon", and if the viewer is looking for a repetition of the Vietnam War, there will be answers first. <br /> <br /> Coppolat should be praised for his military bureaucracy, which he effectively communicates with Gen.Corman and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and Playmate. The tremendous fearfulness of Kilgore makes her an unforgettable character, and the dawn attack is always a Hollywood classic. <br /> <br /> It's almost a psychedelic cruise to a very surreal end that makes it a movie that's not accessible to everyone. Very difficult to look at, but also rewarding. I can offer my explanations for each scene, but it would be completely pointless. This film is meant for interpretation and reflection, not for direct satisfaction. <br /> <br /> A small footnote, surely as your first Apocalypse Now first-time viewer, first look at the original version, the Redux version is I think it's for more hardcore fans and is more curious than the new and improved version of the movie
