Russian actress TATIANA SAMOILOVA reminds me so much about the young Audrey Hepburn and the cameras IN USE is beautiful that she loves her as much. He is the centerpiece of romance in central wars against the backdrop of Moscow's World War II. <br /> <br /> The film is almost poetic in its awesome B&W cinematography, which was the main reason for the first film screening. place, because I had never heard of it and decided to try it when he passed on from TCM. <br /> <br /> This is a very touching love story about the girl's deep love for a man who is suddenly swept away by her role in the war in Russia. She cannot forget the memory of her romantic side, but unexplainedly marries someone who has forced her, a pianist who soon realizes she still loves a soldier whom she hopes to hear. Their marriage is worrying because it can't give up their soldier's loved one's memory of their happy time. <br /> <br /> At the end of the story, he accepts the idea that he never plans to come back to be able to cope with reality and solve the situation. At the railway station, where arriving soldiers greet their loved ones, there is a very amazing last scene and the tearful girl shares the joy of returning soldiers, giving her flowers to cheerful families. <br /> <br /> Stylish and striking camera work is the one that carries the film, as well as the honestly played story. <br /> <br /> Tastefully made, but maybe English subtitles didn't speak the whole story because some of the plot elements seemed a bit blurry for me as if they'd gone over. <br /> <br /> To sum up, it's easy to understand why it won prizes at Cannes Film Festival. Reminiscent of another great Russian film, BALLAD OF A SOLDIER.
