I finished this movie for the first time and I have to say I'm very impressive. <br /> <br /> How bad. How full of despair. How horrible. Unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Visually stunned, I have several scenes that are the first appearance of fantastic transport ... the soul of David Holm as he rises from his body ... his spirit on his knees, praying. <br /> <br /> This movie takes a simple story - this is the story of a haunted driver of a cart that has been killed to collect the souls of the dead year after year, bringing it to the current device. movie and then uses setbacks as a tool to explain how David Holm gets into his difficulties. <br /> <br /> I would like to release it on a DVD to see more. Everyone should.
