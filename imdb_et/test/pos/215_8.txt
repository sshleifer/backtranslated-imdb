A criminal short-lived exhibition that went on to three movie spin-offs (Naked Gun 1, 2 & 3) is a fast-paced, fast-fire comedy with more beats than missed. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielsen plays Detective Lieutenant Sergeant Frank Drebin, an incompetent detective who worships and runs through cases, with his superior ability, Captain Ed Hocken. <br /> <br /> The story is the best, but it is deliberate, because the goodness here is not about storytelling, but about knitting a continuous joke with some really strange and amazing characters. The jokes themselves come in many forms, whether they are word games, punches, bumps or background games, most of them striking, although some fall flat. This is inevitable if this "gag every few seconds" approaches that some fail but the relationship is good. <br /> <br /> Characters are a pleasure. A weekly guest who dies every second of opening an episode is a laboratory that seems to be an expensive and unusual experiment with a shoe shining with children, some sort of oracle, writing is sharp and sharp as a cutlass. <br /> <br /> Although it was not particularly successful at that time, it developed rapidly in culture, many blaming the lack of success of exhibitions that they were far from their time and too complex for the target audience. nothing but Matt 'Simpsons' Groening: and he should know. <br /> <br /> Today's standards, when you see it through this aspect, are your treat.
