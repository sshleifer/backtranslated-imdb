"Are you alone at home?" belongs to the cable TV premiere when networks wanted to offer an alternative to popular TV shows. It is a well-thought-out thriller with talented and reliable situations. Kathleen Beller plays a high school student who receives many threatening letters. Everyone seems to think it is nothing but prank, but Beller is really scared. Tony Bill and Blythe Danner play Beller's parents, Ellen Travolta (John's sister) is a high school director and Dennis Quaid has one of his earliest roles to be filthy rich. It is a competent cooler that still has the appropriate social message. Beller is cute - if you are 30 years old or older, you should remember that he was very popular with young people. Blythe Danner, which I usually dislike, delivers truly mobile performance. Nice little movie.
