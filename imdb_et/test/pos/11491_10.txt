This is a really big and beautiful movie. The main theme of this film is the innocent child (Heather Graham as Joline), who is trying to make his na√Øve desires about how the world should be reasonable by constantly beating in the real world. This is not an unhappy movie - quite the opposite. It's funny on the sad side of the movie, but just thinking about the movie makes me so happy. At the beginning of the movie, the beautiful, vulnerable Joline is a drug addict who is trying to get into a friend's car. He justifies him, persuades him to seek help and gives him $ 30 in the beginning. At the end of the movie, he returns to pay back, explains that he has done the drugs well and he thanks him. I hear the claws nervous. * Of course * that would never happen. This movie is not in the real world. It happens in a world where we wanted us to live. The sad part realizes we don't live there. The happy part is knowing that there are people who want to do it.
