Peak Practice was a British drama series on GP operation in Cardale? a small fancy city in Derbyshire's top region? and doctors working there. He ran ITV in 1993â€“2002 and was one of their most successful series. Initially, he celebrated Kevin Whately's Dr Jack Kerruish, Amanda Burton's Dr. Beth Glover and Simon Shepherd's Dr. Preston, although the number of doctors would change several times during the series. <br /> <br /> The series tented in 2002 and ended literally when two series of main characters fell into the rock. Viewers write to ITV in their thousands of people, and Peak Practice Online published one last episode. But all the claims were unsuccessful and ITV said they were no longer episodes. <br /> <br /> Peak Practice has been replaced with Sweet Medicine, another medical series that has been designated in Derbyshire. It took an episode before giving up the schedules. <br /> <br /> Cardale was founded in Crichi's Derbyshire village and was shot there and in other nearby towns and villages of Derbyshire, especially Matlock and Ashover. After the end of this program, ITV attempted to launch the Sweet Medicine series, which extended the stories of different characters in the original competition.
