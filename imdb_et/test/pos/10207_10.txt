I saw this movie for the first time in the 40s when I was a kid, and I always remember the end. There is no first impression, but some movies are always every time they are viewed. Something just resonates with them. This is one of those films and I agree with another reviewer who said that Fritz Lang should have directed more Western countries. I've always liked Randolph Scott and Robert Young to add it. In fact, Robert Young marks what I consider to be my favorite movie when I have to name just one, not a simple thing. This movie is Northwestern. This brought me to Kenneth Roberts' great historical novels. Western Union also led me to read Zane Gray's novel, which in this case turned out to be a rare case where I like the film better than the novel. Not that the Gray novel is bad; I like the movie story better. The film is not like a novel. This is a completely different story, one of the biggest deviations from the book I've seen. <br /> <br /> I can't add much to the comments of others except to say I agree with many of them. I also want it to be published on DVD. "What happened to Randolph Scott was the best for me."
