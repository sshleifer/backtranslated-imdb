The last part of the elementary trilogy of Deepa Mehta, a Toronto-based Indian film director, has ended with water (2005), almost ten years after the first controversial element "Fire" (1996), followed by a slightly less controversial sequel to "1947: Earth" (1998) . Mehta made his debut debut at a 24-minute Canadian short film "At 99: Louise Tandy Murch's Portrait" (1975), but it was her Canadian film about the lives of Indians living in Canada who brought her fame back to the East, her country by birth, "Sam & Me "(1991). Recognition internationally arrived at Camilla (1994), starring Bridget Fonda with an actor who, in 1990, won Oscar in the leading role in the 80s, who paved the way for middle-aged actors to have the hope of being a stubborn old Jewish woman "Driving Miss Daisy "(1989), late by Jessica Tandy. <br /> <br /> Camilla dealt with the friendship between two women from the second end of human life, the May / December friendship. "Camilla" was Tandy's last picture; he died that year. <br /> <br /> The international fame followed Deepa Mehta in 1996 with a controversial fire that spread with fury in a misguided patriotic consciousness. Having already studied friends between two women at Camilla, "Fire" went a step further in Mehta to portray more intimate relationships between two lonely neglected women. Nowadays, two brothers and their wives are located in the suburbs of the capital city of New Delhi, the older brother (Kulbhushan Kharbanda), who has joined the strange Hindu sect, leads the life of celibacy that is faithful to the guru of his sexual existence. . The younger brother (Javed Jaffrey) has a marital status with a Chinese woman (Alice Poon). So both women, Shabana Azmi, the wife of older brothers, and Nandita Dase, the younger woman, are ignored in their own way. One is forced to lead a celibate life thanks to his wife's eccentricity and the other whose only communication with the spouse is through sex, and nothing else. Living in-law in the world and being the only two outsiders in a family who have no trust in anyone, these two women fall into one another's hands. So the question of lesbianism comes. If there were an external man's shoulder that would cry, it would probably have been possible for them to fall into the man's hand, but who had no trust, their need for support from each other is quite obvious. This does not necessarily mean that all neglected women take on lesbianism, just because of two women in this context. All in all, the movie is very good and goes deeper than two women in bed. The main focus is not on lesbianism in the film, but today's neglected Indian women, even in the capital, are still two sexual characters. <br /> <br /> Two years later, Deepa Mehta's second part of the motherland, which appeared in India under the name of "1947: Earth", was another great film made by a great director, this time rated unlike "Fire" in English. <br /> <br /> Now, Deepa Mehta has succeeded in completing the trilogy, despite many problems since the last installment has been released recently. There is no doubt that it would be as big as the other two.
