<br /> <br /> SPOILERS WITH THIS REVIEW <br /> <br /> Long Kiss Goodnight is another good example of the common misery of many modern films; it starts with a very interesting concept - a trained assassin whose memory was erased, restores its own consciousness - and initial tuning is involved, but it seems that the writers do not know very well where to go and the whole thing goes down with increasingly confusing and / or insecure roads, leaving more disappointing something that was OK but promised to be much better. Baddies are remarkably unnoticeable, and even Jackson's comic sidekick seems more like his pre-Pulp Fiction days; it seems that Harlin, like Cutthroat Island, did everything he could to get him to his wife. His essence is the best of the film and this fact makes you feel even more disappointed that they couldn't do anything better with it. There's something about this movie, though. which for me distinguishes it from a mill from a hollywood maker and places it above average if it is fair. This is something very fine that I can't put on my finger; it is a worrying, cold, dark, even sick edge, a horrible and unrealistic feeling, decadent air, an average streak that prevents different ways. It's in dark red photography and the almost constant night where the characters live, it's in Samantha's dreams in front of the mirror, it's in her weak eyes and smiles when she's going to kill a man or when she announces how she enjoys dying with her daughter listening to her gaze is Mitch's return to the car wheel when he spurs so much blood from his mouth that he barely talks about ... I don't know, it's an atmosphere, something I can't define which gives me a rash (a little bit) and makes this movie still strange intriguing.
