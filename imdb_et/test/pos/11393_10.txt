Everything you need for the late 70s and early 80s pornography is all packed with Paul Thomas Anderson's BOOGIE NIGHTS. Although the film is completely fictional, it is supposedly based on the link of John Holmes's girl. <br /> <br /> In Southern California, in 1977, Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) works as a bus at nightclub. One of the loyal customers is pornstar Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) and two of his stars, Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) and Rollergirl (Heather Graham). Jack and Eddie meet and Jack realizes that Eddie is well ... talented. <br /> <br /> So Eddie marks Jack in the movie "Dirk Diggler" under the pseudonym. He becomes a "big" porn star (not intended) and seems to be on top. Then comes the 80s when the film replaces the movie, and Jack's porn empire begins to collapse with Dirk Diggler and all other people working in the field. <br /> <br /> BOOGIE NIGHTS is really a well-filmed drama. There is little violence, but P.T. Anderson makes it stylized. And this is the approach to pornography degradation, especially when VHS became the standard for pornography. <br /> <br /> Lots of bizarre and unique characters. William H. Macy has an interesting role to play as someone who works in movies whose wife keeps sex with everyone. I especially liked the role of Don Cheadle as a Buck stereo salesman. The best result is BOOGIE NIGHTS for Burt Reynolds. 90s classic!
