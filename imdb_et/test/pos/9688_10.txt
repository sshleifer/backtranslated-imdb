These films had to be the funniest movies I've ever seen in my life. I laughed so hard that I almost got dressed. After making the movie, I laughed for about an hour when I thought about the last vision of the movie. It's definitely 100 times better than the first Jackass movie. I loved seeing them all together again. If you're nervous or don't like filthy childish humor, this movie doesn't like it. If you can open it and not take it so seriously, you laugh your ass. Its amazing nobody killed in this movie. Every movie you see in this movie is so original and different if you don't know what to expect. <br /> <br /> Mike Webber
