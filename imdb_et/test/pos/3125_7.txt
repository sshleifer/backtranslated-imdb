This movie is about two horse traders who agree to send a small Mormon group to the desert. Along the way, they come across a murderous son who threatens peaceful people and threatens their pilgrimage. <br /> <br /> WAGON MASTER is what I would call a "little" John Ford movie, as he probably did not have the budget or scope of some of his other Western countries. In particular, this film does not have large letters like John Wayne, but allow some common support characters to focus. The long-lasting character of Ford's stockpile, Ben Johnson, Harry Carey, Jr, and Ward Bond, have been raised to the role of roles, and perhaps the one who came to be the "leader" was probably Johnson - although the other two received almost the same amount of time and focus on the screen. This is not a bad thing, because the movie just worked without a big star - and it's worth a look. It was very good, but certainly not perfect. Especially when the music goes, you probably either love it or hate it. I found some pioneers sons somewhat schmaltzy. It created a beautiful mood, but it seemed like scenes dominated from time to time. I think a little better work has been done. Plus, with constant singing in the background, I was expecting Roy Rogers to come out at any moment. Another small problem is that the plot was amazingly simple and the ending was pretty much a failed conclusion. <br /> <br /> But, and I am happy to say that "it is", although it is rather formal and sentimental, the film worked well. This was mainly due to John Ford's normal management and Ben Johnson's extraordinary performance. He was able to give the film an excellent anchor. Another plus for me is that I saw it in the same week as BRIGHAM YOUNG, another film about Mormon migration. Although BRIGHAM YOUNG was a bit stupid and too "sacred" in his portraits, the Mormons were less "perfect" and more real people - fans and personalities. Oh, and speaking of BRIGHAM YOUNG, it seems that Jane Darwell was "going" the Mormon-themed films during this era because he was the main supporter of both films. Given that he died in BRIGHAM YOUNG and was set about 20 years before WAGON MASTER, it is a bit stunt! <br /> <br /> Also, if you want a glimpse of the famous Jim Thorpe, he has a small role in playing a relaxing Indian dance next to Jane Darwell around the camp fire.
