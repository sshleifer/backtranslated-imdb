Hammer House of Horror: Witching Time is set in the Woodstock Farm in England, where acclaimed musician David Winter (Jon Finch) lives with his actress Mary (Prunella Gee) and is currently making horror music. One night, when he is looking for his dog, Billy David finds his mysterious wife helping, calling himself Lucinda Jessop (Patricia Quinn), who claims to be a witch who has been hiding in the past 300 years. It is probably quite skeptical that David has a hard time believing him to lock him in his farmhouse room and calls on his doctor Charles (Ian McCulloch) to look at him, but when he arrives and enters the room, Lucinda has lost space. Charles makes too much to drink for David, but over the next day David and Mary's strange and disturbing things will happen ... <br /> <br /> Witching Time was a short-lived British anthology horror series 1 episode produced by Hammer Studios on TV and originally aired here in the United Kingdom in September 1980, the first of two Hammer House of Horror episodes directed by Don Leaver (episode 13 of Satan's Mark is another). Since the Hammer House of Horror series dealt with different topics and were all related to each other, except in the name and surprisingly, the viewing time is a dirty and effective little story of the witch, the advantages of Anthony Read's script are small 50 odd lengths & moves at a nice pace. The characters are pretty good, as is the dialogue, there are some nice scenes, and I liked how he never knew whether David & Mary was going crazy. I think this is a well-structured, entertaining and reasonably creepy horror TV show that I enjoyed more than I thought. if that were even possible, there are not so many prime time settings as well as the most well-known Frankenstein and Dracula films, although the modern English device gives it a certain atmosphere that you can touch a little more. Another television-based limitation is that the usage levels are lower than you might expect, there are some nudity & gore, but not much, though I didn't know too much that the story here is pretty good. This is well done for what & Hammer's experience in his feature films probably helped them to see their eyes well, working well for the genre's favorite Ian McCulloch, who has done a bit. <br /> <br /> Witching Time is a good start in the Hammer House of Horror series, when a 50-minute British television piece is pretty funny, so why don't they make such an exhibition any more?
