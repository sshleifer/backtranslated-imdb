Inspired by "Naked Gun" films, Leslie Nielsen - who had just started comedy * - is an incompetent but heroic Frank Drebin, who always has to deal with an absurd case. Like "Fly!" and the films on which the film is based, humor relies on Mel Brooks-style on-the-spot and foolish comments (namely, "yes, this is" remarks) with the fact that Nielsen remains very confused, despite being meaningless around her. And, of course, the final frame in which something moves. <br /> <br /> It's too bad that there were only six episodes in the show. At least it created films. You can't go wrong with Leslie Nielsen in such roles. I suspect they all had fun filming. Really funny. <br /> <br /> * Before the airplane! There were Leslie Nielsen playing films such as "Forbidden Planet", "Harlow" and "The Poseidon Adventure". Later in 1987, he celebrated with Barbra Streisand and Richard Dreyfuss with Nuts. But after the first "Naked Gun" movie, it's all comedy all the time.
