As an explanation, Disney's "Kid" has absolutely something similar to the classic name of Charlie Chaplin 1921. What we have is quite pleasant, though incredible, I feel good family comedy because only Disney people can offer it. <br /> <br /> Bruce Willis plays at the pace with the self-centered stuffed "Image Consultant" shirt. He breaks down, not only his customers, but also his loved ones. You know he must change before the final credit. <br /> <br /> In his life, the chapter of his past, Spencer Breslin, was convicted of the nervous pie at the age of 8 by the character of Willis (Disney always finds these children somewhere). It forces Will to do his past and do well. You know the rest is. <br /> <br /> For Willis's love, Emily Mortimer and Lily Tomlin are their CEOs. Both work hard enough, as most of the film includes the interaction between the Willis and Breslin symbols. <br /> <br /> "Kid", though not the biggest in Disney movies, can still sit back and watch your family and get away from the warm feeling.
