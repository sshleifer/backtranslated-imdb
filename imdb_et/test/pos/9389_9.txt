I love B-horror movies. However, I am generally not a big fan of "so stupid this funny" movies. I just had to evaluate it just because of the death bed: the bed that eats is so kind and so original. there are many question marks, lots of plot holes and the WTF factor is twisted up to 11, but I wasn't really really bored for a second. I could not call it awful at some point. Every minute I said, "What the hell is this bed / movie going on!" I watched it with a friend who was in no way a fan of fear or B-films, and even she was pretty beautiful. the effect was actually very inventive and the colors and atmosphere were pretty good. it keeps a very smooth and even tone in most movies (though incredibly ridiculous continuity) and the operation was not TERRIBLE. I can see from the point that there is a certain inconsistency in bed activity, which makes the suspension of belief almost impossible, but the film itself was such a unique and bizarre concept that it did not bother me. seriously, for me, this film hit a world that I will never forget, but I guarantee I will find myself back in the future for certain scenes. Does anyone else know other movies about live objects that eat people in the genre? absolutely fantastic.
