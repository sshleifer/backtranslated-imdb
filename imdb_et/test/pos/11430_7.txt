Based on the novel by Ermanno Rea, the essence of the friendship that develops between Vincenzo Buonavolonta (Sergio Castellitto, who may be a criminal of Prince Caspian, and led by Bella Martha) is essentially a story. ) and Chinese translator Liu Hua (Ling Tai). They actually went to the wrong foot, the former attacking the latter for his inaccurate and slow interpreters, which he wanted to say to a Chinese delegate who had purchased equipment that was faulty. Vincenzo wants to do the right things that are rare these days, and that means potential buyers are told what the mistakes are and the complexity of buying them, and given that he is disturbed by the fact that the transaction is still over, he takes time, to consider a component that would put things right. <br /> <br /> But it also means traveling to China to find a hard-to-reach machine that is well hidden and seemingly lost without trace. With Liu Hua's original reluctant help, they went from this treasure harbor town to a city that takes us to the lesser-sighted China sights away from Beijings and Shanghai, to Wuhan-like cities. steel mills and nuclear power stations, where their smoke chimneys determine the landscape. The powerful Yangtze River is also out. Along the way, such travel-like movies, such as learning culture, ideals, food, and basically, understanding that the world is unfamiliar, if only one tries to unite. Although some romance is recommended between the two wires, it is rarely a controversial issue, until it may be late in the movie (hey, the opposites are attracting, not?) <br /> <br /> Apart from large industrial companies and factories, we can see a variety of summer industries like sewing workshops who work in a sweat shop like the environment, and I believe that cotton also comes with noodle production. As a film, he gave me the opportunity to travel without leaving my seat, and gave him the recognition that he did not give a moral high ground for exploitation and he liked it. And for both movies, rather than (and I do not name here) any other film / intercultural collaboration, where dialogue is forced to duplicate and become unnatural and truly irrelevant, to participate in a dialogue based on the native languages ​​of the characters. Some may say that supportive characters are too kind, always opening their hands and doors to foreigners, but I would like to imagine that perhaps more people in rural areas are generally more sincere, friendly and basically not in racing to ride with others, or to be cut off . <br /> <br /> If there is a removable message in the movie, besides mentioning that the world is unfamiliar, it will remind me that some of the things I consider important may not be to others. The importance is something that is something else, and its foundation really depends on how we define the boundaries. So, given our limited lifetime, I think I should shine a little more, live and live, and sometimes despise the illusion that ignorance can be bliss.
