I love the absurdity and amazing humor of Buñuel's surreal films (such as the "discreet charm of Burma" and the name of the "destructive angel"). Other, earlier works (such as "Forgotten Persons", juvenile offenders from the marginal neighborhood of Mexico) are more serious and offer a strong social message. <br /> <br /> But I believe it is "Nazarin", the most successful shooter in the heart of the viewer. Although it is true that it is passionate, it still shows the Buñuel aspect that seems to be fascinated by the beauty and solemnity of spiritual search. Then, when the director (quite typically) throws countless thugs in the Catholic Church, he also surprises that he admires the practice of true Christian thought and self-conscious love. <br /> <br /> "Luis Buñuel praising Jesus for a similar figure? I always regarded him as a completely cynical artist without a trace of faith in the human race ... this is until I looked at" Nazarini. " Difficult to follow Christ's example in a society infected with thought, ignorance, and sin, but he also puts a lighthouse in the midst of darkness in the midst of the dark sea of ​​the hero, Father Nazario, undoubtedly looking at him at the end of the movie and not on him. (unfortunately, if he can't do good in this world, who can do it?) But I would say that this "mistake", his disappointment, makes his character even more heroic because it shows how a person he is and how difficult his fight must be, and who says that the priest cannot finally get out of this "dark night" and restore his confidence? Maybe we have only been given a spiritual path Elegant, open end (where he desperately agrees with a woman's foreign fruit) allows us to imagine the end result of the story. <br /> <br /> In Buñuel, I confess an aggressive, self-conscious atheist with a brilliant spirit and social consciousness; but after watching "Nazarini", I also feel a certain amount of warmth, depth and maturity that is not so obvious in his second work. <br /> <br /> For the sake of contrast, I suggest that you closely monitor his short film "Desert Simon" (also in Mexico, several years later). It deals with a similar topic - the abandonment of the ego in the temptation of temptation - only in a hysterically funny and completely unreliable style.
