I was in school at the end of the sixties and early seventies, and this film is very much about how my school was. Playing school where leading actors can do what happened in my school. Crazy, boy, my school only when we went cross-country, we would have a smoke! "Crash", some of my school broke through the sky and broke the canes! after that they were kept safe !!! And like some internal activities! What can I say .... The film was released in 1982, I remember that as it was when I bought my house and the movie was shown at the same time. If you like British movies and movies from school, growing and periodicals, this is for you. Another similar movie "SWALK" appeared a few years ago and I would like to see that again "Kes" is in the genre. Highly recommended. (But trust me, 1982 is when he came out)
