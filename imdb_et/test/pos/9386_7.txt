As Roger Corman has said in an interview, making low-budget films for filmmakers allows them to win prospects. Well, you would be hard to find a movie that will succeed as much as George Barry's "Death Bed: Bed See Eats". <br /> <br /> The movie has a story back to it, it's interesting. I'll give up any details so you can listen to them yourself if you take the opportunity to watch it. Suffice it to say that the title of the furniture is an insatiable hunger that consumes inequality with bubbling yellow foam that dissolves the victims like acids. <br /> <br /> "The Death Bed" is terrible, the haunting little scam plays its absurd assumption that it goes beyond the usual Schlock price range. It occupies the world of dreams so I could take it seriously. It's a really strange and unusual horror shot. It speaks of usable ingredients - there are some delicious female nudits - and there is art, though art, with a totally skewed sensitivity. <br /> <br /> The different effects are not too bad for a microscopic film, and Barry gives the film a good and atmospheric "midwife movie" quality. The cast actor is as sure as one might imagine, even though Patrick Spence-Thomas gives the artist / narrator a reasonable amount of gravity, and one sure point of interest is to see one familiar face: the future of "Boy Meets World" father William Russ! <br /> <br /> This film may not even find that little cult that followed when it was not, if the pirates were rounds; it must certainly be one of the cases where such a practice eventually helped the film - even if exposure lasted for years. <br /> <br /> If you have a truly bizarre obscure taste, "Death Bed" may be just what you mean. <br /> <br /> 7/10
