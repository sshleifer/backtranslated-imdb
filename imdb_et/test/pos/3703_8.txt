"Caribe" is not one of his narrative aspects. Nevertheless, it offers a wonderfully pleasant story with excellent cinematography. The narrative structure is set around two narrative axes, one of which affirms another, each with elements that are interrelated and exist in great harmony. The story never loses a better pace, and it shows a very good mix of human beings with the natural environment (which in itself is a sign). It's great and we owe it to the emerging director Esteban Ram√≠rez. In addition, these characters are very well written and masterfully complex; so when you get to know them, you can feel your feelings without even saying anything. I cannot say that I liked this picture because of the leap from this whole (in Costa Rica), but rather because it really achieves an interesting portrait of what happens when you intervene in the balance of people's lives. Hopefully, Caribe will make a reference to Costa Rica for future projects, as it is a very good example of making a nice movie.
