First of all, before reading the review, I read here about every review of The Muppet Movie, and I can't believe anyone could give a negative view of such a movie. (Luckily there was only one.) I mean, I understand how someone doesn't like Star Wars because of the whole Sci-Fi genre, but not like a film that marks some of the most loved dolls in human history is almost sad. Okay, I'm gonna get out of my soapbox and watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Muppet Movie came out when I was seven. All my friends wanted to see it as a birthday movie, so I think I saw it in theaters about four times in the first few months. <br /> <br /> As a child, many of me and all other Muppet films and TV shows drew me. Singing was probably the main thing. Most of The Muppet Movie's are classic. From "Rainbow Connection" to "I'm going back there ever", they are entertaining and thought-provoking. <br /> <br /> As an adult, I see almost a different kind of movie light. Yes, the things that made me happy as a child are still there, but it's a little fun and one that is just fun. <br /> <br /> I mean, if you mean, Jim Henson is a sick man. <br /> <br /> Kermit is a frog, and it's in love with a sweet pig that carries purple gloves and can carat you into two pieces. Fozzie is a stand-up comedian bear. Gonzo is "any" that is on the chickens. Then you have two older men who collide, a piano dog, a rock band with a manic drummer, a Swedish cook you don't understand, and a host of other signs that are just eccentric. <br /> <br However, for these reasons and more, Henson has found millions of children and adults, giving us something special to watch and remember. <br /> <br /> 'Muppet Movie' is always in my heart for many reasons, but I think the biggest thing is that it is a movie, unlike many of the latest children's films, that I feel comfortable. children watch. Plus, I don't forget about jokes that are fooled by my kids. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie that will be remembered forever.
