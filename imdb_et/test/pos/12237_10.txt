I think this is a fabulous movie ... I looked at it from the time I was 4 to about 8 years old ... But watching it brought many nightmares. Especially I got them because the man who was always like "the other world" and his friends. I'm 12 years old and I'm getting a nightmare from that day. I can't sleep right now because I mean. I love this movie, but it's so scary! I really love this movie, but I have very good memories of it. Kate is very good in this movie. Amazingly, I don't understand that it was her! I also think the graphics were of very high quality, contrary to what some other people think
