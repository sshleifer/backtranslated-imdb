Despite the foolish situation, the ridiculous plot equipment and the low budget, the tourist is striking. An inventive, beautifully scanned film must be seen. You have to throw the rationality out of the window to fully understand what the director was trying to do. If you can manage it, you will have a pleasant surprise. Note that this is one of the few semi-classical horror films that many descendants did not break.
