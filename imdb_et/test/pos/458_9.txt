During the Hungarian Revolution in 1956, this story is just about stopping a good Cold War book or movie, because an international group of foreigners is trying to smuggle Jason Robard from Hungary to Austria. Nevertheless, the story adds three things, making it a very good movie. <br /> <br /> Firstly, participants use the actual languages ​​of their roles. Russian soldiers speak only Russian; Hungarians only in Hungarian; Germans only in German except to a minimum extent to tell the story. Because Debra Kerr is English, she only speaks English, and of course Yul Brynner and some others speak English for the story. As a result, it is imperative that the audience's empathy be changed for travelers. The viewer shares all the confusion and doubt that they are involved in illegal border crossings if they cannot understand the language they are talking about. Very popular feelings arise in the audience and, despite the heavy use of foreign languages, the audience never gets harmed by following the film. No subtitles are required. <br /> <br /> Second. I was in Hungary in 1995 and I tell you that this movie is right. From the gypsy music that goes beyond dinner to underground caves in buildings, where much of the activity takes place in village scenes, realism is incredible. When I didn't eat in the real restaurant, I ate it twice. I thought I was actually walking on the street of this village head. (In fact, the film was filmed in Austria). Third, and most importantly, this film reconnects the magnetism between Deberah Kerri and Yul Brynner (after the king and myself) and between them when the story is something qualified for the Oscar. Of course, Yul got an Oscar to play this relationship, so Acadamy didn't give him another one, but it's the quality of the movie. Don't miss it.
