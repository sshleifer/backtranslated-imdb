I found this movement beautiful, enjoyable and uplifting. Initially, I was interested in the film's local sites filmed here in Buffalo. Later I found myself missing in the film power. How do you pay God's gift? The ability of symbols to rise above their base animals and react to God's touch warmed my heart. The whole audience welcomed the movie at the end. I left the theater with my grade, joy in my heart and hope for the human race. What can one more movie do? Hollywood, I hope your attention. America likes positive films.
