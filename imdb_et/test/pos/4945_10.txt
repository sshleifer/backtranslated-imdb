Soul Calibur is stronger than ever ... with the creation of a new character and the version of the sword mode of bad chronicles at home. <br /> <br /> The arcade version is more complete, although the list of characters is smaller than the home version, this version is undoubtedly more beautiful, eliminating all the "goofy / unrealistic" fighting styles found in the home version. If you were somehow disappointed with the home option or thought it was "too much," you can find a lot more pleasant and straight back and forth on the Soul Calibur game. Think you have what is the Legend?
