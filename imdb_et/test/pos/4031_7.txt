This movie is not really a 1949 O'Brien film (which is great). It borrows the main assumption - the man is poisoned and spends the rest of the movie to find his killer. But I like that the writers chose an English professor instead of the main protagonist. The plot is also quite original. In general, the movie moves fast enough to keep you awake. But what this movie is about is strange date-related quality (probably due to the frightening 80's original music spot) and the affected "noir" feeling. Dennis Quaid inevitably expects the film inexplicably in moments, but he is still generally convincing. Meg Ryan is a student helper / love interest. When a movie becomes a bad thing, when Dex (prof) meets a British bodyguard / driver and their duels are pretty ridiculous. The bodyguard works for a rich widow (played by lovely Charlotte Rampling), but these scenes are too self-conscious to "help" the film, although the family's "plot line" is quite interesting. Dex also looks up in the same place and looks for this bodyguard that is quite casual. In the last part of the movie, the man is out of the window and you can see him jump out - this was a rather bad direction. But aside from some of these obvious mistakes, I think it's still OK. I certainly did not predict the end, so it was good - is twisting, and although some of the posters here think they are being misled, I thought it was a subtle and credible end. Dennis Quaid, with its strange smirks and black eyes, is more pleased with the right things, the big fireballs, the interior and the Cold Creek Manor. But here, like Dex, he should be a bit jerk, so he did well. A pretty decent movie.
