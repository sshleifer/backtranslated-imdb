This is the ultimate in horror films this year. "House of Wax" is one of the most frightening movies I've ever seen. This version makes the film's version of Vincent Price ashamed. I only know some of the youngsters in the movie. Never worried about Paris Hilton; The pain you know is what seems more tempting than ever. At least he did not try to copy his notoriety. Well, if he likes to do horror, he's better than "Fortune Wheel" Vanna White. She wins Vanna HANDS DOWN! And the scene where "House of Wax" was made was not a joke. The house was made of wax and the victims could get out of there before the spirit was like their friends. These two twins Bo and Vincent (deformed twins) were maniac. The parents raised them well, except for Vincent. And I think they became equivalent. How it happens that someone on the second pick-up is horrible, but not as bad as the other two. This is another story in the book. I think he had to follow his heart, not the other twins who made Ambrose a "trap" for tourists for unsuspecting victims. This movie is like "Opera Phantom" that corresponds to "Rocky Horror Picture Show". And this movie is one of the most frightening in 2005. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
