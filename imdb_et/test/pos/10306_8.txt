I agree with Andy, this is a good movie. Kevin McKidd's character is credible throughout the film. We are forced to hate him and lately with his compassion. Paula Sage, who plays Roberta, also has a good result. It is thought-provoking and emotional without too much. Credit to Director Alison Peebles and writer Andrea Gibb. Very valuable viewing. The pace of the movie is just right, just raising interest in the topic to roll you over instead of bombarding you with document style. A nice little soundtrack with a movie that was used sparingly again, not to confuse you with the story. Recommended.
