Based on Mika Waltar's book, this is the film CinemaScope's second film is full of rich colors, beautiful music and panoramic views. Plot has sometimes confusing wording, but overall it has a strong social content: man is over his emotions, and that every action is equal. But really enjoy this movie, first look at the movie, read the book. a lot of things that did not appear on the screen and give soul to the depths of Sinuhe.
