One True Thing is a very quiet movie that was opened in autumn 1998 for glowing reviews, but a light box. It speaks to Ellen (Renee Zellweger), a carer who is forced to move home to take care of her sick mother (Meryl Streep) so her father (William Hurt) can run her academic department. These conditions are only general. The strength of "One True Thing" lies in how the actors raise their character over the territory of the Hollywood clich√©. <br /> <br /> Streep is Kate, the perfect homemaker, whose ability to enlighten her charming room is evident in her home screen costume party, celebrating Hurt's birthday. But Ellen has never come close to her mother, and since she graduated from Harvard University, she has a certain murder on her - Ellen almost thinks her mother is a simplified head. On the other hand, he admires his father, who has a special passion: writing. Ellen writes to an aggressive New York company and has almost broken her heart when her newest piece is broken by Hurt. It seems to be a very lonely figure. Ellen's perspectives change and she grows closer to her mother and farther to her father. Hurt makes excuses not to be there when the family needs him the most, and Ellen assumes he has a thing. At the same time, he gave up his desk to spend time with his mother's "cult" group "Minnies" to deal with crafts and also learned that his mother was not as weak as he expected for the first time. <br /> <br /> Too Much, "One True Thing" is a character research masterpiece. Streep again turns to a beautiful performance, this time working on a subtle level that starts slowly, but ends with the brilliant speech of marriage promises. Streep earned the eleventh Oscar nomination for this performance. Hurt is also persuasive as a father who carries a mystery that has not come to an end. But this movie steals Renee Zellweger. Forget "Chicago", "Cold Mountain", "Bridget Jones Diary" or whatever you saw him and rent this movie. It is remarkable in this. Zellweger, in his murders, directs his character in the sense of understanding his parents that realistically, a young woman struggling to hold her lip when she screams.
