Keira Knightley and Sienna Miller Stars Story of Two Women Dylan Thomas alive. Knightley is the sweetest child of Thomas, with whom he is in contact with Blitz. Meeting at the bar, where they reunite, but things get complicated when Thomas brings his wife (Miller) to the next meeting. The women hit it and things are moving at a pace until the man who becomes Knightly's husband joins the trio. It makes things even more difficult because jealousy begins to show its face. <br /> <br /> Beautiful, extraordinarily written and wonderfully acted (all disappearing into their roles), this is a fabulous festive celebration of the eyes and ears. It's nice to see a movie from adult adults. On a purely visceral level, I enjoyed watching the film because the film is so artistic. I have rarely ever seen this beautifully designed film. <br /> <br /> The movie's problem is that I'm not quite sure what happened. Something seemed to be missing and a few times I had to repeat the movie to see if I missed something. This is not bad, but as a result it is not entirely satisfactory. (I tried to look for a line to see how many movies are true, but I couldn't find anything.) However, I think it's a movie worth seeing. This is a beautiful movie for adults who probably have the best leaders.
