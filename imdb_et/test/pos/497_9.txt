I love it. In fact, I looked at it over and over and I could look at it again. This movie is not boring. <br /> <br /> The Vampire concept is revolutionary in this movie. It's a good job, great for today's generation. <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes was born for this role. Stephen Dorff was the perfect vampire. Arly Jover, mmmm mm, can bite me any time and have a sexy accent. Donal Logue offers great comic relief. <br /> <br /> This vampire movie is like no other. I can't wait for Blade 2.
