A festive drama with big sets, costumes and shows? although some people direct Rhetti, Scarlett, Melanie and even Lady Macbeth. Patrick Swayze and James Read are great as two men who are trying to make friendship despite family and location ties. Great villain? you want them all to get very bad. A lot of strong female characters in it? as good as bad. The secondary story is also well developed. Many of the great stars of past ages are hot. Representing good history and conflict between friendship and politics. <br /> <br /> Turn the rainy day with your DVD or VHS player and drink with it. Swarm and cat would be volunteers.
