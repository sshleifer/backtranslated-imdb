forget overpriced "Batman Begins, this is the ultimate Batman movie that you don't want to miss. This movie is everything, and it completely transcends the first mega hit of 1989. The first is in the office, but it's definitely a much better movie, the visuals are amazing , Burton works his magic as he still does in his films. The City of Gotham, the Batman Hunting Forest, is a wonderful sight. writer Daniel Walters takes a step forward to bring you a truly emotional connection with these characters The penguin, which Danny Devito has played perfectly, is the type of tragic character his parents gave up since birth, and in later life, revenge in the world denied him. what the villain could ever say in one movie. The second villain is Catwoman, playing so perfectly with Mich Hell Pfieffer, one of the most beautiful actors of our time, gives a WOW result and steals the show so far away from the past as well as the current living entity. he also has a tragic background. her name is Selina Kyle, and she is a very frightening, mousy secretary to the frightening businessman Max Shreck who later murders him out of the window. somehow he lives and has "awakened" by the cats and decides immediately and from now on to become the legendary Catwoman, not before, of course, the amazing queue, in which he completely unlocks and destroys all his apartment with an Oscar-worthy rage and anger I've never seen an actress. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton's dons casing and cover like Batman and Bruce Wayne and this time is much darker. there is not much to say here except that Keaton is just the best actor ever to play Batman. he just dreams, and he has a Clint Eastwood approach to playing Batman and he is very dark. he doesn't talk much, and when he does, he sounds very cool and he doesn't make his voice sound and fake IE balls "batman" start. he moves around Gotham as a man with his own inner demon. he is pshycologically disturbed, and you know it. on this trip he will take 2 of the most famous baddies to ever love the Batman comic book world. <br /> <br /> I have to say, despite the awesomeness of action plans, like the styles of the coolest Batmobile EVERYTHING, knocking the cutters on the ground and Batman slipping across Gotham, its romantic angle between Pfieffer and Keaton, which really makes this movie the classic best choice to anyone who wants to see REAL Batman's action, I appreciate it with 10, give him more than I can.
