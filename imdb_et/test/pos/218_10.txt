I remember first of all Zucker's brothers and Jim Abrahams in this zaninessi, at first Comedy Central. These days (90s), their programming consisted of Benny Hill's buttocks and the original MST3k, which was equipped with a beard. Frank Drebin (played by a stone, a dead pan, Leslie Nielson) is a process that was first created by the merger of various stereotypical police transmissions (I think Dragnet will meet Showsky & Hutch), a boiled flask full of well-known police TV shows and scenarios. It is distilled 3 times to produce the purest policeman. Forget about Simon Pegg in the Hot Fuzz (save it later). Frank Drebin has failed most often, a terrible leader, a terrible shot, macho, but sensitive and vulnerable. He is the captain of the police investigation methodology (a.k.a - ask Johnny at Leathery Old Shoe-Shine Boy). It doesn't make her a bad cop. Police officers will also be happy. Capt Drebin (note that he is the captain here) has improved it. Together with his partner Nordberg and the rest of the force, parodies of the six golden episodes of the police drama. <br /> <br /> Exhibition is a fun dialog and quotes quotes. Most of the sightings are a bit dated and stupid. Magic never came from sight. At the heart of this was a meaningless and straightforward conversation and activities in the foreground, where the background was crazy. Movies can best be described as 90-minute compilations of the best gags in this series. Think Monty Python and now something completely different ..... <br /> <br /> If you liked plane 1 & 2, naked gun 1,2,3 or super secret, you will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I always liked this series better than movies, even though I saw movies first. Why? 2 words: No O.J.
