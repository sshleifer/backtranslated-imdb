Ramin Bahrani sets up the scene early in the Chop Shop, where I immediately knew where Ale (Alejandro Polanco) and his friend came from. Two of them will get to the subway and as soon as the doors are closed, they will ask if they have the attention of all for a moment and that they are selling candy and M&M or something, and then they will continue selling some bars. If you (like me) have ever been to a subway station in New York, this is a situation that happens to be almost unnoticed. People in the subway often see children like those or minorities who sell something or communicate and talk about something in the subway and do not pay for them. The focus of Bahran may not be on children who sell on subway lines, but for survival and being one, it is in the lower class in America. Later, he is thoughtful and heartbreaking, usually at once. <br /> <br /> In order to compare it with Pixot or bicycle early, it is not too far from jumping (actually at least the father) and the son is with each other, although Bahrani is specific in his documentary style. We care about this character, Ali, who is not older than eleven, and who work in a car where some cars are cleaned and helped to get rid of others and his sister who comes out of town to stay with him. But it is not just because we force all clich√©s apart, you know, brother and sister (more - brother) who are trying to care for each other. Bahrani makes this story available through a simple endeavor, Ali, which goal can be achieved in his situation: saving enough to buy a used food car that Ali and Isamar can use themselves. <br /> <br /> This is all Ali's working, but what Bahrani is brutally showing us is the job Ali has to do to make it happen even when its unpleasant things like the tires of the cars at the stadium in Shea or at one point, the purse steals at a desperate moment. This makes it even more serious when Ale sees what a nurse earns for money on the night side, making a sexual advantage on an abandoned truck on the rider's side. She does not mention this and pushes it away, but it is always something that adds the tension Ale wants to protect her sister. This adds to the tragedy when Ale discovers the actual cost of feeding a truck to a profitable company, which adds even more anxiety that it simply internalizes. <br /> <br /> One could immediately find that Ale is an orphan in the neighborhood, such as a film in the Queens region, which was filmed naturally, as did the work of neo-neo realism (simply to call it realism). practically all the mechanics and staff and the people on the streets - but Bahrani is more focused here and now, and it makes the Chop Shop so immediate and cordial. The film has no trace of melodrama, hardly even a music broadcast from live Latino music from cars and radio programs. Sometimes Bahrani focuses on a very fine moment, which makes it pronounced in the following scenes, such as how Ale is awake, but acts as she sleeps the first night after she knows Isamar's late night, and we see she slip into bed. he knows he's awake but can't say any words. Or many other scenes, poetic touches that seem seamless, like when a man shows Ale how pigeons work. <br /> <br /> It's tough and sharp, as you can expect, and it doesn't give much hope to your main characters, despite the few moments that have been consoled. It is also a perfectly captured hand-made film, where technology, as well as many films and approaches made in urban design, informs and complements the on-screen themes and what they do, but it is never a reckless shot or too flashy. The filmmaker has an excellent "real life" cast (Ale was collected from NYC public school without experience) and knows how not to capture the shot while at the same time gaining brutal art, showing only what she shows. It's not a city of God or Pixote; it is your little masterpiece of character or characters that we usually don't give a second glance (or the first trouble) on our way to New York. If you don't move Ale and his daily struggle, I don't know what to do.
