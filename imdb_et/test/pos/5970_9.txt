Not surprisingly, Larisa Shepitko was married to Elem Klimov, who later directed the most terrifying film of war, "Come and See (1985)." "Rise (1977)"? Shepikto's final film before premature death? is built in the very same form. The film, placed during World War II, follows a couple of Soviet partisans trying to secure their hunger army while avoiding the occupying German troops. The first forty minutes are embarrassing because the two men are pulling between the harsh, snow-covered landscapes, the world around them, completely between life, heat and color (indeed, so monotonously drab is the landscape that it literally took a long time to realize that the film is black and white). <br /> <br /> After capturing partisans from German soldiers, the film becomes a cold meditation for loyalty and morality. When Sotnikov (Boris Plotnikov) refuses to betray his army even under extreme difficulty, less decisive play (Vladimir Gostyukhin) tries to save himself. Is he doing it wrong? The betrayal of Ryback is unpleasant, but the film does not oblige its actions immediately; Instead, the viewer is forced to consider what their own response might be in such a situation. Shepitko pities Playback as Bible shouts in Judas. Both men betrayed their allies to the enemy and were forced to execute them. But when Judas committed suicide (at least according to Matthew's gospel), Ryback even finds this possibility closed? An excitingly tight climax stays loose from the neck. <br /> <br /> 'Rise' pulls her emotional power from Shepitko's amazingly realistic quest. I have no doubt that the two main parties were spending their days at the end of the day, dragging the snow-covered land to their hands and knees, and indeed their misery is that I got really cold when watching the film (seriously, I did). Interestingly, the film speaks of this reality on several occasions, because Ryback is an offer of freedom and then beaten by its German prisoners. This device, although unusual, works well with its Bible allegory; Playback is a test of his dignity, and every time he turns to a new dilemma, he selects selfish alternatives, his own life. At the end of the film he is still alive, but the nightmare of war and guilt remains.
