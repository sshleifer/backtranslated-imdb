So many times, Bollywood has been trying to redefine the Hollywood hit to produce the whole duds. Yash Chopra's interpretation of "Sleeping with Enemy" is a very stylish and well-made film. Shah Rukh Khan has been confirmed by Chawla (who is looking for him best here!). When he realizes that the driver has a groom at Sunny Deolis, he will stop doing something to make sure he becomes. <br /> <br /> Every frame in this movie is a joy to watch. Is Shah Rukh singing his trademark "I Love You, K ... k ... kana!" The good self-feeling scene between Sunny and Driver (who fits perfectly) doesn't feel like eating in boredom. <br /> <br /> Every song in the track is pleasant to the ear, especially Jaadu Teri Nazar and Tu Mere Samne. As I said, the driver sees the goddess in this movie. Darr may not be SRK's best film (this honor goes to Baazigar), but it is definitely one of his most flawless performances! Sunny is OK. He has done similar roles before, but he's good. <br /> <br /> In general, Darr is g ... g ... g! ;)
