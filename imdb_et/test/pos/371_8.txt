I knew the premise of this film, and apparently I can't leave a good sound movie, especially the Master of Suspense director Sir Alfred Hitchcock. Basically, tennis player Guy Haines (Farley Granger) will meet eccentric strangers, Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train from Washington to New York. Bruno talks about a perfect murder, Guy hates his wife, and Bruno hates his father, so Bruno suggests changing murders. Guy probably didn't take him seriously until, of course, Guy's wife Miriam Joyce Haines (Kasey Rogers (or Laura Elliott)) was murdered in the amusement park. The guy is of course the main suspect and Bruno keeps him "in rebellion", reminding him of his "plan" and giving him more things to help him kill the father he wants to die. This murder investigation and the abduction of Bruno threaten his tennis career and his relationship so far to Morton's daughter (Northwest Leo G. Carroll), Anne (Ruth Roman). Bruno realizes that Guy is not doing his murder, so he decides to plant evidence of a crime to blame him, with a Guy monogram in a cigarette lighter amusement park. After his tennis match, Guy and Anne (who probably found a "plan" of murder) compete in the amusement park to stop Bruno, and they have a fight over the carousel over control. Patricia Hitchcock (director's daughter) also plays Barbara Morton, Marion Lorne, Mrs Anthony, Jonathan Hale, Mr. Anthony, Howard St. John Police Captain Turley and John Brown prof. Collins and Hitchcock fireball man. with a double train. Some are interested in dialogue and character reciprocity, some good breaks and, of course, an unforgettable carousel, a good classic film. It was called the Best Cinematography Oscar. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 100 on the biggest pop culture icon, the film was 32,100 years, 100 Thrills. Very good!
