You just went to YouTube and finally watched this Oscar-nominated short film directed by Richard Condie. I had previously watched his funny start there. Here's a couple of Scrabble. Her husband shakes her eyes while her husband has only E. beside her. The woman leaves for some time to remove her bed and bath (!) From the vacuum before catching her husband looking at her. In a nutshell, before that, the husband tries to get a TV show called "Sawing for Teenagers", whose stars catch something and the husband gets his own sight. This program is interrupted by a special report on the nuclear war (the journalist is a skeleton here) because all the panics outside, although the husband sleeps during this time and thinks that the parade is going on, because he and his wife continue to play in the dispute ... other bizarre things. Quite fun and worth watching for any animation. Can't wait to see more animations from Mr Condie.
