The film is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful. I liked the movie. Can anyone tell me how do I get this movie from songs? Even the soundtrack does. If this is not possible, can I get at least the names of the songs with my singers? I tried to look for amazon.com but it wasn't there. I tried the CD, not from there. I was browsing Google for details but there was none. I would appreciate it if someone could answer my question. I know the songs belong to Country Music and they are sung by a painter. I need titles with the singer. I recommend this movie or rather songs to a loving person in any country.
