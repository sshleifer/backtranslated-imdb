I had completely forgotten "Midnight Madness" until I found it during IMDB surfing. It has all come back to me now .... <br /> <br /> It was one of Naughton's first films (as well as Fox), and the sharp-eyed experts also choose Kaplan (Henry's "Alice" on TV), Fiedler (she makes a voice "Nut" in Cups) and Blocker (Dan Hoss Blocker Son from TV "Bonanza"). <br /> <br /> But the two who stand out in my mind are Furst ("Animal House") and superdude himself - Eddie Deezen. Furst plays annoyance at this time and has one of the best scenes when he asks his father, "Why can't you just pick me up, who am I?" His father looks over his obese, butterfly frames and gives a simple, one word answer - "Yuck!" <br /> <br /> And Deezen ... well, she shows herself. As the last day of Jerry Lewis he stumbles around, going to mini-golf ponds, putting the melon halves on his ears and reaching Maggie Roswell drops him. My hero. <br /> <br /> As for the film, this is typical of the beginning of the 1980s with the stupidity of college children who stay after an hour and go to the whole city to prove which student division is the best in the university: jocks, nerds, rich kids, feminists or a group that is made up of little. <br /> <br /> Who wins? Who cares, you will have a lot of fun with Disney Pictures' first PG viewing before you create them. <br /> <br /> Seven stars. Catch "Midnight Madness" in any way! <br /> <br /> Lively Leon!
