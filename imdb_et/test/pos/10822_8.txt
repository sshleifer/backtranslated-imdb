Even if it doesn't give more than the previous posts here (like Ruby Liang very good), I wanted to share my position. I hope my English is understandable. <br /> <br /> Bon is a rhythmic, light but deep performance in the unorganized French appearance, as well as courage and charm. In 1940 in France, which was remarkably reconstructed with many details (Bordeaux luxury hotel, owned by HQ and attacked by useless high-level French, Parisian coffees Le Pantheon / rue Mouffetard and 1930s cars) Gérard Depardieu and Yvan Attal play their second role in Isabelle Adjani and Virgnie Ledoyen are very trustworthy in their drastically different roles and Grégor Derangère makes an amazing performance :) <br /> <br /> Much easier than average (eg American) war movies and focused civilians show many things in French (even as I am a French man), some of them are quite deep.
