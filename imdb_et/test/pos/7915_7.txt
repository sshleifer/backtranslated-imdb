Eisenstein's first soundtrack repeats the 1242 ice battle, when the Russians under Alexander Nevsky won the Livonian knights who wanted to bring Russia under Roman Catholicism. Made in 1938, Nevsky can be seen as a propaganda piece: Germanic knights, their miserable (and somewhat funny) helmet are obvious pillars for the Nazis. Rüütel's meat industry, when they enter the Russian city, appears to be a prophetic warning of the massacres of World War II. The film ends with a warning: those who came to Russia with the sword will die through the sword. Made gently black and white (somewhat reminiscent of daguerre), which also marked Eisenstein's official profit. In the late 1920s, Stalin wanted Soviet filmmakers to stop experimenting and make more populist and tasty films for the Russian population. It stopped Eisenstein's career in Russia for ten years, and Nevsky came back with his more accessible film. The strength of Nevsky is on the other side of the battle, and it is rightly seen as a milestone in film history: ever (and probably never) the battle would be so lively. Another strong point is Prokofiev's beautiful, haunted soundtrack (the composer's use of film scoring was completely unusual at that time). One of its weaker points: the comic relief (in the form of two simple Russian soldiers trying to despise a beautiful Russian peasant) is really dirty.
