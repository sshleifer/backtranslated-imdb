Susie Q is a wonderful romantic prom movie. Amy Jo Johnson (Susie Q) is a great actor. I think he did an excellent result. I hope that sometime Disney Company could put this movie on DVD. I think it's cool and a little fun. It's kind of sad when Susie Q dies at the beginning of a car accident that makes you want to cry or noise. But in the middle, if anyone suspects Susie Q, he gets such a funny and surprising one. There's a bit of mystery in this movie, but not much. But I would still recommend this film to the whole family if they enjoy comedy, understanding or romance. It's great! I think Amy Jo Johnson as Susie Q is cute.
