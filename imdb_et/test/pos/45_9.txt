Just a great soundtrack. Really enjoyable music. Outstanding cast, great leadership. Worth a look. <br /> <br /> Don't really explain what happened to a neighborhood. You are left with the feeling that integration is to blame or that the nature of the neighborhood is falling apart. <br /> <br /> This movie looks well researched and well-designed. I especially enjoyed some of the smaller characters like Jeffrey Wright. <br /> <br /> Cutting during the cutting period will help you express what a lively, interesting and desirable experience in the nightclub would be like jumping music, food, drink, dancing, gambling and sex.
