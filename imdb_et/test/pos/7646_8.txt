I like Armand Assante and my cable company summary seemed interesting, so I looked at it twice and probably again. <br /> <br /> The early part is difficult to follow, but later it turns out. I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying the open ends. <br /> <br /> Some actors are not convincing, but perhaps because I was always waiting for a double cross. In this case, the bad behavior would be insecurity of the interacting characters, so it fits very well. <br /> <br /> An important issue is the Carnival owner (Assante) who is laundering money for a local casino and his snake-charming woman (Dagmara Dominczyk) wants to steal it. She complains to Archie (Friday) about how terrible her life is, and how she could help her out. <br /> <br /> There is a twist of 3 or 4 plots (which is probably the cause of all those loose ends) and just when you think you've solved the mind, something else happens. <br /> <br /> My 8/10 score is mostly for the plot. <br /> <br /> I won 't say anymore - I'm not like spoilers, so I don't want to be one, but I believe this movie is worth your time.
