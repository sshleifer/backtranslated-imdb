Michelle, Anic√©e Alvina, was so nice and I really love her. He died a few months ago! Friends? Really the best film for young people. Elton's and his organizer Paul Buckmaster's "reprise of seasons" sings my head forever ... My 26-year-old husband saw it as Juniors in HS. Yes, he was my boyfriend and still is. I think we both shouted out. I think we can pull this movie by Elton John's music, but then they all collided with the teenage angst. Paul and Michelle were almost at our age when we saw the movie - so easy to identify! It's nice to hear that Sean is doing well, I'm also in "assisting professions" (RN). I thought his performance was good and very credible. "Michelle" became very sweet, fragile and vulnerable. I think the main point is that if they didn't have to deal with the "real world", they could be happy and fall in love. Many times, we all just wanted "Calgoni's moment". If we all had no external concerns and could simply deal with our "basic needs", it would be somewhat easier. I have a 15 year old daughter and she has no problems seeing this movie. Children are so bad these days that it is very annoying. For those who are trying to find a CD, my spouse (a big Elton John fan) got a 2-CD set that came out in 1992. This is called "Elton John-rare captains" for Polygram studios. It has both friends' songs and many others. As far as we know, this is the only CD with "Friends" music. We also had LP years ago and were excited to find a CD. Success. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves "young love". I just want it to be on DVD now!
