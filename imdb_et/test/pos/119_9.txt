Finally, in my trilogy, I watched the third film, "Fire." To begin with, I would say that "water" was an undisputed masterpiece at all levels. Fire will come next if Earth is behind quality. Fire: There's so much going on in this movie that I need some more to drink. Writing is great, the script creates friction that triggers the entire "heat" process from start to finish, when it really comes out of the fire, the conflicts move in the relationship completely. <br /> <br /> Mehta is one brave lady: she sees a lot of eyes that are yellow, false and repressive to the great society she is from. India is changing rapidly these days, but much of it is economic change. That he met such a waterproof opposition to "water" after the script had been erased, shows that there are still many taboo issues that the Indian people are no longer able to face, unable to study or discuss. Worse still, if someone, like Mehta, has the courage to reflect on these issues, he is facing death threats. So, as much as India thinks of being a pluralistic, tolerant society, the facts are not always so. When "Earth" was just a historical background in the killing of civil war after India's independence, fires and water point to personal, social and religious issues, which, as I say, are held so strongly (in a negative sense) that open artistic dialogue is still for many years. As I write, it is shown that this water will be shown in India later this year. I believe it when I see it. <br /> <br /> The fire is confronted with a similar sexual and emotional mix that I saw in the "Price Up" section. Whether it is organized marriages (which it had been among the Jews about 150 years ago, or as it is among many modern Indians), they are at risk of being forced into both men and women; or, just plain unbelievable marriage ..... But this is not a real problem. Mehta is clearly impatient with totally rigid religious attitudes that keep the widow in misery (Water) or keep women enslaved as a bond slave. I am not an expert on secular or pricing laws related to divorce. The film seems to indicate that the divorce stigma is almost as bad as the sad marriage. In any case, the Mehta film is a very moving and powerful experiment in sexual discourse that keeps modern Indian relations under control. Because all three of these films have felt in India, because it seems to me that there is an unjustified attack on their culture, such as the predictable scam of a suppressing mind. Mehta forces you to look at the questions, no matter how much the flack is. I admire her work and can't recommend her movies enough. Excellent, disturbing, provocative, taboo-breaking.
