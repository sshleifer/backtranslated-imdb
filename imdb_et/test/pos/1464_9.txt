The first episode of "Man to Man with Dean Learner", which just inspired me, was at least zeroed in the episodes of "Garth Marengh's Darkness" and I was in "My House". I hope this will keep my TV "faux terribles" doing a good job. Richard Ayoade is one of the best "alternative comedy" breeds (I hate this phrase, but I'm too lazy to think of another.) Comedians on television today. I'm glad that, when traveling to local DVD retailers today, "Garth Marengh's Darkness" was sold to the table. Even her short nose Nathan Barley knew that Ayoade was a serious talent, and I'm sure she would have been great if Dixon Bainbridge was "The Mighty Boosh". During these programs, I also thought it was necessary to extend my review to secure a place on this public domain.
