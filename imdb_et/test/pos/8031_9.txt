All over the world, America is C.I.A. you can find many of the confusion they have left behind. At first, their goals were simple: spy, removing enemy agents, stealing classified information, and destabilizing disadvantaged governments. Years have passed and, while their mission remains similar, their secret black action is now the discrimination of domestic spy, US citizens and intruder organizations in the US, who criticize the US government. However, this film focuses on the world of C.I.A world, which is notorious for "Carlos, Jackel". The film is called "Task" and tells the story of Cmdr. Annibal Ramirez, (Aidan Quinn), US Navy Officer, has a striking resemblance to so many terrorist masters. Recruits Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland), C.I.A. and Amos (Ben Kingsley), Israeli Mosadi's Special Representative, Ramirez is a trained secret to watch, portray, penetrate a difficult-to-understand organization, and then discredit a real Jackel who works for Russians. This movie is exploding and packed with natural traces, killings and transnational chaos. Quinn is a wonderful and surprisingly artistic game on both sides of the war. Just one of his best efforts. ****
