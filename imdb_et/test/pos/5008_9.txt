This show was a pleasant surprise after watching Mad TV on Saturday night. Spike is a great host that you can say it is used to, but it does well with your new job. I can imagine that this is a difficult transition to the writer (Seinfeld) host, but unlike many new conversation indicators, he does not allow flying time while trying to figure out what to do next. He's quick-thinking and every segment and section rolls smoothly. Nor does it hurt that she is sexy in a nervous way, so she's not in sight like Leno or Letterman. I don't remember the exact episode of my favorite, but I especially loved the Idiot Paparazzi scheme with fake J-Lo and Katie Holmes. Great new show !!
