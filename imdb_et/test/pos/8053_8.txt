Born in 1946, I was about eight years old when I first watched this movie and it continued to impress. Not only scary, because of the lack of a better word, this film was haunted for more than 50 years. The mob goon played by John Larch was a terrible Scene that, in my 50 years, pulled out of my mind, was killing a little girl and screaming police, referring to her as a "little n - child". These words were replaced when the movie was recently shown on television, maybe two versions of the movie or someone was forced to change a little bit of this heartbreaking scene. High quality or not the movie went a long way in shaping the southern opinion, and still coming to visit the southern city El Paso.This stand may seem extreme, but there is a bit more story.When the film was recently shown, it became clear why he haunted me for years.With the newspaper as the beginning of this film gives the impression that what is shown is a fact The film is allegedly only made one or two years after the depicted incidents that increase its realistic credibility. The fears in the film are not created by creatures or aliens of space, but by people who live in our society at that time. A: Recent viewing helped me understand more clearly how it spoke to my 8-year-old mind. If this film came out the only school I ever went to, mostly African-Americans attended. The victim seemed like my class girl, was like seeing the actual killing. It made a terrible scene that much worse. Maybe no one would find this review helpful but it helped me.
