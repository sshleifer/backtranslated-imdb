Like many other reviewers, I'm surprised to see a lot of negative comments on this movie. The earlier efforts of Dan O'Bannon were a groundbreaking "Alien" in 1979, as it and Star Wars introduced the stylistic approach of "Used" or "Dirty Rooms" to artistic movement, it does not mean that it was the only way to produce them. <br /> <br /> Instead of leaving Lifeforce out of hand, as a sort of script and primitive exploitation, it is important to recognize that the film is based on the "reputable" tradition of British horror and scientific literature - especially Hammer and American International, such as Quatermass (specifically "Quatermass and Pit", 1967), Doctor Who and "The Day of the Triffids" (1963), if not Gerry Anderson's works ("UFO", "Space: 1999" and "Thunderbirds"). But none of these effects would be surprising if the other reviewers were familiar with the writer's O'Bannon genre sciences' Blood Queen '(1966) and' It! Outside the Space "(1958) -" Alien "Sources (1979). <br /> <br /> This film has some" legacy "elements, but perhaps it's worth comparing this movie to its immediate peers - 1981" American Werewolf London "and" The Wolves Company "(1984) - Other 80s Movies with a Common" Reverse "While They Adjust These Stories With 80's Zeitgeist All three films used previous similar incarnations, but their themes are significant Sexual (because they might), and at the same time, they recognized the language-in-cheor, humorous aspects of their projects. <br /> Neil Jordan '' Wolves '' played for many psychoanalytic memes floating in the 80s, while when "American Werewolf" created its theme as an "aging" movie, it is called an artistic license, and the adaptations of these three films are no less valid than the last day's drama inherent in the "Scream" franchise, "I know what you did last summer" and the final destination. "However, these teens target of the films seem to be part of a trend of post offices, while the 80s with films like" Life Force "from a British sci-fi Kanaan - even if it is written by the Americans. <br /> <br /> In this film, there are many ways much better than the last day's disaster and alien invasion rails (Independence Day, Armageddon, Deep Impact), because "solutions" don't live in arms battles, armed loads and testosterone. Not in the other half, it is unfortunate that Steven Soderbergh and James Cameron did not study Tarkowski and Lem before they redesigned Solaris ... <br /> <br /> The purpose of this film was to be fun, not embarrassed or stupid. <br /> <br /> 7/10
