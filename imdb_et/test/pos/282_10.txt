The comic secretary has come back in recent years, Mike Myers' Austin Powers and Rowan Atkinson's' Johnny English ', and lately Steve Carell's' 60s' Get Smart! Back in 1974 was David Jason, who suffered a shoulder and wore a box full of documents marked "Classified". <br /> <br /> Edgar's Secret Life Briggs was his first major role in sitcom, after years of supportive actress at exhibitions such as "Six-Time Barker", "Doctor" Series and "Hark At Barker". <br /> <br /> Humphrey Barclay had found that he worked at the Bournemouth Museum Theater and was impressed by the fact that he was accompanied by Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Eric Idle in the children's comedy show "Don't Adjust Your Set!". <br /> <br /> "TLOF" chose Jason for "Edgar Briggs", a secret intelligence service with a well-meaning but incompetent agent. When John Steed wore a carrier hat, Briggsil was a trilby. When Napoleon Solo wore a radio bug, Briggsil was a pipe. The objects fell into his hands a bit. He read confidential documents in bed, while his wife (Barbara Angell) looked at his wife (on one occasion it would be the other way around). When he monitored a couple of Russian agents on the helicopter, he accidentally switched to the airport's Tannoy system and submitted his plans to catch them! When he hid the train to take a photo of the meeting with S.I.S. man and his enemy contact, he moved with him and took him straight to Brighton! When he tried to arrange an attack on a female Russian scientist, he took a "short cut" to let his pursuers out of a hopelessly lost car park. But like "Inspector Clouseau", he always seemed to end up with a lot of fears from his colleagues. <br /> <br /> As he said earlier, he was married. His wife, Jennifer, understood what she was doing. Though they had once brought him from his high-rise window to shout at him, "a secret service, a secret service that you never think of a secret service!". He shouted back, "Think of the neighbors! They don't need to know I'm in the secret service!" <br /> <br /> Briggs was part of a number whose representatives included "Coronation Street" villain Mark Eden (he was psychotic Alan Bradley) as "Spencer", Michael Stainton as "Buxton" and "Doctor At Sea" Elisabeth Counsell as lovely "Cathy Strong". They responded to the "Commander", which was played late by Noel Coleman. Commander was kidnapped in one episode, leaving Briggs temporarily S.I.S. - Of course, everyone was scared. <br /> <br /> This fun show was performed by Richard Laing and Bernard McKenna who had written for the "Doctor" series. Rather than fake Bond, it was rather a sending of serious spy samples, such as Callan (although he had a bond style theme). Furtive encounters in underground car parks, breaking codes, stolen plans, such a thing. Jason brought a lot of energy to this role, doing a lot of his tricks, such as Briggs fell down the ladder, cleaning his apartment, and dragging the hill into the trash and reminding them of what happened. Pink Panther movies. Briggs had all the ingredients that were striking. Unfortunately, it was not connected to the network. In the London area, it was released on Sunday at 7.25 P.M. where it was disturbed by B.B. C's soap drama "Brothers". It was then transferred on Friday at 7 pm to P.M. because I.T.V. wanted to show his latest American import, T.V. version. Briggs never found an audience. A similar fate hit Jason's next major show: "Lucky Feller 1976". It was only in 1977 and "A Sharp Intreath Of Breath" he found his first successful solo car. <br /> <br /> You can see the title sequence for this series (with two short excerpts in German!) on Youtube. Unfortunately, that's all you see. Jason does not allow his early marking to be repeated or published by D.V.D. Great shame. Today Edgar Briggs's life must remain secret. <br /> <br /> CODA: I've recently seen several episodes and I'm happy to say that it is incredibly good.
