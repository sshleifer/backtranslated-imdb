I am a Czech and soldier (not just pilots) who fled Czechoslovakia after the Nazi invasion in 1939 and fought against them the real heroes and brave men in our history for me. The film "Kolya" (1996), the winner of the Academy Award, is a tribute to these men. It is the first major screen film of Czechoslovak World War II soldiers from "Nebesti jezdci" (1968). I think "Dark Blue World" is a good movie - good acting, good special effects, nice music, and so on. The film is half English and some actors are British. But the biggest thing about this film is pure existence. It is a great opportunity to show people all over the world (and to many people in the Czech Republic ...) that the role of Czechoslovakia in World War II was not only an occupied country, but also an active member of the Alliance campaign. <br /> <br /> Leading characters are older and smarter Frantisek and young Karel. They fled with Czechoslovakia, they fly in the same group and they loved the same woman ... Maybe this is a clich√©, but luckily this story is not so aggressive and is balanced with other scenes (including excellent contests). I don't want to compare "Dark Blue World" and "Pearl Harbor", no one likes PH more and no one likes DBW. But if you like a happy ending, there is no DBW for you. So, I think this is a very good movie for anyone who loves this type of story and a very good movie who wants to know something about this chapter of Czechoslovak history. <br /> <br /> BTW, the main theme of "Dark Blue World" comes from Czech 30's and 40's composer Jaroslav Jezek. He wrote this topic when he lost his eyes ...
