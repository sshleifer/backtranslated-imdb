This review includes a spoiler if you never read the book or saw the cover of the video box. So if you want to know nothing about the movie except that I like it a lot, stop here ... <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are not the first, but the action between the leaders is and they give the novel their alive more than Shute in his novel (although I prefer the novel in general). My very weak objections to the film, not to the book, is that the film slips some relationships between the secondary characters and the guides of the scenes at the end of the film, to offer some not realistic dramatic tension and a general plot device. All this is much better addressed in the book, as a result of which I find that the end of the book is a little more relevant than the end of the film.
