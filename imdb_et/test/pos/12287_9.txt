I don't want anyone to spoil a movie, but it mimics the reality of life in so many ways, and if you are truly honest with yourself, you resonate with it with at least some scene. br /> <br /> Operation is not only plausible, but convincing that it carries one of the characters. What's more, it's funny, without trying too much. <br /> <br /> Yes, I really believe there is a sequel. Watch the movie, you understand why. <br /> <br /> Very recommended, especially if you like real messages.
