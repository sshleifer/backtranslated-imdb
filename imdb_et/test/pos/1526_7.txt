Good news: The director is allegedly committed to Amnesty International's cause and wants to give a firm message about freedom of expression and evil. The plot is clearly original and the actors are two of my absolute favorites. Not so good news: "Original" is not everyone's movie game when you visit movies or video stores. Critics, such as Maltin and Roger Ebert, have also noted the film as a truly failed attempt to make the game a cinematic film. When I remember correctly, the title is taken from the character of Stowe's fairy tale, which has made him a potential subversive and suspicious person in a fictional place where the story takes place. His dreams are dangerous to the government, represented here by Rickman as an intense manipulator interviewer. Since these two people are almost the only ones who come into contact with the film, the director is a real challenge to keep the viewer's attention. Finally, I found the whole thing exciting. Not flawless and certainly not for everyone but cost effective. It is far from being a masterpiece such as Kieslowski's 'Short Movie of Slaughter' or as explanatory as "a dead man walking". But if you are in these films or in a political thriller on Costa-Gavras, you can understand it. Just don't expect any extra sermons or eye filling.
