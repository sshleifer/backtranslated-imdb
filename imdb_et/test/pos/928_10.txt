In the "goofs" section of this movie, there is a comment that there is continuity in which Auguste's car appears to be placed in a different position than in the previous scene of the same scene. It is wrong. One of the views from the Auguste apartment, the other from the Valentiné apartment across the street. The purpose of this segment is to show how Valentiné and Auguste - who may be related to each other - are almost crossroads (as happens several times), but never until the circumstances throw them into the ship. film. (And here's the idea that Joseph has manipulated things so Auguste is on this ferry, checking Valentiné's ticket to see what sailing he's booked.)
