Recently, I rented Twister, a movie I saw several years ago on television, and it's well out of date; I found myself laughing many times loudly and as strange as all these people, I finally take care of them deeply. This is a kind of small film intended for the cult audience because, like Howdy's gazpacho (well, I think that's what it is), it's a acquired taste: you need to be in line with its peculiar wavelength. The production values ​​can be called favorably, and the speed and atmosphere take time to get, but the film has an "appearance", especially in some marvelous shots that contrast the dry smoothness of the earth and the unpleasantness. The interior of the house: Michael Almereyda was also eye-catching. Living with a sodapop magician Eugene Cleveland (Harry Dean Stanton) and his household (two adult children, grandchild and housekeeper) seem so separate from life that we could be in Gormenghaste. Everything in this movie is wonderful (especially Suzy Amis and Crispin Glover as directed geniuses-brothers Maureen and Howdy) who live their role after some time, when you just buy a strange assumption that somehow survives the tornado and is probably powerless fortune, these people are happy but still do not know what to do with their happiness. There are some really great scenes: Eugene's sudden responses first to her gold-mined childrens girlfriend Virginia (in the acidic sense of Lois Chiles), followed by her children; William S. Burroughs took the practice as a target and talks about the mysterious Jim; Maureen's boyfriend Chris proves himself, fighting a tablecloth covered with tablecloth and napkin and old fedora; Howdy, Violet, Maureen and Chris are all sitting on the couch (the last three matching light summer clothes, the former red blazer and the black leather rock'n'roll) that looked at the desert pictures on high TVs and weigh the future (pictures taken by Bill Viola who made Nine Inch Nails' last tour background program). Crispin Glover is predictably great as Howdy: as always, he remains perfect. Howdy has done a cult of his misery and shine; he is like an Oscar Wilde of Kansas, trying to live his red velvet furniture. Whether he throws the electric guitar on but he loudly loosens, a full-length whore, wearing black-and-white cowboy clothes, breaking down the space or simply doing simple things like driving or pouring the so-called soup from a blender, is enchanting. If you like her job, you like it.
