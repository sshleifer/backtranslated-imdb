I saw it for the first time in a short time when I bought a short DVD of a short film a while ago. it is the only short DVD I liked, but I don't like the fact that I love it ... when you spend time with me, you see it. it is beautiful, simple and passionate, no bells, whistles - it could have been done with a spike (but don't get me wrong, animation is elegant and incomprehensible - this person obviously spent a lot of time with cats - but that's just black and white) and then is writing and music ... it's just pretty. <br /> <br /> I eat chocolate, drink wine and watch it over and over ... <br /> No matter what, I expect Pedro Serrazina to do something else.
