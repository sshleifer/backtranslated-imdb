This was seen on the second evening of cable ordering and thinking, "this is the type of film that could have celebrated Alec Guines and Glyn Johns if it was done in the late 50s." Farce in English tradition. Alfred Molina and Brenda Blethyn are very sweet and sincere in their portraits. Naomi Watts just sizzles in dayy Jayne Mansfield-ish (if she could have acted) way. The other casts are big turns and bits. The Welsh landscape is delightful. An absolute assumption, indeed, and not at all credible, but it will not be a joy. Not a big movie, remember, but a really fun time. And Walken is her cunning. We see joy!
