I think it's one of the best Tamil films I've seen for a while. I love the fact that it does not rotate around a man and girl in love, and they made the film perfectly. Great work was cast and I especially congratulate litte girl. She was brilliant and really brought out the lessons of adoption, looking for her true mother. The best are songs, beautiful music and moving words. There are some great songs in this hand ya'll! especially "Kannathil Mutthamittal" and "Velai Pookal". Big songs, both. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy good shouts and great shows (and great songs!). Cheran Simran.
