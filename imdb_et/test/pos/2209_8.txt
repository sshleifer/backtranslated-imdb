At first I didn't think Lauren Ambrose's performance was anything but dim, but when her character was developed, imagination was more meaningful. Amy Madigan seemed too sharp for her role and did not bind her daughter's characters, although it was obvious that her character was unleashed by the character played by Lauren Ambrose. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lloyd has been hit as usual and played his role in encouraging the story. The evolution of his character left the audience wondering why the younger characters were accusing him and what could have been more direct. <br /> <br /> Taylor Roberts played the excess glue of this somewhat vague story. His all-encompassing simplified character gave the movie together. In this central role, Taylor was able to encourage family relationships between characters, acting as an antagonist of all other relationships in the film.
