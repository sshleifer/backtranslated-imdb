This movie was marketed very well. When it appeared in '97. In the year, Master P was in the middle of fame and success, and everything he was on was selling the shelves. That's why it's no wonder that this underground city drama sold over 250,000 copies and is still going. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of No Limit or even have a look at it now. It has a couple of old school phatty videos and won't start with a freaky deaky strippers bonus Ice Cream Party. So I could tell all the people who don't like Master P or No Limit Records to watch it because it's not for you and don't worry about voting because you don't only prevent TRU fans of renting or buying this video with their low voice.
