Who are the stars in this? Never heard of them! But this is one of the funniest comedies I've gone through. It should win the Putz Puller Prize for a parody. The absurd begins with Dr Jeyk in the smell of powder and sex. She is one of the funniest scenes in the film at the beginning of the film, led by libido. Pay attention to the hospital PA system in the background; more like the MASH system. The last scene where Hyde received the award has been laughing for years. Oh ... and "Busty Nurse" is Cassandra Peterson, who went to Elvira, the lover of darkness. <br /> <br /> If you liked Mel Brooks classic movies (Blazing saddles, etc.), I suspect you want it. <br /> <br /> Shit the shame you can't get on DVD everywhere. <br /> <br /> It's now available on DVD !!!!! The good thing about DVDs may not be used !!!!!
