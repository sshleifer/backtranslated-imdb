When we are young, we choose the ideal occupation: artist, actor, writer, rocket scientist, etc. Although most of us grow out of our pipe dreams, the American film's main character is Mark. Let go of your (and age of thirty) age: get rich as a recognized director. Despite the fact that Murphy's Law does not leave Mark alone and something seems to be always wrong, Mark can stay even more ambitious in achieving its goals for every warning incident. His desire to be a director controls his character, that he sees a person in his life or a thing to achieve a goal. When I noticed that other IMDB commentators are against Mark's selfishness, I think it is almost legitimate selfishness, because Mark does not become a famous leader with death. He consistently talks about leaving some signs to the world, and he sees the possibility of making movies to do that. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, every viewer of this film takes early notice that Mark has a chance to get his dream. Is he aware of this? No, not the slightest, and none of his family or friends want to keep him secret (in fact, some of them believe him). Strangely enough, however, the disappointing future that the viewer really feels does not prevent Mark from finding humor in the film. This is a very funny documentary. Most of the laughs come when Mark plays "Coven" scenes. There's a scene where the actor has to break his head in the closet and it just doesn't work. The second scene is Mark's very old uncle Bill, who says a few lines to the camera; Needless to say, after 20 takes a lot of headscarves and Bill-stumbling finally decides he has enough. Unfortunately, a lot of humor comes from Mark. His scenario, which he seems to be worthy of Pulitzer, is ridiculously bad: "It's okay, it's okay, there's something to live in; Jesus told me so." <br /> <br /> "American Movie" Contrary to what people think, there is a documentary that everyone can enjoy (although my sister who watched some scenes seemed to think it was completely odd). The fact that Chris Smith is able to successfully screen a film that inspires both the sadness of Mark's depressing lifestyle and the fun of Bill (who, unfortunately, was lost before the movie was released), speaks a lot about him. I don't know how Dreamer Mark sees this documentary. Does he understand that it casts it in a bad light? Or does it make him show he's stupid in many movie scenes? Or does he see it as something shown before his A&E biography segment? It is interesting to wonder about the topic, and I hope the latter is true for him for a few days. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie: 9/10.
