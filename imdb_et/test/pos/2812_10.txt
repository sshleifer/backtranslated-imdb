Gerald McRaney, (Dave Morgan), "War Crimes", "01 TV Series", was like Tiffan's Thiessen's father, (Jennifer Gallagher), "Kiss Before Lying", 03, who is experiencing a very bad situation in their lives and that brought Jennifer to people and with young men. Dave Morgan is desperately trying to get out of his house and succeeds in introducing Jennifer Chris (Gallagher) who falls in love with her at her first meeting. Almost one or two days later, Chris asks Jennifer if he will marry and agree. After the wedding does not happen after that, it is not a long time, Chris is in the navy and does not like to work on submarines and things are going to happen to neighboring youth. This is a great TV movie and sometimes makes you wonder if this guy or gal I want to be a Soul Mate is Perfect PERSON!
