If you're in the middle of a war and it's still not clear if you come out of it, among the things you worry about, keep the morals of the civilians ... show that our troops have the courage, ingenuity and commitment to overcome all the causes of surprise. And that's exactly what director Anthony Asquith gave the British 1943 War Fleet movie "Dive into Dawn". After more than 60 years it is not surprising that some movies are dated. It does not help that class stereotypes that help define officers' recruited men can be looting. Here, as in many other British warfare films, men always have great regional classroom accents, while officers talk about educated fluency that would place them in the best government class in England. In this film, the captain of the undersea sea tiger, Freddie Taylor (John Mills), is smart, confident, inventive, aggressive, controllable, good with his men, humorous with his peers, quick decision. And it helps to make her happy. His men are fun, mostly competent in their workplace and always ready for fun when things get tense. Although we spend the first thirds of the film to get to know the people they leave, then after that things get tense. <br /> <br /> Taylor and his subordinate are required to destroy the new German battleship Brandenburg. They just leave the ship when it enters the Kiel Canal and leads the Baltic. Taylor assesses the risks and decides that Sea Tiger will then go through minefields, subnetworks and the real danger that there is not enough fuel to return home. After several tense situations, confrontation takes place. Sea Tiger fires six torpedoes, but has to dive without knowing whether he has done his job. After a smart litter, Taylor attacks a couple of German destruction, but then realizes that there is not enough fuel. He is going to surrender and surrender if, at the very last moment, James Hobson (Eric Portman), a sailor who was sullen and lonely, and who speaks German, says there is a small Danish coastal village that was a fuel depot. He thinks it can still be Germans. The last third of the movie is an amazing sequence of activities where the sub-team tries to hold the Germans long enough to pump enough fuel to get Sea Tiger back to Britain. This is a film of war propaganda, so don't wait for failure. And did Tiger Tiger bring Brandenburg down? Are men reunited with their wife and dear friend? Did Hobson have a reconciliation with his wife and little son who continued to smile once? Did Freddie Taylor finally have the opportunity to use all these female names in her little black book? You must watch the movie. <br /> <br /> There are propaganda war movies and propaganda war movies. Some, like Powell and Pressburger one of our aircraft have disappeared and the 49th parallel, are facing the view today, because the stories are strong and unexpected, and the creators did not use the obvious clichés of the transcript. Others, as we Dive at Dawn, were made with enough clichés to look to remind ourselves when it was time for the movie. Yet Asquith can build a lot of tension with even a few clichés. Forcing the Sea Tiger through the subnet was tense. The pursuit of Brandenburg and the drawing for torpedo burning were realistic; The lack of readiness to attack John Mill was well handled. Fake-out preparations that make Sea Tiger as if the depth charges destroyed would be as realistic as below as you might expect, and the battle for the fuel depot was dramatic and exciting. We immerse Dawn is not a classic war movie, but it is a well-made, well-functioning example of its type and time. <br /> <br /> John Mills, worth noting, was a long and long career. Especially for fifty years he played in a series of meaningful films, looking back at these World War II. He had a quality that shows gentleness, joy and determination, but also behind the credibility, a man from England can be proud of fighting. In this movie, Eric Portman, a top-notch, beautiful actor with a unique voice and the ability to give the cold as cold as you want to put on a sweater. Anyone in the downstream is very funny, but in a stiff-top lip mode, but Portman manages some of the complexity of his character. Mills and Portman worked on this movie.
