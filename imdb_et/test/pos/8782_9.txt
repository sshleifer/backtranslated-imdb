Ah, Hitchcock! It's hard to find a bad Hitchcock movie until it has lost BIRDS (1963) and SABOTEUR proves it. Having been admired for most of this director's work for years, I had managed to exclude it, perhaps because of the lack of interest in leading Priscilla Lane and Robert Cummings. I was, of course, familiar with the climax of the Freedom Column that he did not see it repeatedly in retrospectives, but I was wrong that the story that led to it might not be in my interests. I was wrong! On the exciting plot, cooking is done right from the bat when there is a chance to get into the bad guy of Bad Guy Saboteur and Good Guy, and continue to zoom through further occasional meetings and narrow escapes. Well-known Hitchcock elements are all there: an innocent person accused of a crime; people are not what they seem to be; dramatic or unlikely places that enhance the arresting scene inside them (hangar hanger, ranch, bridge from which a hero with handcuffs escapes to escape from the police, a rich charity ball in a palace mansion, a top floor. a skyscraper, and finally a torch of freedom column). <br /> <br /> All humor has been offered with supportive players, great moments of old WW2 old social comments, human warmth, where suffering finds it in hand to help a companion person get something back? In short, Hitchcock always had a core of humanity at the center, although it was very intelligent, which was the sensational majority of supportive players, mainly Otto Kruger, who was the slippery villain of George Sanders' side (his Broadway credit included Noel Coward's leadership) PRIVATE LIVES? And what says it all) and funny Norman Lloyd as a saboteur, not to mention Alma Kruger? no connection with otto? as a prominent society that participated in the intrigue in the fifth column (his character was shown by Claude Rains' mother NOTORIOUS). Priscilla Lane does a hard job with a hard role. For most of his early scenes, we cannot say whether he believes the hero is innocent or guilty and he seems to be constantly exchanging his opinion that he will not turn to him completely until the end of the procedure. It is not possible to determine whether his behavior is guilty or whether we must remain in a precarious situation, but the plot development is so fast, fun and smart that we really don't care about what he thinks. <br /> <br /> Then there is a unique Hitchcock touch that has nothing to do with the plot. Double lane break stops to get a quarter change? one time to compensate your robber for an ice cream soda and call again from the telephone booth. Why have these scenes been entered, have anyone guessed, perhaps to make the film more realistic and thus increase credibility and tension? Or maybe to give the audience a moment to catch the breath? Some characters are up? Driving a car driver, an impossible kind and trusting blind man who lives alone in a carelessly cared cabinet, a political-philosophy-spouting "human skeleton" and other circus trailer members who hide the protagonists from their followers.
