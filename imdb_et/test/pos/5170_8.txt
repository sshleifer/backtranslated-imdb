I watched it on the Hallmark Channel. I was surprised by John Denver! This movie was full of clichés, but it's expected (it's a TV Christmas movie - come on!) The actor is as good as any other 80-year-old TV movie. As I have already said, the story is predictable and cliché, but still good. If you are looking for a fun Christmas card, it will scratch your itch. <br /> <br /> I was also delighted to know that it was in Georgetown, Colorado. This is a true mountain town west of Denver. Very cool because it is my home area. <br /> <br /> I was never a big John Denver fan (I always found him pretty expensive) but he was a decent actor. He's very good as a good old boy as he played in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see it, do it. I am sure it will start again in 2007.
