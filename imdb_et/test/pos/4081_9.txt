As a former Merchant Seaman, I was really interested in this movie: I personally participated in a pedestrian search when I left Kingston Jamaica where one person was found. We managed to get him to land because we were within the territorial boundaries. The second ship I was a spectator was found and could not be landed anywhere because of passport / citizenship problems. In fact, he remained an "honorable" member of the year and worked for him. Africa is the notorious pickup. At the beginning of the movie, there is a big scene when a bulk carrier enters an African port: its size reduces everyone. The team leaves the country with little intercourse and inferiority. So far it is normal. Drama begins when air travel enters the ship's big storms. Joss Ackland is brilliant because the captain who has a drinking problem is being harassed by his Nemesis Suchet directly in the form of a companys representative on board. Searching for a rider is a classic, but we didn't have any weapons. I doubt the use of weapons in this film. There was a big armor on this ship. In my experience, weapons at sea are strictly limited because of customs rules. The dog on board was also unusual. The laws of rabies, especially in Europe, severely restrict animal transport. Anyway, Pertwee is a brilliant mate. The horror of discovery of victims is intolerable: the gloomy metal background of ships and the feeling that drama is not to hide. Some crews are not involved in the murder and those who are gradually being sucked into a world of violence without escape. Tracking the ship through the ship, especially the scenes of the engine room, is "on the seat": the feeling of extreme claustrophobia is great. The feeling of pressing and killing the metal is only the armor. The film is brutal: my girlfriend had to watch it during shooting and beating scenes. Though it goes to Suchet from the comfort of its well-defined cabin, it is not aware of the 3 decks. This tense film, which is partially faulty, but the real message is that we can all suck into this violence. Slowly and firmly. Think of the train drivers who took the Jewish Auschwitz who made the train schedule. I always remember someone who visited the Dachau concentration camp at the end of the war and said that one of the Soldiers was outside the crematorium of the bird table. This movie is like this: ordinary people suddenly get into a world of unstoppable violence!
