I saw this movie on the A&E channel last weekend. The secret was okay, I couldn't guess the culprit before the end. But I liked the characters and their development much more than the mystery. Some of them, especially George Abernathie, had a wonderful Michael Fassbender and George's cousin Susannah. In fact, the story remained of the two characters who wanted to know more. From what I have been trying to move forward with the same title from the book by Agatha Christie, I think this film didn't follow that letter. Very good performances by participants, especially Fassbenders and Cora / companions.
