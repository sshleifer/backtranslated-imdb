While many people find that this movie is just too slow and simplified, I really do. It is not a plot, but rather a film of human survival, three of whom trapped under the tree, where a person eats a crocodile that lies in the water beneath them. <br /> <br /> Personally, I thought this was a very good thing, even though sometimes the roles were quite demanding and I felt the heat of the symbols. The situation in which they were was quite daunting and I felt nervous about them. I found the whole movie quite nervous because their situation has been helpless and a constant threat to their survival. <br /> <br /> The crocodile effects were surprisingly handled with such a low budget movie and believed me, I've seen my fair share of harsh croc movies. The creature moved well and had a real danger, and although the audience I was with did not seem to be against the film as a whole, they still jumped and started when the crocodile appeared. <br /> <br /> Script-wise, I would have made some changes, especially in the end, but it wasn't a big problem. For fans of slow-burning fever within reality, this is an interesting film, but unfortunately I think that for many audiences looking for excitement and higher product value from their cinema experience, this point is simply missed.
