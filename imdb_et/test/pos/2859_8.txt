Neil LaBute takes a dramatic move in his first two films, men and friends and neighbors, with a funny and original thriller / comedy / road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) recognizes her brutal murder (Aaron Eckhart), she develops a strange amnesia and flees in her car without knowing there is a huge drug exchange in the trunk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are men who hit him. <br /> <br /> What Betty is following, after a new beginning (although she doesn't remember her old life) is her beloved dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). The only problem: Dr. David is not real, he is a soap opera character at the exhibition "A Reason to Love" and he is a truly egoistic actor George McCord. <br /> <br /> Tell me more about what is going to be too much, but Sister Betty is definitely original. His hit men, like Pulp Fiction's killers, are violent, but philosophical, taking it to the amazing material of soap operas and its functioning is the best for everyone. It must be one of the best cast films in recent years. Renee Zellwegger is perfect for Nurse Betty, constantly eyeing her in her quest. At the end of his career, Morgan Freeman brings his steadfast love for the killer role, and Chris Rock is his partner, fury and great impatience. Greg Kinnear is best for his comic as a useless actor / soap opera doctor. There are also great supporters such as Emmy Winner Allison Janney (The West Wing), Harriet Sansom Harris (Frasieri Agent Bebe Glazer) and Kathleen Wilhoite (Chloe on ER). Actually, the best characters in cast TV are actors. <br /> <br /> A unique movie that is funny for a moment and cools down, sister Betty is a great actor, casting and a terrible scenario.
