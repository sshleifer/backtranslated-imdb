The punishment park is Peter Watkins' pseudo-documentary. The prerequisite is that national dissidents (hippies, musicians, protesters, pacifists, etc.) have been rounded and tried in court, and then given a choice of prison or running a punishment park. It is a 52-mile trek through the desert to the American flag, police, national card, and several other authorities. The idea is that if you refer to this flag, you are free. The arbitration consists of conservative types, all of which condemn any behavior that is not similar to their own, and there is no result except for a prison sentence or a "punishment park" for any trial. There are many things that are still true today, which is quite disturbing. People who run the course have promised water halfway, which is not true, and adhering officers are mostly a sadistic bunch that is just some of the target practice. It is not a very graphic film, but it is more shocking than its other ideas and themes. The frightening thing is that it can happen. Not a very amazing movie, but definitely worth it. Warning: This may make you angry. 9 out of 10
