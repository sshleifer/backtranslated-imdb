Madonna has been on the boat for over 20 years and has a lot of experience - probably - and a lot of knowledge. He had never thought of yesterday, contraire, he seemed to know what is popular tomorrow. He bravely takes on all the new trends, technologies and adds them to his actions. His world travel has never been "average". When Madonna occurs, she gives 120% - everything is bigger, better, more theatrical and meaningful. It takes inspiration from the East, from the West and makes it unique. Everyone is given a deeper meaning and the Confessions Tour is no different. From the start you find yourself sitting by the chair. He starts a bang, then he makes a brave circus that rises to the horse high in the sky, he does everything he can to attract you. He renews his songs, giving them a modern feeling. He sings on a disco cross, almost reaches the middle of the stage and with his amazing dance team, who doesn't know the dimensions of fear, this show is absolutely more than you wanted. It's a spectacle, an audio-visual orgasm that can't be put into words. The lucky ones are those who actually saw Madonna on stage. Fifty pushing is still incredible. The recent sticky and sweet tour is even more groundbreaking, proving nothing other than Madonna was, is and is never the only queen of pop.
