In the film, both the problem-solving process and the fantastically far-reaching moral uncertainty are rare AND be a fairly accurate historical film, but Fat Man and Little Boy pull out this trick. <br /> <br /> This is a story of the Manhattan project - World War II efforts to build an atomic bomb, reported a conflict between two men who led it, General Leslie Groves and Robert Oppenheimer. <br /> <br /> Historical figures are a great controversy: military vs. civil, practical and idealistic, emotional vs. scientific, brutal and consensual problem solving, immediate attitude to long-term vision. The fictional character played by John Cusack has been added to the synthesis of two historical figures to show to mankind, who strangely accesses the real people (and of course the obligatory love of Laura Dern). Looking for a direct documentary film can criticize outdated melodrama (and occasionally loose facts, but for Hollywood), but the purpose of fiction is to synthesize and galvanize events into more universal beliefs, so I think it can be forgiven <br /> /> One of the greatest visuals in the movie is when Oppenheimer knows the first atomic explosion: it is made entirely through his reaction and given the awesome visions inherent in the atomic explosion, this brave and completely effective way to describe the power-triggering effects of power on people at once (a typical Hollywood shooting historical The use of music is especially good in the last third of the movie. <br /> <br /> Quite accessible and highly recommended for both historical film and higher order drama.
