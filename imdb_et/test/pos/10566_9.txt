BBC 3-Hour Sarah Waters novel adaptation ... "Fingersmith". Life is tough without money, especially in Dickensian London. Blind deeds bring despicable dilemmas. Elaine Cassidy as "Maud Lilly" and Sally Hawkins as "Sue Trinder" give such fantastic performances as the leading ladies who are asking this question ... EVERYTHING ... while Rupert Evans shines gracefully "Gentleman". Imelda Staunton's "Mrs. Sucksby", David Troughton's "Mr Ibbs" and Charles Dance's "Uncle" support. The plot's twists and turns and I wasn't sure I could take care of the characters who could hurt and use each other in this way ... but somehow .. I care ... and what is the quality of it. performances ... love seems like love .. hates hate ... betrayal .. confusion .. also hopefully you will get an idea and hopefully you can get a DVD and enjoy. (Elaine Cassidy is in this great game. Actually ... I have to declare I'm in her fan club ... Hi Elaine :)
