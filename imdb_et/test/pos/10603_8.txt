I didn't know what to expect. I have always considered the team of Bam Margera and CKY a team who devoted stupid things to entertainment. I didn't know they could act. But all who acted in this movie had good results. Aaaaaghi Fun! The scene interferes with Ryan Dunni's depression and his former girlfriend. Sometimes, some scenes seem pointless, but at the same time they are funny. I recommend it to anyone who loves a good smile, but this film may not turn to those who prefer a detailed story and a series of turns.
