I've become a big fan of Barbet Schroeder's work, so maybe I'm a bit biased now, but I think this movie is great, though it may be some length. This is a romantic unforgettable view of the Great Liberation later in the sixties, stylistically amazingly polished (great set!) And I think it is still very observable. <br /> <br /> Basically, this is an ironic recollection of the story of Adam and Eve, driven from paradise after tasting the fruit that has become filled with the hero in a hypodermic. A woman seduces a person while using it, speeding up her sinking. The man seems to be doomed and associated with intense life and an early tomb right from the great title line. There is no hope. <br /> <br /> Although the story is quite sad, I was busy with the beauty of Ibiza and Mimsy Farmer when I found that her character was immediately low, puzzling, loving, tedious, interesting and boring. in general, going very far od use? which seems to be the trademark of Schr√∂der. <br /> <br /> There is even some humor that Stefan, the main character of Germany and his accent, is basically delivering. His main nemesis is not a snake, but a suspicious reputation as an older German? and Heroine Provider - Wolf. Although it is a German name and Stefan is a German language, he declares it verrry as English and, according to jealousy, he regularly spells his name to his girlfriend? becoming a son who cries ... Sometimes Stefan has to work to earn? Cellery. "Does a boy go snorkel at one time and then piano with his rubber pillars afterwards?" more fun in movie history.
