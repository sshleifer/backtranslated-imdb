<br /> <br /> This movie has some very impressive actions. Humor and action mix well, though the intensity of the film does not last until the end. The last scene is a mild anti-climax action quality and surprising explosion scenes before that. Humor does not seem to be so ridiculously clumsy as in many other Hong Kong films, and this film is a completely different class than most of the US championships of recent years. Lau Ching-Wan acts as a typical, intuitive police hero who accuses the commands of incompetent police chiefs. The film's dialectic is based on the supernatural coolness and ruthlessness of the drug gang, lowering the police force, while offering serious poisoning with various machines. Leaving ample corpses to awaken. Yu Rong-Guang is particularly impressive, as this Woo-like action is an extremely cool, ruthless gangster where the harsh boys are truly dead.
