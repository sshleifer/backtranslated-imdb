While some things in Haggard are stupid and unnecessary, the overall package is good. Haggard follows Ryan Dunn and his friends Val (Bam Margera) and Falcone (Brandon Dicamillo) who are trying to get Glauren back (Jenn Rivell), Ryan's ex. The track is followed and developed surprisingly well, it does not astonish or change into an episode of Jackass or Viva La Bam, although it has a side story that does not affect the main story. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For many Bam fans (and girls), there are several Bam Skates, though the weakest aspect of the movie. Phil makes 2 surprisingly small performances, even Don Vito got a bigger (but meaningless) roll. <br /> <br /> If you want to see comedy and escape from Bami's madness, stay away from this movie, otherwise enjoy the time you spend on it. There are some really funny scenes in this movie.
