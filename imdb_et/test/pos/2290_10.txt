Restore the Oscars since 1992 and this movie can be set or even won. It was so good to capture its era and double culture that it was part of the American and Japanese time caps. If you want to know what is here or what it is, this movie will show you. As an American, you will be remembered for a longer Japanese holiday and at the end of the movie you will be a deadly Dragonside fan because you agree with injecting Japanese tradition and culture into your baseball. much as we have done in our culture in our own game. <br /> <br /> Jack Elliot (Tom Selleck) is a splitting, aging Detroit Tigers' slugger, traded with dragons, with perennial runners. dynamic Yomuri giants, Japanese response to Yankees. Giante is admired for their success, but everyone who wants to overcome them is rarely successful. Dragons manager recruits Jack as the last piece of the gallery to win the pennant and we leave what could have been Gung Ho to play in the baseball field, but there was much more. <br /> <br /> Casting was remarkable: Selleck proved that with a good script and a character that suits him, he can make the film as well as his TV shows, and the Japanese was equally good when he was back from Die Hard by Mr Takag. picture conscious owner. Other actors, including the one who plays the interests of love (including the daughter of the leader), are strong and independent, but at the same time faithful to the Japanese tradition, beyond what was forced upon him. She's a good and supportive girlfriend for Jack. Even his dad doesn't tell him he doesn't see him, he's almost in favor of Jack, what he can tolerate for him, and a little relaxed that he knows at least the man he loves. <br /> <br /> Baseball scenes are great, with huge support from already famous Dennis Haysbert as another former US patriarch and Jack West mentor. Ordinary fish and underwater elements are there, and you can almost feel like Jack, to fit a country that doesn't speak our language and doesn't practice its way, but replicates everything we do, including our national pastime. one of the funniest scenes happens when Jack tells his manager, when he connects to a journalist, that he has learned from a Japanese tradition, where he can drink and talk to his boss and cannot use it and exercise that right. very humorously. Plots and subplots are ultimately closely linked, but not too properly, and nothing is unrealistic. <br /> <br /> To name this, comedy is wrong: it's a clean comedy-drama or even a drama with good humor. The plot is too deep to be ignored by critics when an actor in his league tries to wear a light film. The situations were fun, but on their place there were a lot more serious, deeper and more accurate backgrounds, which resulted in one of the best films I've ever seen. Baseball Cinematography competes to love the game, realism. <br /> <br /> Some say the movie is about baseball or Japan, but more than anything that seems to be in the workplace and how people come to work on a completely different background, but they need to do it for their business or team put aside. <br /> <br /> A really big movie that you should never have excused as it did in theaters.
