There are a few movies with a large number of non-stop ninja actions like Ninja III: Domination. This is a story of love, redemption, and revenge, but it is primarily a story of people without any reason. If you've been looking for a movie where the ninja goes into nuts and takes all sorts of people into their graves just because he's a ninja and he can do it, it's a movie for you. I can't think of such movies to compare, because no movie is that awesome. Wait, oh, have you seen this thing with two heads? There's a part where the title thing rides around the motorcycle and about a million policemen ride around, but they run together and not. Ninja III is like that. I recommend this movie especially if you like the following things: Ninjas, Swords, Lucinda Dickie Breakin and Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo, video games that are bombers in the bar, ambiguous and underdeveloped love stories or "good" ninjas.
