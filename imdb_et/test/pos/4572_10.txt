I've seen this movie because I was a little girl and I was from New York and I remember how people lived back, brought many good memories back. This film is not just about the end of a fairy tale, but about understanding a better man, woman and service provider Claudine. It was the welfare system that put women in a binding position. It concerned the injustice of the invaded system and required the family to stay. Diane Carroll was named Oscar for this role and was well earned. If you want to experience a strong family with contradictory but excellent bonding times, enjoy Claudine. The goal of you as a viewer is to keep openness and understand the general disappointment.
