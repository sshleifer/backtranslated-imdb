this movie is funny funny funny my favorite quote from "I think I saw my naked naked indians in my room last night", which was not hallucination, it was India's room "and the other is" what the hell are you talking about, what the hell are you talking about, but when i ever entered this hospital, i'm ready to write my will on the spot ... i'd say it was the funniest of the movie, but the three are the most funny for me, though their lines were little .. and can't start me on a crack pot patient that one that i secretly and quick pace will continue.
