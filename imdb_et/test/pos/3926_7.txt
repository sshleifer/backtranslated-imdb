** 1/2 Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams. Director Jaume Collet-Serra. Based on the Vincent Price film of the House of Wax of 1953, where magic kills unsuspecting teenage hooligans and makes them an invaluable wax. Still with a fantastic design to make the whole house wax, the film is a typical classic horror racket, such as the Tobe Cooper classic 1974 Texas Chainsaw Massacre, later in spite of creativity, and so the film was still a gore. Director Serra showed a slight enthusiasm with his leadership, but it was worth it. My last rating 7/10.
