Imagine a world in which everyone treats someone nicely, never speaks of an unpleasant word, there is no office boundary, and your boss regularly invites the office to a crowd for self-mature dinners, where you can chat with the latest interior design styles. Everything is clean, pleasant - well, just nice. In other words: you are in hell. After falling into the middle of the middle of the middle, Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag) began his new job as an accountant in a small, clean city in the mid-thirties. From the beginning, he feels unfamiliar in such intrusive goodness surrounded by pleasant but inanimate interior architecture as well as colleagues. Food does not taste, drinks do not drink, there are no children; After the first step, Andreas is looking for ways to escape the new world. She doesn't know where she was coming from, but still remembers the rich flavors, the real feelings - something that is beyond her ability to afford. BOTHERSOME MAN resonates with Huxley's and Kafka's ideas, but here's the cruelty of any cruelty. Unlike PLEASANTVILLE, it is not a narrow-minded big sample, more of a civilization of the free world of our city. It mostly resembles a brilliant FIGHT CLUB scene where Edward Norton walks through the IKEA catalog. Tasty humorous spiced Scandinavian laconic story convinces on every level: story, characters and relevance. Real Screen Pearl. 8/10
