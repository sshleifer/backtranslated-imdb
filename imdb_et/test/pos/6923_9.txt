This movie is a pleasure to watch and work well on DVD and video. I think you really need to be an Irish language to understand some subtlites, such as accent, colloquialism, and some characters, but let me assure you that when Dylan Moran embodies the "Barreler", most people are familiar with Dublin because in our fine city there are many signs that will see, work and speak like that! The mere simple comedy used and the genius of Michael Caines are worth the money, but the plot is excellent, the script is fantastic and the dialogue is fast moving and memorable. The perfect light entertainment movie without Jim Carrey's humor.
