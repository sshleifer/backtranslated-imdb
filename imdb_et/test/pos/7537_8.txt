About as much as the British comedy of the 1950s, ST TRINIAN BELLES is almost one minute ... and after 91 minutes it's a terrible time. Other films I recommend during the same period are TITFIELD THUNDERBOLT and GREEN MAN. In fact, every movie is Alistair Sim or Terry Thomas, George Cole, Richard Wattis or Joyce Grenfell. ST TRINIAN'S gets a double dose of Sims, who plays two roles with this fun contempt he is constantly shooting over his face. Joyce Grenfell, like Ruby Gates (oh dear!), Is playing a fun perfection with her "joyful hockey stick" constant-incognito. Perhaps the best laughs come from George Cole as Flash Harry (who comes out of the bush) and various classrooms are visited by Mrs. Fritton (Sims), who reacts to explosions ("Oh bad Betty!") Or to a science laboratory ("just send a few bottles Each part of the movie is funny between the characters, their costumes and the generation, there were lakes, but the first three are the best: it is also the first, the Blue MURDER ST TRINIAN and later in the color GREAT ST TRINIANI TRAIN ROBBERY.
