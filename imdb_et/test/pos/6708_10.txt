Far from being one of the best sci-fi movies out there. However, to understand the concept of the film and not only to understand the special effect, but also the main plot of the film, multiple views are not taken. It is my own feeling that this film has such bad reviews because no one took the time to watch the movie, how it was seen. It has a few moments that you want to rush and go through, but they are little and far away. Hooper, who led TCM 1 and 2 with the new INVADERS MARS and FUNHOUSE, will do their best here. A great result, good acting, and great effects make this movie add to your collection when you get the chance to see a widescreen version of a DVD that is recommended to anyone who is a sci-fi fan.
