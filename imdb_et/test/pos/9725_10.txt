It is the best television series for children (and adults). John Hurt is a great actor, with many great performances over many years, but he was born to listen to the narrator. Almost every episode of scripts is an excellent finished work, and the productions play the color of emotions, alternately funny, sad, happy, exciting and always strange. It is difficult to choose the best episodes from so many great candidates, but "The Soldier and Death" with its timeless sin is insurmountable. It's a series to watch with your kids over and over again.
