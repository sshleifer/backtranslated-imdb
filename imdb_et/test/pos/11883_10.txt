Critters 4 is one of the biggest films of the 20th century. The word "classic" has never been so skillfully used to describe this delightful epic. I agree that the original Critters are the best in the series, but the claustrophobic tension of the space station, in which Critters 4 is set, really must be believed. I strongly recommend it to anyone who wants to see the twentieth century's biggest film characters.
