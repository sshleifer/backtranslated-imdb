I think Gerard's comments on the document hit the nail on his head. Interesting movie, but very long. This is certainly the opposite of a new flashy, sexy, Moore-style documentary school. There is no narrator, no facts or side information, and no other tricks. What you see is what you get - a glimpse of the lost world of Tibetan Saltmen. As a great doc fan, I was surprised at how much I lost in this film, namely the length and lack of dialogue. Finally, I would recommend that the topic be interesting to you. It is beautifully photographed, informative and provides a valuable (and closing) window to Tibetan saltmen (and women) - all the essential attributes of a good document. But do put a big coffee pot, it will help.
