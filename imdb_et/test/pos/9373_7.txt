Crossfire (1947) <br /> <br /> Great Message, Great Symbolism, Very Good Film <br /> <br /> With Robert Mitchum, Robert Young and Robert Ryan, it's completely wrong to go all three. male leaders and director Edward Dmytryk pull together a complex murder and detective yarn. This is a good reason to look at it once and even twice. <br /> <br /> You may need another picture to catch the plot completely because it is explained (too much) or shown rejected (too much) because it is a little complicated without good reason. But it is generally meaningful and we see early (too early) who is the culprit and even why. <br /> <br /> In addition to the drama that is well done with the typical noir light and filled with the short borders that make dramatic post-war movies, there is a social message, its anti-Semitic point. It is limited to preaching once or twice, and it is obviously a good idea that we look at it correctly and look forward to plot and dramatic behavior to take the lead. What they do, especially young people, who are excellent laconic and patient detectives, and Ryan, who is incredibly raw and angry (Ryan is good at this, his typical prediction). Mitchum mostly plays a dehydrated version of what he is famous for, and the fourth well-known acting force, Gloria Grahame, is great, short, even when it's a little weak. <br /> <br /> Although the film's dominant order of events and the message that both arrive, it's really easy to look only at lighting, camera work, and action, including the classic fighting scene that opens the first few seconds. movie, all with shadows. <br /> <br /> The archetypes of these soldiers are very deliberate, and it can be something people are very familiar with at this time and might have been involved in a thread of anti-Semitism. The Shell-shocked soldier made a helpless (but still capable), modest youth without confidence (but also capable) and tired but outwardly capable of being a veteran all over there. And, of course, an angry, violent soldier who is the result of war. This latter is also the responsibility of society - even the army goes through to rectify injustice here, not only because they are criminals, but because they are the result of the weary of a long and terrible war. Then the audience, more than now, could really get it, but it's still grateful.
