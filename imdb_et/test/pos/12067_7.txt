Like many situations, the "civil war" also improves for each episode. The characters begin to become real and believe in the family. I agree with many opinions that some of the first episodes were not so funny; I thought the sample would definitely be canceled. But due to the lack of "Malcolm in the Middle" and "Arrested Development", "war" offers FOX much needed live comedy on Sunday nights. Compared to the rest of the sitcoms that are now "war", this is even a better choice. <br /> <br /> His complaint, at least for me, is in its actual situation. Teenagers having sex. Not every parent likes how their children come out. Parents fight and call each other. But instead of relying on the fact that it means "much", like many exhibitions, everything is ultimately a nice one, which is one rule of a good sitcom. <br /> <br /> One reduction in an exhibition is narration in time between scenes. The style of "arrested development / family member" rebounds works well enough, but there may be too much narration. <br /> <br /> So anyone who needs to watch Sunday night should look at "civil war", especially considering what is at the same time in other major networks.
