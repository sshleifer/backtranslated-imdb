Slipknot on Des Moines, Iowa hardcore rock band. Nine band members who wear all custom boots protection and personalized home masks (eg # 6 clown mask, # 0 different gas machines, # 8 split + torn crashtest dummie mask with lashes). The music seems to have walked between the finishes healthy and otherwise, but it is done so wonderfully and psychologically. <br /> <br /> "Welcome to our neighborhood" sounds a rather generic title, but the film itself is something else. Interviews with the band, soundtracks from their last, selftitled album, 2 live performances and one forbidden MTV music video (a glorious respect for the classic Kubrick movie "The Shining"). an hour, but it's definitely worth it. It is ideally suited to Slipknot for metal / heavy fans.
