Never been able to kiss when Drew Barymore is playing, because Reporter Josie Gellar is a sweet, extremely gentle and sometimes quite painful story of a lovely woman named Josie Gellar, who is still great and quiet and has never been able to. He is attributed to his first major newsletter for the newspaper he is working on to go as a high school student who is happy with popular cool children, and get a scoop on what's really going on in high school. The only problem is Josie's ever popular. The gymnasium was a traumatic experience for him because he was pretty much teasing and cruel jokes. Josie grabs the task so much that eventually "fit" to get the scoop she finds is the main premise of the story. <br /> <br /> Never kissed is one of those films that is so cute and schmaltzy at times, especially at the end of some scenes, that the limits of credibility have been seriously tested and many cynics may not like this film. However, it has been made very sweet. Drew Barymore is perfect because worshiping, but cute Josie breathes the breath of fresh air and makes her completely realistic. I also enjoyed Leelee Sobieski as an intellectual student who met her friends at Josie on her first day of school. <br /> <br /> There have never been some really funny moments when Josie unravels to cool down on her frenzied efforts. An example of a reggae bar scene. I also loved Josie's brother Rob, who also goes back and writes as a high school student, so that he helps Josie complete his "dream", is just fun. While Joseph's shameful story of his early years in high school is being seen, it is extremely painful. You don't need to have a similar experience with high school Josie to be influenced by her story - Drew is wonderful because her character is in a personal relationship with the audience and we adore Josie from the beginning. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of "mean girls" in the 2004 release, in this movie, but it means the girls were fairly gritters. Never been able to kiss becomes a very romantic picture because Josie develops feelings for some people and the question becomes when they get together. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. In some areas it was really beautiful. The movie is funny in some places, the last scene-realistic-not-does this film manipulate your emotions in the most obvious way of Hollywood? Oh yes yes yes! But it manipulates nicely, here are some lessons. The film never announces, but manages to paint an exact picture of what the high school was in some of the selected places. I have actually met people who have had similar experiences with Josie - I met people very much like all these characters - I think many people just don't know or can't imagine cruelty that can be high school in the world and how it can be harmful, but it is there. Not unrealistic. What struck me was Drew's speech on prom because he proves the "sheep mentality" that can be so widespread - if Hollywood is made and produced so much I think it may be, it was well done and very true. <br /> <br /> I'm never going to kiss the sound much harder than it really is, it's the perfect movie to choose if you want a sweet, good-hearted, warm-hearted picture. It's interesting, wonderfully worked and just Rufus. I'd say it out. 8 out of 10
