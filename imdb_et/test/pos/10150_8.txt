Less thriller than a colorful adventure with fine elements should NOT really compare to Hitchcock masterpieces like VERTIGO, REAR WINDOW or PSYCHO; it is rather similar to such enjoyable romps as BIRTHS AND NORTH NORTH. Produced mainly in a movie in Morocco and London, where a couple of couples (James Stewart and Doris Day) are interrupted when they leave innocently on a plot of murder - and when their young son is kidnapped, James Stewart and Doris Day are quite effective in American pairs and characters get abnormal twist: Stewart, in the middle of a western doctor, leaves, but he has to touch "ugly America abroad" about his personality; On the day of playing the popular stage and recording star, who left his marriage, is a dubious character. These personality and background qualities play the story extremely well. <br /> <br /> MAN, WITH ALL THE POINTS, contains a number of famous scenes; both the scene where the Stewart drug day is spoken before the robbery, and the very complex Albert Hall, which includes hundreds of cuts, is very powerful. Less noticed, albeit in my opinion, equally or less satisfactorily, are the finer scenes where Hitchcock connects the partition to the edge of perverted humor, as when Stewart tries to discover some of the taxodermist stores and day out "Que Sera, Sera" (written for this film) cocktail party in the most inappropriate way. <br /> <br /> Although a man who has too much lacks the depth and impact of Hitchcock's work, it remains a pleasant movie and one that compares very well with all his work. This is Hitchcock light, but recommended. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
