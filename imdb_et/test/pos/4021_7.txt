It's better than the two killing films, and although his hardly Schindler list is complicated, it's bloody funny. All men are goodies or bad and women are all just hos and emotionally poor, eg. It is also bloody funny and Pro must have an all time funniest movie pimp, you just can't get enough of these hats, purple suits, gold chains and jive patois forever. The best bit is where he has Harem around him, "YOU ARE BITCHES UNNAST". Everything about her is longer than life, and it's Morris's day imitation in purple rain. Jim Brown also proves that he is a private dick for all chicks and he is again striking a white mouth in every direction. The car scene is very unrealistic that they live with it impatiently, but hey, it's a movie. Certainly it is the best flax and it surpasses Shaft (1971). Even the first movie is pretty good.
