The summary is only for those who hate this movie because finding the OK or medium movie is acceptable. Visiting this film in IMD has made me nostalgic because I can't go back in 1994. I was one of the few lucky people who saw it in movie theaters. It immediately became one of my favorite comedies and it took me a few years to be a favorite. How can I say what made this movie my favorite? Was it an excellent writing (the story was OK, but the scenario and dialogues were fabulous) Was it a superb performance? Was it the movie's mood? <br /> <br /> After so many years of thinking, I'll say it's a blend. This is one of those films that didn't have any mistakes, not even music (another movie that I think has come out right now is Sholay). <br /> <br /> PS: Rajkumar Santoshi, please balance your drama and comedy films. Only one comedy is not enough. I want more ..........
