Not the world's best plot, but comedy in this film rule. Kelsey's grammar is great in this movie. Another funny guy is Rob Schneider, who makes you interrupt your segments where Ken Hudson Campbell plays Buckman. Lauren Holly is likely to play a more serious character than the castle lake. Bruce Dern is a major actor in this film, probably playing the most serious character of the film. The actor who liked the most was Toby Huss as Nitro, all the electric shots his film takes are fun. <br /> <br /> The plot is a bit uneven, about Governor Tom Dodge, who has for years been willing to command his submenu. Eventually he gets a new stainless steel WWII diesel instead of a new opportunity, Stingray. His team is no better off the US Navy. He then puts in a number of war games, showing how the old diesel engine can cope with the current nuclear force. Things still do not improve when he finds that his diving officer is actually a female officer to see how women are dealing with a real source. He wants to win the war games and blow up the ship to win the position of the manager. <br /> <br /> Movie shows are pretty good, actually I smiled non-stop when I saw the movie theaters. I loved when they were silent and Buckman farts, and everyone's reaction to the smell is fun. <br /> <br /> Overall, out of 9 out of 10, this movie is just fun to watch, it's nice to hate movies like this, trying to be 100% serious.
