Yes, we really are the winner - the winner on the best fool movie! <br /> <br /> The only reason I voted for this movie 10 is that it is so incredibly bad that it really becomes funny. <br /> <br /> "Night Hunter" is basically about Jack Cutter, a Vampire hunter (Vampire hunters have probably been around for centuries in his generation) and his mission, which means he must kill the last remaining Vampires. <br /> <br /> This movie contains one of the most exciting scenes I've ever seen in my life. Not to mention really bad weapon shooting scenes. When people are filmed, the blood breaks across the whole place of Ketsup, making the film so cheap and lame that you just lose interest. The constant shaking of the camera is what most disturbs me in the fight. I think this has been done to create an "effect of action", although I do not think it has any effect. Its completely ridiculous! <br /> <br /> All stunt scenes are done very badly. For example, a scene where a dead vampire driver is thrown off the roof. When the body hits the ground, it collides like a weak rubber doll. The scene in which Jack sniffs the ground, getting a vision so flat, I got a hysterical laugh. failure. To say this is a good movie, it would be the same that nuclear bombs are good for people. It is clear that those who say it is one of the best action films have not seen much in your life. <br /> <br /> This is basically a B-class vampire action movie that deserves 0/10 but what I give to the 10/10 but for that ability (being the most painful action I've ever seen) make me laugh and i just can't live without it.
