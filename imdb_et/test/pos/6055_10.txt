I saw this movie for the first time in the late 60s and tried to see it every time it is on television, which unfortunately is not often the case. Now that I have TCM and FMC, I hope it will happen at least once a year. Like Louis Gossett Jr. An official and gentleman, Jack Webb offers incredibly excellent performance, such as the Parris Island Drill Sergeant with classical screwed recruitment, and the story, though dated, touches and works very well. And how painful the real cans have certainly helped make the film real. This is a great movie with excellence and great story. See if you have a chance - it's worth the time!
