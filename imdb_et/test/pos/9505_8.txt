This video was my first entry for residents and I couldn't play it in the last three days. Visual images are dynamic and more inventive and technically sophisticated than anything I've ever seen on a big screen or a small one. <br /> <br /> The DVD loses points, however, for the pointless insertion of new music. Original Resident Music is nothing else you have ever heard, and indeed you tweak your brain in the best possible way. However, the new music is quite uninteresting and in most cases it is quite bad compared to classical stories. It also seems that the unfinished Vileness Fats video is very incomplete, and I can only read the story from the extensive reading of the notes on the disc. <br /> <br /> This is a DVD with a lot of cool Easter eggs about the notes on the disc, apparently turning to long-term fans of the population. Tip: Look for icons on the note pages that shouldn't be there. <br /> <br /> From a technical standpoint, the disc is one of the best DVD transmissions. There are virtually no traceable pixels in the strong contrast points and only a little bit. <br /> <br /> Kudos is a top-notch presentation. This plate deserves your attention.
