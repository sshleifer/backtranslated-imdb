It may be my favorite so bad that it is a fantastic movie all the time. like many of the 80's of repeated gestation of ninja revenge, I created my childhood ninja phase. The man thought Sho k. it was bad at that time. Jet Li could pour him with both feet! This movie has crazes that include flashdance, exorcist, and Lee Van Cleef's ninja TV shows. ugh. but when my friend says everyone can get a good movie, it's a true genius to make a movie that starts with ninja surviving 17 shotguns that is long enough to take over the arabic body to get revenge. wow. Although previous comments have broken the sword out of the hat, no one has yet found a powerful love scene. As a sexy leading man cop removes his shirt to expose the backrest brush. Fun never ends. Rent it !!!!!!
