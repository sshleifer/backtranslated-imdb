I watched the movie a second time on September 30, 2006, and thought it was even better than the first time I saw it. I enjoyed this actor, especially "Uncle Benny". I thought Fred Carpenter did a great job of writing and managing this movie. The story is definitely in your interest and I hope this film will change its top. I felt it was moving smoothly between the scenes and finally a surprising twist, well, just saying I didn't see it coming. I also thought that Craig, an actor who played "Eddie Monroe", did a great job and I hope this movie will help her continue to act. From the beginning to the end I enjoyed it thoroughly.
