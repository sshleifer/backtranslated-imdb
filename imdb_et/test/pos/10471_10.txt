The French babble appears in the modest house of two Danish sisters, which is wet, cold and alone. As he escapes from the revolution in Paris, he is seeking refuge in a hidden religious community off the coast of the Jutland region. <br /> <br /> The unknown to those who are so generous about him, he is a big cook, a food artist. Babette gives its host community a sense of economy, productivity and shared faith. He leaves only when he wins the French lottery - 10,000 francs. He returns with an exotic cargo-laden shell, a one-time meal that commemorates his father's birthday, the community founder. <br /> <br /> This food bag sounds joyfully in the eyes of the dying faith, but its nuances have been translated by an aging military officer who, as a young Parisian man, has appreciated the sensory experience here. For the meal, the culmination of the film, the communion of love in the temporary art of food - involuntarily raises art, love and the meaning of life.
