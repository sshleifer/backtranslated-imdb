Of all the mafia movies I've ever seen, this is one of the best for many reasons. Actor Pesci, Cortese and Vincent. The story is one of the best (in the mafia genre) because it is realistic. Characters are people with many other people involved. This movie is also great because it is a good dialogue. It also has very realistic struggles and action scenes. This film also launched a career in Pesc and Vincent. If it weren't for the success of this movie, the casino and Goodfellas might not be as good as they were. <br /> <br /> Story 10/10 Acting 9/10 Realism 10/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> My fantastic mafia movies are <br /> 1: Goodfellas 2: Casino 3: The Godfather's Trilogy 4: The Enforcer of the Family (The Collector of Death) 5: The sopranos (I know it's not a movie)
