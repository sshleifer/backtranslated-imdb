I rented this movie, but I wasn't sure what to expect. I was very pleased to find that this is the best Brazilian movie I've ever seen. The story is rather strange and simple and above all extremely original. We have Antonio, a young man living in Nordest, amid the middle of somewhere in the north-east of Brazil and deep in love with Karina. The main conflict between the two is that when Antonio loves his small town and has no desire to leave, Karina wants to see the world and annoy it. To prove his love for him, he decides to go and bring the world to him. He puts Nordestina on the map as he says. And how he does it is incredible. This is a good movie; may be somewhat static for some people because it is a different editing operation, but I think it is also the one that improves the story. It's just fun and it will do you well.
