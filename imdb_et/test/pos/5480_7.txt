The thriller at Jackal Day Of Fire has added to the twist that Eastwood's old-fashioned bodyguard Frank Horrigan is worried about job failure. The run becomes personal when John Malkovich's reptilian assassin Leary hits him with this neurosis - a rather confusing exception for a good woman's love (Russo Lilly Raines) does not make sense for Frank to rest when Leary personally takes off. > <br /> Malkovich is volatile - it's not just flammable on the screen, but often also a changing actor. This is one of his good films, focused and playful director Petersen game. Eastwood is too old, but a) the audience doesn't care that he is him and b) his age is written in a script, not only in narrative, but also as a repeated joke. Pretty much, if you wait, but well handled. 7/10
