Welcome to all Denver fans! <br /> <br /> I couldn't accept more with you! This exhibition was so cool and lovely, I looked at it as a child in the late 80s. Denver also has other favorites like Care Bears and Rainbow Brite. I'm 24 years old now, but it's still one of my favorite shows and my favorite movie from the 80's. It brings back all the memories. Theme setup was also great, I get goosebumps when I hear it. It is sad that it lasted for such a short time, but it has remained a definite favorite. It's great that I'm not alone and that there are people I liked. This is one of the cartoons I preserve for future generations. <br /> <br /> Viva Denver! :)
