Martin and Lewis must be taken as salt and pepper. Why does Martin put on Lewis? Then why all the women in this movie like Jerry? Because he is innocently pleasing! Martin sings a few good songs (at least once) and Jerry can kiss more girls than in any other movie. In general, I find that I can take so much of Jerry's funny things before they make it harder. BUT .... .... in this movie, see when Jerry stuck in the navy submarine! FULL! Buster Keaton should have been proud. I'll give the movie a 7.
