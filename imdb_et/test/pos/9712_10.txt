The sequel is exactly what you expect. And it's good enough that anyone who wanted to watch it would leave it happy. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie prize. But it takes what made the Jackass TV show and the original film a success, and that makes it a notch. It's funny, brutal, and more nasty than the original. And I loved it every minute. <br /> <br /> The original had some notorious tricks and at least one stunt to remember this movie. You win, shine, look away and laugh very, very hard. <br /> <br /> In any case, you probably don't have to read this review or others to find out if you like this movie if you've never heard of Jackass.
