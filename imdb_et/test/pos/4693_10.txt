This HTV series is beautiful. I highly recommend watching the movie. It has everything it should do: a remarkable script, strong characters, beautiful scenery and an extraordinary atmosphere. Add some scores from Clannad and get an unforgettable picture. I love every adventure movie I saw on HTV: Back to Treasure Island, smuggler, adventurer, but Robin wins them all. I would like to thank the whole HTV team and Richard Carpenter, who gave me a lot of adventures and excitement. I have a DVD version of my small movie collection. I am very sorry that such films are no longer being made.
