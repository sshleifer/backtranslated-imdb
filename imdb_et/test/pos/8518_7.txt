1983 was a "bond battle". This year, Roger Moore and Sean Connery celebrated two separate James Bond films, while "Octopussy" was produced by "official" makers of Bondi films, while later (Never Say Never Again) was produced unofficially by the group. was directed by Kevin McClory, who kept Thunderball's film rights. Surprisingly, the "unofficial" movie is better, despite the obvious drawback and the never-ever-ever Thunderball remake. Never ever say that sport is never one of the best pains ever made for a bond movie. Everything starts with Sean Connery, diamonds returning to Bond for the first time since 1971. Connery may be older, then he was, but he looks better here, then he made Diamonds Are Forever. Never say never to have dr. Well, from Russia with a lovingly sleek and dangerous shark, just a few years older. Connery's single liner and dialogue delivery is as dead as ever. One of the drawbacks of Connery's age is his credibility, especially when it comes to film ladies. Let's face it, even Connery, even though she's in a higher physical shape, looks like Moore when she was sleeping women half of her age. However, despite this question of credibility, Never Say Never Again shows one of his best performances at Bond Connery and his two earlier bonds. <br /> <br /> Kim Bassinger plays Domino in one of his early film roles. Bassinger plays a significant trust in a relative newcomer and makes this character credible. Bassinger keeps his own stars and also has great chemistry with them. In fact, he can bring out the counterparts of Thunderbari played by Claudine Auger. <br /> <br /> Then there is a villain, Maximilian Largo, played by Klaus Maria Brandauer. Brandauer Largo is all that the James Bond movie villain should have: suave, charming, evil and above all believable. Brandauer makes the role realistic and decides not to fall into the trap because many other Bond runners have been hit. Brandauer plays Largo with a silent threat and charisma that is not seen in many 007 opponents. <br /> <br /> An excellent casting form also extends to supportive pain. Barbara Carrera makes Fatima Blush a fine henchwoman and the screen will appear when she appears. Max Von Sydow is a nice look in the form of Blofeld, although his appearance is more like a camel. Rowan Atkinson looks like Bond's cramped contact, making some of the best scenes in the movie. All that Edward Fox Mi's staff is in the forefront of supporting painful strength, which makes a great contrast to Bernard Lee, Pamela Salem, who makes Moneypebb and Alec McCowen a wonderful Q. he has a couple of confusions, though Bernie Casey like Felix Leiter and Gavin O'Herlihy Jack Petachi, both of whom appear to be credible in their roles. Otherwise, this film is one of the best pains ever made for the Bond film. <br /> <br /> In addition to excellent pain, the film has several other important ingredients. From the opening Central American sequence to the Shrubland fight against underwater sequences and the motorcycle, this is a film where the sequences are not only large but also serve the plot mostly. The film also features good special effects on passenger aircraft models, explosions, and all the things we expect from a Bond movie. Irvin Kershner, a fresh deprivation of Empire Strikes Back, brings the film a strong trend, especially in sequences, such as the nuclear warhead substation and the subsequent theft of cruise missiles. <br /> <br /> is far from perfect. Never say never is easily one of the Bond movies, which in the 1980s computer sand video games are great. Although the technology timed the film after a while, the strong reliance on this film, especially in the hijacking of cruise ships and the dominance scheme, makes the film look amazing for a quarter of a century after its release. The script also tends to suffer due to predictability because it is a remake of Thunderball. <br /> <br /> But for this predictability, it is never ever said that the script is never good. The script sports good dialogue scenes, not worth one lining (how many Roger Moore scripts say that?), Some humorous situations, but are mostly traceable and tense. When you look at the past, it's a remake of the movie script with a lot of good things. <br /> <br /> Music is the biggest weakness of the movie. Due to the "informal" status of the movie, James Bond's theme could not be used. It said it could have shown the right composer that the bond score without it could work. Unfortunately, Michael Legrand's score is far from enough. The Legrand score is completely out of stock and there are only two places where it actually works. Even worse, the film has been filmed with one of the worst title ever received by James Bond. <br /> <br /> Despite being heavily dated, the somewhat predictable and bad score has never ever said a good Bond movie. This film proves that one of the best bonds, good practices, good special effects, good directions and some terrible dialogue is "unofficial" bad. In fact, it is better than Octopussy and the winner of the "Bond Battle".
