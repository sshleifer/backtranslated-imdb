Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare, but Fata Morgana is a good case. The big topic can be encrypted for young people's tasks, but Herzog is doing an amazing job. The idea of ​​the film is to show people and even the world from a non-human point of view. Each image is the opposite of a voice command. Although the text of "Creation" (Mayan myth Popoli Vuh) refers to the original wilderness, this scene no longer changes the illustration of myth. It is located on waste and various samples of destruction (fire, smoke, damaged vehicles). "Paradise" pictures are different, and "Golden Time" is darkly comic? the highest culture is a strange roadside musical act. Its mythological framework lacks a historical historian. There are no human characters. If the boy is standing with the dog with a longer shot, the initial suggestion is from the boy's point of view; in the end it is much more dog. The lizard is also stronger than the person who introduces it, and the tortoise partner hardly sees people with their large mirrors. <br /> <br /> Animal stories and nature documentaries have always been anthropomorphised, but Fata Morgana has no such thing. Certainly, the dunes look like a female body, but a similar one cuts both ways. People will probably just be able to distinguish between creation and nature, and there are planes and factories alongside mountains, lakes and waterfalls. People and civilization are all part of the wider natural landscape.
