In the 1970s, Texas was a small filmmaker named S.F. Brownrigg led a handful of surprisingly decent low-budget rides that show a little cult over the years. Before watching your first movie, don't look in the basement, I wasn't too sure what to expect, but I'm sure hell didn't expect it to be the only Texas horror I thought it was better than the chainsaw Veraauna. I don't know, it can actually be my all time favorite horror movie. <br /> <br /> We start from an insane crazy shelter. At first it seems to be a modest place for mental health, given that all patients are allowed to move around freely and not as if they were in their house (I think it is). none of them seems to be so dangerous, but erroneous. Among the inhabitants is a love-nymph, a 700-year-old woman, a man-child, a spaz, a man who thinks she is in war, a woman who thinks she has a child, and a man who thinks she is a judge. One day a judge kills a doctor with an ax, soon after, the baby's mother's sister kills. Ten minutes of film and things are really ugly. Maybe the new sister knows what to do, again, maybe not. More cancellation would do more harm than good. This is best when you first have to enter, knowing as little as possible. If you value honestly to God with horror, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> If you liked Scream, if you liked the wrong move, then if you go to this uniginal, overpriced, overpriced digital Hollywood garbage, you are unlikely to see beauty in this area. Don't look in the basement because the first attempt makes the quality even more shocking. The atmosphere and sharpness fit the location and score like gloves. Unfortunately, good oil is S.F. He used most of his good ideas in his first film, although the next record in his Texas-sized quadrilogy is somewhat a masterpiece, that is, if you're particularly lousy, he's excited about the average, like Hixploitation like someone I know. If you love the first two of Brownriggi and you must definitely find out what else he had to offer, don't open the door and the house where the hell froze. Do not look at everything in the basement that managed to cope with horror needs, no letters, no budget, no digital effects, but an original story that brought out a crazy shelter, with a dozen majority members, and a harsh, fine result and, of course, a twist. This is a real horror for a real horror fan. 10/10
