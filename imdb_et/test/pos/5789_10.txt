I always knew the day was coming. We all knew. There's only so much oil in the ground, and one day we'll be short. But is it not appropriate to use coal instead? And wind power or something. Things to worry about future generations. <br /> <br /> Then this documentary hit between the eyes. Oil makes a fertilizer that is the first cause in the history of the world, practically no one lives on farms. When the inevitable oil shortage hits, many things - air travel, many drugs, plastics, in the suburbs - are impossible. But the most daring understanding of the documentary is: oil gives us so little energy in so little effort that without it our lives must change. Even if substitutes and protection are applied immediately, they are best suited to our landing in a strange post-oil world that (documentary requirements) could start right away. <br /> <br /> Despite their gloomy message, the documentary is often a lot of fun. It contains fabulous historical materials (beautiful pictures of dark city dwellings and fun fun things from the 1950s) that reminds us why we first moved to the suburbs. It also offers the hope that the great effort that has begun can both ease our transition from oil and make the world a better place. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about a documentary is that it does not spend time in a mysterious way why we are looking for this item. How can it suddenly be a major emergency? We knew in the 1970s that we should prepare for the world after oil - and we started to prepare for alternative energy research and smaller cars. If our failure to comply with Jimmy Carter's 25-year-old initiatives has blessed us in the post-oil world for a difficult landing, why didn't anyone talk about this soapbox? <br /> <br /> Finally, the documentary was very convincing; and it left me in a terrible cool, very cute dream. It has to look at everyone who is not afraid of very likely in the near future that we still have time to do something. <br /> <br /> - Charles
