"Subspecies", like many other horror films, get raw saddle with IMDb. Most filmmakers have horror disdain, and when they occasionally rent horror films, they either want to laugh or move in too harsh scenes. Unfortunately, "subspecies" are not particularly ridiculous, not bloody, so it gets a low rating. It's too bad. <br /> <br /> There are of course many criticisms here. Non-participants are flat, subspecies have a bad special effect and night scenes are too bright. But what are you waiting for? For video-video horror, "subspecies" have decent product values ​​and greater integrity than you can foresee. The film's Romanian language is virtually unique (I believe it was the first American film made in this country, post-communism), and the locations on both the interior and exterior are beautiful. The script has moments of intelligence, especially when it goes to local folklore (all fake, I'm sure). Sometimes filming and smart scripting work well together - subspecies have a very different world. To endanger the threat of bad praise, it can be a lot of dumber. <br /> <br /> Fans of more frightening aspects will undoubtedly get bleeding from the vampire, Radust. He's quite effective in this movie - with a powerful, memorable fat voice - but I like him better when actor Anders Hove gives more independent, campy. A completely sincere Radu is somewhat silly. Other foolish aspects include free nudity and subspecies that are clearly only in the movie, as the producer Charles Band has a fetish for small creatures of evil (see also Puppetmaster and Demonic Toys). lots of movie mistakes. What it is - a direct-video vampire horror - "subspecies" is absolutely good. There are better product values ​​in the queue, more violence and a somewhat more thoughtful story, so I recommend them even higher. However, this is not a bad start for the series.
