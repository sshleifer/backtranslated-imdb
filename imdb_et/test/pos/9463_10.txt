OK, at first I thought it was another cheerful romantic comedy that kept the comedy back, but it wasn't. I mean, how could have been with the amazing Amanda Bynes who stared at it! She was amazing, really funny and still stunning! The boys were also very fit, one of the main reasons why girls go! The plot is based heavily on Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" as it was extremely similar, even with a spider called malvolio, which was a malvolio-like character. The script was really well written and pulled together and it was very witty. The football skills were also amazing, it even made me think about playing football myself! Anyway, this is a light-hearted movie about the romance of young people, which becomes very confusing! Go and see it!
