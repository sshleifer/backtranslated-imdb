The task is an outstanding thriller with several plot twists, characterized by a character rather than asterisks, the need for special effects, obligatory romance and endless cars. However, there is a car chase here and it's great. Aidan Quinn is wonderful because both the terrorist and the naval officer are "recruiting" to eliminate him. It is rare that a second or third actor, such as Quinn, is given such an important role that carries the film. Typically, this role is given in the A list for an actor who has a drawer in the box office, which is probably why I never heard this movie before I saw it. Donald Sutherland is excellent as a morally vague, sometimes creepy uncommon agent who recruits Quinnit. Ben Kingsley is also an Israeli representative. The plot is very complex and there are several stories that are gradually approaching and not all at once, as we are used to. Paranoia and claustrophobia of these types of thrillers have been captured and depicted with both moral ambiguity and intimidating intensity. Locations are convincing and effective. The sound track is nothing special, but rarely do we get all the above features these days, without the development of dark and / or pointless plots; convincing star revolutions; loud, tedious, music video type tracks; a villain who bites it; and repeatedly cast, costumes and a plot that mostly serve the public under 25 years of age. This is an outstanding thriller, which for the most part certainly did not get its release. *** 1/2 of the four stars.
