I watched this movie on the "miniseries" television in 1989 and it was an amazing movie. I would just like to see this copy again and again. It has been 15 years since I watched it, and it remains in my mind. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, it pulls you in. The characters and the plot line keep you. The end was great. The feeling and rage that the son has shown his father about the truth is unforgettable. The stop of how it comes out and how it comes to your father is really intense. <br /> <br /> If you get a copy of this movie, you will enjoy it thoroughly. <br /> <br Then send me an email and tell me where I can get the copy.
