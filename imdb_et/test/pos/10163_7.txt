Hitchcock's 1934 film problems concern the known story of McKenna's marriage (James Stewart, Doris Day, the first version of Leslie Banks, Edna Best) with her 11-year-old son traveling through Morocco on vacation. On the bus they know the sympathetic Frenchman (Daniel Gelin, old version of Pierre Fresnay). Although they are in Marrakech, they also know a couple (Bernard Miles and Brenda De Banzie) and suddenly happen to be killed, a political message dying. Then the kid is kidnapped to ensure their silence and McKenna gets help from the Moroccan Inspector Buchanan (Ralph Truman). <br /> <br /> This is a great movie about a family that bounces on a dim international conspiracy, and then they are forced to act superbly by James Stewart and Doris Day. This exciting film features a dense, intriguing, intense and interesting drama written by John Michael Hayes and Charles Bennett. Offering an ordinary temporary magician theme: innocent people get into the intrigues of web horses and surprises, intelligent crooks. The Moroccan and London studio has a colorful and bright filmmaker, Robert Burks, although it is too transparent for Marrakech scenes. Hitchcock's usual Henry Bunstead's cheerful set and working until his last death.
