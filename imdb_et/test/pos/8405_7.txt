In general, I enjoyed Scarlett. I'm a big fan of Gone with the Wind. I've read a book and seen a classic movie several times. I even have a small set of Scarlett O'Hara ornaments and other things. I have to admit that my wind and my favorite book and film are coming along with the wind. Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable are remarkable actors and two of my favorites. Unfortunately I couldn't read Scarlett, but I was happy to see the movie. It must be said that this film is not at all close to the crooked beam of the Wind, nor is it an actor. However, Joan Whalley Kilmer and Timothy Dalton played a nice role, and in many cases, Joan sounded like Vivian Leigh Scarlett. Dalton also depicted Rhett from time to time. Getting used to different participants took some time, but I generally enjoyed it, being a fan of Gone with the Wind, as I am. One of the main disappointments was that Joan had no green eyes and Scarlett O'Hara and Vivian Leigh both. I also found that Lord Fenton is totally terrible and I didn't like his character. If you're windless and / or enjoy romantic stories, check out Scarlett. But don't expect it to be remarkable like wind. It's far from it, though it's interesting with new characters and so on. I'm glad that this is not a remake and some of the story's events are what I imagined to continue with the love story of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler. If you haven't seen it today, will I get it tomorrow? :)
