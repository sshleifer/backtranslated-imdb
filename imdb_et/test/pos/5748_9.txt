This movie was amazing. I was tears at the end of the movie. Okay, I know it works, but it wasn't important. The message came loud and clear about God's love for us and the sacrifice of Jesus. The film was realistic and showed real human feelings, whether it was Pete's angry blonde girl's sons or a guy who asked questions. But it also showed the joy that comes from the true relationship with Christ. The cars were fantastic and the actors were very hot and attracted my eye. But what I liked most about this movie was a clear gospel message. Mother and pastor supported Ben in their new hands with Christ and tried to be a divine example to others. Nicky D showed that no matter whether you have the whole world to offer, without Christ, it doesn't matter. Nina showed how erroneous, but a good person can just leave the mark. I loved this movie and I think it brings a lot of teenagers to Christ.
