Charlie Wilson's war is a great example of how to make movies. This film is of high quality and is perfectly cast. Tom Hanks plays a leading role and offers exceptional performance. In addition, Tom Hanks has a unique ability to act as an excellent Philip Seymour Hoffman. I've never seen him in such a perfect match. <br /> <br /> Film is smart, smart and well written. Julia Roberts also celebrates the stars of this film, but the other two leaders are easily shady. <br /> <br /> I appreciated this movie 10/10 and I am happy to recommend this movie to anyone interested in high quality film.
