not a bad movie, but performance and scenario may be better. I like this movie because I have a life that is in good shape like a movie. it's hard to get a lost generation in Romania, and 90 percent of us choose something else and that something else involves dealing with people who have "bad habits" when you understand me, but it's with the territory. this movie represents me and I like it. I have a rage to tell me that I speak to people, I live in a society and I don't fit and I don't want to, and that is also a movie story if you like to understand a real movie, if not, you will find it simple and cheap.
