I disagree with one of the critics who criticized the film. Having read the book, it has impressed, although it is a kind of literature that you can't really LIKE (similar to Hubert Selby's writing), I was expecting it to be shocked, but that effect was finer. Isabelle Hubert is a great actor who can deliver a multilayered character. There are many scenes that focus entirely on her and her subtle changes, and I can imagine a few actors who do it well, so that they have ignored their reputation or reputation so much. Such coldness, distance, cruelty and at the same time it is helpless, painful and painful. There is a person who is controlled and controlled at the same time. Perhaps it is not realistic - even though you read the newspaper, you read it much worse - but it is a truth that is very difficult to bear. I think it's a great movie, but I didn't enjoy watching it. It's not boring, but there are times when I wanted it to end. BTW, his male colleague has worked very well (and I also think well).
