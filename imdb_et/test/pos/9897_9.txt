I was also happy to see Checking Out at the Phoenix Film Festival with Peter Falk. This is an extremely sweet character-driven film that reminds the audience of Applebaum's life situation. More than funny gives the character of each family an invaluable comic that not only encourages laughter, but also inspires some joyful tears. Peter Falk was born to play this role. She plays 90's "young" three fathers who bring their adult kids together, which could be one of the most important times in their lives. The 2-day trip that the Applebaum family takes to New York's pleasant background (with carefully selected characters) will not only leave viewers more, but will also feed their family feeling. "Check Out Out" is a black film, not only for everyone who loves the family, but also for all those who don't !!! I thank the director who took the opportunity to bring this GIFT to his audience.
