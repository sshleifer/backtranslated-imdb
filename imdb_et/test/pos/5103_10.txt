Peter O'Toole, one of our best actors, is a great reserved school teacher dedicated to teaching young boys. She meets the girl in the show and falls in love. The story is one of love and devotion. Petula Clark adds the spirit and sensitivity, not too much to the voice. You will enjoy this movie, although the end may not be happy. I enjoyed it.
