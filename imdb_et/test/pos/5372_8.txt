Ben (fine by Charles Bateman), his young daughter K.T. (lovely Geri Reischl) and her new girlfriend Nicky (extremely attractive Ahna Capri) are on the way to K.T. birthday party. They are unexpectedly waiting for a far south city where no one can leave, except Ben, K.T. and Nicky, no one can go. It is said that children disappear and adults are murdered at an alarming rate. Ben helps some local people - Sheriff Pete (LQ Jones), Tobey (Alvy Moore) and Jack (Charles Robinson), a local priest - try to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> The thematic horror movie actually precedes "Exorcist" and combines an interesting "Bad Day at Black Rock" plot in a rural area with a large closet in your closet. It actually sent some of the spinal cord back to my vision because it consistently traverses my malicious path. The desperate and festive atmosphere stays fast and lasts during this time; The increasing sense of panic gives him a real hit. Some memorable pieces include the odd opening of the toy tank, which becomes real and hits the car flat, not to mention Nickys' twisted nightmare, which was implemented live and stylish by director Bernard McEveety and the team. Jaime Mendoza-Navas's music is finely evil and gives her extreme extremes. <br /> <br /> Permanent and professional craftsmanship is doing some good work, especially when ever involved in Strother Martin is a true Doc Duncan and manufacturers / actors LQ Jones and Alvy Moore. The fact that the whole plot is under our hero's nose makes it much more intimidating. Jack the priest is going to lead them in the right direction, but are they on time to stop things? This is an enjoyable little cooler that you should visit again. just talking about myself, I could appreciate it much more after giving me another chance. I can say now, yes, it is really undervalued, talking about good, interesting, unusual and effective nature. <br /> <br /> 8/10
