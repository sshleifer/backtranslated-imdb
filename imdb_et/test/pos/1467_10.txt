This movie is a very beautiful and slow movie. There's nothing about Hollywood. It is very Danish and the characters are very real. This is the first Danish film for transsexual adoption. It is really love that has no sex. I wouldn't say that this is lesbian love, although the two main characters (transsexual veronica and Charlotte) are linked. It's a story of love and life. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty much going on in two apartments. Background music is almost non-existent, making it more realistic and more intense. The two main characters are big players. They really make them real. They are not archetypes, but the real people you meet on the street. I think this is the first time I saw this transsexual. Very well done.
