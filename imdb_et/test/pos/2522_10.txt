This film features outstanding actress Marilia PÃªra and amazing dicretcion by Argentinian Hector Babenco. This is, in my opinion, the best Brazilian film ever made. The film was filmed with a child from Brazilian "favelas". The children were not actors and they poured Babenco in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The story speaks of criminal children arrested in prison, which seems much worse than Alcatraz. Police are constantly raping and beating the children. Unfortunately, this is not just a fiction, it is still happening in Brazil today. Must see those who love violent movies. But take the mother out of the room because it's a hard movie.
