What was shown in the Roman cinema (not as bad as it was shown at the Roman Film Festival) in Italian is a highly artistic film and festival film at the Rome Film Festival, which is guaranteed and delighted by its peculiarities. style, spooky humor; the ability to lead comedy to the suffering of others; tempting, cheerful music; on-site performances; overwhelming sweetness and humanity - but disastrous, because his strange and compelling story does not allow the average audience to wonder what they are watching and why someone admires how it even got. <br /> Andersson gives us an almost complete set of dry skits. Going through them has different topics. Money: The man in the following table (Waldemar Nowak) captures a rich cage wallet that speaks over the glass brand in a cell phone restaurant, then goes and subscribes to a number of custom-made garments; The dead son calls his marked father out of a difficult collection to ask him for another loan. He is worried about his deprived investments, while his wife hugs him in a bed with only a shiny viking helmet. <br /> <br /> Depression: Primary school (Jessica Nilsson) breaks down in class because her husband has called him "harpy;" The carpenter's spouse (Pär Fredriksson) collapses in front of clients because he has called him. Many men have dreamer dreams. But hey - this is Sweden. Isn't everything depressed? Love Problems: A bohemian bohemian couple is constantly falling apart; the girl class has fantasies about the leader guitarist Micke (Eric Bäckman). Women slipping doors when their men start practicing their instruments. (Music is obviously also a unifying theme. In addition to the brilliant guitarist, there is a tube and drummer who is in the Dixierland band and also plays in the march and funeral. thunder so hard that it sounds like a battle that rushes over the earth. It also connects the tone and gives the impression that different scenes are happening at the same time on a terrifying day. <br /> <br /> Andersson is a visual composition and a static mean distance Captain and the film has a misty gray-green appearance, designed by DP Gustav Danielsson, which is perfect because it awakens the darkness of the Swedish winter, but it also flashes with the director's spiritual colors, ending with the smile of every scene. so beautiful. (Or maybe: Alexcanr Sokurov sometimes produces such effects in very different contexts.) In scenes and in a film plan ikuna is such a visualization that comes from the visual style, the speed of the scenes and the isolated humanism. general outlook. It is a completely learned style that is soothing, soothing. <br /> <br /> Not everything works equally well. You may feel impatient with a sequence of scenes that sometimes read too much of the work of a writer living on Saturday night that needs Prozac. Since some scenes move you clearly or laugh, it is obvious that others will fall slightly. <br /> <br /> But some scenes are real zingers, and one of the most obvious triumph of pure magic is the dream - described and then visualized dreams are another important thread where the girl group is a wedding dress that has just married her fey guitarist ideal who plays a delicate line of reefs while a large window collects crowds of admirers. The angle of view turns outward and the window slides slowly as if it were the building where the dreamy young man would look out of the train that moved from the station to bring them to their honeymoon. It has a fresh, subtle and quite sublime effect. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it may seem that everything in your life (Du Levande) dream, including a repetitive scene where the bartender is always bronze, and the last ordering time is announced, after which all embarrassed customers will rise up from their desks one drink. <br /> <br /> The Italian reviewer called it "a small big movie" and that's right. It limits itself to a dozen ways, but it has a size. Roy Andersson is a small captain (like some medieval miniaturists) about Scandinavian dark comedies that are different from other films. This year's "Un Certain Regard" of Cannes is also Sweden's Best Foreign Oscar 2007. It's hard to say what Bergman thinks, but Andersson worked with him; is famous for its precisely produced TV commercials, some of which are visible on YouTube. Bergman called them "the best advertising in the world". It is interesting to see whether this director, whose craft is subtle from his point of view, will work for some time in longer segments. In the meantime, every good movie buffer must look at it. <br /> <br /> "Schadenfreude" is not the right word. It means joy from the misery of others. Andersson teaches us to rejoice in the affliction of all of us.
