If you don't like Mel Brooks, this movie doesn't like it. It's given. Why would someone not want his films to be known to me, but to those who do not see the light, just do it. <br /> <br /> All the others: it's classic. The whole cast is perfect: Carey Elwes is a disgraceful, wise, BRITISH Robin Hood, Amy Yasbeck moves appropriately when Marion, Richard Lewis is his usual confused, annoyed himself, Roger Rees is a brilliant combination of flug and violence as "Mervyn" Rottingham sheriff and Dave Chapelle, Eric Allan Kramer, Mark Blankfield and Sadly Miss Matthew Poretta are the perfect Merry Men. <br /> <br /> There are similarities with Spaceballs, Blazing Saddle ... and every other Mel Brooks movie. But why do you want it to change its style when it works so damn? The pop culture references of this movie are old enough to be funny again, at least 16 years old. It's a complete and perfect parody, every second you have a laugh. Some of them do not work, but most and most. I discovered new jokes for the fifth and sixth time when I watched the movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, if your constant visual and verbal gags are not your style, it wouldn't like you. This is not the winner of the Academy Award, it's Mel Brooks. You know what it is when you get there. If you want constant laughter, surprisingly well-developed characters, and a couple of paragraphs to last for life, look at it.
