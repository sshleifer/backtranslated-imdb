This concert is a type of concert that only arrives every 20 years, and Madonna's confessions in the era of the dance floor will certainly be remembered as one of the highest points in her career. He's 48 years old and he just looks divine, he's been holding on to nearly twenty years younger dancers. I am also very pleased to announce that all the songs are lived, which is good, because he actually sounds better. Each song was so unique, a visual where stunning. "Live to tell" performance was fantastic and I was amazed, "Isaac" was exotic and proud, and was rich in political symbolism, Arabian horn, American eagle free. I especially liked the "I Love New York" rock photos, I almost stood up in my salon and rejoiced when he said his critics suck George Bushes ****. And again I was impressed by the 70's inspired music (inferno remix). This Spectacular decedent Concert made me a fan. <br /> <br /> Decision: Highly recommended for Capital H.
