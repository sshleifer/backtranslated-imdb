During World War II, Japanese soldiers are starving, dying, growing weak and getting worse. A small group of soldiers trying to survive have finally used cannibalism. This film is an excellent insanity that transcends people in extreme conditions. This movie has some humorous parts, but most of it is just a very slow and realistic movie. It follows these soldiers from one painful moment to another and eventually to death. A very interesting film that shows death and horror that may have been the worst war in the world.
