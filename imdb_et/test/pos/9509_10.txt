I've seen movies come and go my years, and when I see a catastrophe movie I hope I won't be disappointed. And this one I was not at least. The story of the whole country sinking into the ocean was a great concept written by a writer of sakyo komatsu, with intense theories where this land goes. The characters were top-notch, and although I am not Japanese, I didn't need a translator to give an idea of ​​how people could meet their most desperate needs for common good. Special effects blew me out, literally at my seat, watching the tides Waves of stage currents and earth explosions that had to take months to work perfect. Yes, it works best, emotions run across the film and I shouted for the toughest scenes. For visitors to the movie, you don't have to watch this movie and understand Japanese, you get the idea and feel of every person and character to understand it well and follow it as you are there. My hats to guide Shinji Higuchi, I hope she can overcome her second experience of breathing. As I said, ... Fantastic movie.
