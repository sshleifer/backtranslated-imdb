Ok, when I rented it for several years ago, I had the worst expectations. Yes, acting is not great, and the picture itself is dated, but when I was sitting there was a strange thing. I started to like it. The action is great and there are few scenes that pop you up. Brion James, perhaps one of the biggest B-class actors alongside Bruce Campbell, is great as always. The story is not bad either. Now, I'm not in a hurry or buy it, but you don't waste your time looking at this good b-class post-apocalyptic west.
