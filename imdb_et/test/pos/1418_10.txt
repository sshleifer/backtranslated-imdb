I've been a big fan of Errol Morris because I saw Thin Blue Line and heard it saved life. To date, this film is her best work. <br /> <br /> The plot is a mix of Stephen Hawking's book with the same title that is intertwined with human life. The story is told by interviews with families, friends and Hawkings. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled; It sounds completely boring, but the whole package is dynamic and thought-provoking. Blending life and theories is seamless and fun. I was especially moved by how well they humanize this genius and all-knowing man. When you are physically impossible, Hawking's greatness and shine shine in a real, living human being, which is allowed to laugh and be at the same time. <br /> <br /> Find this movie. See it and have fun. And if a studio with this picture reads it, the 15-year anniversary edition would be perfect now ...
