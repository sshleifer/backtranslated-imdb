Frankly, I thought this film would be a Japanese drama. I was dead wrong. This movie is based on the popular and the same name of the Japanese anime. It tells the story of a city that is in English in Uzumaki or Spiral. Gradually, city dwellers slowly become dangerously and violently attached to spirals, and some residents actually become living creatures that actually have some sort of spiral like a snail. The film was a gigantic, casual, acidic journey that was twisted with romance and drama. It's like twisted drama. What makes this movie disturbing is the way some people have become obsessed with the spiral. For example: one father has a full storage room with spirals installed, one girl took her very long hair and teased quite a big spiral, one boy slowly turned into a human snail, one man could turn his body into a spiral shape, one woman tried to open his ear, To get from the inside and one teen ran around him so he could twist the car tire and one child stuffed himself in the washing machine that he got Another very disturbing aspect of this very well syndicate is the atmosphere tone and the style in which this movie was kicked. Camera corners add a psychotic and twisted story, in other words, good cinematography. The general coloring of this picture gives a somewhat demented story. The color is a mixture of lime green, yellow and slightly orange, and the special effects of some spirals are outstanding. girl and boy romance. However, if all the spirals and strange events in the city are complicated, you will be familiar with two teenage relationships. But in some way, this is a very irrelevant, rather second-hand story that has nothing to do with the real story of a spiral obsession city. very different and weird foreign films. It's just crazy and madness, it touched me.
