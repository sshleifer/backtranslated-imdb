Although it is a little away from the book, you can't love music and settings in the air. <br /> <br /> Bath scenes are just as they should be. Although if you have watched it so many times when you notice that the background people are the same in every scene, but aside, I like the scene where they are in hot tubs, but do men and women really swim together like this? You saw all the men who sat outside the neighbors were women. It was also strange that they all had hats, but maybe it was at that time. The ballrooms were very nice, dancing and outfit seemed beautiful. Catherine especially liked the first dance hall. <br /> <br /> The Northanger Monastery seemed to be busy, but I enjoyed Bath's scenes better. <br /> <br /> Schlesinger delivers good but not exceptional performance at Catherine Morland. Googie Withers gives the best result than Mrs Allen I know. <br /> <br /> Ugh Peter Firth, Mr Tilneyna, he just talks about the load of garbage and is not spiritual when he should be, it's hard to think he's in love with Catherine, but then this book never really impressed. <br /> <br /> General Tilney plays quite well with Hardy and Stuart also produces some good results than Isabella. Ingrid Lacey did not give Elinor Tilney a good result. As for John Thorpe, he gives the impression of an abundant and covetous man, perhaps not the character depicted in this book, but I like it. , but when new scenes and characters are added, it usually disturbs me. Marchioness! I hate him. He's not a Northanger story, and he doesn't have a fingertip page. <br /> <br /> Some scripts are unique. When Catherine asks Elinor Tilney about her mothers' death, she asks, "I think you saw the body? How did it appear?" What a stupid thing to say! Elinor's calm response is too stupid. <br /> <br /> Please tell me if you agree or disagree with me
