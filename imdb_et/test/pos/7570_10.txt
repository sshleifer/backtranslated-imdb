I was three Sarah borrowed for a friend and I was watching them at the end of the week in a sick bed. I liked each of them thoroughly. I liked how the last film gave a glimpse of what Caleb and his sister were when they grew up. In addition, I liked the "Billy-boy" song that was first heard at the time of the first movie credit under the title "Sarah, Plain and Tall". But one thing in Winter's End that I didn't like was the youngest daughter. She was a very cute little girl, but she just had too much spirit and looked like other children, even compared to the talkative but still good-natured Caleb when she was younger.
