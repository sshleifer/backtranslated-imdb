This movie is like "The Breakfast Club" will meet "Mad City". It turned to one plot after another, with Justin Walker, Corey Feldman and James Remar, who really offer great performances. However, this movie is not for everyone. If you don't like movies that go "all the way" to violence, don't look at the last 20 minutes. My wife had to leave the room. Of course, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. It's a really sharp, realistic teen drama. I can't believe it came from B-Movie King Roger Corman. This movie is a must-see for those who are not weak. Highly recommended.
