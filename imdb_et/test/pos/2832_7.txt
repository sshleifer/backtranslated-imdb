In general, he wants it to be a better film, but it has enough intense power to value it. Peck made this movie while he made The Gunfighter before he probably decided he was a monument rather than an actor. Damage! He was a good actor who was perfectly prepared to deal with very unpleasant characters and do them very well. He plays character here and, if necessary, ruthless. Given the mission that nature is assigned to, and the "men" to do it, these qualities are indispensable. <br /> <br /> Without a spoiler, think of this movie as an early, grittier Dirty Dozen genre. <br /> <br /> The dialogue in this movie is a bit of a ham, but it is atmospheric and intense and definitely tells a story worth talking about. It contains a good character by actors of all characters and even Barbara Payton becomes credible. <br /> <br /> This is not often shown on television, so your local video store may be the only place to find a copy. Go ahead! Give him an evening. It's worth your time!
