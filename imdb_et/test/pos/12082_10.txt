Who loves my children has changed my heart, it made me cry all the way, the most I cried when the family had to say goodbye to the child, I cried it the most and every time the child was cried, when they had to say goodbye to my mother, was sad that they lose their mother, I was sorry for the child with epilepsy, I was glad that the same family accepted one of my brothers. For me, this guy I thought was special because he went home. I feel like I'm special because I'm in the world with Aspergers syndrome and sometimes when I feel I'm crying. I really enjoyed this movie, 10 out of 10. True story, very good. Another movie that would bring tears to your eyes, I think it would be better to be with Morri on Tuesday (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0207805)
