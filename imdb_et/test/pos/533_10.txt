Adam Sandler's films are my favorite comedies. Tallies silence is my favorite horror film. The matrix is ​​my favorite sci-fi movie. Anywhere But Here is my favorite drama. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most valuable asset this movie has is that it works. At the end of this movie, I felt that I felt his character better than I knew. He just did an amazing job. <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman did a good job. Recently I rented my first movie, Leon (1994), where he played a 12-year-old girl. I believe he is in contradiction; he was a good child actor. Well, 5 years later, he's still a good actor. In fact, he's much better. <br /> <br /> Sarandon and Portman did not show their characters well, but also worked together. I mean, even now, I can't believe they're not really a mother and a daughter both in life and in this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a 14-year-old girl (Portman) and her restless mother (Sarandon) who leaves her home in Wisconsin for Beverly Hills. <br /> <br /> At first, Portman hates her mother, who takes her away from her cousin and friends, and two start a very nice relationship that goes up and down in a few years (usually down, I can add). <br /> <br /> Although this explanation is a bit vague, the plot can only be summarized vaguely. But when you see this movie, you see that the plot is not really as vague or weak as it is really very deep. I say the plot is very weak, but then it is focused on being strong so that it is strong. And there are some great scenes that I hope are sometimes considered "classic". <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. I laughed. I cried. And while there are some gaps, it is still a constellation and it really ends.
