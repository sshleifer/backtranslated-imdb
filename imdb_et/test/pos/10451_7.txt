Yes, this is the Fast Times wannabe, but it's still a good entertainment. <br /> <br /> Some comedy parts are really funny. The scene, when three men visit a Spanish lady, is fun, with little flamenco music in the background. The reaction, when his sailor's husband comes home, is a rebellion. Boys also use funny things when dealing with crabs when they try to "drown" them and when they visit a pharmacist. The abortion scene is also a rip-off of the Fast Times, but it does good to capture the terror of the situation. You really know what Karen is going through, and Gary is your mad scramble for money to pay for abortion and restore her recovery. <br /> <br /> The end is painful to look at, but refreshingly realistic. First-time viewers are not ready for this and this is a shock. <br /> <br /> For young girls and a Spanish female patient, there is a decent eye-candy, but heterosexual men probably want to miss the penis measurement competition. <br /> <br /> Also an underrated soundtrack. Explore an early, early U2 (!), Autos in your main and James Ingram's matching tear guide song surprise. <br /> <br /> Some people hate it and it is somewhat dated, but those who like teenage clips or grown up in the early 80s should like it.
