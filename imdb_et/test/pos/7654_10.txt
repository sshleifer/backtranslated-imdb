This film is a gobel of portraits of Roma communities put together by music. This is very much a musician's film, because the dialogue that is spoken is limited and what kind of dialogue exists, is not important for the narrative structure. Some may expect a national geographic story of "customs, clothing, and music" or some landline around average characters - don't look at it here. <br /> <br /> This is because it paints a portrait of a family of nations, rather than talking about individuals. The plot is a story about space (Andalusia, India) and / or the time of the people (we can't say). No need to talk. You will feel happy people who are heavily involved in small communities where social interaction is very important. And the great feeling of sadness in parts, rejected by their society. <br /> <br /> So this is a couple of romantic landscapes that have been photographed very nicely, with large-scale Roma music and a collision with the tail, which is the oppression of these people, and still faced.
