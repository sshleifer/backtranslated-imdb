All I can say after watching DVDs in the first season is that I can't believe that NBC showed this green light. It is as different as it is now in fashion when you lose Lost. Those who are not left with X-Files may be worth the worthy heir. Not as mysterious or intense as lost, I find it more fun. <br /> <br /> This kind of extended story is hard to do. I mean, it can break into a childlike sting if most of the elements are not together. But associate them and I think the cast is excellent, writing sharp, location and props for the first time, and special effects for the television budget are very good. Of course, it pushes what is plausible, but because it never gets so stupid to offend your intelligence. <br /> <br /> Bottomline is that it is a great Sci-Fi drama for the whole family. I doubt it is classic, for a long time like X-Files, but in the meantime I recommend getting a DVD if you missed it the first time I did. One more series has appeared in my black exhibition this fall! <br /> <br /> PS: I just heard it came from NBC to the tent ... Here's the hope that Sci-Fi will pick it up.
