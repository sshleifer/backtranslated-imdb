I've been waiting to see this movie aged and I have finally! As soon as I heard the title, I knew that this movie would be my favorite movie and when I saw it, I believe I wasn't disappointed! <br /> <br /> This movie was all dance, love and Patrick Swayze! There was so much in it and it was about important issues (which were at that time in the 1960s) like abortion. <br /> <br /> Dancing this movie was fantastic as it did! Swayze was brilliant as Gray too! <br /> <br /> Although this movie was absolutely fantastic, you can't say you've seen it unless you've seen the last scene. It catches the breath because the choreography of the last dance was perfect, at the end of the movie you were dancing and it would not really be surprising if it would affect people to start dancing. <br /> <br /> In general, Dirty Dancing is a movie that doesn't miss, and even if half of the participants are, "Where are they now?" During the period, the actors always get this great movie in their career!
