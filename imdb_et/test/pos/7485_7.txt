We go to the store where Nick looks at the coins in his hand, noting whether he receives a special, 69 cents 20 ounce cup of coffee with a free pastry. She decides to go for a bigger size, which of course is more expensive plus it doesn't fit her cake. He tries to register with an Indian secretary who keeps his land. This is a fundamental question with him. Well, it gets irritated that she doesn't get her way and continues to kill her. <br /> <br /> The tone of the story is set from the beginning. The people we meet are not nice guys. There's Nick, his girlfriend, Dallas and their partner Billy Hill. They are drug dealers. Nick decides to visit Casey, his friend and former crime partner in Houston. He wants to make another deal and then go to Paris with the profits he brings. What he does not understand is that Casey has gone straight. He is an architect who is married to Christine and wants to have a baby. <br /> <br /> Casey doesn't rate his former friend who brings drugs into the house. He decides to get rid of things by rinsing them out of the kitchen utensil. The premature arrival of Ice, a pizza supplier, will surprise Casey. This man has been sent to kill him, but before that, Casey brings out some weeds to share with Ice, who has a grooming opportunity. <br /> <br /> Just at this point Dr. host institution. Casey's application shows a two-year gap that he cannot justify. Jarvis will doubt his future father. At this time, Dallas makes an entrance. She is a woman who asks questions blank, as if she wants to know if Jarvis enjoys watching porn. Jarvis, who has awakened, can leave. Dallas has decided to attract all costs to Casey. There is a surprise in the shop because Billy Hill enters the picture and doesn't like what she sees when shooting Dallas. Billy Hill has also come out of Casey, but he is impossible. <br /> <br /> Casey gets a visit to Kasarov who wants to get his money from Nick; in his absence he takes it from Casey. Kasarov sets a deadline, and Casey makes his mind to overcome all these low lives. He has come to all parties in his class at the designated hour, and the different factions take care of themselves. Finally, Casey has a better plan that includes Christine's stay in Paris. <br /> <br /> Never heard of "Thursday" because of the talent we had. Skip Woods drove his material. It looks like it's a well-intentioned movie. Sometimes the film remembers the same genre as any other form or form that seems to be the main objection to the negative comments left on the IMDb site here. For starters, "Thursday" shows witty Skip Woods, which has gone on to write other films, especially "swordfish". The scenario is divided into chapters with activity-related indicative titles. Denis Lenoir does wonders mainly with interior design. <br /> <br /> Thomas Jane makes a great contribution to the film with his Casey. Although it is hard to imagine, he has won and has done something. This actor, most recently seen on television "Hung", is one of the actors we don't watch. Dark Hair Aaron Eckhart is a welcome addition to movies. He is a greasy criminal who has no redeeming qualities, or something that is close to regret and does not hesitate to involve his former friend in his scheme. James LeGros has nothing to do. The same is true of Paulina Porizkova, a proud creature that is only disturbing or adding a sexy angle. We liked Glenn Plummer, who appears at Iceina. He makes an average listening on the phone. Michael Jeter and Mickey Rourke also appear.
