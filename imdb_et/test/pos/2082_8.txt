This is a very small film full of interesting signs and situations. Although it is not in the same class as some of the best-known movies of that time, it is still very observable and memorable. The scene in which Zachary Scott sits on the bus steals an accidental airlift that is placed over the seat next to the coat. He defines his character beautifully - a man who is so low he puts the war veteran with something invaluable to use in various charades. She easily stands when the situation demands, and admires women in Fenchurch's household with her irresistible charm and the smile of this killer. <br /> <br /> I couldn't think about whether this film was made to succeed by Mildred Pierce. Scott and Bruce Bennett were together again, and Faye Emerson is similar to Joan Crawford's face structure and big eyes. Nor is Mona Freeman's character different from Mildred Pierce's unpleasant Veda. <br /> <br /> I agree with the previous comment that the end of the movie was too nice, with a comfortable drum over the rock "Ronnie Mason", the character of Zachary Scot. In one of the last scenes we see that Mona Freeman has reunited with her boyfriend, who she had previously been intimidated by older, smoother Zachary Scot. I think the script should insist that he be attacked for his behavior and his brutality against his sister, instead of treating it as a typical adolescent episode. But these are small drawbacks in an otherwise enjoyable and well-made movie.
