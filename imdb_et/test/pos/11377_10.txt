This movie is everything. Great actors, good dialogue, drama, comedy and great writing and leadership by Paul Thomas Anderson. I've seen this movie many times and enjoy it every time. It won't get old, it's constantly fun and stimulating. Just the best role of Burt Reynolds and he does a good job. John C. Reilly and Don Cheadle also provide great comics. There is no weak element in this movie.
