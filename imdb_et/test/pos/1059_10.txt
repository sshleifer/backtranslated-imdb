Barbara Stanwyck is the sheer joy of this war-comedy, a sailor invited to spend Christmas with a popular journalist's family at her farm in Connecticut. The problem is that he does not have a husband, a child or a farmer as he writes in his column, and he can't even eat; Her great recipes give her a good friend "Uncle" Felix, a Hungarian restaurant owner in New York. <br /> <br /> Things get even more complicated when their strict publisher boss calls for Christmas. The scheme is planned quickly, with her closed groom offering a real Connecticut farm, neighbors offering a borrowed baby, and a quick wedding that the designer is not going to look at. But when a powerful young man arrives on Christmas Eve, romantic complications arise because the allegedly married author falls like a dark chick to a naval man and vice versa. <br /> <br /> This is a charming, warm movie that balances humor and feelings and is a great presentation for Barbara Stanwyck to show her great comedy talent, supported by such wonderful character actors as Sydney Greenstreet, Una O'Connor, SZSakall and many others. The joy of dancing in the Town Hall is to see, and Stanwycki's unexpectedly sweet and feminine side is a wonderful surprise for viewers who have seen him mainly as a harsh, joking female femme. A really wonderful movie that has tried over time.
