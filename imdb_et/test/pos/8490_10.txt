Jamie Foxx leads this powerful journey through the spectacular lie of blind, emotionally disturbed, African-American pop jazz, the life of Mr. Ray Charles. Although the whole cast performer does great, Mr. Foxx earned more than just an Oscar. If it were possible to name an actor for a consecutive year, I would consider it for Mr Foxx. Foxx doesn't just play Charles, he creates it again. CJ Sanders and Sharon Warren also deserve a special reputation for depicting their mother (the inspiration for her life) and the young Ray. The two offered strong support in the film. <br /> <br /> Charles's fight with guilt, his younger brother and mother's death, darkness, discrimination, addiction and success are nicely woven into the tapestries of his music. The music is beautiful, the script is as much as possible, perfect and acting is not legendary. <br /> <br /> The film's management method requires discussion. Taylor Hackford - Director, who I am generally ambivalent - had to choose which aspects of the greater and more complex life story of Charles's life would tell his story in the most honest, dramatic and understandable way. While some disagree (apparently wanting a documentary instead of a dramatic biopsy), I believe he chose his themes perfectly. Much of the success of this film is its consistent focus on some persistent theme in Charles's life - his deep love and respect for his mother, his need to love and receive, his addiction and guilt complex, his musical genius, and his deep fear of responsibility for others. Charles is depicted as a man who fights bravely with his personal demon army. I learned more if I could have imagined that one of the men I listened to on my old record player was on my evening evening on Sunday night when football games were on TV. "Ray" didn't contain anything sugar. Topics are transferred to power and human dignity. These themes create a unifying drama that includes the length of his long and enlightened life. The power of these themes, a strong script and leadership, music and actor make it one of the most enjoyable and expressive biographical films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Recommended for everyone.
