------ Spoilers ----- Spoilers ----- Spoilers -------- just a few small <br /> <br /> This is seen in the Satil Canal, missed the first 30 min movie, keeps this comment brief and informative. <br /> <br /> The movie is essentially about 5 characters long. 1 girl with the help of another girl robs 3 different people, but she flees and 3 robbes 2. This is one of the kind of films where script artists try to be thought-provoking or philosophical, mysterious and ... you get a point; but make them very short because of their own, personal and meaningless absence. Like one of the prisoners who ought to be some kind of psychic crying, there is a part, but his language cannot be spoken. Writers think that if nerd uses a lot of 8 letters from amateurishly - unknowingly I believe - viewers are sufficiently aware to believe it. I wish I could give an example, but I cannot recall - just as I said. The end was also bad. But one female in captivity acted as her old and relatively wise woman, although she, like elsewhere, had many clich√©s. <br /> <br /> So why should I give this movie 7 stars if I think everything above? Easy, I'll give all seven letters to ADD KELLER - one sexy $$ momma. SHE is FINE lol. I am the admirer of beauty and she is exactly that. But don't get me confused because I'm not perverted and this movie is not porn in any way. there is something I can't explain about them, but I like it. I remember an event where he was released in captivity and when he was looking for a way out, he moved to Keller. She's trying to get her way, but she has no chance. He throws him down, kneeling down the stairs, and he pulls the pants down without the panties;). Now, though he has an AMAZING ass - and this blow leaves a little imagination for a long 30 seconds, I guess - it was his facial expression that got me. he wanted it, and it saw that I thought I was behind it. I would have torn this harvest! After that expression I couldn't look at him objectively, I was in love. lol. I'm glad to see this movie, but if Lisa Keller didn't play a leading role, I'd have changed the channel ... well ... after I saw the scene mentioned above. I'm a fan of LISA KELLER, but it looks like he is not a consistent actor, seeing the last of this 2003 movie. But I watch her another movie.
