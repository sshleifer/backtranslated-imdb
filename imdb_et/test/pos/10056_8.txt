I haven't been a Madonna fan right now, but I thought I would comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was wrong. One of them, like Madonna, was put by the critics. They were very mistaken and many potential viewers were turned off due to poor ratings. <br /> <br /> First of all, Madonna in this movie is doing an excellent job, which was her first. She plays a ditsy blonde in the movie, she is in real life far from a ditsy blonde. Most critics were somewhat unsuccessful in his song's fame and did not give him a fair shake. When you watch this movie, I hope you understand that accent and whore are just working. Griffen Dunne is another person to whom the film did not give a fair view. When you look at his filmography, you see that he is quite an accomplished actor. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, it is something like a real woman, but came 3 years before Roberts, It's successful. This is a funny-ball comedy with lots of site cuts, strokes and one liner. Some comedy is dead and comedy enthusiastic to really understand finer humor. <br /> <br /> I know it doesn't talk much about the movie, but I hope it helps to dispel the belief that it's a bad film. It is a pleasure to enjoy the night. <br /> <br /> Peace. <br /> <br /> Gary
