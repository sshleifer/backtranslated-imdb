1904 North African Moroccan people hang on weak independence because different European authorities - France, Germany, Great Britain, Russia, Spain and now the United States - are capable of doing this. Sultan (Marc Zuber) is a weak doll; his uncle, Bashaw (Vladek Sheybal), manipulated by the French and Germans, is the true force behind the throne. Enter Berber Chieftan Raisul (Sean Connery), the leader of the Rif tribe and "the last Barbary Pirates" who kidnaps the American missionary, Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen) and his two children and takes them hostage. In the US, President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) is facing war on this issue: "Pedecaris Alive or Raisile Dead!" - seeing the problem as an excellent way to carry out his "Big Stick" diplomacy, although Secretary of State John Hay (John Huston) is not so sure. However, the razor has less pristine plans for Pedecarise, who is able to cope in any case. <br /> <br /> John Mileus's great historical film, based on a very loose real story (ie, Pedecaris was a medieval man), is a great imprisonment. It has some amazing action scenes, a witty, well-written script, a fine cast that accompanies the material and does not exceed its greetings, such as "Caribbean Pirates" or "Lord of the Rings" films. This is not really an "epic" movie in the strictest sense, but it is one of the best pure-action films ever made. <br /> <br /> Although the historical context is shaky, the story is interesting, and some reviewers think it is even more relevant today than it was done. As President Roosevelt says, "America is like a grizzly bear" - acute, strong, but at times somewhat blind and reckless. At the time of setting up the film, America had just come to power in the world as a superpower, after they were powerful in the Spanish-American war. And Roosevelt grabs this case to prove American belief. It didn't work in real life, but it allegorally works well. From the right perspective, the Milius scenario is quite accurate when evaluating America and its place in the world. She admires Roosevelt and her "ambassador" diplomacy method, and admits correctly (with Roosevelt's words) that although America may be feared and respected, the world is never "loved", whatever they do. And there are a few scenes - such as the shooting of Roosevelt's European leaders and the almost comic surprise of Marines in the Bashawi Palace - showing America's reckless and violent side, while others - the climate fight with Germans - show their heroism. br /> <br /> The film's historical / political context is, of course, just the bones of the meat, which is essentially an amazing action / adventure movie. There are some great scenes, such as Raisul's rescue from Pedecaris's double crossings, featuring some of the best sword games in every movie. Opening the rush and the above-mentioned route, and the US Navy's attack, are brilliantly made. And the last battle that combines the elements of "Arab Lawrence" and "Wild Bunch", while the great historical fantasy (the three-way struggle between Germans, Americans and Rifs) is a superbly staged, adrenaline pumping sequence. <br /> <br /> Excellent casting gives great performances. Everyone seems to have a fun time in the movie and it shows. Sean Connery is surprisingly convincing as a Berber who has a Scottish accent, but succeeds in pulling out his interesting, well-drawn and silly character that respects his hostage, and violates a modern, civilian. Candice Bergen, an actor I never loved, gives a fine performance as feisty Eden Pedecaris, who is as harsh as her captain. Brian Keith is an amazingly convincing TR - you feel he has to be such a sporty, gentle but practical and intelligent person who has a wonderful feeling. Roosevelt's boxing and targeting of foreign policy discussions is one of the greatest "bad ass" moments in film history - and who can forget such features as "Why is the beauty of this thing lawfully violated?" John Huston offers strong support as tired, cautious Hay, acting as a perfect foil for much more brisk Roosevelt. <br /> <br /> Among the best, are Geoffrey Lewis, like Samuel Gummere, the cynical ambassador caught in the middle of political intrigues, and Steve Kanaly, the captain of the navy, who happily advocates (and carries out "military intervention!") other familiar faces like Vladek Sheybal, Nadim Sawalha, Roy Jenson, Larry Cross, Marc Zuber and Darrell Fetty are doing a good job, no matter how small their role is. -John ("A Fistful of Dynamite") as General of Germany and Aldo Sambrell as one of the Raisul tribes. "Wind and Lion" is a wonderfully made adventure film everywhere: something for everyone: a wonderful weapon and a sword game a lot of humor, a harsh, heroic heroine (and her two lovely children), a nice (as uncomfortable) romance and an interesting (if obvious) political / historical context. This is not a masterpiece, but hey, she wasn't trying to be. l vi "interfering nine stars and my highest recommendation.
