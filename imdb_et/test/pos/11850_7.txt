Plot: Ed and Alice are involved. They live together and live a boring life. She's been asleep before Alice. He has much less experience. He decides he must sleep before he gets married. He is very reluctant to agree that both should see other people for some time. <br /> <br /> First of all, he hasn't really fallen into it. Her natural days are behind her and she is just content. Until one day Alice returns and tells her that she did some random boys; who of course starts to fall for him. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a BAD idea that causes relationships to be extremely burdensome. <br /> <br /> Good movie. The train wreck looks, but still good. <br /> <br /> It's worth renting.
