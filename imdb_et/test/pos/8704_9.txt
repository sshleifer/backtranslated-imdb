I was ten years old when I saw Subspecies, I had the hoods of Michael Watson and Laura Tate instantly, they had very big screen chemistry in earlier parts of the movie. I ordered a copy of Full Moon in 1993 and I got to know it: Ion and Rosa, the servants, have a much bigger role with the king. What most people don't know is there is an alternative sequence that was supposed to happen in the end scene: Michelle and Stefan get a corner of the room and Michelle has the idea of ​​making a vampire for Stefan to help fight Radu and his demonic controlled former friends. However, for some reason or another reason, it was not done with the camera in the scenario. The second scenario, which can be affixed to the original trailer, shows Stefan's drinking from the wolf or, in fact, the trailer that you see him in the blood to his chin. <br /> <br /> This movie will be 9 because it is one of my childhood and I have character memories; Although my favorite characters were Stefan and Michelle, I think that Anders Hove's Radu is a pure feeling-emotional actor, so much in his work.
