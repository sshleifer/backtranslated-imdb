Talk about your classic! Ernie Fossilus (Foss out of here) came with a cute and creative trailer that was completely Star Wars. This pearl is so stuck, full of respect and gags. Not only that, when Star Wars made a new special effect again, Hardware Wars did the same! Talk about fraud that just doesn't die! That's why George Lucas calls it his favorite parody. He was so impressed that he even hired Foss to work for "Jedi Return" (don't believe me, check his scrap in IMDb!) <br /> <br /> This must be the first and my opinion, the best parody ever made. I think the special edition was a bit superfluous, but in contemplation, I think it is perfect for Star Wars to re-launch today and proves that sometimes the wrong confusion is blended perfectly. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's only 10 minutes, but it's worth your time. <br /> <br /> You laugh, you cry, you can say goodbye to $ 3! Well, maybe for 15 DVDs, but you're real lucky.
