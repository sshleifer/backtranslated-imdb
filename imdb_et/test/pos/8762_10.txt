Beautifully designed, "Traffik" tells the story of drug use and trade from several perspectives. From a police point of view, from a politician's point of view, from addiction, from a smuggler's perspective and from a farmer's perspective. A carefully called story gives an impression of how everything is interrelated. From the beautiful spot on the Pakistani poppy rocks, the Karachi downtown, the Frankfurt and London entry points, the smuggled buildings, the huge dimension of drug use is seen.
