Regardless of the date, I think "Inki and Minah Bird" is an enjoyable and charming comic. Art is not extraordinary, but good enough. This comic is not a dialogue, but a sound and a music, but this combination works pretty well. The copy itself is good, funny, old-fashioned, creative, fun and fun. <br /> <br /> This drawing also makes a difference because it focuses only on 3 characters: Inki (a little black girl), Minah Bird (a very strange bird) and a hungry lion who wants both Inca and Minah for breakfast, so He drives them both during most of the comics. <br /> <br /> I find this lion very beautiful, fun and cool. I like this lion. This poor lion is so stupid and loser that you have to know him. For me, the real enemy is Minah Bird, not the lion. At one point, the lion eats almost it - too bad for it to escape because it has eaten. <br /> <br /> Back in this animated short time, no empty or boring moment. At least for me. The only bit I find is the end, because the bird is fighting against the lion, stealing its teeth and putting them on its own. In addition, I have nothing to criticize, apart from the fact that the steak should definitely have a lion and not a bird. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is a very forgotten and undervalued little jewel that should definitely get more credit.
