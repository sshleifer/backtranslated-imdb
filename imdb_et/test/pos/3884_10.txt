Jeff Garlin's film is full of heart and laughter. Like Curb Your Enthusiasm, his screen person is fun; but we also see a feeling of warmth and emotional vulnerability that makes this story universal. Although the film crowns the dreams of its character about love, promotion and weight loss, it turns to everyone who dreams of a better life. Supporting casting brings on the frustration and joy of your life in a funny and heartbeat. All topics are simple joys of food, friendship, and once again life's disappointment. Using music is creative and adds this movie to many pleasures. Every Jeff Garlin TV show fan must see it!
