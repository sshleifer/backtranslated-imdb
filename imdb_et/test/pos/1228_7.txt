I'm not here to say "Armored" is Kubrickian, Hitchcockian or Fellini-esquire. No. These directors are more like Don Siegel ("Charlie Varrick") and Walter Hill ("The Warriors"). These two helmsmen don't joke like women in their movies. No skirts need to be valid. They made rubber films in films. Weapons, a lot of weapons. The men met with violent death by pulling the jaw. Their films were like head to head. You want a friend? Send a dog. <br /> <br /> "Armored" is such a guy movie. Dueling armored trucks? Bloody impact devices? Exploding money? If it doesn't get your brain lizard excited, leave it away. We meet six security guards who run armored vehicles, three trucks. Six, led by Matt Dillon, form a fake hijacker, which includes two trucks. Their mission is one day to provide $ 42 million from the Federal Reserve (in my opinion). The idea is to drive both trucks to the warehouse, put down the cash, then let them hijack. Surely the police officers doubt them, but if they stay together, they will get through it. First of all. But he looks out for eviction. And he's a guardian of his confusion for his younger brother. He needs money bad. <br /> <br /> Matt Dillon cajoles claims to persuade revenge. There is no blood on someone's hands. Clean holidays. All good, not bad. You're forever rich. Blue sky smiles at you ... <br /> <br /> Right. <br /> <br /> Everything goes to hell. It's one dead thing after another and the stakes are rising. And almost everything happens in a claustrophobic abandoned warehouse somewhere in Los Angeles. In fact, the film is going to be the background of the degradation of the industrial city. I like the industrial degradation of cities. <br /> <br /> Kudos Matt Dillon, who plays a bad dog at the top. She is disappointed to be disappointed to make the movie completely crazy. I love this man. <br /> <br /> The credit is also due to the threatening, stabbing, bubbling and completely sinful electronic sound of John Murphy. I think he's heard some Tangerine Dream documents. <br /> <br /> It is also surprising that this is a PG-13 film. I got one? one! ? f-bomb in this movie about violent harsh robberies. At some level I like it. Get the kids. <br /> <br /> The director is Nimrod Antal, a Hungarian who made a fine noir in the "Check" subway system in Budapest. Anyone who is called James V. Simpson is from the scene. Many people in this movie are just beginning. I am ready to make the respect for this film rise over time and those filmmakers ahead of their career.
