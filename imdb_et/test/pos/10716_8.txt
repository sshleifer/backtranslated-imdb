Academy Award-winning Kramer vs. Kramer ‚Äùfollows the amazing businessman Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) and his divorce between his eternal husband (Meryl Streep). One day Ted leaves her and her child a better life, forcing Ted closer to her son (Justin Henry). Two ties and become very close (but only after some friction) and just as everything goes to perfection, Ted's wife returns to the city and wants her son's exclusive right. Ted then goes on a mission not to let his son take him out and fight with his wife in court. Dustin Hoffman, together with Meryl Streep, gives an excellent result and the young Justin Henry is impressive. It's a sad emotional film roll, but it's a very well made and inspiring film. The film took the Oscar's Best Picture of the 1979 Academy Awards, along with Hoffman's best actor and Streep's best supporters. If you don't mind tears, Kramer vs Kramer is a great movie to watch. Rating: B +
