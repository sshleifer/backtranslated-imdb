Like a complicated road, "Tough Luck" leads the rider. There is nothing wrong with plot curves if credibility doesn't let the window out. Eventually, the film sets out the tolerance of public opinion. However, this mistake is easy to forgive thanks to excellent action, character formation and a great carnival. Don't wait for any symbols. Armand Asante, Norman Redus and Dagmara Dominczyk play shady artists, not just the type of person who was admired. Double crosses come quickly and furiously, and the last cross is slightly stretched. Recommended. - MERK
