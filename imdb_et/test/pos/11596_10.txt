Much more eloquent comments than it has described the remarkable performance, casting and shaping of this film. The only negative reviews seem to focus on perceived imbalances in dealing with the main moral issue of the film (euthanasia). <br /> <br /> This film is a barrier to recent scenes, emphasizing Ramon's belief that he is not some big point, but just that he has no human dignity for life that is not necessary to live. We, the audience, see tremendous dignity in our lives - we see the family, friends and culture, and, because of its physical limitations, life lives completely. At the heart of the tragedy of this film is that there is only one person who thinks that Ramon's life is not worth living - and that is his. <br /> <br /> To watch this movie and say the only counter-attack on the worshiping priest's visit is meaningless. The priest's visit is a pure farce, a direct attack on the opposition of the Spanish Catholic Church to the issue of euthanasia. However, the sister's leaving words to the priest for a moment reveal powerful "lifestyle" feelings that quietly support the entire film. We are constantly encouraged to see the hope and beauty of a life of love. As the film progresses, we may gradually be encouraged to understand Ramon's thinking, but we have never agreed with our decision. <br /> <br /> I don't remember a movie that brought me so much and provoked me.
