Clive Barker has written Hellraiser's fame and created a fantastic horror film that is funny and exciting. <br /> <br /> The make-up made by Bob Keen and Geoffrey Portas was fantastic. To create the mutants that lived underground, it took quite a bit of imagination. It was really a cure to see the quality of work. <br /> <br /> It wasn't terrible, because the worst creature was actually the killer of human sera. <br /> <br /> I just saw Craig Undoubtedly, on the second day, she hides her doubts and did a good job in this movie. Nothing is remarkable but fair. It was only Anne Bobby's third film and she was also good. <br /> <br /> The end was remarkable and rednecks just got their desserts like David Cronenberg. Ha!
