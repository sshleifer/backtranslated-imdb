The main attraction of Anywhere, but here is Natalie Portman's great results. He gave him a much appreciated emotional depth for his rather ungrateful character. The subtle actor Susan Sarandon is sincerely sincere as the mother's figure. I thought the chemistry of the two stars was plausible, chemistry that could have been more involved with the more inclusive script. I'm not saying that the script was in some way bad, I just say that it seemed to be underdeveloped from time to time. I don't think it was a script writer error. The film did not suffer too long and sometimes became unreasonable in longer scenes. The film looks beautiful, with good direction and great performances. All in all, it is observable, but perhaps more for the older audience. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
