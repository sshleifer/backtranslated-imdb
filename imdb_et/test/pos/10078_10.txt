It's strange how the least known movies sometimes get the best you see. This movie has all the elements of a standard modern thriller, weapons, techno, baddies, cash, etc., but it is still different from your average Hollywood. I would credit it to two very charismatic people. Christopher Walken has a lot of confidence and Lorraine Bracco is one of the warmest and sexiest women I've ever seen on the screen. Another big reason why this film looks like is coz, which begins after Jamaica begins. The Jamaica resort is so beautiful that you would like to be running by the pool with Run'n'Kok at night. . . . I know I did. I'm very happy to see this movie - it was just nice to leave!
