The classic version of the classic Lewis Carroll story is much better than you think. Here Alice is a virgin librarian who falls under the rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her self-image. Produced at a time when adult films were a creative endeavor, but not just a sexual scene, it is a good looking, small film that resembles the day's low budget movies. Regardless of what you think, this movie has a good script with funny jokes and good songs. This is a naughty story for adults. If you don't know if my suggestion is good or don't think the movie was pretty much available in this non-hardcore version for the better part of the last three decades, just because the movie is out of sex, So I saw the movie for the first time a year ago on cable TV. The relatively recent DVD video release put the sex back in a terrible way into the clips that were inserted into the blades, making it clear that removing the frames was the best choice. If you are an open minded adult with something delicious, I can recommend this little movie from the heart.
