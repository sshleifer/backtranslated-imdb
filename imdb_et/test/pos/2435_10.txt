This amusing, sometimes outrageous look at the 1940s and 1950s Hollywood detective genre Robert Sacci, as an unnamed former policeman who retires, uses his life for savings to pay for plastic surgery to transform his image into his idol, Humphrey Bogart. creates a shop under private name "Sam Marlowe". Robert Sacchi, by the way, is one of the rare few Bogart impersonators who got the right right; more until the body and face are available. For a while, "Sam" is the only customer of his homeowner who wants to find his undersized boy, and his only discussion foil is his secretary, just "Hollandess" (Misty Rowe), who, in his words "looked" like Marilyn Monroe and made the same a lot of sense like Gracie Allen ‚Äùand is a passion for banana cracking. Then he meets Elsa (Olivia Hussey), a regular, sweet, virgin daughter of pensioners who has been murdered without reason. In the process of investigating the murder, Sam briefly passes: Gene Tierney's daughter (Michelle Phillips) from Anastas, terrible, stupid Greek rich sailor (Victor Buono, with a trusted Sidney Greenstreet), her unhappy, long-suffering woman (Yvonne deCarlo, who can play various emotions without saying a word), his two smarmy henchmen (Herbert Lom, directing Peter Lorre and Jay Robinson, reasonably accurate Lionel Atwill) and Anastas "cruel, immoral Middle East potent (Franco Nero) who is with glamor and an amazingly loyal lover (Sybil Danning), who would all give something to acquire two excellent, perfectly marked star sapphires. When Elsa is murdered, Marlowe's interest in solving the case becomes personal and she carries the Los Angeles landmark labyrinth, including the Hollywood Bowl, the Hollywood boulevard sculptural and esoteric attractions, and the Santa Catalina Island rocks, who decided to get them rich before each. Throw Mike Mazurk and many others, a traditional stupid but sympathetic ally to police forces, and a number of nicely-drawn character revolutions that give practically all players a dimension and despite an accidental title song, you have a very enjoyable movie experience.
