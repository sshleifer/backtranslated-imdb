Of course I'm a little biased, but by that time it was the most accurate Marines ever shown on the big screen. <br /> <br /> I was in Camp Pendleton, who attended infantry training, when Webb led his team to film some outdoor conditions and our company was asked to participate. It took about two or three days as much as I remember. <br /> <br /> Webb and Don Dubbins were serious and similar. <br /> <br /> While shooting a short scene that seemed to take forever 18 years - Webb was very conscientious about the merits of things (Marine affairs) and did a good job with one exception - the scene where the recruiter was wearing sunglasses. It never happens for several reasons. <br /> <br /> I have a movie video and it suffered my grandparents anytime I can sit them for a few seconds when I show them my priest when he was a young stud and part of the world's greatest fighting force (no courage, just a fact. <br /> <br /> What surprised me was how well the real Navy did their job. It was before I realized that the DI must have some functioning genes for its activity. <br /> <br /> The only movie I've seen since it's equal to DI is the first half of Full Metal Jacket, and it's only better because of the unpleasant language. When DI was done, the church was not allowed on the screen. <br /> <br /> Despite the lack of robbery, it is still a big movie to rent. <br /> <br /> Ooooo-rahhhhhh !!!!! <br /> <br /> Semper Fi, Do or Die
