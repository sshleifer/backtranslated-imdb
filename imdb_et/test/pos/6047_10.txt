Interpretation is not required by the portrayal of Jack Webb, a sea drilling instructor, who is designing new recruiters for basic training. Straight, straight, the front panel is all about this classic. At a time when our leaders' statements are parsed, it is necessary to understand what they say, a film that does not play our language or moral fiber. The right and wrong is clear and easy to define. If you like a clear, well-understood dialogue in a disciplined military environment, this movie should suit you.
