This is not a "real" James Cagney vehicle because its screen time is unusually thin. Frankie Darro plays the hard boy Jimmy Smith, who is the leader of the street tangs, who is sent to the reform school with some of his friends on the bench. Cagney plays Patsy Gargani, a gang leader who is given a symbolic position as Commissioner-designate. If he finds the first hand of brutal treatment in the reform school suppressed, he is obliged to make great changes with the help of the reforming nurse (Madge Evans). HELL MAYOR is fast paced and still fun after all these years. The cast is well rounded: Dudley Digges, Arthur Bryon, Farina Hoskins, G. Pat Collins and Allen Jenkins.
