I was just happy to find this movie. I've been using Walmart $ 5.50 DVDs because I watch a lot of movies (and rarely watch TV). I graduated from high school in 1968 - so I have a family and many friends who served in Vietnam. This movie really illustrates the pain I have seen with my friends with what happened to them there. I want more people to see this movie - I think maybe more people could understand what happened to our Vietnamese veterinarians by looking at these great actors in depicting a family damaged by a war. The story seemed realistic - it was not a mushy but made me feel what they were going through. I think it helped Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez play father and son - it made their relationship more credible,
