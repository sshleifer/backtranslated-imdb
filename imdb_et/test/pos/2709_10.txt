For the first time in 1994, I saw this film in high school when it was during my lifetime, when it was a lifetime. When I first saw it, I thought it was great. Of course, it may not be longer, but it's as accurate as I think (no matter what someone else thinks). Cynthia Gibb was great with Karen and Mitchell Anderson was Richard. Louise Fletcher (yes, who played in 1975 "Dirty Over One Cuckoo") was good too, but I found her version of Agnes (Karen and Richard's mother) a little control. I'm a huge fan of carpenters, and I believe Karen's voice was and still is so wonderful. It really seems to me sad that he's gone and has left the country too early, but thanks to his music and his angel's voice, which is endless, the music is going on. Anyway, back to this movie, there is really a mystery for me and any other people (Carpenters fans and non-fans) about what caused Karen to get this problem with his health. Was it the media who was responsible or was it just Karen's decision? I don't think it was his decision. It could have been one of the media articles printed on him somewhere in the '70s when their hit "Near" came out of what was shown in the film. There are other moments in the film. Richard Fighting Drugs and Karen's Short Marriage. I didn't hear my loss in February 1983 because I was not yet watching the news; I had learned years later. I don't know if there's going to be another movie about wood or Karen in the future, but so far this movie is doing well. However, I say this: if Karen did not take into account the false information of this article or any future articles that might have been published with similar content, calling her "obese" (which must be quite offensive), she would still be here today. I know she is in heaven and probably entertained with her beautiful voice. God bless you, Karen!
