Few people understand it, but in the ancient world, the world literature was on the scene before the Greeks arrived. In addition to the literary remains of the Jewish "Old Testament", the work of Mesopotamia and Egypt was remarkable. The first summit was religious poetry and "Gilgamesh epic". The Egyptians did a lot of poems, but the main addition was the adventure "Sinuhe story" by the migrant and the doctor. It was this work (a fragment that we don't know) that finished the novel "Egypt". <br /> <br /> The story is unique (just like the movie). "Egypt" was the best seller in the early 1950s and Darryl Zanuck decided to do it: yes he wanted to show his girlfriend Bella Darv as Nefer, as well as the rest (Victor Mature, Edmund Purdom, Peter Ustinov, Michael Wilding and Gene Tierney), but he knew that these films rarely made a big box. It can be encrypted, for example, by Zanuck, who is trying something else. <br /> <br /> The number of anti-Egyptian films is very small. "The Land of Pharoahs", "Egypt", "The Ten Commandments" (Both De Mille Versions), "The Moses", "The Holy Moses!", "The Cleopatra", "The Mummy" (All Versions), "The Scorpion King" When there are 20 movies about ancient Egypt, it is huge, but "Egyptian" is unique, while the second "Ten Commandments" speaks of the Great of Rams (Pharoah Ramses II - Yul Brynner) and his father Seti I (Cedric Hardwicke) and Cleopatra the films deal with him, but a few other ancient Egyptian names come to the movie. The biggest Pharoah of Egypt was Thutmos III, who captured most of the 1470s or so. No film about him or his predecessor of history, the first great female ruler of history, Hatschepsut. known spiritual revolution that tried to reach what the Jews (and later Christians) tried - the type of monotheism - is the "Egyptian" theme. This is Pharoah Akhnaton. <br /> <br /> Actually, Akhnaton acted in the form of personal monotheism that was not for public consumption ee angered the priestly class who worshiped Ammon, not Aton. Due to our uncertain historical data (although Akhnaton's official documents - "Tel-el-Amana" letters are quite complete in their survival), we do not know whether Pharaoh was killed at the palace coup or not. But he died, followed by his young brother or son, whose name is better remembered than any other Faroah except Ramses: Tutankhamun. <br /> <br /> This movie is really good when it goes. Wilding makes a benevolent Akhnaton who is too weak to be as effective as a religious reformer. Mature is good as ambitious (and outside the movie - ultimately successful Pharoah) Horemheb. Tierney and Purdom are doing their lead well and Ustinov is Purdom's friend. The good support of Mrs Darvi is also good. The amazing fireplace has John Carridine as a philosophical tomb. The film is definitely worth watching because it is one of the few attempts to show some of the history and culture of ancient Egypt.
