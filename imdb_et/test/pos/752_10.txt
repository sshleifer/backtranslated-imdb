It's a fun and funny movie. Very interesting in all corners. It has an extreme number of memorable, psychotic, but lovable nuts. Got; judge, Sargent, boy, creepy old woman, slut, clown. And unfortunately, they all live in a large house with no locks and too few. So for our joy, we see how to ride them, play games and be dangerous. We also learn a lesson ... never give your patient an ax! <br /> <br /> It was before Cukkos nest and crosses it. At least fun. He even has his sweet moments. "Love is pure. Love is love. Love is strong. You love me, your love is pure, you always love me." Now who could resist it? Nuts are also people. Just a few loose wires. Be a little cautious or you'll get an ax back! Children are playing. Hehe. <br /> <br /> The man who repaired the phone was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were really genuine. All the characters in this movie are very well played. And I found them funny. No, HILARIOUS! They may even give you dirty thoughts on how to use them. Or how they will get you. <br /> <br /> This is actually a very smart movie. There's a brilliant twist to the end. I have to say that I thought it was good but never expected it. It's terrible. "The court has made its decision. You are no longer in control!" I love it. The end is so perfect ... you shot a tear. <br /> <br /> I am so glad to see such a movie. I will never forget it. It's not just a cult ... it's a cult classic. Whatever you do ... Don't look in the basement !!!
