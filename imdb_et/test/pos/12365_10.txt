The classic film, where the cult status is Karkarlen (1921), director Victor Sjöstrøm, who also plays the main role of men, is based on the story of Swedish writer Selma Lagerlöf. The film brutally talks about drinking Dr Holm, who wins his wife, ignores his children, seduces his brother for drinking, and is in the dark for sister Edit (Astrid Holm) love. At the end of the year, David sits in a city park with his proud friends and talks about the Phantom Prison (Körkarlen): who dies at the New Year's Eve as the last before dawn, must serve one year as the leader of death and release the dead souls from their bodies. But David gets in the way of his friends, bleeding and dead on the ground. In the meantime, Phantom is approaching the shipment. The driver is no other than David's late friend Georges, who died before he died and died a year earlier. Since David refuses to pull, Georges forces him to. Together they travel to stations where people live, who suffered David. They visit the nurse Edit, whose love for David she could not recognize and with whom she was infected with tuberculosis, so she dies now. But his unconditional love for David saves his soul. David's wife and children filled her spirit. David can prevent his wife from killing herself and her children because she does not see a way out of the misery that David has thrown at her. They also visit David's brother, who has murdered after David's drinking. David asks Georges to go back to his body because he finally sees his way was wrong. Since it was Georges who had once been drinking him, David wanted to have a second chance, and Georges must have another year as Chief of Phantom to pay for his own sins. This film probably belongs to the strongest and most impressive films. Unfortunately, it is still not available on the international DVD.
