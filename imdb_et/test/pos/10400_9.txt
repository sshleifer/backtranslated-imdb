Like many horrors of the horror who sought the fasting of the next great intimidation, we plundered everything we could get to the Asian horror market, leaving no dark hairless worship. We had a good reason to do so, the Asian market had created such terrible wonders as Ring, Dark Waters, Juon - Harsh and Two Sisters. By the time Takashi Miike started ripping a genre with one mouse game in 2003, it seemed that the market was dry, leaving it open to mocking and hacking, despite the continued work of a Hollywood remake machine. Now, don't get me wrong, there were still many good Asian horrors, Marebito and Shutter-like, but two, then a few days into a smaller genre. But the ghost of the hair was definitely on the party of his party, and it was time to take this success into the drunk tramp bed! Then comes a movie like Noroi - a curse. A film that is smart enough to pay its roots a subtle respect, but throws it out of the window while doing it. What I describe as a plot of land will probably make you think there's nothing new here. The film is a documentary of one of Japan's best paranormal researchers, receiving stories and clues about ghostly events. She begins to investigate the woman's statements that she regularly hears a neighbor who is crying in a neighboring house, but there is no child except for the middle-aged woman and her son. These two disappear sharply when the reporter pins around his nose, but strange other coincidences begin to open. A psychological young girl, a spiritual sick seer, a pretty young actress with a strange vision, a lot of dead doves and a very bad demon under the name of Kagutaba, which led to a truly frightening showdown in a small historic town. . <br /> <br /> More on the plot, it can be a little fun. The film is filmed in a "faux documentary" and includes film footage from TV shows and news programs, and subtitle labels allow you to know where you are on the timeline. In the film, more than a couple of comparisons have been made in Blair's witchcraft project, but after the creepy journey and the horrible night of the night, the comparison ends in reality. <br /> <br /> What is refreshing Noroi is how it does not fit the audience of modern horror. If you expect ghostly ghosts to pull out of the attic, look elsewhere. The strength of the film is that it is a slow, gradual terrorist attack, terror so deep that it will stay with you a few days after that. The climax is pretty funny, but just when you think the movie is over, the "real" end is treated when the credit starts to roll and the sweet holy f * ck is the killer. From the operational point of view, it is mostly convincing. You get some "comedy" exemptions from madness, tin foil covered psychic, but it dries quickly towards the movie. The film also has a slightly nastieric sense of how much Asian ghost fear, because there is a violent line to some event. <br /> <br /> Generally, Noroi is the one who watches himself late in the evening. Not after the first look at Ring ten years ago, I was so overwhelmed by watching the horror film. That's what itchs you until it's too late, it's under the skin. Just let yourself go into it completely. And not a visually impaired ghost patient? No wonder it is hardly out of Japan, not to mention that the American remake was still lined up. Check it out when you get a great view of my books!
