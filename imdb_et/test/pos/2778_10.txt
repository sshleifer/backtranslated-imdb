this is the best movie I've ever seen, and I love it very much so sad and loving so I can watch this movie over and over again. when I first saw it on the Disney channel, I was like watching this movie again. I love to watch this movie every day and wish it to anyone. this is a really good movie. for anyone who hasn't seen this movie and thinks about it, they go better and see it because it's really good. I love that part when the boy got to know the girl and since then I was just that movie. if i could watch two movies every day, this one and loved my two favorite movies i really love
