I slowly roll out as many Hong Kong movies as I can get my hands and came to this gem - mostly thanks to Ching Wan Lau, one of my favorite actresses. <br /> <br /> This is a great action film, although it is not OTT as the title can say. It moves very fast and is really enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise in this movie was the soundtrack. It seems that Rob Dougan, the man who made The Matrix's popular "Clubbed To Death" song, has picked up Big Bullet's soundtrack and compiled it in one of his "Furious Angels" album tracks; this name is called "Im no longer driving" and is also the opening of the "Law and Order" and "Matrix Reloaded" DVD menu. It surprised me very much thanks to a random hit!
