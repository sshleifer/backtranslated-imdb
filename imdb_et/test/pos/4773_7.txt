But that's also Minnie and Pete too! Yes, the terrible captain may not be Pete, but it is! Mickey and Minnie are the best characters, both very sweet and enjoyable. Interestingly, Minnie is, in this sense, a lady rather than what she usually is and Mickey is less attentive than it is now. Pete is still the same old, but she looks a little different. <br /> <br /> In this famous episode, the little steamer Mickey, Minnie, and some side signs are a lot of fun and a lot of annoyance. Even at their first performances, the three main characters are very advanced. <br /> <br /> I like this episode, although I generally prefer Mickey Mouse. I like animation, steamboat and music theme, smart gags - and of course Mickey and Minnie! <br /> <br /> Like many previous cartoons, it is very casual. There is also the character of the parrot's side, which is very annoying and quite unnecessary. I don't like these things. Another interesting thing about this episode is that there is no color version of it (or, if it exists, I've never heard of it)! <br /> <br /> Anyone who just enjoys Mickey Mouse and Disney enjoys it.
