One of my favorite Hartley movies. (As if it was a "bad" one.) Although it may be a bit more of a religious affair than we usually expect. Still, he claims that Hartley is inclined to which we are all accustomed. <br /> <br /> First picture of Jesus and Satan discussing their ideas, opinions, hopes, and regrets the impending end of civilization. Imagine the whole conversation that takes place with some drinks in your neighborhood. And as an added conversation (not to mention visual) disruption, let PJ Harvey be a companion (aka Magdelena) to Mr. Chist. Then, just as you smile, in the background, the band of the current Salvation Army (played by Yo La Tengo), to be added aside. The path of moral justification has never been so happy. <br /> <br /> Quite likely, there are more questions than answers, but it's fun. And Mr. Donovan has a weak shine, as always.
