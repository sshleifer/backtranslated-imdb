Joan Cusack steals the show! The assumption is good, plot plot interesting and scenario was OK. Too simplistic is that the story of a gay man was as positive as it is usually not so positive. And again, it's fiction. :) All in all, there is a fun romp. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed was the "inside joke" aspect. Because the target group was probably straight, they may not get ghosts in the story context. <br /> <br /> Kevin Kline showed a facet of his ability to act, which the scriptwriters sometimes ignore when pointing to Kline. <br /> <br /> It hit the mark.
