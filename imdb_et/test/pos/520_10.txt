Linda Blair has been in business for forty years, and although she never gets to Regan MacNey's "Exorcist", few of her subsequent horror films have used their legendary status to such a great effect as "Witchery". She plays pregnant woman Jane Brooks, who travels with her family to an abandoned island hotel her parents want to buy. They are accompanied by a couple of real estate agents (Catherine Hickland and Rick Farnsworth) and when they arrive on the island, they meet a photographer (David Hasselhoff) and his writer girlfriend (Leslie Cumming) who is legendary at the hotel. local witch (Hildegard Knef). It seemed that the long-awaited witchcraft had resulted in her suicide, and she was with the child at that time. Without knowing the danger, Jane has recently dreamed of a witch from dramatic death, and Jane's little brother Tommy (Michael Manchester) has been directly visited by her spooky, black-clad spirit, which she calls a "black woman." The group's time at the inn's inn starts quietly; unknown to them, but black black has already sent his hired boat captain (George Stevens). Before long, isolation and freezing will affect everyone, and it is in this period of mood and tension that the black pattern begins its terror treatment. He intends to get his fate with Jane and sacrifice his companions and unborn child. All of his other victims fulfill his vengeance - the blood of greed, lust and virgin. When the sun goes down and the sea becomes wild, he haunts them one by one in harsh and terrible ways. The location of the island is actually scary and the inn is very horrible and haunted. This is such a colorful film that reminds me of Dario Argento's work. The lighting is great and the set decoration is terrible. The soundtrack is very effective and unique. The fear is extreme, terrible and unforgettable. Cinematography is great and it brings us back to Linda Blair. The creative team of this movie captures him as a horror star should be captured: a lot of dramatic push-ins, constant close-ups that accurately detail Jane's incremental possession, and moments that resemble other great horror movies. "Rosemary Baby", "Jacob's Ladder", "The Shining", "Black Sunday", and of course "The Exorcist" are hidden tributes. She does a great job and steals the show with her moody and undervalued performance. This does not mean that the rest will disappear; Catherine Hickland is sexy and very good, and veteran performer Annie Ross is a memorable Jane female rose. Hasselhoff gives her the best, but she is not essentially a movie star and her television personality gets her presentation. Blair and young Michael Manchester have wonderful chemistry. The film is otherwise so violent and horrible (a good chance) that it needs their warmth (Blair also played with her mother in Monster Makers in 2003) and her mother-scenes on this film have the same delicate feel for them. Finally, Hildegard Knef (with his last role) plays a great witch and has the most amazing voice and accent. Together with Blair, he was completely cast. But this is Blair's movie all the time. Jane Brooks also seems to have some psychic ability, and this aspect of the film listens back to "Exorcist II: Hereetik". I think "Witchery" is "The Exorcist", "Exorcist II", "Hell Night" and "Summer of Fear", as Blair's best genre has been working so far.
