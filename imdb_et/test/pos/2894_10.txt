I have been a "big" speed hunter since "moving images" and this concert is just and an example for everyone who is a fan of why Rush is so popular. They fully recognized their greatest concert play and despite the rain on the football arena, they can still produce outstanding results from the start to the end. A real example of this is the "yyz" time the whole crowd will sing along with it in a truly classic way, perfectly sinc. They really play all of the favorite songs of everybody with a real powerful "lust" that rarely happens. One of the best concerts will be given to the best place in the house. The second DVD is an exciting documentary of the band when they are in Brazil and show you a lot of progress that allows them to see not only musicians but real people in their daily lives. This DVD gift set must be for every young and old Rush fan and is definitely your DVD collection holder. They even have a concert cd for those who just want to listen to music. This DVD is worth it!
