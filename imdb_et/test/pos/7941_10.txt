When I first saw this movie for the first time about six months ago, I found it interesting, but a little less. But it stuck with me. This interest grew and grew, and I wondered if my initial boredom and response were of actual VHS quality rather than the film itself. I bought a Criterion in a DVD box and found it was the second time I was right. Alexander Nevsky is a great movie. It is rushing and I am sure it succeeded in its main purpose: propaganda against the Germans. <br /> <br /> This is the most common criticism of this movie and Eisenstein that it is just propagandist and nothing else. It is wrong. He is an amazing filmmaker, one of the most important people who lived. By now, the world is far enough from Joseph Stalin's distance to see Eisenstein's films as art.
