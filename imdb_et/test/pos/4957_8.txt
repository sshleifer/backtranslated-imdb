I think this movie is actually entertaining, even though this film has no essential qualities. First of all, when Doug and Chappy start their mission, they take on the F-16B and the fighting scenes pilot the F-16A. Another thing I do not like about this movie is the constantly repeating F-16, which moves to its right to escape the rockets ... why are the flakes and incandescent colors not yet shown? Thirdly, if you see that F-16 is almost empty of ammonium, there will be many rockets again ... the models used to simulate destroyed aircraft are not good either. However, I think that using IAI Kfir as an opponent's plane was really good, much better than F-5, which is shown in Top Gunis (but this movie is not as good as this masterpiece). <br /> <br /> A funny movie, I love planes and I've seen it more than 3 times.
