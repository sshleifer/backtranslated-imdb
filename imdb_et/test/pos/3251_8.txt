I am afraid I do not agree with Mr Radcliffe, because although he has rightly said that this is not comedy, he has many other advantages. The plot is partly crazy, but I believe it all fits nicely, creating a satisfying and enjoyable movie. The last scene was quite insecure compared to the rest of the movie, but the actual ending of some scenes in the past is very interesting, showing just what someone is doing in stressful circumstances. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to fans of thrillers and movies, but if you are a fan of the gangster movie, as long as you don't expect something as deep as Goodfellas, you should still enjoy it.
