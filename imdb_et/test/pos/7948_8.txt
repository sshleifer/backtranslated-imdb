SPOILER ALERT - AND I really mean it! READ MORE WHEN IS MANUFACTURED HIGHLY PLOTED! <br /> <br /> Okay, first I have to say that I have a relatively high tolerance for pushing movies. I watch and appreciate movies about real terror threats (such as war and holocaust), or when death and sadness are important for the plot, but I hate movies like STEAL MAGNOLIAS and ENDEARMENT, where the film is built around the main character of the manipulative death. So, no matter how well this film is made, it is against MAJOR's hit because one of the main characters dies as a result of the disease (although they never say what it was in English subtitles). <Br /> <br /> So you can ask yourself, "if this blow-hard hatred of this type of movie, why did he watch it for the first time?" You would have a great question to ask, even though I hope I'm not really shockproof! Well, when I found it in our local library, I had no idea what it was !!! The film was not designed specifically for export because the subtitles were in Korean, English and Japanese, and the box was printed in Korean. Well, being a fan of every nation's movies (I have probably seen movies from at least 30 to 40 different countries), I tried to try it out. <br /> <br /> Well, after mandatory death, I loved the movie and hated it as it ended. Although I usually hate a Hollywood type of miraculous ending, I wanted to see that the boy was rescued by some new medication or experimental surgery. I was really struck that he had to die - especially since he seemed like one of the most beautiful people I've seen in films for a long time. Her smile was contagious and I really wanted her to finally get her. Well, at least I appreciate the film's message you have to hold on to the moment. Great functioning, music, etc., but not just the most satisfied end to me. This movie was good enough to encourage me to try Korean cinema more.
