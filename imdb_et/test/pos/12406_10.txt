The effectiveness of this image has been best demonstrated by the target group, namely teenagers. My 14-year-old son made this film so appealing that I appreciate it much higher than his imitator "Mad City". It caused debate in our household on issues such as mutual pressure and loyalty vs. doing the right things. I appreciate this movie 10! Parents should follow it with their teens and discuss it later. <br /> <br /> I liked very intelligent dialogue and consistent action. I thought James Remar was enough in his role, but the teens really shot this picture. Other IMDB users have praised Corey Feldman's performance, which is truly inspired. All in all, I give this image my highest recommendation. Go here!
