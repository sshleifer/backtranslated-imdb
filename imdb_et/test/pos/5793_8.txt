Little Vera was weird for me. All in all, I enjoyed this movie, but the way the characters behaved was not what I used to be. For example, the environment that Vera's family lived was very tense. Almost every time the family was together, they were either drinking, fighting or shouting, and often it was a combination of the three. After watching the film, I felt tense because of all the confrontations that occurred during that time. However, I was very interested in seeing this story as a middle-class Russian family. Throughout the film, we are reminded of Russia's industrialized country, as the screen recurs through repeated images of the train. It gave the viewer a sense of mechanically lived life. The characters seemed to be focused on living their life after work and drinking. There was no sense of happiness in the whole film. The only time a character didn't shout was when Vera loved her fianc√©e Sergei for the first time. It was very short, because the viewer later discovered (after Sergei locked in Vera's father's bathroom and Vera puts it out, after which his father continues Sergei) that he is abusive. The second time Vera says that the only reason she was born was the family getting a bigger apartment. It is very interesting to see how both Vera and the family were able to deal with each other's behavior. The film was definitely worth it because it depicted how life could be in Russian regions.
