It was really one of the most pleasant special offers I saw on television. He's just an incredible performer. His personality shines through every song he does. I really want it to be available as an uncut DVD so I can watch it over and over again without speaking. I haven't had the chance to see her, but I want to do it. I will not forget his backups. They brought a lot of content and humor for the show. With their style and amazing dance movements, they really complement Dan's true talent. I want there to be a few more songs on his live CD, which is also incredible. It's refreshing to see someone who fills her. Just so incredibly friendly and real, I really can't say good enough about Dan and this show. Once again, I just want it to be available as an uncut DVD.
