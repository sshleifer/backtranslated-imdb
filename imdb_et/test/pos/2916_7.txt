I'll start right from the beginning, saying, "I like this movie." It's sweeping, it's great, it's thrilling and fun. Sinhue doctor, sitting in front of his small stone house, writing his memories. And what a story it is! He stays out of the river and is raised by an older couple who punished him for the poor. He communicates with Horemheb, who sees glory when Sinhue sees healing. And both run to the future Pharaoh to Anknathen (forgive my rights) who suffer from epilepsy. <br /> <br /> And Pharaoh has another mistake: he believes in one god instead of the goddess pantheon. Then it was completely revolutionary. Sinhue and Horemheb grow up. One night, Sinhue sees a woman who makes her lose her senses. He gives up his practice, sells his parents' home and even their tombs to spend the night with him. Is he? I will not tell. At the same time, Merit falls in love with Sinhue, a mermaid in the tavern who played with the sweet simplicity of Jean Simmons. He falls under his spell and belief in one god. <br /> <br /> Victor Mature excels at Horemheb. Edmond Purdom is sincere because Sinhue is a lost doctor (does he find salvation? Keep up with the voice). Even Belh Darvi, a woman who steals Sinhue's heart, is not as bad as everyone has said. The fact that he was Daryl F. Zanuck's lover was not related to pain - right? Yeah, right ... yet, he wasn't so bad that I was worse. I think he made "Egypt" better than many of today's young actors have done. I said it before and I say it again - I like this movie. I recommend it. This makes you think, despite some hammy behavior. Enjoy this movie; It's worth it.
