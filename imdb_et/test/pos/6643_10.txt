The woe is quite unique as a war film (or rather rather an anti-war film), as it focuses not only on soldiers and involved politics (no politics, but not on how you think it is shown), it deals with two main topics as the only two beings, who can be cared for at all in this brutal and degrading society. Ingmar Bergman, who is his main and two other very psychological films, Wolf Person and Hour, is much more interested in the impact of war on civilized beings, that it brings out the worst and is also a reminder of what is alive in a catarist way. very important. His two main players are frequent co-operation partners and friends Max von Sydow and Liv Ullman (like Rosenberg's strangers) who are musicians living on farms on the island (not too different from "Wolf" when he thinks.) <Br /> <br /> They see rolls of tanks and a few old friends who are already worn out, but they don't try to put it too much into the heart; there is a sweet scene where the couple just speaks, quite frankly, but with a heart (everything, as the movie repeats, to create a possibly provocative feeling) ... Then there comes a mistake, including a fake propaganda film made at the gunpoint with Rosenberg, a psychological confusion as a prisoner of war and Terror associated with a friend of a friend (one of Gunnar Bjornstrand's finest works with Bergman). Needless to say, this is not one of the easiest movies that Bergman can review with filmography, but in some cases it may be one of his most accessible works. His religious themes are very low this time, even if the idea of ​​keeping a kind of faith passes through the atmosphere of the film. When the war is busy, it happens in the usual fast ways (through the great Amigo Sven Nykvist). <br /> <br /> And the deconstruction of the relationship between Jan and Eva successfully matches the chaotic war background - a land where lines have never been too firmly drawn. In some ways, this film is even more important today, at the worst of Vietnamese times; I couldn't see the chilling, uncompromising coincidences of Iraqi and other, some Janite and Eva fighters or those responsible. By the way, the last scene is one of Bergman's best, everywhere (acting, leadership, lighting). It's not such a war image (or again anti-war, I think there is little John Wayne spirit in this Svensk production) that I would advise my bats to leave their friends all Saving Private Ryan - that's a little more related to glory roads, looking at the effects of the hypocrisy of war. But, as with any Bergman "genre" movie, it actually stands by itself, but it is the one that wraps the wall for the artistic crowd.
