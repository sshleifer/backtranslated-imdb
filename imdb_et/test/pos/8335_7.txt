Following the coup d'état of 1941, Max and Dave, Paramount Pictures Corporation removed Fleischer from his brothers. Former operations such as Seymour Kneith and Izzy Sparber, now called Paramount Famous Studios, were responsible for the new operation. At first, the Famous Finished Product was unnoticeable with Fleischer's recent production. The existing series (Popeye, Superman) continued as if something had changed. <br /> <br /> Today's Theme, JAPOTEURS is one of the earliest known studio SUPERMAN shorts. <br /> <br /> AS Normal, SUPERMAN cartoons were a great combination of fine, modern fashion. This applies to both (overture) and multiple multifunctional (random) music. Just when each short comedy had its own background music, everything was kept fresh by re-registering it with every picture. <br /> <br /> For JAPOTEURS, we must remember that it was filmed during the first year of engagement and characterization of the United States as a very stereotypical, short hand and direct evil. The hostile Japanese sabotage dialogue and personality was strictly a mark of the old pulp press animals, with every word spoken sarcastically, completely incredibly politely, because the characters surrendered their cold bloodiness because they made the most demonic threats and outrageous acts toward the random world. <br /> <br /> JAPOTEURS is visually bright and exhilarating, stunningly positioned and uses some multi-level or table plan animations to give your flying sequences a real depth. br /> <br /> PUBLICATION of the animated film, SUPERMAN Radio Show, heard by the mutual broadcasting network; The comic is similar to a comic strip and uses the very same talents of Bud Collyer and Joan Alexander. <br /> <br /> We value it with a ½ star. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
