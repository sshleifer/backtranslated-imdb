You have to like baseball, and you have to at least sort of like Tom Selleck, but if you meet these criteria, you should enjoy the movie. Selleck plays a former big bang who finds himself in Japan (?) When his career falls. Really well thought out and exciting to look at Japanese practices and behavior. Big supporting performances by Sellec's director ("Clint Eastwood of Japan"), his girlfriend Takanashi and his interpreter. The chemistry between Selleck and Takanash works very well, it's a really nice romantic film after baseball. Look for Haysbert to become a fellow citizen before he became the permanent shine of Allstate. The film comes out very well. Just my top fifty all-time movies and maybe my favorite baseball.
