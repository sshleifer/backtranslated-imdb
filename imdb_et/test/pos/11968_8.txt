When I went to see the documentary film on the Communist blockade, I waited for something completely demented, according to Communist rocks. Some scenes contributed, including the Soviet film "Tractor Drivers". <br /> <br /> You think that the task of the movers is to make ideologically correct musicals that sing, dance and advocate the party's line with insurmountable coefficients. And one more surprise in the East Side Story is that some of the films presented were really promising. One was from the mid-1950s East German effort called "My Wife Wants to Sing", in which, as the title suggests, an unhappy hausfrau attempts to launch a singing career over the objections of his traditionally minded man. Another really interesting movie, including from East Germany, was called "Midnight Revue". In this film-a-movie, the producers create a story of their creative situation among the group's filmmakers who are musical according to the party's orders. (Screen filmmakers can themselves make a musical number to avoid "too hot" themes that resemble those of the 1957 "Silk stockings" movie.) <br /> <br /> The documentary is somewhat inconvenient in the storyline, but it is still fun to watch. (Look for a final commitment to the person who did it all.)
