Travis (James Franco) is a young man traveling by train for commercial reasons (we assume) who leaves his beloved phone down. Prostitute, Terri (Rachel Miner), rises, and when she travels to her city, there will be many events that will definitely stay with her forever. <br /> <br /> Both of these characters have barriers they have put in place to protect them from communication. But despite their facades, it's obvious that both are eager to blow them. In total, there are about 30 or so-to-speak lines, but the way James Franco and Rachel Miner use their faces, you can also turn off the volume, no words are needed. The style you look at is Terri's look in the mirror. You can just feel your despair in the room. <br /> <br /> But the movie is not perfect. It has been filmed mainly with hand-held cameras, which is a bit annoying. Mainly thanks to Mr. Franco and Miner and the effect of photography, the scripts of the script do not differentiate so much. But sometimes the story doesn't really know where he wants to go. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a movie that will really stay with you long after you watch it. An hour after you see it, you're still "what-yourself" for certain characters. It is not flawless, but still leaves you with more than 4x so long.
