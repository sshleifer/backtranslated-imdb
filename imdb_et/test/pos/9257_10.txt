For anyone who liked this series, this movie is something to follow. But it also leaves you more. I loved that every character (detective) appeared. At least with the end of this fourth chair, because they leave the new movie behind. My guess is, of course, Bayless. This series was a very well assembled series of scenes. This is the series I wanted to live with. Thanks to some great TVs.
