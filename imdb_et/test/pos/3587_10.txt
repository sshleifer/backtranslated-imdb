The Blue Planet series is undoubtedly one of the biggest documentaries ever made in the ocean. For five years, the filmmakers worked tirelessly in the series, receiving footage that nobody has ever seen (i.e., The Deep.) <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch this series. Watching the fish outside the small pictures shown in the textbooks is really gentle, but only a needle on the big haystack of the blue planet. From the open ocean to the tidal pools, from the coral sea to the deepest darkest part of the ocean, the BBC takes the viewer almost magically through the ocean. I have to admit that one of my earliest dreams in life was a marine biologist, and after seeing this series, the dream was restored. For years I have studied the oceans of this world and have seen countless documentaries on coral reefs and dolphins, whales and crustaceans. But no one has ever been able to survive the life of both the wave and the group. <br /> <br /> Look at the blue planet series as a whole, I promise you will not regret it.
