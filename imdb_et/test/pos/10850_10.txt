I love this movie. I watched it over and over when I rented it from Netflix. It was a lot of content and meaning for me. I think many people enjoy it. I have read and seen quite a few lesbian stories over the years and I am happy that they get better and better about how they are presented. They tend to feel more positive about lifestyle and feel gay women.It is nice to see two women find themselves and be as happy than others in this society.I think it is obvious that more and more movies on this topic are grace for our theaters and television screens.Many manufacturers and directors are aware that lesbians live very full and healthy lives and that we have wonderful stories that both individuals if families should not hesitate to see.
