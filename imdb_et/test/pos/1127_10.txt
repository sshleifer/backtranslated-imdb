I love this example. I hate it going to the season finals because it seems forever until the season starts again! I've been following this example because her pilot then all went to where the rust starts college and see what Casey's sister is, where she gets to know Dana. I am also so glad that cappie and Casey finally came back, which made me crazy! As for Evan and Rebecca, I hope they get back together, which he just knows for the finale. I just looked at most of the majority and I'm so SHOCKED that Casey Cartwright (Spencer's Grammar) is the daughter of Kelsey's Grammar !!! this surprise so much and the second thing that is great about SHOCKER is that she was born in the same year as me and that she was born with my baby's baby on my birthday and I was watching her all the time and had no idea !!
