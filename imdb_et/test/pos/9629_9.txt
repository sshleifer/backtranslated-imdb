Patriot is a well-thought-out, well-produced film that draws the viewer straight and keeps them with them. In this case, it is not the same as Under Siege et al. Al., But it is definitely a brand that could be described as Seagale's second film era. Not so much Action movies that have a good story, but a good story that has been matched with a few points and injected with some of Seagall's inappropriate sequences of action. Is this a movie that hardcore action junkies enjoys? Probably not. But for us, who doesn't just like our activities, but also good stories, it's a big step forward for Seagal. It's almost like a change in Clint Eastwood when he tried to get out of his "Dirty Harry" series. Either man, if he had continued to sing in the singular, they would have played a definite role forever and secured his career in a short time.
