When you read Carl Hiasen's book, the film follows a lot of real form, some minor changes to Hollywood. In my opinion, this is a great family film. Luke Wilson (Officer Delinko) steals the show from a very perfect one, including Robert Wagner and Jimmy Buffet. The children of the film do a great job, led by Logan Lerman, Brie Larson and Cody Linley. Brie Larson is perhaps a bit too small to play Beatrice. I imagined Beatrice's role as a bigger girl, maybe 6 feet, 175 pounds. It could have believed him in the role of beating Dana. They should have developed their "tough girl" character more and bite through the tire or hit the football ball through the human. She is very beautiful, and I understand why she was cast, she is the attraction of the office. <br /> <br /> It's like PG as the movie gets these days, sex and little violence. This film is a stream of parents, a strong environmental message where children are deeply appreciated for the beauty of Florida and its wildlife. This shows how adults are cared for by our planet and that our children can demand better. One of my favorite lines in the film is when Mullet Fingers says, "Florida can use some mountains, like Montana. Florida photography also spoke without dialogue. It's a great movie as a family film with children aged 5-15 years! Bonus for parents' entertainment, especially when they are "parrotheads".
