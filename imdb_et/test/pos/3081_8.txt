Robin Hood; Tight men are worth a look, I looked at it recently because I've just become a fan of Cary Elwes and it's one of his leading roles. A few moments brought me so hard! I didn't expect them to know it was so funny, Even the second time you still fell, you missed your chair. Of course it is great, of course, especially Robin himself from Locksley, Cary, but Blinkin and Sheriff and Little John (Don't let the name fool, it's very big! Lol) and everyone else! <br /> <br /> Of course, there were a few moments, the movie tried to make a comedy scene, but you don't necessarily make a laugh ... but OK. <br /> <br /> This is the second time Cary Elwes and Patrick Stewart, who appeared in the movie together, both worked for "Lady Jane" in 1986, and it was fun to see them, 7 years later, parents, awwww. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth a look, a lot of fun!
