I love this movie. I just got a copy and saved it to watch my birthday. This film highlights a number of issues. One is. Who are the monsters of this world? The difference is just that. Different. Real monsters hide the rules behind the masks. They are the ones whom everyone sees as "a nice quiet blessing" who "didn't bother anyone". Or they are worse than what Croneberg plays. Men who draw joy and power from cutting people and creating their own books. I love shapeshifteres, people with gifts and those who may be scared to see people. This film touches and examines what is normal. Who are "others" and who are afraid. Although I gave this film 10, I am still sick women who scream or are so upright on their roads that they do not see what is going on and what is the means of destroying Median. My second complaint was why they never made another movie. I would have loved to see the most intriguing story that keeps me fascinated from start to finish
