Go go, you can't look away and you don't want to. "Haruhi Suzumiya Melancholy" (Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu) is one of the most interesting anime I've seen for a long time. If you can look away from the wrong and sometimes perverse humor, it is easy to find a perfectly built and masterfully done work. <br /> <br /> Part of the shine is due to the fact that the episodes are not in chronological form so that you do not understand some of the things they first talk about, but when the series progresses, you find yourself saying, "ah, so just they meant! " Although it may be confusing for some people, it is difficult to make a case of talking in this way after viewing the exhibition. <br /> <br /> After all, characters are in focus. The title, Haruhi Suzumiya, is by far the most eccentric heroine of any anime. His opening speech to his class, where he says he is "not interested in normal people" and is looking for "espers, aliens and travelers" is completely odd, but he is so loving. <br /> <br Then, Kyon, the "normal" man, pulls into the madness surrounding Suzumiya-san. He is a narrator and his quick spirit always makes the scene more fun. He finds himself caught in the middle of various factions, all of whom are trying to influence Haruhi Suzumiya, and the other three are representatives of these factions; ironically, they are the creatures that Haruhi is looking for, but they cannot express themselves. <br /> <br /> The first one is Yuki Nagato, a quiet girl who is the only member of the school's literary club and also a representative of the integration think tank; he is basically an alien, although his best description is a computer program of the human body. His purely emotional response makes him comic and always thinks more than an eye. Then there is Mikuru Asahina, the rider who happens to be incredibly cute, the big ditz and Suzumiya plans to advertise their club, the SOS Brigade, to the world. The end result is that Suzumiya is doing things around her with sexual harassment, making her a fetish dress. The final sign is Koizumi Itsuki, a fearful and persistently optimistic philosopher who happens to be Haruh's "esper", although he can only exercise his powers under certain conditions. <br /> <br /> The end result of all these stars is comedy, unlike others that are both raw and deep and always brilliant. Don't believe me? See the first episode, their "student movie". You see what I mean.
