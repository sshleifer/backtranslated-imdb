I think we all, no matter whether we are car fans, luv the Dodge Challenger sound when it goes down the road, noise 57 Chevy does when he screams with ecstasy when this tear around the corner and above all breaks sound like a classic vehicle flame when it explodes. I'm not the biggest car enthusiast with any imagination, but any of the above really rev my engine! The importance of transport to the cinema has not been denied. It has even been said that inventing a train was one of the greatest effects of early cinema (looking at the window almost like a moving picture and the idea of ​​transporting to another time / space). But the car remains the most popular and the most popular, it's even its genre: the car-class genre. A genre that focuses solely on the beauty of cars. In fact, it's just porn! Car porn! And I'm not talking about a rather nasty documentary about Channel 4, where men had sex with the car. Regardless of what your ... car swims, I guess. Moves on ... while RUNNING ON EMPTY is not as pornographic as VANISHING POINT (Richard C. Sarafian, 1971), where its close-ups are in a moving car, all that bumps and curves (!) the main focus of this film. In fact, cars get their own characters (more later on). They are objected and fetished as much as women, perhaps even more. And holy, are these cars something! All the cars in this movie (besides those in the background) are just beautiful? there is no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> As I said, these incredible cars are given some signs. You're really going to start to compassion! SPOILER? The most important thing about this scene is when the car is destroyed and the SPOILER is burned. It has become almost a convention for the genre of a car fleet; Fraud 1978 by Plymouth Fury CHRISTINE (John Carpenter, 1983), Satan's Custom Lincoln Mark III CAR (Elliot Silverstein, 1977), Small Italian Mini Coopers (Peter Collinson, 1969) for a Friendly Volkswagen Beetle LOVE BUG (Robert Stevenson, 1968) and, of course, every car from DEATH RACE 2000 (Paul Bartel, 1975) and even WACKY RACES (1968-1970), all of which had their own character. Ironically, however, this pressure on the car often goes beyond (!) Human characters! And this is certainly the case with RUNNING ON EMPTY, where only one person (a blind figure who drives his car with hearing, not seeing) has some dimension, the rest is in stock. These are all your stereotypical teens of the 1980s; big hair, annoying accents and none of them see in the neighbors, especially the appearance of Kylie Minouge. But who's fucking? It's all about car racing and crash! That's it! If you don't like it, you look at the wrong genre. <br /> <br /> Car scenes are definitely the point of sale for this movie and the best thing he did for it. They are fast; very fast! And we're not talking about the rather annoying technique that some movies use where they record the speed of the car about 40 km / h and then accelerate it. Oh no! Not with the movie you're not doing. Are these cars zooming in at real speed? there are no fancy tricks here. So we have speed. Check it out. What about accidents? Check, check! Though there are no cars that will fall ALL ONLY with incredible BLUES BROTHERS (John Landis, 1980), when cars are shot in this movie, they will definitely disappear! They seem to be using gunpowder or something similar to build cars with one small stroke and KABOOM who they are flaming. It reminded me of THRILLER: CRUEL PICTURE (Bo Arne Vibenius, 1974) in this sense. <br /> <br /> There are quite a few scenes between these fantastic scenes (especially the beginning and the end) that slow down everything and I don't think much can be added to the movie. Note: more explosive cars are needed! But here are a few exceptions, which are great scenes? SPOILER especially rape event. <br /> <br /> So it's all a man's movie! Boy's movie! Full of cars vrooming vrooming around the outback and a couple of tits thrown in a good measure too. I recommend this little movie to anyone, even if they are very cyclists (!)? this is a great movie that you can just turn off your brain, sit on your leather chair and put in full capacity! I'll give him 3.5 luvs 5 luvs? Bruuuuum! P.S ?? Amazon sells it just over £ 2? this is a real deal, although the DVD does not have any specific features.
