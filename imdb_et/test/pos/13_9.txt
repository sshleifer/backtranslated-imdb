I work in the cinema and every Thursday evening we have one film for the employee that will appear the next day ... Today it was The Guardian. I saw trailers and ads and never expected a lot of it and I didn't expect that movie in any way. Well it turns out that this movie was much more than I thought. This was, above all, a great story. Ashton Kutcher and Kevin Costner did an amazing job in this film. As a big fan of this 70's exhibition, I always found that Kutcher has thought of something other than Kelso, despite the great action he has taken in the Butterfly Effect, but after seeing this movie I think I could finally look at him seriously. United States Coast Guard Unofficial Heroes.
