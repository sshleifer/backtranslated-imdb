FOUR SOOON TRADE was Rainer Werner's Fassbinder's first shooting plan to receive the main stream. Only during his fifteen-year troubled career, he managed to create amazing work in film and theater, both as a performer and as a creative producer, actor and director. Although this film may not turn to many viewers, the film has a lot to offer. The story is quite simple. A person is excluded from his upper middle class family because of an emotional and economic problem and is unable to control his downward spiral. FOUR SOOON TRADE is made with the slave's dedication to an elegant detail and each set is very carefully designed and built. Each set object appears to be carefully arranged to create layers of emotional texture. Many religious paintings and icons decorate the walls of different spaces and seem to tell Hans about finding his desperate spiritual meaning or direction in his life. I was thinking a lot about how lighting and color were used to contrast and enhance drama. Many times during the film I froze the frame to admire the beauty of the composition of the picture. I filmed this movie and the print was almost flawless and secondly not. Fassbinder uses his actors almost cruelly in the "Anti-Natural" style, he does everything he can to prevent the participants from reacting in a normal or linguistic way, and it has quite a pleasant effect. "Hyperreality" to Narrative Instead of performing Mundan Melodrama, actors force the touch of almost military influences to look at the film differently, the Fassbuster film deliberately prevents the viewer from simply associating with the characters. It is an uncomfortable experience for many, but I found it to be a unique and satisfying artistic adventure.
