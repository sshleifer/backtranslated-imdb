I've seen the director's cut version and it can be something other than content. Great action (especially Cole Hauser, I was sad for a little space for Claudia Black), exquisite visual effects and photography in general, plausible plots (considering the genre) without much logical holes, really not foreseeable twists, building up to characters. These are the biggest assets of the film. Along with style, some of this movie can be considered a Class B effort, but I disagree with it. The whole thing is really very original and stylish. <br /> <br /> And even though I am not a Vin Diesel fan, this Riddick's heavy guy's role is well suited to him. Can't wait for Riddick's chronicle, it's really cool this flick has a sequel ... <br /> <br /> 9/10 when you ask me
