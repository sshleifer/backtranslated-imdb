One of Anthony Mann's most recent western peoples was also his only cavalry in the West (plus one short episode in Winchester '73), though of course he is focusing on strangers and internal conflicts rather than offering Fordian coat of arms celebration and shared ideals. Not in his beloved highland, but at the foot and in the woods, this is a more cynical view of the border of life, in many ways to his Apache, without the need to preserve the legend: this outpost consists of failures, failures, cowards, and a strange competent official ignored by his superiors, poorly managed, while civil war is a priority and all the best that the army has to offer. <br /> <br /> Victor Mature and James Whitmore are free traps who find civilization creeping into them when they get rid of their leather and parachuting horses with a local tribe attacked by their cavalry on their territory. Instead of blaming the Indians for their losses, they decide that it is a military fort for the construction of a fort and decides to demand compensation from them that combines their ranks as scouts. But despite Guy Madison's friendly and competent executive to bring the mature to the 19th century and wear a uniform, Robert Preston's lowly colonist deliberately arrived to revenge himself for the tribe who drove him out of his outpost? and Mature's clumsy surprise with Colonel's wife (Anne Bancroft, too big a blank slate here to do a lot with a woman who's tired of men who think they know what's best for her)? soon to lead things much darker. It is not a long time before some soldiers are planning to kill each other, both sides are trying to subordinate their actions to doing these things: little wonder that at one point the mature will break away by a scammer that he has long been calling. I'd be dead for that, but it's nothing but a dirty dirty blue rag! "His day, Stallone, Mature, was one of those actors who might have surprised you with the wonderful performance here and there, if it matched the right part and the right director. It's not one of his best days, despite having the most difficult part, perverted as a simple man, with good meaning, but for a drunk, violent, uneducated and unpleasant, almost childish lifestyle, the part intended for Burt Lancaster seems to have some striking resemblance to his character in Kentucky. , deciding to restore the career he destroyed during a catastrophic suicide civil war, launching another meaningless suicide campaign against a tribe who added a lowering of the second list, which keeps him away and promoted. much of your stigma his wife's compassion as well as the former comrades whom he considers to be inferior. He is farther away from salvation, but there is still a recognizable person and one is not completely integral? she admires Madison's courage to make a pointless attempt to get Preston's orders against their superiors? deadly inclined, though it is. <br /> <br /> Like his hero, the film is a bit harsh around the edges (and boasts one of the most surreal and foolish title songs), but it tends to make it more interesting and there is a lot of Manni's typically elegant camera that moves and plays perspective, while the border setting is convincingly harsh and primitive. Unfortunately, the shortcomings of the early CinemaScope lenses are very obvious on the Columbia DVD, which often has a dark image (2.55: 1 CinemaScope demanding enormous additional lighting and early application films showing a lot of trial errors) and grains.
