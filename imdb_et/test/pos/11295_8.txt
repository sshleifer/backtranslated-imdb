I was surfing through IMDb one day when I stumbled "Mr. Wonderbird's curious adventures". Noting how hidden it was, I decided to look for it. Thanks to Digiview, it didn't take me long, so I bought it for the dollar and when I got home I looked at it, although I have to say I was pretty impressed. <br /> <br /> Three king's apartment paintings, a shepherd dog, a chimney sweeper and a king's portrait (who is as selfish and sadistic as the real king himself) live one night as the king sleeps. The shepherd and the chimney sweeper are fleeing, the king's painting calls the police to catch the couple. Fortunately for Mr and Mrs Wonderbird, who often mock the police and the king. <br /> <br /> The back of the DVD disc describes this movie as "a surreal visual joy and an underestimated record of the history of classical animation." I couldn't agree to that, given that many of the backgrounds seem strange, and many characters are strange , which also includes the underground city and the hungry lion, soothed by the music of the blind, depressive citizens (who look like Andy Warhol), not to mention Mr Wonderbird, are somewhat eccentric. The film is very creative and mostly fun to watch and its only mistake is that it can be slow. In general, this movie was very good and it is recommended by you. <br /> <br /> Rating: B + (Awesome)
