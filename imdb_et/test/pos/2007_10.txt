Pain is just one of the best cinemas I've ever seen. Here are my reviews of the episodes published so far: <br /> <br /> The episode was even better than I expected, and I was expecting quite a bit of everything I heard about it. I am already very impressed. The father was horrible and played great. A little girl is so expressive, she uses her eyes to convey such emotion. The animation was great. The cinematic art was amazing, the angle of each camera captured the scene's feeling perfectly. The editing took place so well, each scene smoothly mixed into the next. Music hit emotions quite well and pulled you into the story. I can't just say how wonderful this episode was. This will definitely create more appetite for my appetite! Episode 2 was even better than the first! Everything I said about the first episode is carried out, only you see more of the character development. I can't wait until I finally see the episode 3 or the rest of the series for this question. Developing is an intriguing, characteristic feature of all the great Hollywood trap, but without any effort. So many words have been said so much. This series is something you have never seen and encountered to become a real success. <br /> <br /> This episode was FREAKING AWESOME! No other word describes it! WOW! All I have said about previous episodes is true, but better! I don't know how you manage to do something amazing and make it even better! Additional character development proves to be a completely characteristic work. Cinematic art is outstanding because it is always Emily's pain, fear, hatred and emotional skater. I can't wait to see this episode 4 ... or the rest of the series. You have really crossed over. <br /> <br /> As far as I've loved other episodes, Episode 4 is the best. I love the progress of nature. I feel like we are coming to Emily, her pain and her inner struggle. Other topics I have noted in previous reviews will continue. Great for cinematography, writing is great, actors have done their portraits correctly and have made their characters, and the animation is just amazing! Another great job from the DbP team!
