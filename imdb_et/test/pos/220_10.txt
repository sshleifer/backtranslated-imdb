After reading all these comments, I am very surprised that no one has ever even pointed out that this exhibition was based on the 1957 - 1960 NBC Police Show "M Squad", starring Lee Marvin, I read the comments with "Dragnet" and some of the Quinn Martin police shows, but when you look at the M group, you can see it based on it. In M Squad's end-of-1958 episodes, you see Lee Marvin, who plays Lieutenant Detective Frank Ballinger out of his car and then fires it, and he fires back, the start of the police team is basically the same (including Jazz music) and then Lee Marvin talks about what (Im Lieutenant Detective Frank Ballinger, M Squad, Special Police Department of Chicago) and Leslie Neilsen in the Police Unit (Im Detective Lieutenant Frank Drebin, Police Team, Special Department of Police Department) and so on, even Johnny shoeshine in M ​​Squad's episodes The man's character and M Squad's episode "More Deadly" is an episode of a police event entitled "The Broken Promise", which is the same story!
