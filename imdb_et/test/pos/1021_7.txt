A pleasantly enjoyable film that is very evident both in its era and especially in the specific stage associated with each boy's "rituals". But I have to say that having read very positive comments here, I was a little disappointed. The period was caught, but the plot was very thin. The whole thing comes up with the worst confusions in the school's game history. The idea that a quack quack is never chosen from just one of the three stars, but also from the filander, plays. And without it, nada. The sub-plots were not related to what I saw in the main land - they could all be removed completely without affecting the main story - which definitely refers to the fundamental error. If all your sub-plots look like cushioning, you know that the central idea is stretched beyond its boundaries. Nonetheless, this benevolent film, the heart of which is in the right place, has some subtle performances, and you just get the feeling that everyone involved felt the last one! This good feeling goes through the film. And it has to take something into consideration. The error is really a pretty good movie. 7 out of 10
