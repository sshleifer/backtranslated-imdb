It was the first kung fu movie I've ever seen. Duplication is not the biggest, but much better than some I had seen. The plot is much better than some made today. Sometimes it's nice, but it gives it a special boost. There is no Academy Awards. But if you want to see the struggles and the proper story, it's for you!
