I'm an importer of a decent superhero movie. (I don't read the superbug budget, I don't have any storyline) Are a few of my favorites The Phantom and the budget movie called The Demolition. Black Scorpion can be added to this collection. <br /> <br /> Once you've seen a demolitionist, you'll get this movie. This is basically a copy of this heroine. (He even denotes the same man in both films) <br /> <br /> If you haven't done that, let me explain ... the police father is murdered and he is looking for revenge. He captivates black clothes (sexy roof top, dirty equipment that looks great on Joan Severance) and goes out to capture some catch. does not want children to see it ... without first sifting it to see if you approve of a graphic sex scene. What I thought was a bonus (well, give him an extra star <grin>)
