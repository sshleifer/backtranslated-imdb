It's a good movie for Chucky fans. Okay, I'm sure it's not as good as what the child is playing, but it can be really funny and enjoyable, Chucky laughing is fun. <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS) <br /> <br /> Now, not one doll, but two, which means double effect, Jennifer Tilly really played this part and definitely pulled the best kills of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you've seen a child's feature films, it would be a worthy movie for your Chucky collection, but if you've never seen a child's feature films before, it's a new start. Of course, you have no idea how Chucky came to your current situation (because I'm not talking to you), but you understand why Chucky is very popular. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is a very enjoyable movie.
