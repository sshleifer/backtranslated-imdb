Wallace and Gromit are the main characters who are some of the best cartoons. A great combination of visual humor and claymation makes A Grand Day Out, Wrong Pants, and A Close Shave, one of the best animations ever on television. Winning several Oscars and countless other awards became quite popular with Nick Park in the US, but his influence on the United States has not been great. After the third Wallace and Gromit, all this speculation was about the full length Wallace and Gromid movie, but nothing has happened for years. Then, in 2000, we got another brilliant movie from Nick Park, which was Chicken Run, which was almost able to apply for the best picture at the Academy Awards instead of Wallace and Gromid. Perhaps the success of this film was ultimately to Park's work on Wallace and Gromid. <br /> <br /> 5 years later (such films take a long time) and many expectations, Wallace and Gromium will finally reach the big screen. Despite the relatively weak trailers and marketing campaigns, this film offers so many opportunities. This film is a joy for both children and parents. Tones of adult humor are hidden under brilliant animation, Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Virgin Rabbit is one of the few films that can attract both children and adults alike. This rather complicated technique is that only Pixar is already perfect and DreamWorks has had many problems lately. Although the DreamWorks logo has been hanging on the poster, this film is mainly from Aardman's very creative creators. which apparently had been in the wild lately and had run in large numbers. Their business has received a lot of respect from other people living in the city because the huge vegetable competition is fast approaching and the crops need protection. The complications arise when Wallace tries to manipulate rabbits with vegetables that they do not like, and then a large eating machine is fired in the area. The task of Wallace and Gromit is to find a giant animal and stop eating it through the gardens, as well as approving them from the city dwellers. In addition, Wallace wants to impress Lady Tottington, who also won the attention of a sniper driver by Victor's name. A simple plot, yes, but it's more than ready to prepare for some fun surprises, like other Wallace and Gromid cartoons. <br /> <br /> In animated movies with little dialogue, this is an animation that must set the pace and mood of the movie. Even though it only takes 85 minutes to record for 5 years, the profitability is fantastic. There's a huge amount of detail that requires more than one viewing. Even more amazing than the detailed and almost flawless animation is the truly indescribable amount of visual humor in the film. Whether it's a creatively placed shot or a regular label that has been brought to the most funny position, or it's an oh-so-divine rabbit that is constantly shown in the movie, most of the strange rabbit humor comes from watching the movie all the references before it's too late. Just picture a movie in Madagascar, except for funny much less pop culture references, and better animation. <br /> <br /> Casting was great, even though it wasn't so important in a movie that didn't have much dialogue. Peter Sallis is doing a great job again, like Wallace, although there were no separate quotes in this movie that could be used at any time (The Wrong Trousers: "It's the wrong Gromit pants and they're wrong!"). Ralph Fiennes is doing a great job as a leading villain Victor and also Helena Bonham Carter (known as the "Fight Club", a crazy female leader of cultural upheaval), giving her a lovely voice when she plays the interest of Wallace's love. Although "Wrong Pants" did not reach the final chase, there were not many activities on the Ware-Rabbit's face, including one fantastically made Chase scene between Gromid and Victor's evil dog. Last but not least, rabbits lurk at the show at some point. Whether it's their cute expression, their funny movements or their glow, the rabbits even take some of the main stars in the film. The funniest rabbit in the movie is the "damn" rabbit himself, the end of the movie when he was laughing. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Even though it's not as memorable as "wrong pants", this movie is as good and fun as Chicken Run. Unlike almost all of the films coming out this year, the movie won't let you down in just 85 minutes, but it will contain so much joy and joy, it will leave everyone looking at it more. There are very few mistakes in the movie; it was a pure pleasure to watch. This film is the perfect contrast to a decent, but vulgar, uncut, raw film that has made a surprising amount of money this year (40-year-old Virgin, Wedding Crashers and Sin City) and for families and those who want harmless entertainment; this is good. It is recommended that this year's animated film and its best examples. Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Naughty Rabbit: Fully harmless fun from the second to the second 5,100.
