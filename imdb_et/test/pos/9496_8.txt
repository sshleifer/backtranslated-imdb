I thought this movie was really good. Finally, it finally shows the viewers that Leila should keep what she had. Leila was ill for her husband, Jim, who was more concerned about the job. He was in his work that he forgot his anniversary. He was also very sloppy. He couldn't take it any more so he left to see if he left him. The film shows that he is leaving him, even trying for the night he is confused. She goes to her and tries to bring her home. He comes to find another man, Schuyler. He seemed like a man who always wanted to clean and notice him. Finally, he sees him looking at Schuylers' shoes and how he let his cigar ashes fall on the floor as Jim did the same thing. Jim stops a lot of money and cleans himself. Finally, Leila thinks she should keep her husband, because that's all she really wanted and changed.
