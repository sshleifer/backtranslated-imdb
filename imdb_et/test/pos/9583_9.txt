Such a shame that such an important film is virtually unknown. <br /> <br /> I don't think Alan Bates has made this better movie. <br /> <br /> It's never shown on television. The only time I remembered it on British television was in the summer of 1998. I have this on tape, but unfortunately the quality is not good at the time of the air of talent ... <br /> <br /> I remember I want to see this movie for a while before it appeared on television. It was shown on channel 4 in the early morning of the morning, ensuring that it remained invisible except for a very small audience. <br /> <br /> At that time I was living in Bristol and ironically, when I finally saw the movie, I realized that I had been walking along the VÃ„GA house, where it was filmed many times before !! The film has a fine line; A couple who is trying to enlighten their tragic difficulty in dealing with their hardly mentally disabled girls, laughing at it and even engaging in their jokes. <br /> <br /> The direction and actor are so big that the film is always compassionate and moving, and never dangerous to bad taste. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, I saw the production of the film's filmed work with Eddie Izzard, Bri and Victoria Hamilton, playing Sheila. <br /> <br /> It showed that Izzard improvised and speaks, and Hamilton tells the funny audience that he ignores him by ignoring him. <br /> <br /> I take it out of context because I just saw a short clip, but reading this game and seeing the movie, it's obviously such a delicate issue that this approach is both sensitive and disrespectful. <br /> <br /> Izzardit was praised for his actions, but I was uncomfortable with what I saw. <br /> <br /> It is perhaps surprising that successful gaming was not found in the audience when it was finally filmed. <br /> <br /> It is one of the best British 70's movies and hopefully it will be released from the DVD one day.
