I know little or nothing about astronomy, but still; At first I was a little skeptical about the plot of this movie. This results in three children who were all born during the sunshine and thus have no emotion and thus (naturally) become ruthless to kill serums. The beginning of the plot sounds ridiculous, but when you realize that the sunshade blocks Saturn and, as you know, Saturn is an emotional planet, it all goes into place; is a complete idea and it is then that you know that you are not just looking at another foolish 80's horse brain plot. Thank God! Seriously, a bloody birthday is based on a ridiculous assumption, but it's more than its originality. Having a lot of kids traveling around for killing, the cinema may never have been the most ingenious masterpiece, but if you choose this and the other boring Friday, the 13th clone - I know what I chose. /> Also by helping out of the movie, some people think it is a dumb plot, it is a lot of fun. Many of the Slasher's become too quick to form and the audience just looks at some gores. This film still keeps the children from the terrible performances (which bring back the horrible child's classics, such as Damned village), the humor of the constant ill and the small but impressive film, tension and tension. One of the things I liked a lot about this movie was a lot of weapons. Nothing is worse than a slasher, where the killer uses the same weapon over and over (coughing Halloween cough), but that's not because the bloody birthday finds everything from skipping bow and arrows. There was no room for a chainsaw, which is a huge shame, but I don't think every film would have a chainsaw.
