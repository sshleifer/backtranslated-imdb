Andaz Apna Apna is my second favorite comedy of all time, being Namak Halal (although it was technically a drama). The story is not a breakthrough, but the complications it adds make it fantastic. Aamir Khan is a full comic book. Just look at his phrases in the song Yeh Raat aur yeh doori. He's amazingly good in comedy, I didn't know. Salman Khan was also as good as the two characters somewhat dim. The noise it does is almost as funny as the faces of Amir. Raveena and charisma serve their purpose, but nothing is wonderful. The actual selection of the batch is Paresh Rawal as usual. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty simple, Amar (Aamir) and Prem (Salman) are the useless sons of poor fathers. They don't believe in hard work and just want to get rich. So both of their brains experience the idea of ​​enriching the daughter of a rich man (Paresh Rawal) who comes to India to look for a man. This is how Amar and Prem meet on their journey and join hands to catch hundreds of other men trying to marry this girl. If they succeed, they will have to get rid of each other now. Somehow they both get Raveena's house, Amar as an injured man and Prem as their doctor. Here they try to displace one another. But things are complicated because Raveena's friend (Karisma Kapoor) falls to Prem and he continues to do so. And the rich man's twin brother (Rawal) is trying to get rid of the heir and his father, so he's suppressing the money and sending his two most trusted but strange fools to do the black work. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you don't want to miss. Look out! It's worth it. I even have a DVD, its good. And if you like this movie, I would recommend Gol Paint if you haven't watched it yet. Other good comedies are Namak Halal and Hera Pheri (new).
