The main reason for this is to look at Laura Gemser in all her glory. <br /> <br /> This is a good reason for me. <br /> <br /> He leads another rich boy as a guest to Africa. it seems to be all these movies. Huge mansion near the jungle. Hunters who stay with the parties if they don't catch the zebras. And these parties were drunk slaves. <br /> <br /> All the high societal types of Emanuelle films seem to be out of control. And Emanuelle in bed most of them. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato didn't drive it. He just hung it and used the same to cast. And has anyone noticed a "subconscious" sexual image at the gas station? And why were most men dressed during sex shots? <br /> <br /> Consistency? Hardly. IF GODDESS GEMSER IS BEAUTIFUL.
