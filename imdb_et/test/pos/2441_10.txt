I haven't seen this movie in a couple of years. It came to the Disney Canal in the morning. I missed it and found it even more fun than the first time. The story, landscapes and characters are as good as they come from. I know if someone takes the time to watch this movie, they will definitely see it for the second time. It is very memorable for more than one. I recommend this movie to anyone because it is so interesting as well as educating everyone involved. <br /> <br />
