It was Laurel and Hardy's last silent movie at Roach Studios. However, as the public was "thirsty" with the "jargon", the team only changed it for just one year, with just a few small plots. LAUGHING GRAVY was basically the same plot except that Stan and Ollie tried to hide the cute puppy from their jail landlord - not the goat like ANGORA LOVE. This whole narrow corner is the worst part of the film. While you might understand that boys who want to keep a cute little dog (ultimately it's snowy outside), why they just bring the goat home is just understandable and pointless. According to the plot, they followed the goats home and they got tired of it and kept it. Ah ?! It just doesn't make sense - if it had been a giraffe or a cow, would they have done the same thing? In addition to being unconvincing, the film itself is Laurel and Hardy, with familiar lines and familiar comedy roles. There's quite a few laughs on this film, but unfortunately, not one of their best films to cover their silent career. This aspect of their career seems to have ended.
