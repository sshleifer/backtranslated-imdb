One of the classic, low-budget 70's movies, this movie was found only in a 50p discount video shop in London. (Interestingly, the package contains the star of the movie "Charles Bone", which sounds like a porn star, but if the role of the credit is clear, the picture is on the right side of the TV screen, so all the cast members are missing the last letter from their names) <br /> <br /> Since the narrator apparently introduces us to the situation that desperate New York City apartment tenants know you are mountain biking. The direction is from "Ed Wood's one-time" school - if one or two extra pictures look at the camera team, what the hell? <br /> <br /> Movies will finish the plot with twists, putting the usual suspicion of shame.
