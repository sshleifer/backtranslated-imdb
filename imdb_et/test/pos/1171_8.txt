"Out to Sea" is a fun movie starring Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau's great duo. This movie is not quite as funny as their "comedy old men" comedies (which it strongly resembles) but have a lot of laugh. Lemmon and Matthau play a couple in-law who take a cruise together. When they arrive at the boat, Lemmon doesn't know that Matthau has signed them as a dance leader so they don't have to pay for the trip. It encourages Lemmon who can't dance. Worse still, Matthau doesn't even know how to dance. Nevertheless, they go with it and this is the process they meet with some passengers and crew members. Here are the team members: there is a cruise organizer Gil Godwyn played by Brent Spiner, a veteran of "Star Trek: The Next Generation", acting as an evil dictator. There are two companion dance events played by "Barney Miller" star Hal Linden and veteran movie star Donald O'Connor. There's a shipowner, Mrs. Carruthers, played by "Golden Girl" Rue McClanahan. As for passengers: Vivian, widow, played by Gloria De Haven, who falls in love with Lemmon. There's Liz, one of my favorite actors of all time, Dyan Cannon, who falls in love with Matthau. There's Mavis, the mother of Liz, played by veteran director Elaine Stritch. And they also meet others. All of these actors are happy to see Lemmon and Matthau play with them. It's nice to see Cannon here, to see beautiful than ever; Stritch is a hoot; Spiner is a funny comic villain who plays this deadly straight; De Haven is great; Linden, O'Connor and McClanahan have a good moment or two; and finally there are two main stars, Lemmon and Matthau, as usual. A nice little comedy pearl. <br /> <br /> *** (Four)
