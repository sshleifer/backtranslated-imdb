In August, the days of Dies d'agost Marc Recha have given us a sun-saturated Catalan documentary style film, which is mostly curved improvised meditation from the brotherhood and the recovery of the dead. Beautiful sometimes large-scale, rich in atmosphere 35 mm. Landscape pictures, nice soundtrack and Catalan language fascinate as a mood image when you are pleased with a trajectory that is not much of a boost and that doesn't take you far. The filmmaker Marc Recha and his non-identical twin David are the stars, and the narrative is expressed by their younger sister. Marc had studied the life of Ramon Barnils (1940-2001), a member of the Social Democratic family. He felt he was saturated with information and had to pause. The interruption changed to making a film that tries to grab the mood of interviews with Barnils' associates, the thoughts of the Spanish civil war, their drought, the harsh terrain, the affection of the brothers of Recha. and suntanned nudity and any characters or stories they got when they camped out of their van. This leads to a giant cataclysm and a temporary loss of one brother. Finally, David must return to his daughter to Barcelona and Marc must return to his project and end there. I found it fascinating to listen to extended sermons in Catalan with Spanish and French words (perhaps associated with Proven√ßal?). It's not a big movie, but it draws attention and is logical as a film festival that has pure visual and audible beauty and a way to play genre and mix autobiography with fiction and documentary in a fresh and thoughtful way. <br /> <br /> Official Selection of the 2006 New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center.
