One of the most important quotes in the whole film is pronounced as a semi-protagonist, Titta Di Girolamo, who is a physically non-descriptive middle-aged man from Salerno in southern Italy. When we introduce him to the movie at the beginning, he has lived in the elegant but sterile hotel in the Swiss-speaking Canton of Switzerland for the last ten years. . While in the central, but apparently unobtrusive, arena, Swiss bank employees, who usually read Di Girolamo cash, tell him that his usual suitcase, full of tight banknotes, lacks $ 10,000. At the news, he is quietly threatened, but rigidly threatens his own banker who wants to close his account. In the meantime, he, the spectators, say that if you bluff, you have to bluff to the end without fear that they will be out or ridiculous. He says: you can't shine for a while and then halfway through, tell the truth. After all, it has been bluffed only halfway through and spoken of the truth, and having accepted the consequences of life and, finally, love, is the root cause of Titta Di Girolamo's concern. <br /> <br /> This originally atypical character, a 50-year-old extreme man, a person who doesn't even respond to a non-financial chamberer and a waitress who says hello and goodbye, will change somebody at one moment who the spectator cares. At one point in his life in non-life Titta decides to be concerned about the "ridiculous" appearance. The first part of the movie can be described as "slow" in some languages. It really shows Di Girolamo's days and nights at this hotel with a strange, deliberate pace, revealing seemingly secular and irrelevant details. However, scenes that may have seemed unnecessary show how important they are when this masterfully built and innovative film opens in your eyes. The presence of Titta Di Girolamo - a man of imagination, identity or life, an atypical character that you can suddenly love and feel when you least thought it is - is also transmitted with elegantly edited sequences and the use of very interesting music (one special note was the Canadian Scottish Ever since the release of films such as Le Conseguenze dell'Amore or L'Imbalsamatore, the contrast between Hollywood and Italy has never been more contradictory to the mobiles. Unlike a mechanic (and much more clearly - Al Pacino's film Insomnia), Le Conseguenze dell'Amore uses this condition to symbolize a deeper emotional misery that is so deeply involved in the vagueness of consciousness, and indicate your cause (if it does exist). /> <br /> Sofia is a young and sympathetic waitress in the hotel (played by legendary Anna su.) ur-daughter Olivia Magnani) and Titta's best friend, a man she hasn't seen for 20 years, unexpectedly offer a small window to life that Titta finally (though initially at first) agrees to reconsider. Although it has never been explicitly stated, the spectator knows that for a person like Titta, love is the unintended consequence of accepting the consequences. Le Conseguenze dell'Amore is a sexual or non-violent film, a film that opens in its own time and does not allow the viewer's expectations, is the small, quiet, discreet renaissance that has taken place in the Italian cinema since the fall of Cinecitt√† in the second half of the 70s. The world expects Italy to produce more Il Postino-like tickets, more La Vita Bella-style movies ... ignoring fine creations like Le Conseguenze dell'Amore, L'Imbalsamatore and others. Your loss, the world.
