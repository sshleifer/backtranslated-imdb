Hysterically painful; perhaps a film that Chekhov would have done would have made films. What is really funny is that two cousins ​​are so common (many descriptions of their relationship on this site are dead wrong). <br /> <br /> What's really funny and uncomfortable about these characters is that they just can do that? Don't bring yourself to talk to one another - or anyone else! It's terrible. If you've ever been too shy, worried, involved, or just frightened to talk to someone (and who isn't?), You're sure to see yourself in this movie. And it's not quite. <br /> <br /> It mirrors the audience and says, "If you don't like what you see ... change it."
