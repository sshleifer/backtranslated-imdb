Three separate and distant lives of individuals intersect with each other's brutal killing. The one-hour movie only shows the event that brings the three people together only after half the movie is over. I've seen other segments of "Decalogue", but it hit me the most sparsely in dialogue and in the most interesting structure. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a lawyer practicing protection against a person accused of murder. Obviously, the same arguments will have to be repeated as a lawyer, but will not be shown on the screen (at least for a short 1-hour version of the Decalogue). We have to imagine that it must be so. A misanthrope cab driver has two facets in nature: the good side feeds the mango dog, cleans the cab carefully, picks up the dirty rags thrown by the missing people and remembers his wife dying; The bad side scares small shops, refuses to drive drunk - apparently worried that he threw in the booth - and beautiful girls. A reluctant protagonist who murders ruthlessly, rocks from bridges to fast moving traffic and pushes strangers into urinals without provocation, is also a person who can laugh innocent young girls. Thus, Kieslowski's film and manuscript present two good and bad sides of the three main characters. <br /> <br /> But the film is not a death penalty, but rather a killing. The Fifth Commandment, "You must not kill" is investigated theologically - ("Even God saved Cain ..."), sociologically child and poor dead dog brutes, and psychologically (after the drunken man's male friend), it led to the accidental death of his sister whose photo with him. "What makes ordinary people kill - it has never been fully explained, but the proposals are legion." <br /> <br /> In the world of Kieslowski there is a pattern in which events and people are cosmically related (note the clown's similarity with the killer because it hangs in the mirror of the cab). Kieslowski and the young idealistic lawyer seem to ask us to literally look and imagine - why are we killing? Do people legally die really bad? Is it beyond the power of the society (drunken at night, which led to the girl's life), which makes us frightening murderers? <br /> <br /> wouldn't be in the wood for trees to discuss two tough killings in the movie - so merciless. The film invites the viewer to ponder why God does not ask him to kill him. <br /> <br /> I understand that the longer full-length version of the movie is made by Kieslowski. But even this short 1-hour version is great because it is a small and rare, intelligent editing, interesting cinematic and cutting edge direction that gives much more than the sum of its parts. <br /> <br /> This segment requires more healthy Dekalogs 6.7 and 8.
