*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** THE CELL / (2000) **** (out of four) <br /> <br /> "Do you believe it's part of yours, deep inside your mind, with things you don't want other people to see? During a session when I'm inside, I see these things. "<br /> <br /> - Catherine Deane <br /> And so are we . One year of visually stimulating films "The Cell" is a movie of love / hatred - whether you love it or hate it. I understand why some people do not like such production. A story that combines disturbing sera killers with thinking is "Cell" too much for some viewers; others do not understand the complex activities and emotions of the film. I think this is one of the most attractive films of the year. <br /> <br /> Mark Protosevich creates his own feature film as a debut with an imaginative world of rich, colorful images and provocative characters. The filmmakers use every shot. In 1993, Protosevich saw ideas for "The Cell" when he decided to combine two of his main interests, thinking and serum killers. He had allegedly influenced such directors as Wes Craven, George Romero and David Cronenberg. They would probably be proud of such imagination. <br /> <br /> The film combines two major narratives, one of which is the scientific study of human mind and the second psychopath who murders young women for their sexual pleasure. Child Therapist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) is part of a neurological study at Campbell Center, a scientific clinic. Because of his empathic personality, the scientists chose Deane to enter the mind of the catatonic preteen to regain his brain awake. <br /> <br /> A sick, demented serum killer is driving the streets. In an abandoned rural area, Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) is the innocent female victim of a large glass cell, where he then drops them and makes sadistic sexual rituals with his body. The killer escapes the FBI every time they arrive. Violent seizure makes him a comic. The FBI captures its unconscious body forever. Unfortunately he already made a cell with his last victim. Forty hours is filled with water and Stargher is the only person who knows the location of his victim. The FBI takes this situation to the Campbell Center, where Catherine enters Stargher's mind, hoping to find her last victim's seat before the cell fills with water, sending her a watery grave. <br /> <br /> Wild science fiction was based on both actual science and theoretical fiction in the creation of the Neurological Cartography and Synaptic Transmission System. It is far removed, but it doesn't matter. The film makes us believe. Even if you do not believe in unbelief, the visual appeal will be of interest. <br /> <br /> According to movie production announcements, Mark Protosevich was a great filmmaker, Tarsem, because they both think visually. Tarsem Singh is known for details, stunning and trends. "When I wrote" The Cell, "Protosevich explains," I was surrounded by postcards or paintings of paintings of paintings or paintings during my work. So I think visually and Tarsem is a very visual director. The same visual reference framework that worked very smoothly. " <br /> <br /> Vincent D'Onofrio offers a movie backbone and no actor would have achieved his character better. It offers mysterious, distracting and interesting work. "I think my character is in some ways self-contained," D'Onofrio thinks. He also studied the psychology of successive killers to help him under the character. His profound performance preparation costs a lot. <br /> <br /> While actors, writers, and directors do wonders with their material, the true glory of the film goes back to the talents. Photographer Paul Laufer, Production Designer Tom Foden, Costume Designer April Napier, Special Effect Coordinator Clay Pinney, and Visual Effect Supervisor Kevin Tod Haug. They bring life to the "cell" world. This is an extraordinary world that deserves a number of views. Some movies you watch, others you have. The "cell" belongs to a later category. <br /> <br />
