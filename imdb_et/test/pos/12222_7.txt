This DVD set is on the widescreen of Universal's 2006 Surface 15 episode. Full hours are 10 hours and 34 minutes plus some bonus features (deleted scenes, interviews, special effects)). It was a relatively high budget figure and a large part of the budget puts this screen in high quality production and special effects. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, 10+ hours is a lot of time and, as is usually the case with this type of thing, the overall quality will drop in later episodes. I found that the first 7 episodes (plates 1 and 2) were very interesting and the rest was disappointing. "Surface" was produced, written and staged by Josh and Jonas Pate; and it seemed that they were surprised by the success of the series and could not summarize enough good material when they hurried to complete additional episodes. It even looks like additional writers will be introduced for later episodes because the characters (which were already the weakest part of the series) lacked consistency in how they were played in early episodes. The series was canceled and while the last episode gives conclusions about the results, there are still many things that hang. This is basically a science fiction story of genetically-created dragons; a kind of "Jurassic Park" and "ET" television mix. The story begins with a puzzle when a crew less navy sub is found adrift at sea, boaters on a Texas lake are sucked into a jacuzzi, a lighthouse in Africa destroys a huge monster, etc. etc. And as long as things remain, this vague is quite tense and tense. As a human element, three American families are introduced, one on each coast and one on the Gulf of Mexico. Laura Daughterty (Lake Bell) is a California marine biologist who discovers an ocean creature that rises from underwater heat on the seabed. Rich Connelly (Jay R. Ferguson) dives in the bay with his younger brother when a similar creature pulls his brother away (never see again). Miles Bennett (Carter Jenkins) is a Wilmington teenager discovering floating eggs in the ocean. She takes one home where she hatches the "ET" type dragon. He spends the rest of the series trying to hide his strange pet from his family and local authorities. These dragons may look like lizards, but they are rather indestructible electric eels, ignite electromagnetic pulses, cause lightning, empty the sea of ​​the fish and multiply as a bunch of migratory rabbits when they find the underwater warming air of boiling water. As long as it is not certain whether they are intelligent, extraterrestrial or harmless, the assumption is interesting. When you start to suspect their origin, it will all be very tired and predictable. <br /> <br /> Jay R. Ferguson (bravely bad actor in David Hasselhoff's tradition) basically plays Richard Dreyfuss's character as "Third-Meet Near Meetings", so you know that a better actor and a better director could have been an interesting character . You grow more of this character with every episode you hate. Unfortunately, there are three parallel tracks that will soon be two, as Ferguson and Bell (Sandra Bullock's low-budget version) will soon be paired and involved in a number of moral adventures that are almost as unlikely as Jason Bourne. gets in. You are waiting for the plot holes and the need to stop the disbelief in such examples (which may even be fun), but their adventures are not just completely unbelievable, they are completely and completely boring. There are three consecutive episodes with Ferguson and Bell with diving, which you yearn for the excitement of an actuarial conference all day. <br /> <br /> Jenkins (Miles) is the casting strongest member and segments with his pet dragon (Nimrod) are often often exhausted with Ferguson-Bell's stuff to keep you looking. And these segments will benefit from the presence of the amazing Leighton Master (the recent "Gossip Girl" fame), like his sister Savannah. Obviously, the producers began to raise its importance to the target group of their "teenage boys" and one positive thing they did with later episodes of the series was to introduce Linsey Godrey (Caitlin) to Miles for the first love. As Savannah's display time decreases, Catlin is gradually turned on. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, they needed a third story that viewers were sufficiently involved and it would have been better to limit adult melodrama to another. young actors. <br /> <br /> Then what do I know? I'm just a child.
