Whether you are a fan of this series who inspired it or not, it is not an unfair job. But in the best possible way. Wishing to stay away from the old sitcoms that made the big screen dissatisfied, Pemberton, Dyson, Shearmsith and Gatiss went a different way, dealing with the problems associated with adding their success and other creations, and inevitably, renaming some of their best loved characters. I'm sorry they didn't stay in one of the more consistent Gentside League movies, because if inventive, to get involved in the scenario, it weakens the finished movie. It is worth renting though.
