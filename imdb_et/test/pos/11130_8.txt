High school. Years and decades later, some look at it tenderly, others are embarrassed. But few are easy to forget. This is one of the most critical phases of our lives when the changes are fast and furious, whether we are ready or not. No more children, no more adults, irresistible forces, pushing and pulling us in every direction. <br /> <br /> "Celebrity" did all it can to defeat this turbulent chaotic period to cast its young characters. Mostly successful. It bowed down but felt like a slice of life. This film has a special place in the '80 class hearts. We were pleased after ten years and soon three or four years of stimulating and sometimes difficult schooling. We led the cold, cruel world, leaving home college, then parts unknown. When we approached our water event, this newly released film was a two-hour yearbook for us. We couldn't escape the radio from the titer song. It was on the screen. These were our friends, rivals and classmates because we were faced with our dreams, disappointments, advancements and failures. <br /> <br /> This is especially gratifying for those who participated in some of New York's other elites, top-level high schools especially Stuyvesant, Bronx HS of Science or Brooklyn Tech. As children here, we were considered to be the best. We had no hearings, but we had tough exams. Perhaps even more than children of performing arts, we were supposed to make the world, though not necessarily famous. Like them, not all of us have done this. But the pressure cooker environment promoted extraordinary marriage and esprit de corps, not unlike the "Hot Lunch Jam" cafe. On our graduation day, our spirits rose almost the same way as the running final. The film leaves us at the end of "I Sing the Body Electric" with a suitably winning remark that refers to a blindingly bright, unlimited future and all the promises he made. <br /> <br /> "Fame" could not be set elsewhere. This story would never have worked in a small or suburban school. Los Angeles has stronger identification with films and television, but NYC is a mecca for all arts. Home not only to what was then called PA, but also to the world-renowned Juilliard, is the NYC Cultural Center, which is not compatible with any other city in the world. It is also a historic time capsule that shows New York's endemic seed, dirt, and dirt, which are still struggling with its almost bankrupt budget crisis. But above all, it showed viability because it was suppressed by the breakthroughs of Giuliani, Disney and tourism. <br /> <br /> What I didn't want to be young again. But at least "fame" I remember what it was.
