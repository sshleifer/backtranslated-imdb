I want to say that this movie was great. <br /> <br /> I loved it from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The show was great. The director did an amazing job and I would like to see it again. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tilly did a great job, a boy who interpreted his father (Manny) was another great actor, but I can't restore my name. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for El Padrino II. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa looks so good and I think she is one of the most talented actors out there. Latin actors who do this good job are shown in this movie! <br /> <br /> Rent it !!! Rent it !!! Rent it !!!
