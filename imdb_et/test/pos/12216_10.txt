The surface is one of the best shows I've ever seen. NBC is so stupid to cancel this big show and worse about everything, leaving it in half. NBC or anyone else should give Surface at least one season just to be ready. Just like NBC gave you a book to read and halfway through, they decide to take it away from you and you will never know the end. I just want to see what happens to everyone and most importantly to see what happens to Nim. I think I can say it safely about most of the surface fans that we want to save Nim! Nim has taken all our hearts out and then NBC cuts the two. Come to NBC, give Surface another season!
