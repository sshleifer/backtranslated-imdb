I stumbled upon this site looking for a 1959 Porgy and Bess video or DVD with Sammy Davis as Sportin Life. If anyone finds it in your home movie format, please let me know. I'm talking to my daughters all the time about things they think are new, which is actually done. We went to see a live theater a couple of years ago and all I was talking about was a movie. Unfortunately, my daughters can't remember seeing Sammy Davis Jr. Needless to say, they don't know the other big players in the movie. It's a big watch that this classic movie (for the most part) isn't collected in home theater format for collectors and future generations. Anyway, I think this version was the best!
