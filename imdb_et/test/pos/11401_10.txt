Paul Thomas Anderson's stylish and delightful 70's porn industry follows Eddie Adams, Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg), for six years of sex, drugs and disco. His opportunity to meet porn director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) begins his career as one of the biggest adult players of the time. The Dirk character is based on a real porn actor John Holmes, who, as Dirk, was well-blessed. Then Dirk finds initial success. <br /> <br /> The main themes of Boogie Nights are obviously related to this genre movie; pornography, drugs, sex, betrayal, violence and music. Boogie Nights deals with pornography under some control. It has not been overplayed and sexual scenes are surprisingly minimal, but spiritually clear when they take place on the screen. <br /> <br /> All cocaine is abused throughout the movie, and the movie setting, Los Angeles 1977-1983, reflects the popularity of drugs at a time when the film is a great movie. But Boogie Nights does not promote cocaine because there are some addictive and overdose scenes. For example, in Jack's party they find a recently and graphically overdosed girl; Blood pours the nose and starts unconscious. The film before this scene has been quite cozy and comical, but from that moment it is based on the darkness it takes. <br /> <br /> Music scenes will be filled perfectly, from superbly staged discos until Dirk sings terribly in his new music career. The soundtrack is also great, featuring The Emotions, ELO, The Beach Boys and the Unforgettable Sound Experience. The whole movie's standout scene comes to music; Dirk, Redd Rothchild (John C. Reilly) and Todd Parker (Thomas Jane) visit the house of the drug dealer Rahad Jackson (Alfred Molina) to make quick money from selling drugs that carry money, but the Night Ranger sister Christian, who plays the background, increases The intensity of the scene is incredible, proving that music can bring more depth to the scene. Boogie Nights is full of scenes that make the movie even more fantastic. <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights is an exceptional performance by Burt Reynolds as a mysterious but moody film director. In a scene where he attacks a young guy to slip his films, it is a complete shock for the audience, because before that he was pretty soft and substantive. Other notable performances include Julianne Moore, Heather Graham as a beautiful Rollergirl, John C. Reilly, and Mark Wahlberg, who offer their careers. <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights is also a surprisingly original film that uses common themes but filmed in a sharp and realistic way. Anderson's approach has taken these characters completely away at a time when something seemed to be wrong or at least until the 80s. Since then, things have become very dark and all the signs of recognizable characters and situations in the first part of the film have gone. However, this does not diminish the interesting entertainment of this movie. <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights was not successful but earned only Â£ 2 million in the UK. But this is not a film or director's concern. Anderson acknowledges the quality, not the popularity, of his three other films, Hard Eight, Magnolia and Punch-Drunk Love. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a simple parable that is filled with amazing and changing situations, because at the end of this movie you realize that Boogie Nights is a simple moral story, but what remains in your minds after viewing it. Boogie Nights is shocking, fun, devastating and visually and audibly outstanding at the same time.
