Go to this movie, I was a little cautious. I've always been a bit bright about movies. I've always enjoyed decent animated movies, but claymation was always different for me. But it struck me as a surprise. Wallace and Gromit are very loving characters and this is a great story with jokes of all ages. For kids and fine, it's silly licky / joking, but on young children, jokes to older people. Very clean claymation and although the story was holes, it keeps my interest beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> It is so rare to find pure and corrupt humor these days, this movie was even more refreshing. Wallace and Gromit go to the usual thing that destroys HUMANELY buggers who are destroying people's vegetables. But this time they are in some way fighting a gigantic rabbit, which their humanly built traps cannot even hold under the tabs. Big laughs and a great hour and a half fun. If you haven't come into contact with Wallace and Gromit, I recommend this movie very well. <br /> <br /> The only reason I appreciated it for 7 and not higher is that it is still a family movie and I have no children. I enjoyed it, but if I had looked at it with the small scarves and my husband, there would certainly be at least 9! Give it down!
