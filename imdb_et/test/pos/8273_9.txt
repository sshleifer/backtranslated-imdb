When it first appeared in the Masterpiece Theater, it deeply affected me. It's beautifully filmed and worked. I read Mary Webb's book immediately and it remains my favorite of all time. Janet McTeer is wonderful as Prue, and I was expecting her to be regular in the British drama scene. I think he decided to focus on the British stage. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that with the American success of Janet McTeerer years later (with Tumbleweeds), this movie will be available to us again. Unfortunately, it is not yet published on the DVD. When someone listens to you, make it available again!
