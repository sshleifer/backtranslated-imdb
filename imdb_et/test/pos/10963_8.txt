"Shadows" final credits, after reading "John Cassavetes," see some white stars on the screen: "The movie you've just seen is improvised," they say. I am always in the position that films are so important because the filmmakers started using them, because basically there is no movie without a scenario and many other reasons. <br /> <br /> Cassavets pursued the same goal and believed in freedom of expression; "Shadows" is a great example. This is a film that does not have the real main characters without real main lines; it is mostly people in different situations, talking. Yes, some situations are interconnected, but in Cassavets, apparently always in a hurry to talk, uses fast back and forth techniques when characters go somewhere or flee from someone and don't talk. <br /> <br /> Performances are all in this movie. For example, there is a great score, full of jazz influences and a lot of fantastic solos, and there is one sign that he is a jazz musician and plays trumpet (Ben, all the characters of the characters are the same names as the actors). But we never see him with a trumpet or jam band; she doesn't even talk about music and just rides her friends across the city. They speak a lot and something that is in their minds; how intelligent each one is for a fun sculpture analysis. <br /> <br /> "Shadows" are funny in their intellectual references in such parts as above, because they are not cultivated. The only important woman in the film (Lelia) wants to be intellectual. But again he has an interesting conversation with one of the older men at the party, the book he is trying to write, and how to face reality; but there is nothing to do with the intellectual nature. At the same party, a woman actually makes an intellectual claim that is full of complexity and asks the man next to her: "Do you agree?". "Yes," he says, but you can say he doesn't know what he's talking about. <br /> <br /> Another character, singer (Hugh), speaks of his glory in times, and we see him only once; but there are no references to the musical industry. The focus of Cassavets is the singer's relationship with his leader (Rupert), who for the most part includes conversations with trivial things and not with actual "musical" talks. So the trumpet player "Shadows" is an important thing when he spends with his friends; an intellectual wannabe girl is her way of dealing with romantic relationships (one of the strong points of the film) and the singer has a relationship with her leader? Exhibitions. <br /> <br /> The reason why performances in this movie are not important is simple. Cassavets needed people to be able to improvise without the importance of being really good. I believe some of them are not, but they know how to improvise in the scene, and you can note how well they do it. "Shadows" do not touch performers; this is the way to change cinema chat based on magic; and it could be said that performances mean something. <br /> <br /> That's why the camera in every conversation is similar to a stalker, constantly in the eyes of every character, constantly looking for expressions that come with natural speech. There's a scene where the trumpet player and his friends are trying to pick up their daughters. They are three, so each one sits next to one girl (three girls girls) in three different tables. They all talk at the same time and the camera shoots through the table and sometimes friends look at each other when they say what they say? It's natural.
