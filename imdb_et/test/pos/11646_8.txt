Just to explain that Matthew Poncelet was not a real person, but a combination of two killers who had been convicted of BOTH and sentenced to death for two teenage murder. <br /> <br /> I read user comments and they responded as if Matthew was real. The character is based on two killers, Elmo Patrick Sonnier and Robert Lee Will (who killed individual people) and the murder itself was based on one Willie. Both Willie's conflict and someone else's, and both sides swearing in the other half, also killed the story. <br /> <br /> The Prejean approach is unique because it is not only convicted because you wait for their death and help them take responsibility for their actions, it also reaches the families of the victims to help them find out that the convict, indeed deplores what they effectively contribute to both parties. <br /> <br /> Everyone posting here seems to have a strong belief in the death sentence. It is not my place to say that this is a true or false theory that punishes death by death, does some kind of karmic meaning, but prohibits a person on his / her freedom in the rest of the day, though costly, it makes more sense for me to have a small room 23/7 (one hour exercise), that the rest of their days would be remembered from a cruel thing they felt more punished - they are technically alive but deny living. Say someone killed someone to take their death out of responsibility (as Susan Smith killed their poor children by pushing their car into the lake). I think it is ironic that they do not get the "freedom" they wanted, and now they have to spend the rest of the day. <br /> <br /> Prejean's point is very good. He is with my respect - he can find that balance - he doesn't support the killer, he guides them to accept what they did. If they do not feel any regret, they would not ask for spiritual guidance. <br /> <br /> There is a final remark when Poncelet apologizes to Delacroix for killing his son's daughter's parents. he was also murdered for not apologizing for his death. I think Poncelet denies killing both children throughout the film. Prejean believes that he was both a murderer and a friend who was convicted, but not to death - my idea is that Poncelet killed Delacroix boy and another man murdered a girl-Poncelet took responsibility for what he did. If he were responsible for the girl's death, he would probably have apologized for it.
