It was a great movie. I'm dealing with a child I raise with a FAE and watching this movie more than the word can explain. I also bought a book and it was great. I would like to have my copy for myself and so will my son's teachers look at it. I would like to know if someone could sell me a copy of this movie, let me use it for a while or contact someone where I can buy it. Thank you, Myra I recommend this movie to anyone who deals with children / adults with special abilities. This movie must be displayed on TV again. A team of doctors who have watched my son also want a copy. His special Ed-teacher has asked me to try to find the copy he has or can borrow. <br /> <br /> Thank you
