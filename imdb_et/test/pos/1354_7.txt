If Sicily is a baroque territory and doubling its perspective, it is part of the realistic challenge of this film. And this is an overwhelming joy here, crossing Fellini with not just one, but three film directors and, of course, the actual Bellocchio, who has made really great films and shouldn't be defective in his honor. Manzon's "I promess spos" has many different and painful improvisations with actual marriage. Sicily is also considered a skulduggery territory (you already know this version of the island, so there is no spoiler included), the comic version of which makes Sergio Castellito a big Palazzo hall to look at.
