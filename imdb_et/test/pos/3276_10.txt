I'm not the biggest fan of the West. My two personal favorites are Unforgiven and Tombstone. But this movie liked! It was great! The plot was well done and it was a fun movie. Everyone who participated in this film was great! I even think it beat both movies somehow. Well, not really Unforgiven, because it was a great movie that these two can't compare in the long run. I think it beat Tombstone. Both had their own strengths. For example, they both had excellent pains, very good plots and very good filming. But in my opinion, Posse beat the tombstone in four ways. First, the characters were more unique in Posse. The music was better at Posses. Unlike Wyatt Earp, the idea in Posse was original. And the biggest difference, sequences! For God's sake! Posse was a western country with really good sequences of action. I mean really good! The action was fast paced. Like today's hidden movies. The activity also had big budget explosions! Fistfights were also pretty good. Mario Van Pebbles was great in this movie! I recommend buying this great movie!
