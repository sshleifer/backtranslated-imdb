Conclusion: Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag) finds himself alone in the coach, descending to the desert, which seems to be at the last stop of his trip. He does not know how he arrived there, but he has a welcome sign. After a moment of reflection on his location, he is welcomed by a man who takes him to his new life. He then enters a world that is different from what he came from. <br /> <br /> As Andreas is quickly introduced to his new job as an accountant, he feels that his surroundings are a bit too uniform for his taste. When she takes her first lunch break, she immediately notices that everyone in the city is wearing a gray costume. On the same day, he sees some fences that look like suicide, a dead man businessman. The odd thing is that the city people are not paying attention to this terrible activity and walks like it ever happened. It is quick to see that these people are genetically desensitized and that their ability to distinguish anything humane or inhuman is missing. <br /> <br /> To help Andreas settle down, he is asked to go with his colleagues to a local nightclub. It seems that the club is one step away from being as exciting as a bingo evening ... and when Andreas drinks his concerns, he understands that no matter how much he drinks, alcohol has no effect. As he tells these stories to strangers in the men's room, the person in the toilet is beginning to give the words that Andreas has always had. Realizing that this man thinks of what he is, he monitors him to his house and notes where he lives in the future. The plot is projected to form with Andreas, who wants to escape. He's looking for a man he's repeatedly followed ... hoping he can make him a man again ... but is it too late? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: this Norwegian film is something everyone should see because it has a big question! What is the meaning of life? (Well, close enough). The film represents the dark reality of today's working man (or woman). It is the only purpose that people understand that life is too short to be materialistic. He tries to show that small cliché things, such as the sound of playing children, should not be taken for granted because the moment you hear this sound is the moment when you are one step in getting a robot. Stopping the movie repeats what happens when it is too late to escape the routine you are used to. You will begin to accept the phrase “if it is not broken, do not fix it” and become too risky for a risk change to occur. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is not being taken, as realism ... its message is more than real. In the film and what Andreas sees, the lack of empathy is a bold statement of what life can change. Director Jens Lien has created a film that would have failed in other director's hands. It's a fine cinema genius, and I'm looking forward to seeing what he's doing next. <br /> <br /> Trond Fausa The leading role of the Auragar is completely cast. Representing the middle Joe, Trond gives a good picture of darkening this image. Supporting actors also do the right job and, for some reason, I feel that Keanu Reeves would be perfect in this film, as most of the supporting pains required them to act without emotion. <br /> <br /> The result of this movie was beautifully designed. The recurring theme was always a joy to listen to, and it gave me a very amazing but welcome movie lesson. <br /> <br /> Set the date of publishing in the UK on May 25, 2007, I'll definitely go live this experience on the big screen. This movie has reached its top 10 ... now fast becoming my top 20! It has some shocking scenes and it's dark in humor ... BLACK-SEX !!
