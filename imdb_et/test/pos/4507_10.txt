Watching Stranger as founder of fiction Marc Forster's The Kite Runner is the vegetable equivalent of vegetables because this artistic epic called PG-13 is good for going to your movie. No, this is not a movie I would like to slip on the couch and eyeball at the end of a tough day. Kite Runner is not your typical mainstream movie, which is for you to entertain and forget your worries. First of all, no fame appears in it. Second, nothing is cut and dried, black or white, or so extreme that you don't believe in the image you see. Third, Kite Runner loses its subtitles when the characters speak from time to time in their mother tongue. Fourth, the Forster movie is not a romantic little girl, a boy-losing girl and a boy-winning girl. Fifth, this foreign-language film may feel uncomfortable and challenge your assumptions about life, friendship, and survival. The main topics are coward and redemption. In the first half of the season, the protagonist acts with the coward he has to agree on for his personal safety and integrity. Right, Kite Runner is for the redemption of past sins. We are talking about personal responsibility, so don't rent or buy this wonderful movie for the boy to stay at night or something that takes the bad taste of the day. Based on Khaled Hossein's best-selling novel, it sees the culturally enlightened melodrama to the right and originally in the veins of the adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Sandlot as one of these light-hearted friendships for adolescents. Approximately half an hour in its 127 minutes, it will change to about two young people who fly kites in Afghanistan, dark and uncomfortable. However, if you can handle the rest of the lesson, you will be happy, relaxed, and perhaps even entertained. <br /> <br /> Kite Runner opens in San Francisco in 2000 as our main character, Afghan emigrant Amir Jan (Khalid Abdalla of United 93) and his wife Soraya (Atossa Leon Florist) receive two copies of Amir's first novel published in the box. Previously, Amir has managed to triumph over her lifetime as a storyteller as phone bursts out of her reverie, and she is reluctantly pulled back into the past that is best forgotten for her. Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub of The Nativity Story) invites Amir to make up Pakistan. Rahim was a servant in Amir's household in the 1970s, when Amir lived with his rich pashtun trade father Baga (Homayoun Ershadi, A Taste of Cherry) in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion. "You have another chance to be good," Rahim says to Amir without sugar cover. In principle, Rahim Amir wants to fly to Pakistan and then enter the war-torn Afghanistan and rescue Rahim's young son, Sohrab (Ali Danish Bakhty Ari), who is considered as a sexual slave to Assef (newcomer Abdul Salam Yusoufzai) a. cruel Taliban leader and Amir once feared the opponent. <br /> <br /> Kite Runner moves from San Francisco in 2000 to an extended setback that took place in Kabul in 1978 when life was idyllic. Twelve-year-old Amir (Zekiria Ebrahimi) and his father's servant son Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada) love watching movies like John Sturges's Western Great Seven, when they don't drive kites. By the way, this is a kite flying like you've never drowned. Not only do children fly, but they also compete with other children to see who can cut the other's kite's strings. The Kite fighting scenes create the same excitement that the dog fighting scenes were Tony Scott's Top Gunis. Hassan is Amir's best friend, but unlike Amir, Hassan belongs to the Hazara minor. Earlier, young Amir and Hassan had a confrontation with young Assef (Elham Ehsas) and his two flunkies. Assef began to beat them, but Hassan pulled his instrument and threatened to use it with Assef. Assef had no choice but to go back. In the meantime, Amir was ready to bear the fate of her hand that had dealt with her. Amir's father, Baba, deplores the absence of his son's backbone and fears that he will grow half a man because he is a coward, unlike the happy little Hassan who punishes Amir. Anyway, Amir and Hassan come out of the show with Assef without scratch. Later, after Amir set a new record for his kite flying and fighting skills, Hassan drives after the dragon. Hassan is the title name. Hassan claims the fallen dragon, but he finds himself in the grace of Assefi and his two nations. Assef lets Hassan hold the kite, but his minions seized Hassan's eagle, the belly alley, while Assef's youngsters. The worst, traumatized Amir looks at a nearby attack, but lacks the courage to intervene on behalf of his friend who would have intervened. <br /> <br /> In addition to the extraordinary air scenes in the kite, Kite Runner has underground, straight line stuff. When Amir returns to Afghanistan to rescue Sohrab, he masquerades as a Taliban fighter, but he does not wear a firearm. Kite Runner's rescue action is more like a Midnight Express escape scene. Although Forster does not investigate local politics and does not interfere with the ethnic and cultural issues at stake here. Indeed, Troy scriptwriter David Benioff had to remove some parts of the book, and racial and ethnic prejudices are not clearly defined, so you have to accept some things in faith. Forster showed the film almost in China to give him an authentic look. Forster deserves recognition for its two hours and epic excitement. Performances, especially by children, are distinct from their credibility. Kite Runner is a movie that you just don't forget.
