I and my companions gathered in one house to watch it on Friday night before going to the pub. It was the only program that ever opened us. This is one of the best comedies I've ever seen, if not the best. David Jason was great and was compared several times with Buster Keaton with his smart tricks that were pulled so incredibly. I wish I could watch the DVD again. He had an amazing ability to make stupid things credible and this series shows how many talents he has in so many different directions. He's a "trip and fall guy" and I remember seeing the trailer once when he showed people how to do it professionally. He certainly teaches it to the people of art. He only showed it for other programs he did. Pshaw, this program shows how he's gifted. I've lost why David Jason's veto made another series because I thought it was one of the best things he's ever done, and I've been a fan of it because he did this series. It has been said that he did not like it because it showed the rawness of his early career. I think it might have been the right decision when he took it, but now his career has progressed so far, I believe it would be a good time to make another series that shows him that he looks at his "secret life" full of mistakes, which he does not see.
