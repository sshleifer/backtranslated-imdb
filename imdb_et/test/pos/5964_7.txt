The frogs who wished the King or Frogland are Ladislaw Starewicz's most cautious story of people who want the government to solve their ever-seen problems. The ironic thing is that they ask for answers from God for Jupiter. Jupiter responds first by sending a stump and then a stork. Not working and the stork is especially dangerous for amphibian creatures! The frogs have some human qualities when we see them in dresses in the last fashion of the day and see some shooting or film camera when the stork arrives! As I said, it is a short, very political allegory that is better suited for adults than for children. In fact, I saw it in Rhino VHS with Bambi Male Godzilla. That alone should tell you what to expect here!
