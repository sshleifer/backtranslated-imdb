Just went ahead and this movie was fun. Maybe better than the first, but at least equal. If you don't like jackass, or really unnecessary amounts of male nudity (more than the first one), then stay far, far. But if you dig the whole Jackass thing, this movie won't disappoint. Toro Totter is the biggest invention. OKAY. so my review wasn't long enough ... Anything else I have to say is bad, poor Dunn, they pull out of it. So if you enjoy masochistic humor and fertile male nudity and the nudity of the most disgusting woman (John Waters is involved, I have to say more?), Then this film keeps you all stitched. I never stopped laughing and actually went out to sweat.
