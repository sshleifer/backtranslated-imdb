Amazingly the best, intriguing worst, Francis Ford Coppala's groundbreaking epic "Apocalypse Now" is one of the most iconic and celebrated 20th century movies and I think America's biggest film focuses on America's participation in Vietnam <br /> <br /> Most more like "Apocalypse Now" is that it differs uniquely from other movies of the same genre. I've grown up as a film buff and especially interested in war films, I've seen a lot of movies that have tried to portray Vietnam's "images" and "feelings" but haven't done so. Movies like "Hamburger Hill" and "We were Soldiers" belong to the category of attempting to defeat the Vietnamese atmosphere, depicting the "heroic battles" that are more often deceived by the zeal of Hollywood film production. "Apocalypse now" does not have battles, heroes or crooks, there is nothing in the film that suggests that it is meant to reflect Vietnamese images through the physical aspects of war. Rather, it is a film that vigorously explores and explores the human psyche when it has been tortured by the absolute "horror" of the darkest military conflict of the last century. <br /> <br /> Apocalypse Now is an unforgettable epic that works (especially by Martin Sheen's silent captain Willard's interpretation of Martin Sheen) with remarkable cinematic art (filmed in fillipins) that gives the film a real reality in the background. /> <br /> Evangelizing a lot of emotions and leaving us for a mid-term review, the "now apocalypse" is not a frivolous moviegoer. This is a masterpiece that requires the full recognition of various views.
