Slick, tidy and well-made old school version of how to make a big international thriller. Having decided to reach the feared global terrorist known as "Carlos the Jackal", Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland, "Without Borders", "Space Cowboys"), CIA Operational and his Israeli colleague Amos (Ben Kingsley, "Gandhi"), "Sexy Beast"), will become the noble naval officer Annibal Ramirez (Aidan Quinn, "Music Music") to become Carlos and use her in a bold plot to get the KGB to kill real Carlos because she took the CIA offer. Sutherland and Kingsley are both good here, but the movie belongs to Quinn, who embodies himself here (in two roles). The film's director Christian Duguay and filmmaker David Franco offer another great value of the film here at Hitchcockian-like breaks and major world sights.
