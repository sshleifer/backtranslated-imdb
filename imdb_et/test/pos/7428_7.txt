It was the third time I tried to watch this movie. For the last two times, I found the beginning as badly sweet and "schmaltzy", which I just stopped. But now that I'm a little older and more compulsive, I forced myself to watch the whole movie and I was very surprised that I really liked it a little. So, I look at the movie the same way I watch swimming in the ocean when the water temperature is 70 degrees (that is about 21-22 degrees Celsius for all those lovers of metrics out there). Of course, the water is terribly cold and shocking, but when YOU stay in the water, get used to it - so answer the urge to jump straight away! <br /> <br /> The film begins with a long shift between Flynn and her daughter, played by lispy Patti Brady. Some may find the conversations very cute and lovable, while others may take them a little harder because these moments are so cute-cute! In a sense, Flynn was an amazing act, because it is hard to imagine in real life, having children or acting in his home country, especially that he wanted to be in one woman in the movie - now that is! NEVER say GOODBYE concerns a divorced couple, Flynn and Parker and their mutual marriage. Since they both love each other as well as the bitch boy, it seems to be a failed conclusion that they bind the knot again. However, there are some serious problems facing them: Lucille Watson (who plays her usual overcrowding and controls her mother-in-law character), Flynn's girlfriend (after all, she's Errol Flynn and she's divorced so you have to wait for she has a girl SOMEWHERE) and by the sea (played by Forrest Tucker). <br /> <br /> Not all of this has ended unexpectedly and everyone is happily living. Despite being formal and predictable, the film is a winner because it is so fun to watch. Flynn, despite his reputation as an adventure hero, is very good at comedy-romance and has a lot of fun to watch. Cuddles Sakall is also a movie forever - he is just as gosh-darn cute and sweet that he is perfect for this type of film. And despite the sweetness, the movie is pretty well written. The bottom line is that the movie is FUN. <br /> <br /> So my suggestion is that you watch this movie and force yourself not to stick to the badly sweet aspects of the movie. Once you get over it, the rest of the movie is a picture that is worth your while.
