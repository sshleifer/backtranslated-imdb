Frank Sinatra played in this strange little short RKO that is currently public. The film came out at the same time as the war ended and it is a nice statement of religious tolerance. <br /> <br /> The film starts with singing the stage at Sinatra. After leaving the stage, he walks into the field and finds a group of children who choose to go to another because of their religion. Instead of boys shouting (or helping them), Sinatra offers a nice civic education about religious tolerance and equates prejudice with fascism. The kids seem to have a lesson, but then Sinatra starts singing a song that honestly (get it?), Hate me. He had a lovely voice, but unfortunately I think it was damaging the excellent message he gave to children about tolerance. This is a good message with too many songs - even if the guy is singing is Frank Sinatra. It is also an interesting curio - a nice historical piece that is often overlooked ... and it's quite touching even when it seems a bit schmaltzy.
