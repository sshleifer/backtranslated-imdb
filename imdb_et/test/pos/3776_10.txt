It's sweet. An actor who played sister gonzongas is the same actor who plays Elvira's lover in the dark. Another little tidbit is the actress who played the sister who gave her a wedding ring to Roy Munsin's landlord King Pinis. This is the most famous story ever said. It should sell more copies than the Bible. My parents participated in the release of this film to a local cinema. The film ran a week and we were one of four families. The theater gave a woman who passed on (a family friend). I was 3 years old. I've burned through 4 copies of VHS and finally converted it to DVD. It's beautiful.
