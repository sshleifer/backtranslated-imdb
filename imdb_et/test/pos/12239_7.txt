The creature function of the early 1980s concerns the long abandoned gold mine that some horrible miners have decided to control. Of course, they don't find gold there, but one very hungry monster who robs in search of catch. <br /> <br /> Although I have to be honest and admit, I found that it was boring "Boogens" at first, it rose to me when it passed. Now the characters are not too interesting or actors. The closest interesting character is Morgan, played by Keith Hurt. In any case, the female leader Terri Berland looks pretty good and Rolf Theison makes her dominant jerk for hate. Impact on Man Mark Sawick's writer plays fast air. <br /> <br /> It starts in a predictable way, a piece set at night, claiming that two victims will get things up to an acceptable start. The monster itself is intriguing for its design (as you can imagine, it appears from time to time until the end of the game) and it is the result of stop-motion animation when this process is no longer used. Director Melanie Anne Phillips (headed by David Michael Hillman pseudonym) and the team deserves the atmosphere to create their atmosphere. They can make the film obviously claustrophobic and gloomy and the use of their lighting works well. The film's intensity is pretty good. It is enough for them to say that they are doing the best they can with their small budget. <br /> <br /> Hidden little products that are worth exploring for heavy scare-takers. <br /> <br /> 7/10
