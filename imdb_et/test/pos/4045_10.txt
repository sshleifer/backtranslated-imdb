People who compare this movie with big blockers like Lord of the Rings or Matrix are inevitably disappointed with the development of this film. Although it is not in the major special effects department and there are no battles with hundreds of additions, there are still two championships of old folklore. The acting talent, though not the A-list, is still great and communication between characters is probably sincere as in the larger A-list movie. My special favorite of this movie is Bridget Fonda, whose performance by the Snow Queen itself was quite touching, helping tremendously with the amazing wardrobe and makeup. He injected the character of the fallen season into humanity and the trait of sin, which has been corrupted by evil magic. Fonda did not act from Hollywood, what I think is good because Hollywood seems to have run out of ideas on how to teach his talents to play roles and that they have become old and addicted to CGI and other special effects to take us away from actors, who all use the same tricks. Instead, it shows participants new ideas that show how to find new variations on old love and threat issues.
