"2001: Space Odyssey" was created in 2001 and the main character is HAL. Computer. That's right, a computer that speaks and thinks in its own right. It was done in 1968 and it is believed that by 2001 it would be conceivable that computers would be a joke. If it was in 3064, the talking computer, which had emotions and its decisions, would be considered as moral. There is nothing in this film that provokes any emotion. It creates two reactions and one is called sleep. It starts with nothing but the dark black shot well over two minutes. Then we see the first picture with some kind of lighting, "Human dawning". So, if it is in chronological order, is dirt the birth of the world before? <br /> <br /> The "monstrous human" series of great monoliths comes from? from the earth, from heaven, we never know where it comes from, but for one reason or another it is there. Monkeys go to Apesh when they find the monolith that only a person could have done, but is it a catch? man is not yet developed. So who did it and where did it come from? What is its purpose? Monkeys find a tool. Monkeys use bones to fight against monkeys. Monkeys with weapons are now the dominant group because they have used their mind as an advantage. More successful monkeys, and more importantly, smarter and more innovative monkeys, are the dominant group because they have taken over the soldering hole. <br /> <br /> We jump quickly into space, millions of years later, where we see space ships floating around classical music. We see the earth, the moon, the sun, the universe, and the 1968 film whose visual effects are stunning but outdated. The result is legendary. Cinematic art is remarkable. Editing is cruel. There are countless shots of tiny spaceships floating in space that seem to be infinite. When we get to the ship, there is not much to talk about. Over the next hour, Kubrick will show you a variety of life opportunities in space. Kubrick shows us the life of astronauts, which is very boring, and we get the message completely. Spaceships are bulky and outdated on the inside and outside. Remember the first mobile phone? Not one, but it looks like the future in 2001. All the characters have clothes and hair that resemble 1968. The chairs are decorated with bright red tones and strange shapes, because we all know that in the future we will be sitting on strange chairs. Computer screens are terrifying and probably before HDTV, because the clarity is cruel. All TVs look like they are from 1968, so it's not all futuristic. Like all the films that have been set more than 20 years ago, they look terrible and convincing. Just because it's Kubrick, we shouldn't say, "Well, that's how you think it looks." No, I wouldn't. Just as I don't think the computer would talk to me in 2047. It doesn't happen, and when someone made the movie right now, set it up for 30 years and talked to a self-thinking computer. laugh with this stupidity. Just like I did in 2001. <br /> <br /> HAL is a livelier person to shoot? I just called him a person. HAL is a computer but has more life than any silent characters in the movie and he thinks he is alive. HAL is the only thing that is alive and he sees people as carers who take care of him when he does all the work. HAL "reads" his lips, one of the few conversations between Dave and Frank, and he "sees" that they are going to turn him off. This is where the only dramatic part of the movie enters - the battle between the red light and the spacecraft who is trying to get into a larger space ship. Oh, drama. If HAL thinks he has an upper hand, Dave will return to the spaceship, proving man's ingenuity. Dave continues to finish HAL. HAL claims his life when he slowly disappears, which, like everything else, seems to take forever. <br /> <br /> The final act is as annoying as the first two. Again, the monolith that Apesid found was over. He's coming out again. Then the child is born in a placenta-like film that looks at the earth from space. What is Kubrick? Is it a transformation? Dave for the baby? Does a person develop again? Does Kubrick say it is the end and the beginning of man? what does this alien look like? Maybe I'm going crazy when I try to figure out what this crazy director is trying to say, but the more I mean, the more the beginning and the end make sense. There are so many questions unanswered, especially for the monolith. If you can do this movie, you should think about it. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the film fights with the film he wants to go to. The first act and the third act are strong, but the second act tends to slip in one place that seems eternal. There are some intriguing things in the movie that give you some thought when you give it a chance. If the movie's start is meaningful, the work ends much better, even if you still don't do what Kubrick is trying to say, which I don't do.
