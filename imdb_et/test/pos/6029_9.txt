This movie is a bit slow at first, in about the first 10 minutes. But if it hits, you can't turn it off. Adam Beach and Rose McGowan play the best parts and are excited about their action. You can never guess who the killer is. I gave this movie 9 because in some places Adam Beach has to talk a little to hear what he says. <br /> <br /> 9/10
