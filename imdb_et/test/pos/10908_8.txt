Kevin Kline's first two gays are much better. (The second is the clumsy "De-Lovely" in which he played Cole Porter.) Inspired by Tom Hanks's "Philadelphia" emotional reception, where he issued his high school drama teacher, the film in this version was probably more "Forrest Gump" than "Philadelphia ". Here's Hank's character Matt Dillon. <br /> <br /> Reaction scenes in most movies are very funny and, as is often said, they are particularly effective, as Kevin himself did, Debbie Reynolds, Tom Selleck (brave move because he himself was the target of rumors he denied!), Bob Newhart and Joan Cusack as the finally beaten bride - <br /> <br /> Tom Hank's actual teacher criticized the graduation scene, saying that people were not doing so in real life. But it is a farce and not a real life. That said, it's not as effective as possible, and the wrong "wedding scene" misdirection, which puts it like Tom and Kevin, that I am going to force, I found quite useless, annoying and police. The highlighting of the film for me is, of course, the Kevin scene, where there is a real-male-cassette and it is fun, but certainly not realistic if the tape responds to Kevin's actions. <br /> <br /> Generally, hoot!
