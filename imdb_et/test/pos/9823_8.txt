Like many others, I was attracted to the combination of Pollack, Ford and Scott-Thomas. I had enjoyed Pollack and Ford's work in Sabrina, a well-made film and a careful rewriting of old material. When I heard that this film was in production, I ordered and read the book. Immediately it seemed to be a harder story for the film. The characters are not always sympathetic, there is little or no humor, and the author makes numerous plot shortcuts to focus on his main topic: that everyone sees the only one who shares a unique combination of loss and betrayal. In the event of an accident, the adulterous spouses of the adulterers are looking for each other. What's more, he thinks that the resolution can come through the bitter investigation of the hidden life of adulterers as well as the fact that this "thick and thin" experience can give deeper love than anyone before. Although much of the book deals with their bitterness and the hatred of their former partners, ultimately, they find acceptance and forgiveness. The film scenario only retains the air accident and the common risk of the spouses. If a woman is a researcher-aggressive, she is a woman in the film and a woman is never a co-researcher. The film has a completely new dramatic sub-block for Harrison Ford, which seems even more acute than the double coincidence of the crash. The woman's "re-election congress" is also new, but it works better. The audience cannot meet the expectations of pure romance or romantic comedy, because this story focuses on a very bitter pill. If the book achieves resolution and forgiveness, but the reader is raising the burden of bitterness and the promise, there is no corresponding moment in the film. Although there has never been a hint of forgiveness, we have assumed that healing after taking pictures is a double duty. The Ford character doesn't have to be a somewhat unknown man, and the Scott-Thomas accent change is a little uncomfortable first. This movie is not a dead damage that others suggested. However, it is difficult to rate the film because rewriting and customizing the screen is below the standard previously achieved by the driver.
