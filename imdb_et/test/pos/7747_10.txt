I thought this movie was fun. I've never watched old movies ever and it was really a great first time movie. He had heat and heart and spirit. There was such a cheesy, but the modern film industry is cheesy cute. I gave it ten and I highly recommend that you rent, buy or see a movie. Gene Kelly was very dreamy and a bit sarcastic and you knew the character thought she had everything. The female lead was thrown to perfection because their two persons had a spark and you wanted to stick and see what would happen. The grandmother of the film was invaluable. Perfect for a big old movie. I love the fact that it was black and white and Gene Kelly is so sweet with all the kids in the movie that you can't like her. Look at this.
