This film is definitely well designed, beginning and ending in the dark, focusing on Lili Smith / Schmidt, Julie Andrews, who originally sang "angel" later on the notorious spy. <br /> <br /> It's beautiful! I saw the movie about 15 years ago and recently looked at it again. Critics in the 1970s triggered it as fired, "cinema vulgaris," and the lack of structures (among others) has proven to be wrong. Blake Edwards has definitely created a film with almost lyrical film. You just have to buy the premise that Julie Andrews is a spy whose mission has gone wrong. The view of the chilly chemistry between Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson must believe that they are lovers - who fall into one another's innocence. And finally, love is more important than winning wars. And so is the preservation of innocence. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of underrated behaviors and the movie will definitely reach emotional depths, often not in comedies. <br /> <br /> The French ghosts in Victoria / Victoria), interesting diplomatic things (remind me of Tamarind's seed about 18 years ago) and a general feeling of goodwill. <br /> <br /> Stop all beliefs and this movie will take you away. The twisting of Julie Andrews' warships and the haunting Whistling Away the Dark is enough reason to turn on the TV, just for the soundtrack. And a striptease number like "Jenny" number Staris! works. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a good champagne outdated. Paramount should bring it to the DVD as soon as possible. The same goes for Star! To DVD. These are both interesting pieces of Julie Andrews' diligent and then underestimated work.
