No matter how much it does to me, this movie is not as good as it could have been. Maybe I misled these IMDb's countless exaggerated comments, but I waited so much more ... <br /> Of course, the idea is good, violent scenes and camera-work are outstanding, genius Dario is breathtaking, but the film is "dirty" with a few mistakes that I find unforgivable. First of all, are I one of the few people who feel the music of heavy metals played in the most intense scenes is lurking on the atmosphere? With other music (Goblin ????) this would have been SOOOO intense during needle scenes! ... Instead, the soundtrack destroys all possibilities for tension ... Second, the final kill scene and the last moments of the movie are just stupid and uninspired. I don't want to say "amateur" because I love Argento movies. At the end I was left blank. That's hardly what happens in most of Dario's movies! Although it is undoubtedly also susceptible to a quick final (even if most of it is brilliant) .... <br /> <br /> In short, watch this movie, try to make the most of your good points, but be ready for the bad ones. It is NOT a perfect film with any means.
