I can't explain it, but I find this movie not just funny, but so enjoyable that I'm forced to watch it again, or at least I did when I had cable TV. I've always felt it was really a badly made movie, but maybe it's because I watched it with a cable. I am going to get a DVD of this movie to really look at it, but more importantly, just look at it. I liked the plot and the idea of ​​the movie and I especially liked it. I don't always know if making movies was cast and it's no exception. This film deserves a better fate than it got, and Kelsey's grammar deserves at least one love. Who wouldn't be? The characters in this movie were the guys I could detect in the army, and the zaniness was accurate. Nice soldiers.
