I really liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Everyone has something to blame, everyone is real. Neither cartoon heroes nor colds, omnipotent, all things characterizing. <br /> <br /> I read a lot of other viewers here who complained about Anne's morals and James was going to keep her love for her, despite her cheating, but I disagree. <br /> <br /> I found Anne (Emily Watson) absolutely wonderful and I felt love for her. <br /> <br /> She was a heavily repressed woman, her activities were not planned; But it is in real life, when you achieve freedom, you probably have errors (especially at the starting point). <br /> <br /> Was he too ungrateful? Maybe. But we have to remember that he runs for the first time with his feet. He knows that James is a good man, maybe a bit too rigid, serious and job-oriented; but he also feels the desire to live life himself. <br /> <br /> Does he blame more than him? I don't think so. <br /> <br /> But what happens in their lives makes some changes. <br /> <br /> James, instead of letting his wife go out of his life (as other viewers suggested right) listens to the ball and waits, hoping for better. He begins to realize that what he was superficially (marriage) was his playful play. <br /> <br /> This is not a story of a character that has an overly emotional and insecure character (ie, ordinary clich√© of Latin American or jealous boys), it is the story of men and women who use both heart and brain. <br /> <br /> It can be very painful, but if you really love a person (women) or a person and if you are not terribly unstable, you are likely to forgive your cheating and let it go. If you are not jealous, prehistoric, criminal, passionate, peculiar and mentally unstable. <br /> <br /> Very good movie. The last scene where James - despite everything that happened before - goes to the train station with Anne is really touching: He's free and he understood what freedom means to man. <br /> <br /> Guido
