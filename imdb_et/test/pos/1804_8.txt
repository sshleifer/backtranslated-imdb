Valley Girl is an exceptionally well-made film with all-encompassing great pain. Although the dialogue is a bit outdated, it was very clean when the movie was released. By now, I know many people (including teenagers) who cannot use the sentence without the word "like". This is undoubtedly the legacy of this film leaves. This, like the most excellent film, was rated 8.
