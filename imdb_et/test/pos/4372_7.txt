For those who love stand-up comics, you must have heard of George Carlin. She's really one of the best live comedies so you have to know her. <br /> <br /> But he died already, God is resting him in peace. Or hell. He did not believe in religion too much that he would have chosen hell to live forever. HAHA, just joking, doesn't take it seriously! <br /> <br /> It's a bad ya !, this is one of George Carlin's latest works, before his death - <br /> <br /> I, one of his best deeds, must be fans and almost all George Carlini jokes. It's not the best ... but it's really fun. <br /> <br /> He has less political and religious jokes. It's just a good time! <br /> <br /> Editing is very good. It's not a concert, so it shouldn't quickly change the frames ... the slow dazzle with the other shot was well done. Disturbance is the best choice for editing!
