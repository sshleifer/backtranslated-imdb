Although it has been in cinemas, because it is mainly a farmer in MÃ¼len, one of the three stars in France did not play the first role. After that, the fans had changed their mind and waited for it on the DVD. When it was released this year on DVD, it has been a great success! Others failed to have a slow and incredible length (3 h) at that time (1994), which is annoyed by critics. But the melancholic story makes it slow and long. The movie's moral is that you can't escape from the death you have been assigned to. This is the same topic as in "The Final Destination" and changes the Gothic story. The atmosphere is very melancholic.
