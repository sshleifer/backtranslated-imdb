what i say, this movie is amazing. it has its drawbacks, as every movie makes a tombstone, for example, a tangible tombstone clearly visible during the death of penguins, Max Shreck loses his big coat between the second second during the picture consultation site, losing the black eye makeup unexpectedly between the shots so he can reveal Bruce Wayne i Catwoman, save the dialogue, but it is played and spoken differently than when it was first talked about, and finally Catwoman knows how to use any training to whip a bull. these shortcomings are small compared to some that you would see, for example, in batman forever, where a traveler might expect to wait for his wedge or Kilmer's hair to change between frames. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie worth 8/10 is a great actor because the performances are absolutely amazing. Michael Keaton repeats his role as Batman and has much more to do with this movie. He looks second in his role more comfortable, and is parallel to rogue tasks. Danny Devito is the perfect penguin. I really like the penguin conversion to a grotesque penguinman instead of the comic or non-dangerous character of TV shows, because now the character is deeper and has a lot of interesting story that comes from the family's basic need and feeling accepted and wanted. it gives us the evil character we feel compassion for because it was rejected because it is not his fault. Michelle Pfeiffer is great as Catwoman. she is bright and sexy and she is also a villain we know because she has fallen victim. Christopher Walken is an excellent secondary villain and it is such an interesting sign even though he is not even in the batman universe. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is much better than the first and Danny Elfman gets more ways to show off his musical talents. Sets are amazing. They are detailed, eye catching, embarrassing, gothic, unique, blind, and so many other adjectives can describe how amazing they are. The costumes and decorations are great and obviously they were doing a lot of work and doing all the work, because Batsuit is better, the cat's suit is amazing to look at and the penguin is made and the effect is so convincing. Penguins look really realistic and play a good role. The script is really good and the story I think is plausible. In general, this film deserves 8/10 because of all these factors and is a favorite of all my favorite movies
