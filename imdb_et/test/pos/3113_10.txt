George Cuckor, a well-known female leader, could not count on his last film for two more talented and beautiful women. This movie is a remake of Bette Davis's "Old Acquaintance", written by John Van Druten, which is definitely dated but still enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Bergen and Bisset shine with the best friends who compete with everyone but guide them to remain friends. Liz Hamilton (Bisset) is a "serious" writer, intellectual and elegant. She meets her lifelong friend Merry Noel at an exclusive girls' school and starts a life that is not always friendly. Later, when Liz is a "promising" but a serious fiction-blocked writer, Merry decides to try his hand in writing, which encourages his ball Merry to be crafted by a casual approach, which he himself may take too seriously. <br /> <br /> A lot of Liz's passion for Merry's trashy novels was hit by dirt and ultimately his old friend Liz appreciated his national book prize. Bergen steals an exhibition as a high writer of steaming bestsellers, who are planning to break the broken pieces of their life with their final literary struggle, but unfortunately, things are never that simple. <br /> <br /> David Selby, whom you remember as tragic Quentin Collins from Dark Shadows, Hart Bochner and of course the delicious young and mercury Meg Ryan in his first film role after leaving the soap. Rich and famous is filthy, nerd, witty and wise. It culminates in a new year's fiasco, which emphasizes the constant nature of true friendship, and I will not let the year go all year round, despite it at the turn of the year. See it and see why.
