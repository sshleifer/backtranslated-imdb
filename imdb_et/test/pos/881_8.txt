Unlike Bond and other detective films, Alfred Hitchcock's hero had previously been an ordinary man who got into trouble and then out of his agony and courage (and happiness). Jewel Thief is based on the same principle and so is Vijay Anand's respect for the arrest. A tribute, as it may be, but it stands for its own reason and creates Vijay Anand as a great director. <br /> <br /> This is a story of a normal man, Vinay, who one day realizes he has a double named Amar who is actually a Jewel Thief. Maybe Vinay finds himself in the middle of a hatching mechanism and can save himself from the chase of a wild goose to find the Amar that will keep pace. Temporary death is almost throughout the film, and when the plot is removed, it hits the shine of the scheme. Just like Hitchcock's films, Jewel Thief can boast of the great climaxes made within Simaim's large palace. <br /> <br /> Everyone and I mean everyone; Dev Anand, Vijay Anand, Ashok Kumar, Vajyan Mala, Tanuja, SD Burman, Kishore Kumar, Majrooh Sultanpuri etc. It is one of the best thrillers ever in India.
