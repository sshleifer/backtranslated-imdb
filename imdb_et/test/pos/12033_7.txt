I found the parts of this movie quite slowly, especially in the first part; the second part seemed much faster, but it is not clear to me why one part was faster than the others. I have somehow managed to enjoy it. Working was good, writing was good (still vulgar). There was another good thing: it was easier to understand than the godfather movies. You knew who the side was, and the like. All in all, the movie wasn't half-bad.
