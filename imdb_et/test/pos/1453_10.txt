It's just one of the best films of the 1950s. Otto Preminger led only four or five really good movies and this is one of them. Frank Sinatra gives his best result and Elmer Bernstein's music score is dynamite. From the opening (by Sauli Bassi) to the hysteria of drug addicts, Frank goes to a cold turkey, this is a riveting film! Kim Novak (giving very good results), Eleanor Parker (giving a very bad result), as well as Darren McGavin as the repulsive force of reptiles and Arnold Stang as the Frank Grifter. Beware of bad prints: this movie is in the public domain, so some copies are pretty harsh.
