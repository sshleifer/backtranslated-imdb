Betty is so insane in Verdi's Macbeth production that she is asked to continue when the diva has hurt a car accident. But in the great Scottish game tradition, production seems to be cursed with problems, at least one of which is crazy team finishing. Unfortunately, Betty feels that the killer has special plans for him ... <br /> <br /> This is one of many black-and-white Argento crazy clips, which in this case is especially excellent British operator Ronnie Taylor. I'm not measuring it, but I think about two-thirds of this movie's frames are pans, dolly, tracking devices or cranes - the camera's movement is just amazing and makes the movie ten times more exciting than the standard thriller. The images are natural and dizzying - heroes are heroes, heroes, worshiping around the cloak of the opera house, wounding the killer brain, bullet burning bullet, swallowed chain of the victim's trachea. Conceptually, it's just amazing and can only be done by this director. There are, however, no drawbacks to the film; cast at best varied - Marsillach and Barberin are both slightly shaky (and its dubbing in the English version is terrible even according to Italian standards), although Argento's regular Nicolod is fun and Charleson gives a thoughtful result to more than a few autobiographical (horror leader who was very far away its distance and technique). The material is a nice three-step combination of The Phantom Of The Opera, Shakespeare and slasher flick, written by Argento and his usual co-owner, Franco Ferrini. . Full of music - Brian Eno, Claudio Simonetti, Bill Wyman, Puccini and of course Verdi. The scenes of a beautiful opera house were shot at Parma Teatro Regio. For some bizarre reason, this movie has an alternative title to Terror at The Opera in the UK.
