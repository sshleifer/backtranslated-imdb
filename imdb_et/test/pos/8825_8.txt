Looking at this PPV, I had great expectations about it, because Smackdown is the best example in WWE, it's a very good PPV because it's the last one before Wrestleman. <br /> <br /> FIRST MATERIAL BOYS & CHRIS BENOIT VS. MVP & MNM W / MELINA IN 6 MAN TAG TEAM MATCH Good starting point for games. At first it started to be a bit slow, but later picked up and the game became more exciting and fun. Benoit rolls over and makes Joey Mercury to win the Hardy Boys. 6/10 <br /> <br /> SECOND MATERIAL - GREGORY LIGHT {CHAMPION} VS. SHANNON MOORE VS. FUNAKI VS. CHAVO GUERRERO VS. DAIVAIRI VS. SCOTTY 2 HOTTY VS. JAMIE NOBLE VS. JIMMY WANG YANG OPEN CRUISERWEIGH'S EVALUATION WWE CRUISERWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP I am a very big Cruiserweights fan, and I will never be disappointed by watching them, especially in this game. Chavo Guerrero nails Frog Splashi Jimmy Wang Yang to win and become the new WWE Cruiserweight champion. 5/10 <br /> <br /> THIRD MATCH- FINLAY & LITTLE BASTARD VS. BOOGEYMAN & LITTLE BOOGEYMAN It wasn't really a wrestling game, it was a comedy match, even though it wasn't a clear wrestling contest, it still attracted me with funny gentleman games. Finlay scores a small boogeyman with Shillaeghi to win. Boogeyman does not deserve to be in PPV and is not worth being in WWE. 4/10 <br /> <br /> FOUR MATCH-KANE VS KING BOOKER W / SHARMELL It was a surprisingly good game, I thought it would be mediocre, but it turned out to be a real competition. Hats for both men pulling a very fun game. Kane wins after King Booker Chokeslam. 6/10 <br /> <br /> LAST MATCH- PAUL London & BRIAN KENDRICK {CHAMPIONS} VS. DEUCE & DOMINO W / CHERRY WWE TAG For Team Members Not much good game, Deuce & Domino need more training to wrestle, & London & Kendrick are the only ones to keep the game fast. London and Kendrick retain their titles after Kendrick receives one invitation for one win. 6/10 <br /> <br /> Sixth Material - BOBBY LASHLEY {CHAMPION} VS. WRONG. KENNEDY ECW for CHAMPIONSHIP Mr. Kennedy is attacking Lashley before the game starts. It was okay, but not quite good. Lashley & Kennedy has some chemistry, but not enough to draw a big game. Kennedy wins from DQ, after Lashley treats her with a chair, she is attacked by a chair in the entire entrance area. Lashley still retains its title. 4/10 <br /> <br /> SEVENTH MATCH- JOHN PRICE & SHAWN MICHAELS VS. BATISTA & UNDERTAKER This is probably the biggest tag team game I've ever seen. Hats for all these men (yes even Batista) to pull as close to the 5-star main tournament class. All four of these men played their parts very well because it was a very big and fun team game. Batista turns his back on his back, then leaving a circle that forces Michaels to reach Sweet Chin Music, then Price to reach F-U to fight. 7/10 <br /> <br /> I don't know why everyone says that this PPV is not good enough or is boring, I just don't get it. This is a great PPV that Smackdown always offers. Great PPV really. <br /> <br /> In general, I give him 8/10 & a B +
