I found this small pearl an extra option on the Vampyr-Der Traum Des Allen Gray DVD and didn't expect that much. It seemed to be an interesting little short so I turned it on. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I did. It was really incredible! Despite the fact that the animation was made more than 70 years ago, I thought the animation was better than some of the computer effects and experiences made today. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple - a newly-assembled toy dog ​​hears his owner's regret about not being able to afford orange, and is going to try to find one. In the process, this toy gets into the underworld, where there are all kinds of unpleasant creatures and toys that are guarded by anyone other than the devil himself, all of whom want the dog's orange for himself. <br /> <br /> This film precedes, but reminds me of a mad monster? (1969, Jules Bass) - a movie I have always enjoyed and to a lesser extent some of Tim Burton's animated works - The Nightmare before Christmas (1993, Henry Selick) and Corpse Bride (2005, Tim Burton). Fans of all these films will definitely love Mascot. <br /> <br /> Generally, there is an incredible piece of short animation that you should watch.
