When it comes to their scary and surprising little criminal movies, those who move around the scrambled characters and live equally around the scummy, and also carry that momentum and blindness, thanks to some pretty mad cinematography and very black comedy; Dead Bodies is a movie Paul McGuigan wants to do. Unfortunately, the crazy and casual gangster No. 1, as well as the entire store, but an interesting realistic exercise that has been mixed with realism, is the only effort that we have to go to. Dead Bodies is a work by Robert Quinn, based on the Derek Landy script, a film between a psychological horror and a neo-rabbit; blending the elements of crime and terror with moral and unnatural, obsessive-minded issues. McGuigan's British crime efforts carry this wavy and distorted feeling, as witnessed by someone's nightmare and front row seats. His films are strangers, there are some areas and entertaining in others that have their extreme and over-local approach. They suffer from a very dreamy sensitivity, even though they are grounded in a very realistic, downward, gloomy world in the real world with so much emphasis on fear and fear situations, its characters spawn as anything else. Dead Bodies is a film that deals with some of the most harrowing characteristic situations as well as the brief involvement in the study of the delicate psychological mindset, only here the film balances the eccentricity of its characters; the fear of the scenarios they encounter and the much better moral issues. <br /> <br /> Dead bodies are effective and fairly simple without ever feeling manipulated. His suggestive and conscious inclination to get home exactly what people think and feel is not detrimental to experience. Early we meet Tommy McGann (Scott), a young boy whose friend Jean (Davis) dominates her, her life and screen when she is in a short time she is. The fact that his situation lives less than in a desirable house; there is a clear distinction between workstation shelves and a partner with whom he does not work well. This is how the audience is explicitly allowed to not like Jean with his obviously bad, corrupted and expected attitudes. Later, the film is more likely to capture the face of a police officer if doubts and tensions arise in what is clearly an inexpensive and easy way to tell the audience that our hero is not yet in trouble. <br /> But compare it to gangster # 1, where this is an episodic and erroneous approach to McGuigan; that an important, viable test point arises when the character is set aside, leaving the building on someone else's 'random disk' scene set several months after the previous one. The feeling is not so justified or fulfilled. Kay Davis' Jean dominates the founding of Dead Bodies; Possible femme fatale is just itching to choose some kind of fight, but just can't find it. He has led Tommy by jumping with rings; to go there by doing it and that without Tommy's ever real reaction in the way he could, mainly because he is controlled by his sex promises. At first, a certain tension is being built because Tommy's under-reaction to what is happening and culminating in a separate release when the original case happens, and Jean dies. <br /> <br /> If the setting is simple enough, this is one thing, but the project's pinch is the way Tommy decides to let Jean's hands open, burialing him without informing anyone about his death bar as the best friend. Things are being done when it turns out that there was another dead body in exactly the same place Tommy buried in Jean, in suspicion, denial and general difficulty of the day's round ingredients. At this point, the film blurs the lines between the rams and horrors; Indeed, Tommy lives in a rather large, ominous, spooky, and even Gothic house that he shares with an older relative living in the upper areas of that house. It creates memories of Hitchcock's 1960 Psycho and Bates, which he has with his mother and where he is placed. In addition, it is no coincidence that this horrible place is the unfortunate death of Jean. <br /> <br /> placing the corpse in the hands of the unhappy men's leaders to make it work because the original case is a classic noir; from Ulm's 1945 movie Detour to the newer and more modern, compared to Dead Bodies, 2006 by Big Nothing. What this film opens is twisted; a rather unpredictable and rather frightening story of the genre's hybridity and thought games that are clearly drained under the image palette. Voice transfers and a fine line that the driver makes between most of the film for better and wrong help to push this neo-noir field; if we consider that the leader is essentially innocent and his murder charges are unfair, this is one thing, but his attitudes towards Jean saw him initially, and covering his death is an anti-dissertation murder charge. Dead bodies are taught; entertaining to watch without ever being exploited, and giving a consistent tone to the rather nasty physical and psychological content of the subject.
