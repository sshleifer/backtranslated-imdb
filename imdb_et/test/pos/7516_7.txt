George Scott gave life to Paddy Chayefsky THE HOSPITAL, a very dark drama-aging metropolitan hospital and medieval doctor on the verge of suicide. In the future, Diana Rigg is a free spirit who decided to save her. Their dialogue collides and it is clear that they have been made from the beginning. But does he save him? Their single sex scene is both passionate and furious, both graphic and memorable. Meanwhile, a hospital group of mixers grabs those who don't want the dead building to become a cancer center. And the serum killer is in the hospital, specializing in doctors and nurses. However, a good part of the film is focused on Scott. Just like it should be. What is the difference between this film and the film? In 1962, we recycled international, obsolete DR. KILDARE with a terrible effect and a cardboard script. Fire 1971 and HOSPITAL. Less than 10 years later. Hollywood did something to make it right. Watching HOSPITAL is a reminder of how many medical shows like ST. ELSEWHERE and SCRUBS owe it to the enduring classic. And if HOSPITAL reminds you of the network, it should be. Same scripter.
