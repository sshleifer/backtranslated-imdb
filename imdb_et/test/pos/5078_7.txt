In this day and age, where almost every other news story includes discussions on water plans, Abu Ghraib pictures, or forced detentions in the Guantanamo Bay, "handing over" Gavin Hood is about as fast and timely a film that has probably come out of Hollywood entertainment centers. It is not a kind of imagination, a perfect film, but it is not worthy if it has been received by critics from the entire ideological and political spectrum. <br /> <br /> The term "transfer" refers to the CIA's ability to arrest all suspected terrorists, then throw them secretly abroad to question and torture them indefinitely, all without a lawful procedure. Anwar El-Ibrahimi is an Egyptian man who lives in the United States for twenty years, has an American woman, a young son and a new child, who appears to be a very unlikely candidate as a terrorist, but one day, without warning or explanation, is arrested by Anwar and taken to an undisclosed location where he is brutally tortured, Until he acknowledges his involvement in a terrorist organization, which Anwar claims to know nothing about, on the negative side, Rendition speaks from his storytelling abilities from time to time, often biting a bit more than it can chew both in plot and character. , Douglas Freeman, brought to Anwari for an "interrogation" of Egyptian officials. The problem is that Freeman, created by writer Kelley Sane and accepted by Jake Gyllene, seems to be too naive "boyfriend" to make a very credible agent, and is not given the time that he needs to fully develop as a character. We know very little at first, and it seems less at the end. He "moves through the movements," but we learn little about this person. Thus, without holding a strong center of gravity, the film is known from time to time so that it is separated from each other in the seams, with the story elements flying in all directions. There is also a similar problem with Anwar's disappointed wife, played by Reese Witherspoon, a woman we never know much about, except what we see on the surface. Gyllenhaal and Witherspoon have both proven to be good performers in other circumstances, but here they are limited to a restrictive scenario that rarely allows them to occur within one repetitive remark. </p> <p> </p> Ultimately, a powerful movie is a unique theme and the way two concurrently running plots fit into each other in the film's closing strips elegantly. This may create a little more natural story than perhaps we would have liked this subject, but hey, that's Hollywood, and the film has to pay SAMALA's respect for the expectations of the mass environment when it wants to shine itself green. not to mention daylight as a finished project. <br /> <br /> Two supportive performances are particularly convincing in the film: Omar Metwally, who makes a real-life man scared by the Kafkaesque nightmare he can't wake up and Yigal Naor, who is surprisingly complicated by the main interrogator / tormentor. Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin and Peter Sarsgaard are also making their mark in smaller roles. Particular mention should also be made of Dion Beebe's warm and plentiful cinematography. <br /> <br /> Does the film simplify the problems? Probably. Will it put the deck in favor of the victim of torture and the evil government forces? Certainly. (One wonders how the film would have been played if Anwar really was a terrorist). Yet the film has courage on a controversial surface. He is not afraid to raise dicey questions or to risk some political positions. He publicly thinks about how the state faces peacefully and fearlessly with its hard-to-reach 'citizens' rights'. And how much courage do people with goodwill eventually have to get up and say "enough", even if there is a risk that the terrorists who are in power and patriotic are in power? (The film does not reflect in any way the reality of Islamic terrorism). <br /> <br /> Thus, "serving" would have been set aside to allow the enemy to be perfect. good. The "handover" may not be perfect, but it is good, and it has something important to say about the world in which we live now. And that alone makes it very worthwhile.
