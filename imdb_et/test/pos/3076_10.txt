"Robin Hood: Men's Tights" hasn't got any respect. It was fun! Cary Elwes was great as "The Prince of Thieves" and David Chappelle, Amy Yasbeck, Patrick Stewart, Richard Lewis and Mark Blankfield when Blink did a good job. I never understand hostility "Robin Hood: Men in Tights", but I know a great comedy when I see it. <br /> <br /> "Robin Hood: Men's Tights" will be *** out of ****.
