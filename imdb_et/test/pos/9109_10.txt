Inviting all D-scholars! Grab your friends, hit the theater and watch this movie. From the opening order to the credit you get your breath. <br /> <br /> This movie is wild in history through D's history, not just the list of some bulls they've made, but the coronation of their power rises. I'm a big fan of Rage Kage (Kyle Gass) and Jables (Jack Black) so I naturally loved the movie. <br /> <br /> It helps to know their exhibition and their first CD, but it's just as funny as you don't. From the fun and vulgar word, the crystal rhythms, the large amount of smoking and the stick, to the very madness that is the story, it is for D-sciples as well as for beginners. Many of their songs are cited, such as two kings, tribute, and Kielbasa's many sound tracks, such as Cock Push-ups, a fan of every audience saying that I remember both new and newcomers say, "This is fun! " I recommend this movie to every body that has ever been pulled out. This film is definitely a big competition because it's next "It's spinal knock." One of the best.
