This movie is a love story that is behind the war. Everything about the movie was perfect. I just saw a movie yesterday and I want to get my DVD and watch it several times. The story ends when it started, I was very happy that he came back and was proud to get to the doctor and fulfill his father's dream. He honored his father, his boyfriend and his lover. The character had many shades. Christian Bale is also a phenomenal actor. Some stories are happy. Apart from the love story, I wondered how the war was influenced by a beautiful, peaceful and peaceful island, and it made me realize that a real devastating war could be for my people ... the government makes a decision while the people are suffering. His father was a very educated man and wanted more for his daughter when he had regular dreams. I loved this scene where she complains that she doesn't receive a gift card, and I also loved the scene where both of them survived the earthquake. They were surviving.
