Certain aspects of the penal park are less than perfect, especially for some actors. But I think this is probably the most important film "The War on Terror". I grew up in hatred of hippies and still in some ways. It was only when the United States began to make an unnecessary and deceptive war in Iraq, that I began to see the world through these eyes. I know what they felt. Although the film is somewhat timed, it looks like it brings these uncomfortable emotions from our current situation directly to the surface. At the beginning of the film, it is quite clear that the punishment park is meant to be concentrated in a camp of death for all "unpatriotic" elements of American society. This is certainly an exaggerated and extreme view of our polarized society, but it is CREDIBLE. Sometimes I think I believe the US could easily slip into fascism. Looking at this movie, I can only think about how I hear feelings similar to people on both sides of the political spectrum almost every day. This film is a raw, concentrated distillation of American PRESENT political scene. I'm so impressed and sad that something like that (and yes, exact) was filmed more than 30 years ago. If you look at the film more moderately and you decide to believe it won't happen, check out Guantanamo Bay, some of our "enemy fighters", rumors of the CIA secret prisons, and many similar incidents. Greensboro, NC 1979 (8 full years after making this film).
