A wonderfully thought-out and engaging film that leaves a mark beyond the initial raising. Based on a true story that is one of many "small" stories before World War II, which gives an understanding of the cultures of most ordinary people affected by others who are perceived as former enemies and possibly future enemies. War clouds on the horizon. The film was enthusiastically viewed at the Stony Brook Film Festival. Well written and expertly cast. The characters were the most credible and led one to experience their trials and afflictions.
