Indeed, this film used its locations with superb shots, dark and movie-disturbing things very slowly, but constantly watching. This year, Modern Love worked well in Gold Coast Film Fantastic, giving the audience a glimpse of the Australian Cinema, which is usually overlooked. The most important thing is refreshing to see that Australian cinema does not take the Aussie symbols and story over the years. This film congratulates all the festivals and opens the debate afterwards. Performances and characters are well-developed and the cinema is fantastic. An interesting study in family relationships and environments.
