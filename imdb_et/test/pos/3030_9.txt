The last movie that gave a lively and disturbing look at what madness probably liked was In Dreams. In this movie you didn't see madness. Now Cell comes with a renewed and much more disturbing image of the inside of the mind of the psychotic killer. Open scene takes you to the seemingly innocent mind of a fairly small boy and the things that Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) sees are exciting and then frightening. The things he sees later in Vincent Stargher's (Vincent D'Onofrio) thoughts are amazingly imaginative and exciting, most of these things have never been before the movie. <br /> <br /> The Cell's story is not just something that is really groundbreaking. In fact, it is basically the same as lamb's silence. You have a murderer in custody and these people have to find their way to find a female victim who is currently in danger of losing her life. The only real difference between building plots is that in the silence of lambs you have to enter the murderer's mind to find another killer as well as his current victim, while the cell has entered the killer's mind to find his victim. In spite of the harmful weak story, Cell completely turns the genre of the psychological thriller. No one who has ever been made is even close to it. The film was also good and it worked very well. Vince Vaughn performs another of his distinctive performances (he was even a good Norman Bates in Petho's miserable transformation of 1998), and even Jennifer Lopez makes his career a good second (the second is a great prospect)). Nothing tells Cellis about cinematography to give him enough credit, it was imaginative and exciting, and it is incomparable to anything that has been in cinematography. The cell is an incredibly well-made film that deserves recognition.
