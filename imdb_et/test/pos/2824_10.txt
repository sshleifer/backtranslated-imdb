First, all the enemies: get a life! I don't see why you don't even want to post on these boards, as you probably don't know about cinema, robots, or people. <br /> <br /> This film has an important lesson for us all about gender, stereotypes, relationships, and DESTINY. Indeed, we are all robots that are programmed to respond to certain ways of certain stimuli without thinking. How many times have we seen the sunset and made some tiny comments without thinking about it? I say, Thank you Aqua (brilliantly by Bernadette Peter) to stop me and think about the awesome power of Mother Nature. <br /> <br /> Only when Val and Aqua start rejecting their programming, that they begin to understand their true desire - to find love and escape from the creative life of the factory. This movie should be a must see in prisons - just think about the dreams and hopes that this prisoner could inspire. maybe even they could overcome their "bad" programming and join the rest of us in a world without crime. <br /> <br /> We can all learn a lot from these robots. I'm a better person for heartbeat.
