As I said in the second comment, this is one of the best teen movies of all time and one of my personal favorites. for me this movie is the second best movie ever. the other only for the breakfast club. The last American virgin is also the most honest service film of all time. it is an undervalued and pretty much unknown film for many people. it's on TBS, maybe once a year, but sometimes longer. the first part of this movie is sex media with some honest scenes. then the other half is pure honest and mostly serious. just a few comics. I think this is the best soundtrack ever. I've never heard this many great songs in one movie. In this movie there are 4 love songs that I think are the best songs in history. The movie is a pizza boy named Gary, who is a virgin. he is in high school with some of the best friends. her two friends are sex-horns teenagers. the first half of the movie is pretty much sexual malformation. it's very funny. gary is in love with a new school. later it turns out that his best friend goes with him. he also cheated on the side. you may feel that the love of gary is very much for this girl. You'll feel it even more on the other side. Gary's friend turns out to be a trick. but his second friend is pretty cool. The film shows how people can be. you can be related to this movie. The plot sounds like your typical teen sex comedy. but it is so much more. this is a very honest film. it is also very 80s sexy what i love. if you love the 80s or grew up in the 80s, rent this movie. but there may not be people in the 80s, but this movie may still be a pleasure. I first saw this movie in 1987. it is very fun and very funny. it combines very touching moments with very funny moments. it's an underrated pearl! I have a movie. I love it! i give last american virgin *** 1/2 out ****
