This movie is like happiness that corresponds to Lost in Translation's sixth way of thinking (or maybe the surprise of the Crying Game) and the best soundtrack I've probably ever heard ... if that makes sense. <br /> <br /> The first 30 seconds tell you a lot about being twisted. (I was surprised that someone was walking out of Brooklyn's premiere right away.) But from there, the film lives between two truly damaged people, Daphne and Buddy. <br /> <br /> They are lonely, confused and the boy is not talking about sex. Daphne brings out her most interesting stories from the transmitter, some are pretty funny (Mr. Chang), some are disturbing (Harlan's scenes with music that tells us what we are seeing now, what's happening or what Daphne really knows), and because I have a friend who used the sender, I can add, most seem quite real. You are alone is multi-layered and mostly brilliant. Okay, maybe a few minutes less talk, and I don't know we'd forget something. <br /> <br /> Then I have to see it again, knowing the end. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. <br /> <br /> (The director asked Brooklyn people about the audience to write an IMDb review because many people read them.
