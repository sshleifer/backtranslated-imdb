This amusing but inspiring game was shown by the big VIP keys, the original series of the Canadian Comedy Network (comedynetwork.ca). This exhibition is organized by four funny, handsome men who value others for their "game" (ability to take women). There are two men in every episode who go to different pick-up games. There are three different sections and the winner will appreciate VIP at the exclusive Toronto nightclub. <br /> <br /> Being a man, I find this exhibition fun. We all know that it is difficult for women to confront and, of course, men are curious when they look at them. Guys who compete in this show can even give you some tips - if you pay attention.
