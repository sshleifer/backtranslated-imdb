I was very impressed with the film led by (Luigi Bazzoni). The story was about a young woman's translator, who has suddenly lost all the memory of the last three days and has suffered cemeteries for astronauts. He can't explain how it happened to anyone. One day he receives a postcard from the island of Garma, where he visits. Strangely, people seem to know him, even though he has never been before. His dreams of astronauts a month also come back to him. with you throughout the movie. I recommend this movie to people just to see how good it is. VERY RECOMMENDED!
