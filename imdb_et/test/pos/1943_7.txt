I was turning over the channels and I had to stop and laugh when I found this movie. At the beginning of the 80s, it was so obviously teenagers, and I called my mother a "shark, turn to such and such, the boy looks completely out if his father is a child". <br /> <br /> Um. Yes, yes. It turns out that this movie is about my father and his friends. <br /> <br /> Even without loosening my father's childhood, I'd say this movie! <br /> <br /> It is just ..... strange to say at least, apathy is entered for teenagers even at this time. It is a good "human interest" and shows some strange aspects of the psyche.
