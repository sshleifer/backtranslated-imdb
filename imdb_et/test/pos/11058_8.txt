This was my first film by Gaspar Noe, which I looked at and I must say that I was shocked. I don't mind at all, but it's not even gore, it's a real fatigue. For some, it may be impossible to see a couple of scenes and I really mean disgusting. Leaving aside these aspects, the main ideas and dialogues outlined here are quite brilliant. If you are strongly opposed to bringing a new life into the world and the way it is given, you cannot stop and think about it. The actors did their job well, representing a small number of people who were sick at the bottom of the community. The film is full of metaphors, but I'll let you figure them out. Don't look at it if you want a lite, a relaxing time. I recommend this movie to all those who want to think something or just look at something that is in your middle cinema.
