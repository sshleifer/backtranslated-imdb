Very good movie. Very good documentary. <br /> <br /> It is very good to see that these pest detectives have been humiliated and learned as large, narcissistic, heartless pigs, raised by one of the eye-parents, the community, and the environment, are <br /> > I'll put my cover on Pat McGuinness. Can we get this decent man in any 911 commission or investigation? We need his integrity, resilience, intelligence, clarity and spirit in the fight against world politics and big business reflection. <br /> <br /> All the animals come out at night - whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dentists, junkies, sick, venous. One day, the real rain will come and wash all the scum from the streets. Pat McGuinness should be the first drop of this real rain. The people who control this land are animals. They have to be drowned. <br /> <br /> I'm just shocked. Accommodation is a scary business. Hateful intimidation and looting are detective, murdered on Sunday morning. In Pat McGuinness's burning traffic light, they see terribly caught, terribly guilty and ready for a fair and terrible drowning. <br /> <br /> It is exceptionally satisfying in a world where players play a rotten game, look for justice and see all the narcissistic rogues that are drowned like pathetic human rats. <br /> <br /> How do you feel about rail, terrible, snaky fingers? How does your accusation seem to be your accusation, your racked confession, your cracked detective work to know what it really was? How does it look? I hope it spins like a knife that you miserable with one eye.
