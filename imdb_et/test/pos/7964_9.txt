Hooray for Korean Cinema! Last year I saw "Chungyang" and "Somewhere Hide", now I arrive at the debut "Christmas in August" by director Hur Jin-ho. The diversity of themes and level of achievement speaks very much of a mature national cinema to discover. The main themes of this film are death and love. An avid and thoughtful way Jung Won (Han Suk-kyu) solves his impending death and sublimation of his desires for Darim (Shim Eun-Ha) for true love. I was deeply convinced by careful management of his behavior and emotions, protecting Darim from unnecessary pain without being rejected. <br /> <br /> The success of this type of film is based on the skills of the participants. Han and Shim excel, both quite expressive but naturalistic. Several secondary characters, Jung Won relatives, friends and customers, have quickly created to enrich the story without affecting its main focus. LIVE is loved, but everything has to go through. Pain is reduced. Life goes on.
