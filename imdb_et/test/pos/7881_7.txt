Joe is a film about the dark side of the 1960s in America, and Susan Sarandon had a nice chest. This movie frightened me as much as I saw in the theater that I never liked Peter Boyle in front of Young Frankenstein and was still quite campfire even after this comedy. Looking back at today's experience, this film seems once again to be direct, and up to half of the electoral approval of John McCain's "Joe Plumber" approval and their fear of choosing a black man as US president in the coming weeks. Black Prez would be a nigger sweet revenge, but it must be brought to many senses, if not to the streets, this time to Joe's enthusiasts. So, Joe's spirit in the film is the uprising Joe's plumber's campaign! Still, I love to be American and be scared so and knowing that they show what ironically Gregory Peck said our civilized law is: "a living, breathing reality!" God help us.
