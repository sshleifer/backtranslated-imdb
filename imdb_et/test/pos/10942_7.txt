The combination of vampires and martial arts is a bit confusing and the fact that their voices are duplicated is almost bad, but the premise is involved, the scenes are fast and flashy, and the movie is often quite fun. It's a shame that the story is such a wreck. There are a couple of places where I had no idea what just happened, it was almost the same as five minutes had just been cut out, and you were suddenly on the next scene without knowing how you got there. The film is poor in explaining things, and some things don't make much sense, but the film moves lightly so its shortcomings hardly register. Not in any way a great movie, but definitely fun.
