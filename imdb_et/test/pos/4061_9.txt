Father (78) and I (46) both were watching the flick today. For a man who is particularly well-known for his roles, the De Niro heckuva is a comic artist. Of course, it helps to play against your past movie images. Think of one of these roles, 15 minutes, as a policeman who had to deal with mass media interference, and you have an interesting set of comparison / contrast competitions. <br /> <br /> Murphy plays another character of his own, Axel Foley. Shatner plays himself, a parallel world himself, who is well-known for TJ HOOKER and not STAR TREK, burlesque. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see how the film comments on the reality of the police work and its contradictions. fictional colleagues on television and in the movie. Shatner lectures sliding over the car cover; De Niro points out that the hulls scratch the bonnet finish. Ironically, as the film progresses, De Niro's character begins to deal with the reality of the illusions of reality in the real world where he works. <br /> <br /> Film inspires sources so you could comment on this is a derivative. Well, what? Satyr must have his own humor to exist. In addition, the film has original originality. For example, I am firmly convinced that the method of killing dead people has never been done before. <br /> <br /> One of the vengeance of the weapons involved - wouldn't these weapons have any kind of setback? To penetrate the steel, these balls had to pass through inertia. And any ball's highest inertia level is at the moment of burning. So, shooting those tank-killer balls should have let the shooters back to their butts. Oh, what the hell ... it's satire. Perhaps the lack of a weapon rebound itself is the satire of the B-F weapons, which is so accidentally used in thrillers. <br /> <br />
