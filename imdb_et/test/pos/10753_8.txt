This film hit me by surprise. For years I have avoided many of Harold Lloyd's sound images (as well as Keaton's sound) because they have a generally worthy reputation because he is a silent film because the basic formula is lost. But when I saw this movie, I was pleasantly surprised that it really liked it ... when I accepted it, it wasn't a "Harold Lloyd" movie (despite being starring at it). This is because although this is not the style of its previous films, it is very original and Lloyd has not played a very different kind of character. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, old films are almost completely lost here. Lloyd doesn't do old familiar stunt work, romance is quite different from her early romances and the plot is just weird! Instead of the usual roles, he is the son of a Chinese missionary who returns to America for the first time after a little boy. That's why, although he looks like an American (except for his white suit and explorer helmet), he thinks and acts much like someone in China. In many ways, he is very naive in America and is among the innocent among the wolves. Early he meets a man who is a local party leader. This boss produces a candidate who has lost the Mayor's competition from the LOW - because he has bought and paid a corrupt mayor to produce a "symbolic" candidate who has no chance of winning. Well, the old geezer they traditionally ran to the office died and he decides to launch naive Lloyd - he has not won the prayer! Well, unthinkable happens and Lloyd wins !!! This and Lloyd's decision to clean up the city greatly disturb the old political machine and they do not stop honestly to destroy Lloyd. Just as Lloyd seems to have been accused of being accused of corruption in a prison, he creates a 100% impossible and very illegal scheme signed confession scheme. Nonetheless, it is incredibly funny and a great ending. So, my advice is at the end, just stop disbelief and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Important Note: This movie is definitely not politically correct. The word "Chink" is used repeatedly. I found it offensive, but given the times, I ignored it as you should. However, if you are someone who cannot and does not want to be angry, I suggest you ever watch movies - as you are offended again and again.
