My family (two 40-fold, 8-year-old, and my 71-year-old mother) saw it on April 29 in a hidden preview. We all enjoyed the movie a lot. The story was good and knowing that it was based on real events made it much more enjoyable. Luke Wilson had a vision to look like Tim Blake Nelson. And seeing Neil Flynn playing something other than "the average cleaner from Scrubs" was great. The children of the film did well and I am sure they all turn to a demographic at a heart-level level. Visuals were just cute and Jimmy Buffet music was added to the "Florida feeling". OK, maybe the story was a bit too clean and well packed for some adults, but hey, who cares? I can't compare it to the book, I hadn't heard it honestly until the movie came out. <br /> <br /> It was just a NICE movie and had a good message. Simple and simple.
