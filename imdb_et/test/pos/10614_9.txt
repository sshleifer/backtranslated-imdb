I saw this movie over 20 years ago and remember how much I loved it. it really touched me and I enjoyed the work of the cowboy in it. highly recommended: atmosphere and touching. <br /> <br /> I mean this movie from time to time and I'm disappointed that I haven't enjoyed so much revival as many classic films. did not know that I was looking for it today to win the academic prize for the best original story for Ben Hecht and Charles Macarthur. <br /> <br /> In principle, this nasty character who destroys another career and is cursed is because it is. he dies but is allowed to redeem if he can convince him to tear. a large number of movies show him this goal. well written and cute. I had shown him for his games, so I was surprised to see him in this role on television late one night in New York. You need to see if you ever have a chance.
