This DVD usually sells for about $ 20. I wouldn't pay that much for a DVD if I knew what I got, but no matter how good it is. It shows Knot in all its glory, with the footage of these concerts ... playing Surfacing, Wait and Bleed and Scissors among other stories, including the music video "Spit it Out", which was probably banned from MTV. <br /> Slipknot, for those who don't know, is basically a tired of the symphony: nine masked men who show on the stage general chaos, machine guns, worship guitar and vowel that strikes your face and leaves your face behind more. For those who have never seen Slipknot before, I can't recommend enough DVDs ... probably from eBay or Amazon to get a better deal. <br /> <br /> A short, though well-made knot. <br /> <br /> Seven out of ten.
