I saw this movie in preview today and it was fantastic. This shows well what the average high school student is going through. <br /> <br /> I left the movie stunning and sad and thankfully for the film's ability to raise these issues (bullying, rape, suicide and depression). <br /> <This is a fantastic Aussie movie. <br /> <br /> Look at it. <br /> <br /> Support it. <br /> <br /> Learn from it.
