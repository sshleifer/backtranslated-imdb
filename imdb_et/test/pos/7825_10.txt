It's typical for people who complain about something if they don't have anything about it ... So it's about a gay man who falls straight women. First ... It's a real story, so you can't say it's not plausible. Personally, I think it was the best love story I've ever seen. And I'm very prof. I think it shows that true love is a personality, not just an appearance and a sex. And it has nothing to do with everyone who is gay, straight or bi, unlike many other shows. Maybe we in Europe take it more cus most TV here is a little deeper and makes you think more than American TV ... Plus we are not afraid when it comes to showing things. <br /> <br /> If you want something funny with one of England's best (Lesley Sharp) and you want to see a decent, true love story without too much juice. I know I love it
