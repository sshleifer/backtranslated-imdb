In "Hoot", Mullet Fingers is in sabotage to stop pancakes. The problem is that the builders start again and have to take more drastic measures. When confronted with dogs, he scares them with snakes, not before biting the dog and going to the hospital. <br /> <br /> Roy at bedtime is asking his father who is working with the Department of Justice about how he is dealing with fraud. His father says it involves tedious steps when looking at the paper, because sooner or later they will all slip. You see this with Enron and WorldCom. Roy looks at the documents related to the pancake house and finds that the document has been suppressed (he has to break into the trailer of the company) so that if the police see it, he is right on his side. Unlike when he left the police. <br /> <br /> As you have already mentioned, Roy is not always law-abiding, and when a company man kills owls (illegally), Mullet Fingers takes direct action. He can't wait for the law (Mullet Fingers is hiding). The film does not suggest that the system should work.
