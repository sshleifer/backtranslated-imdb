Lecture about the life of the tortured magician Ray Charles. His impulses on the piano created a fire music and his nostalgic voice created exciting and cool stories. Every barrier Ray encountered never stopped him and found his way across the conflict. A real lesson. A large team of producers contributes to the creation of the era and armed with great costumes, hairs and settings, Ray follows the faith, believing it is real, direct filming! Rigid music freezes and clever audio editing for the audience. But the most important part of the movie is Jamie Foxx. His action is a very great, most diamond-polished action ever seen. He lives his role. He's a beam of light.
