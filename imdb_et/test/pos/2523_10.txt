Trust an excellent and accurate Junagadh75 review! This film is convincing and moves the hardest, most brutally beautiful in the film house. File UNFORGETTABLE STRONG MEAT. OR MOVIES COVERED. Pixote gets into your nervous system and raises you despite the screen pain. Here is an independent list of movies that did the same thing for me, ie "engaged, destroyed, transformed, inspired, resonated ... this category goes beyond the ten list of nerdy films that are looking for the perfection of the film." Wiseblood, "The Wages of Fear" "Saint Jack" "Funny Bones" "Blue".
