SEA INSIDE (2004) **** Javier Bardem, Belen Rueda, Lola Duen, Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo, Joan Dalmau, Alberto Jimenez, Tamar Novas, Francesc Garrido, Jose Maria Pou, Alberto Amarilla, Nicolas Fernandez Luna. : Alejandro Amenabar) <br /> <br /> An inspiring story of living death; Bardem is an excellent <br /> <br /> Spanish quadriplegic real life calculation by Ramon Sampedro and his request to fulfill the euthanasia of death cannot be a source of inspiration, but this film is just that. <br /> <br /> Sampedro (played great by Bardem) was a virgin, energetic young man when he lost his limb function as a result of a tragic dive crash (which was a terrible setback with a visceral blow) and paralyzed for about thirty years, while his loving family took care of every need. Though his ability to move was not, his mind was very active and skilled to be an inventor, poet, author, and artist who kept his mind busy until he could no longer think he was living longer in his haunted condition. <br /> Enter the beautiful but also the afflicted, afflicted lawyer Julia (Essential Rueda, who fits Bardem nicely as if they were really soul mates) hired to see Sampedro's final desire to end her life and turn into marriage when she starts open it up like no one ever did. Not too long ago, Julia is going to look into her past reward by discovering a lot of hidden family letters. When Julia comes up against Ramon, she doesn't want to talk to her first, but she finally agrees with her that it might help her case and the project turns to making a book? memoir / biography of free style poetry and prose. <br /> <br /> Film is a heartbreaking story of human spirit and how love finally triumphs over heartbeat in many forms, including Ramon, is unlikely the love it shares with a single stranger named Rosa (Duenas) who sees her on television one day, inspiring her to her bike on her farms in Spain to get to know her and possibly change her thoughts about ending her life. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker Amenabar, who wrote an enchanting scenario with Mateo Gil, promises to mix fantasy when Ramon sees himself magically as he leaves his bed and into the potential seas of bucolic landscapes, where he suffered so many years of cruel twists of destiny, which has imprisoned him for three decades. The film is not a complete downturn that has a clever and sometimes humorous tone that does not dilute the effect of the final act. I also worked on the remarkable make-up of James and Jo Allen, working tremendously on the viable aging of Bardem to give them the Acadamy Award. <br /> <br /> Bardem and Rueda deserve Oscar nominations as two people who have so much in common and despite the fact that Rueda Julia is married to a loving, dedicated husband, that a few people who prepared for each other are absolutely impossible for them was never together. It's just one of the cruelties that really rings, but it's not a definition of the film as a whole; it is imperative and one year's best.
