In & Out is a simple assumption of comedy. It succeeds to be funny and entertaining. <br /> <br /> In this movie, comedy ranges from ridiculous to subtle, physical comedy that exists alongside dry humor. Kevin Kline is expected to be in an excellent form in this film, and besides Tom Sellec, he is not playing the leading human type of his "square jaw". Mr Selleck plays his humor well and shows a nice comedy timing. The cast film makes this movie a success. <br /> <br /> Not all movies with homosexual themes are intended to promote any kind of sinful, hidden Hollywood liberal action plan. part of this film makes the viewer meaningless, it was a byproduct of a well-functioning work called by professionals. I often found a language-in-cheek, laughing at the right moments. Solid "B"
