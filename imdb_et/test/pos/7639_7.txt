I gave this movie to 7 out of 10. I think the general reluctance of this film is because people don't really know the plot. If you think this line is really the point of the movie, it will never give you an explanation of the explanation. It is true that the special effects are sub-par and they seem half-low, but I think the plot's originality keeps you drawn. People say the vampire genre is superfluous and clich√©, but Bled, which you don't have with your usual vampire. Its a dream / alternating reality story with a vampire / eternal life. I love it. The only thing that kept me from giving a higher rating was the lack of special effects and I personally dislike movies where most people have accents. But as I said before, if you really get a plot, it's not a bad film.
