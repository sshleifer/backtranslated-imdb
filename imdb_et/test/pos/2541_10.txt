Three of the things Spalding Gray has to say is: he certainly marched his "drummer" beating. he had never lost words; and apparently he felt that those who watch and listen to him would be interested in all aspects of his life, experiences and thoughts - no matter how trivial at times. <br /> <br /> Most of us are not quite as far away from the wall as he was. Most of us are not so interested to share the least with others - even on one-on-one or on small groups, let alone on stage. <br /> <br /> But it doesn't make it less interesting to watch and listen to this erudite, an unusual man, and after seeing one of his performances, reflection, we find that many of his words are probably more relevant to our own lives and thoughts when we can think for the first time <br /> <br /> He was allowed to be a "New York / avant-garde" personality type and arguably a bit "strange." (There are those who say that "New York" and "strange" was unnecessarily It is redundant.) <br /> <br /> I give him "10" as the genre of his genre.
