I like this movie. I can be biased because I love dolphins. But my 3 and 4 a. old is sitting and watching the whole movie .... It is not an Oscar material, but definitely fun. Dolphin cinematography is well done with ocean landscapes and sunsets. My favorite scene is when the Flipper "slips" in the water of a pop pot that hits Sandy. It's a funny funny moment that laughs at me anytime. On the other hand, teasing boatman criminals (forget your name) is a bit difficult to take. And the shark scene is far from reality. Question: Do dolphins really make this noise? Or is there serious duplication here? The bottom line: my kids like it and it keeps recycling through the VCR.
