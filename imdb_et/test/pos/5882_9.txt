Although the wonderful soda counter in the local pharmacy no longer exists and the clothes are definitely the l946 immediate <br /> <br /> post-war vintage, and good and evil are easy to understand, and <br /> <br /> these old planes are really dated, this movie is never dated. Post-war human adjustments and problems, beautiful <br /> <br /> love stories, wonderful action (especially Harold Russell and <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews) is as it was today in 2002, as they were 1946 <br /> <br /> I was one of those young women who welcomed our wonderful <br /> <br /> veterans who got home from World War II. Like many, my memories of war years and homecomings are just as fresh as they are <br /> <br /> yesterday - this movie is very important for our time.
