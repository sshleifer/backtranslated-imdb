Another long line of 'no' movies made in the late 1970s and early 80s is much more. This movie is undervalued with a low budget schlocker with twists. It has a witty and bizarre sound that is characteristic of horror films of the time period, but it is a surprisingly talented performer of actors / actors who make this film. A young nurse arrives at Dr Stephens' progressive mental hospital immediately after some of her patients have been murdered and not everything she seems to be. It looks like dr. Masters, a rather ambitious female doctor, has taken over his tasks and started implementing his ideas. Each patient takes on a unique personality and has their own personal qualities and mistakes that make for very fun interactions. There is a nymphomania, a crazy old crown, a woman with an unhealthy obsession with babies, and a man who has returned, among other things, to her childhood. There is also a strange little twist to this strange story, which later finds that a young sister is caught inside the shelter when patients run loose and bodies gather. If you are a cheap fan of the 70s, this is your movie!
