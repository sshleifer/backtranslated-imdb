I was a kid when I saw this series, a little bit after Buck Rogers, both of the same Buster Crabbe characters, and I have to admit that these movies have always been part of the best entertainment I've ever had. The fight against Emperor Ming was one thing, but I was interested to know more about the ultimate destiny of the Flash Love Triangle with Dale and Aura. Barin came and persuaded Aura to forget Flash, a very innocent ending for her sight. The series has no offensive and really violent scenes and can be viewed by all audiences. The other thing is that I learned to swim in the water, watching Crabbe doing it in the fight against the occupants. The music was also nice, although it was used earlier in Boris Karloff's Frankenstein movie. It would be nice if the DVDs in this series were equipped with subtitles in Spanish (not yet available).
