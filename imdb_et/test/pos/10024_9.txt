While I can't tell if Larry Hama has ever seen an old cartoon, I think writing these cartoons, file cards, and some cartoons would be something. <br /> <br /> An old comic for fans, this is quite the same, except for some new characters - and the crazy Cobra commander. <br /> <br /> We also have all the old favorites but personal Please note that one thing that always upsets me was "Duke's responsible" stuff, if there are many other * officers . <br /> <br /> Battle sequences are similar to the old series; The main trick seems to be CGI. In general, it's pretty good, if not slightly up.
