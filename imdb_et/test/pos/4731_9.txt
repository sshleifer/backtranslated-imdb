Many people remember the Waco standoff a long time ago. Most people who are probably rooted in their thoughts are "cult leader" David Koresh and compound images that burn to the ground after a long standoff. Many people believe that Koresh was a madman who thought he was God. He was accused of a child's moorest and was recognized for the disintegration and death of his followers. In addition, many people feel a massive suicide when the FBI invaded the center of Mount Carmel and the burner of the building. Most people feel that the cult was guilty of not accepting reasonable terms with the FBI. Most people feel that Koresh was the brainwash of the cult and followed all that he said. Nothing can go further than the truth, because the strong evidence after the nightmare ended and this one-on-one documentary proves that much! <br /> <br /> This documentary is one of the most balanced studies in the situation. It is much more comprehensive and very detailed than what most people in the mainstream media have received. For many people, the documentary shows that the highest levels of ATF, FBI and the United States were those who were unfair, cruel and deceptive, not David Koresh and his followers. What Korseh and Davidian did was simply defending their constitutional rights, and the higher authorities violated these rights and raped them completely. AFT had no reason to rush the compound; it was an AFT who first shot down and fired helicopters from unarmed men, women and children! Even more shocking is the FBI's action when they entered Mount Carmel. Follow it yourself and you develop and look at the US government. There are infrared recordings that clearly show that the FBI put men, women, and children on the burning compound with machines. It boils your blood. It really makes you angry. This makes you think about what people are leading this country. Finally, it makes you wonder what every night's news is about, the whole truth and not just the truth. This video is scary and I recommend finding it very well. You don't have to buy this documentary; it can be viewed for free from Google Video!
