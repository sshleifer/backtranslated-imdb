It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is just talking about. Or maybe not: Herzog goes to the Sahara desert and nearby villages to film different landscapes and locals. But it's just the broadest stroke. It's just that you're either yourself or not. He gets into the world around him completely without a story that relates only to certain aspects of written poetry, because his camera (photographing a supposedly neglected film picture) travels like a clean travel book. You can even jump into this simple conclusion, because he puts these huge landscapes up, then moves to a tougher civilized culture (though not a real "normal" culture), and to a level of points that are too abstract to convey here properly. Sometimes it takes time to "create" the purity of a section, but the purity of how parts are handled by nature or broken machines. Soon there will be a narration, Popol's Witch's readings (by the way, for most of his films), with the gradual passing of actually stylized frames, to a completely different level. It's a hybrid movie, and it's not easy, but the rewards are the best that is closest to Herzog's idea of ​​"ecstatic truth", the pictures he's been doing throughout his career. <br /> <br /> One wonders whether the images will end when the second part, Paradise, directs the spoken words or vice versa. You are moving your eyes with photos and pans, and the wording is close to religious writing, but there are also musical choices, how to make a strange spare song and low-key classic music with Leonard Cohen and blind beliefs. I think both sides are congratulating you, and that's something that * seems like * it shouldn't work. Perhaps this is the pull, the possibilities that have been made of unspoiled wastes and the smallest parts of any civilized life (in this case, witchcraft) that make it so exciting. If only cinematography is an admiration that is too indescribable to a casual fan of photography, because it is a form of technology and some tougher pictures of any Herzog film. There are pans, there are long shots, there are buses in towns, there are buses ten miles away that only a couple of Mirage shines, there is a full fire and a man who has a reptile and talks about the radar (a truly classic gonzo comedy ), there are people who are still fake, and a man and a woman who plays naughty music. But most importantly, it seems at least natural to me as to the personal nature of the approach. <br /> <br /> I am sure Herzog only knows why he did this movie, unlike the simple "how"; he had already filmed small dwarfs, and he ended up with many dangers to end it. Nonetheless, this makes Fata Morgana such an amazing game - it turns to one side, depending on what someone is actually bringing it to. This is certainly regrettable, but it is a temptation to see it very quickly so that all ideas and realities experience strange strange vibes (yes, here is the word "vibes"). This is one of the truly outstanding "feature films" ever made.
