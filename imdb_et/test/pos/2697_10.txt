For many years I have not seen a better comedy than the Queen. I appreciate it one of the best. I have just returned to Ireland from Arizona for an American Airlines flight and randomly showed several episodes. I laughed at my head and later asked stewards to play again and they did. Thank you AA. The whole team is excellent and especially Kevin James, Leah Remin and Gerry Stiller, but all the painful actions are great. I love everyone cast, they are so funny. The Queen of the Queen is the hard edge that I love and is rarely seen in today's television comedy. Both Leah and Kevin play each other so well that every situation is plausible and fun. I just bought this season for season 2, when I was this week, and I plan to buy the next set next time in the US. My 20-year-old son loves this example and its glory is that he has the ability to reach different generations. I would like to thank everyone who has been involved with this amazing show - it is so welcome to see a TV show that I think is bad in the TV show era, generally these days, except for Seinfeld and like it ... Thanks for the great show.
