Anyone who correctly identifies opening images as the death of God himself without reading the final credit definitely deserves a free ticket to the Transylvanian holiday home. I imagine that this is a favorite movie "Twin Peaks" in a dark place on film night when there was there. I think the better title could have been: "How fun are you with someone who has almost died in the woods with a Neolithic?" The answer, it seems, is quite a few. So, despite the foolish "killing of God", uber-pretentiousness (the appropriate phrase from the previous letter), the more clearly "Alistair Crowley - Hi, I'm a beast, deal with it!" as a Christian cosmology (I cannot believe that some other viewer was thick in this judeo-Christian Bible) ... despite being a bold and important work that most people should not see. I am so impressed that it has been done at all.
