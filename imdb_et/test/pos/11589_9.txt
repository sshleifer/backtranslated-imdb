In Spain, the former sailor Ramón Sampedro (Javier Bardem) has been twenty-eight years old and is fighting in court for his right to practice euthanasia through a community that protects freedom of choice and is led by his friend Géne (Clara Segura). Ramón is introduced to a lawyer who protects his cause, Julia (Belén Rueda), who has a degenerative deadly disease; meets Rosa (Lola Dueñas), a lonely worker who has been abused by men. Their relationship changes the life and view of Rosa and Julia. <br /> <br /> Chilean Alejandro Amenábar is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary directors. The filmography published in Brazil consists of an excellent and original film "Abre Los Ojos", "Tesis", "The Others" and "Mar Adentro". Javier Bardem is probably now Spain's best actor. Their association created this very political issue of the sensitive drama, the right to make euthanasia. This drama is never hungry or depressive because the scenario uses humor as a relief valve in the most dramatic situations. Cast productions are perfect, have a character and protect different views on this unpleasant theme. Dialogues and lines are very strong and intelligent. In the IMDb schedule, I noted that this film is based on the real story of Ramón Sampedro. Unfortunately, this movie and DVD do not provide this important information. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Mar Adentro" ("Sea Inside")
