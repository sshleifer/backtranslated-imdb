For me, this is one of those movies I saw on the "Z" channel in Los Angeles when it was in use. And that was another of the movies I saw when I was young ... and I found out that there was a world ... one that I didn't want to receive. <br /> <br /> Going to Los Angeles and watching an international movie became a joy to me and today, no programming of the premiere channel has shown the "Z" channel in international movies. The three international films that stuck with my young head were "Spetters", "Beau Family" and of course "Pixote". <br /> <br /> It was the most shocking and sad thing I ever saw in my life. It was also one of the first films that helped me understand that there are differences in the cinema: entertainment and information. Let me be honest ... I grew up in a small town on the east coast, I had no idea that such - so much - was there. All I knew about South America was brilliant Brazillian vacation brochures and Columbia had a lot of drug trafficking. <br /> <br /> Then comes the movie like Pixote. Sad. Annoying. Cancellation. Scary. You look: kids. Those in need of shelter, love, understanding, and all, have the opportunity to survive day by day through homes such as drugs, sex, robbery, theft, streets and sadistic groups, and so on. Their survival is hard to see with other street children. , prostitutes, etc., and you will wonder how such things can be allowed in such a world. <br /> <br /> Pixote is not an entertaining film, it is an information film. It shows shocking and disturbing images - but it shows the lives of their everyday street children.
