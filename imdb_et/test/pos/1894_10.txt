I find this film a meretricious, original, lethargic, and skillfully bad choice for entertainment in celluloid. But I admire the courage to throw the script, turn the camera on and fool. I find that failed performances, lighting, cinematography, sound, and any film school laws D 'Urville Martin broke down. When it comes to film directors, there are times when I want to give up everything and have a lot of fun. This movie looks like fun. When other filmmakers ask me for advice, I'll tell them I'm watching Rudy Ray Moore's movies. They always turn to embarrassment, asking why not watch Masters Woody Allen, Scorsese, Lucas, Capra? I laugh and add that you always want to know what you're not talking about in cinema.
