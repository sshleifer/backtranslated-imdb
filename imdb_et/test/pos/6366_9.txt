I would agree with the comments already posted on this site by the previous rater. <br /> <br /> For the first time, I stumbled over this film in the 1980s when I worked in a psychiatric hospital. Unfortunately, many psychiatric barbers come home. I especially liked the end of a psychiatrist talking to the hospital at Grodin's door. Trust me, its quite accurate. <br /> <br /> Of course, most psychiatric hospitals do not have doors locked and there are not many straight lines these days, and all hospitals have to license "upholstered space". br /> <br /> But a wonderfully underrated movie and certainly what is quite fun. <br /> <br /> Jeff
