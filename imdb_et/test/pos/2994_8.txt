First love. Teen love. We've all experienced it, even if it wasn't as sweet as sharing the main characters. "Friends" could be considered a classic "Blue Lagoon" adaptation originally created in 1949 and its remake since 1980 (most popular with Brooke Shields) and in 1999 (young Milla Jovovich). Though "Blue Lagoon" puts two young lovers in the desert, without touching civilization, "Friends" are going in the opposite direction, and it is definitely a lot more true and harder with a modern audience. Paul and Michelle, who, for various reasons, turn their backs on the family and the adult world to live with a small house in southern France. Having only one another and the innocence of their childhood, their friendship slowly develops much more than they themselves are fighting against the sweet events of their aging. This film is still controversial to date, as the actors are teenagers and they will definitely watch the periods mentioned in the film (15 and 14 1/2). The film contains no clues about child affliction, nudity, teenage sex, and teenage pregnancy. But the real contradiction is not the subject, but the fact that Paul's and Michelle's love is presented as a natural and healthy relationship. Although it worked in good-hearted lovers at some other time and in the desert island, they have some very serious moral issues in a modern environment. Laws that prohibit sex between minors are valid in almost all countries and the lack of sexual education for teenagers is considered to be one of the causes of an increase in unwanted teenage pregnancies and abortions. Is such a film a child pornography or face, to make us face our hypocrisy, in relation to a modern society that does not correspond to teenage parents and laws that are clearly contrary to human nature and hormonal development, but which are necessary to prevent child abuse? Is hormonal development parallel to emotional growth? These are not easy questions and most of us feel uncomfortable. As an artistic work, this film is really forgotten and a tough gem. The script is progressing with extreme simplicity, though somewhat sapphire, but never pulls any bumps to present your message, although it is somewhat slow today. Photography is beautiful and has very beautiful scenes. The behavior of the two main characters in some scenes varies very terribly and in others is surprisingly innocent and trustworthy. Pop music, unlike most of today's productions, is used tastefully and sometimes words speak the thoughts of the main characters. Generally, this is a delightful piece, even if moral values ​​are not in line with your own.
