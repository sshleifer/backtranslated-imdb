It was a pleasant musical about creating the Moulin Rouge dance halls. It reminds me in many ways of the 40's and 50's Hollywood music because it has many clich√©s that lead to the inevitable conclusion ("do STILL exhibits continue?"). Although this is not new, of course, it was enjoyable and well done. The musical numbers at the end are spiritual and beautiful. In many cases, it reminds me of THE GREAT ZIEGFELD. In real life, Ziegfeld was quite a player, but it was disinfected on American film. But FRANCH CANCAN has characters that are fully functional libido - but nothing really has been shown so the movie is okay for the kids. <br /> <br /> Nothing is new, but well done.
