Excellent Greta Garbo is in this first form, her first chat. He gets fine support from other pain that includes Charles Bickford as a tough sailor who grabs his heart. Mrs Garbo is doing an excellent job as she usually takes the captain of a returning seaman after fifteen years. This is also the great actor Marie Dressler. Great movie!
