I recently saw the House of Wax and I have to say that I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> It has been one of the best Horror / Thriller movies in recent years, if not one of the best and most interesting. <Br /> <br /> I've heard a lot of people about developing a slow start and character that takes 45 minutes to open the movie. <br /> <br /> Even if the movie is divided directly into deaths, viewers and critics would have criticized the film for not having the proper signs they don't care less about. <br /> <br /> Also in character development, it thought it worked amazingly well. Having your own answer and others (reading posts off the bulletin board), many people who wanted to live in the characters ended up, one of which I have noticed is that many people say they are Paige Edwards (Paris Hilton). having regard to Warner. Bros has marketed his death, his surprise turns around that many audiences rejoiced to survive. <br /> <br /> Chase / death scenes, they were some of the most inventive and tense. I've seen for a while and enjoyed everyone very much. <br /> <br /> The action was absolutely good, I could not hurt any of them, especially Paris Hilton, I thought he was very decent and I was hoping to get him more than just a 120 minute movie of a 25 minute screen at the time, but his chase has done it and believe me when I say that Paris can act in fear (see where he hides the car from Vincent and he walks along .... the appearance of a face blade is very real). <br /> <br /> In general, I will give the House of Wax maximum letters for entertainment value and even gore ...... I just want the criticism that during the marketing of the film, they would not reveal the list of deaths and who dies lives like the Ld is ten times better than wondering if the pursued character will live or die and terrible death. <br /> <br /> You can't wait for a DVD, but watch it in the cinema if you can, it's not in your front, but if you're waiting for a DVD, watch the movie in the dark without interruption, trust me you do not have to be disappointed.
