Now, I'm a bit biased because I'm a big late night television fan. I've been Jay Leno's loyal fan for about 6 or 7 years and I think he's one of the most funny, talented comedians. And David Letterman is also a comedian hell, although I only look at his show (unless Jay repeats) during the ads or if he has a better guest than Jay at the show. Daniel Roebuck and John Michael Higgins are both fine actors and they were very much like Jay and Dave, but did they disappear? No. Roebuck paints Jay's voice and expression quietly with a smile at the high pitch, hearing Marlon Brando castrated. Higgins counts David's facial expressions (such as his trademark), but he doesn't pound Dave's voice. Those who are not big fans of the late-night TV can be much less biased. There are a couple of comedies who can make Jay dead. Why couldn't they choose some of them? And the same goes for Dave. I would like them to have Norm McDonald's part. The norm does not see Dave-like hell, but it made SNL a great embodiment. "Hey ... you got a gum?" It was so fun! <br /> <br /> But I learned a lot about late night wars, which I knew very little at first. I have never watched the "The Tonight Show" before Jay Leno was the host, so I didn't know what the fight was finally to replace Johnny Carson and the innumerable talks that finally made Dave move to CBS. I knew very little about what happened behind the scenes and found the film very light. And in Kathy Bates, "The Tonight Show" is a challenge for the former executive executor. He steals the film basically. My score: 7 (out of 10) <br /> <br />
