One night in McCool's is one of those films that starts with a lot of promises, but when the movie goes on, it becomes stupid and loses that time. Liv Tyler plays a manipulative woman who tries to get her body to every person she meets, all that belong to her spell. There are some funny moments in this, but they get less and less when the movie gets worse comedy. Michael Douglas, who plays an assassin, is as good as Liv Tyler, though he looks like he was a little weighted from armaggedon. It's ok, but it's memorable just for the scene where Liv Tyler washes his car, you know what I mean when you see it as a boy! Shwing !!!!! 7 out of 10 (just).
