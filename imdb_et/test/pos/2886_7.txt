This is a great concert that included the best songs of the band's 30-year career. Lee, Lifeson and Peart were animated and fun on the stage and gave an excellent show. That said, I think the sound recording was in the mixing console and / or in the mixing process. But this is not the boys' fault. They even pointed out that the show was the last minute so the band and their team probably did their best. They should not have exhibited the exhibition for public consumption. That sounds like a distant sound, and Geddy's bass has good harmonic content, but not at all! They should have held this concert and waited for a better time. Buy this DVD only if you're a hardcore Rushian. There is no quality in the audio department.
