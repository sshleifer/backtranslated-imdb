It's really an Australian cult class. If you are one of the lucky ones who have seen it - then you are very happy. It has been released in most countries, but not for any reason in Australia. I have a copy of a DVD in the UK. Not a big deal, but I bought it after seeing it at the film festival. Leadership is on the ground and performances rock! It's a scary film of a dark film, but it's often very funny in some parts. I invite you to watch this movie, with coolness that is not seen by 99% of the typical Aussie price. The scenario is very well designed and sends you to a journey where you know it will end badly, but until the last ten minutes you just can't choose badly. Great work of four leadership, especially Lachy Hulm. <br /> <br /> When everything is said and done: great work on the screen!
