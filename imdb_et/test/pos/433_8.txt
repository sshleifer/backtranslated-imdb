Like the long-standing admirer of the 2001 film "Moulin Rouge" and the newest admirer of Jean Renoir, I knew I would inevitably look at his "French Cancani" sooner or later. The film talks about the fictional story of opening a nightclub in Moulin Rouge. Impresario Danglard (Jean Gabin) tries to turn the Montmartre washer Nini (Fran√ßoise Arnoul) into a canan star without creating his passionate lover's anger, dance Lola (Maria Felix). It's just one of several "French Cancan" triangles of love - a stereotype, these French showbizi folk are always in love. <br /> <br /> Renoir drives his typical gentle humor and attention to supportive characters. and also wrote a lyrics to a beautiful Welsh song that is prominently featured in the film. Gabin perfectly embodies an aging French playboy hero. Arnoul is a cute redhead who keeps his dance numbers, except for a couple of tricky frames, with obviously double use. <br /> <br /> "French Cancan" is considered a musical comedy, and although there is a lot of musical numbers at the nightclub stage, only one character, Casimir, breaks in the middle of the conversation. An actor who plays with him, Philippe Clay, is fun to watch - a really tall, skinny young man who sings, dances and controversizes. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with a long cananical sequence, as all characters learn to fight their problems and make art together. Dancing is much brighter and more coherent than "Moulin Rouge"; in fact, if I have one complaint about "French Cancan", the whole thing is a bit too technical. Even when Nini experiences a heartache or someone sings a melancholic song, the light is bright and smooth, the shadows do not penetrate. Yes, the result is a cheerful and warm-hearted comedy; It's just that I can't think things are never so colorful and innocent in real life.
