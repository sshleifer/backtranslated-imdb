My local PBS station, WHYY Philadelphia, recently showed "Elegant Universe". After watching for three hours, I learned that after the brain was hurt, I learned everything from wormholes, quantum mechanics and parallel realities and alternative universes. The semi-trailer branch of physics, which makes many ideas of science fiction not only possible but PROBABLE. According to the "string theory", this seems to be wormholes, alternative realities and alternating timelines are possible and can only be a matter of time until we get the knowledge they need to use them. <br /> <br /> Although this may not be the case with providing new information to someone you know, I found the exhibition very interesting and informative. It was very understandable for anyone who just introduced this topic.
