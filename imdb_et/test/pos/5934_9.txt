Shawn Michaels vs. Edge-8- It is hard to believe that Shawn Michaels is in the opening game, but for both men this is a great game, Edge, whether you like it or not, is a great speaker and Shawn Michaels is just eternal when it comes to his presentation Undertaker vs. Heidenreich. Casket Match-2 OK, after a good opening game, now what a terrible game. Undertaker has made some great races at Royal Rumble and the 1998 Royal Rumble Shawni Michael was the same type of game, but it is worse than it is. <br /> <br /> Kurt Angle vs Big Show vs. Bradshaw. Triple Threat WWE Championship-6- It's OK, I feel that all three men could give a better result, it just didn't show them in the best way. <br /> <br /> Randy Orton vs. The Triple H. World Heavyweight Championship-9-Triple H gets a clean victory, can you believe it takes the Sledgehammer out but doesn't use it. Randy Orton took great steps when he got irritated, but how he got irritated is really ridiculous. I really liked this game, the best result I've seen from HHH forever. <br /> <br /> Royal Rumble Match-7 It was a lot of fun and I usually don't hit the royal rebellion high. The winner is again very predictable, but it has had many moments that were very interesting to watch. The Flair and Guerrero segments are the fun best segments I've seen for a while. <br /> <br /> Generally, it is great for PPV and mandatory for wrestling fans.
