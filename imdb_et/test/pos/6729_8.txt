I remember seeing this child as part of the special offers of children's films from the CBBC, and recently it has happened with the copy. <br /> <br /> Twenty years after the last movie, it's not lost. <br /> <br /> This is an atmospheric story that entices Cornish folklore and adds really horrible imagery to the young mine Billy's ghost. <br /> <br /> Stylish picturesque port of Cornwall Read region uses a combination of a strong coastline and abandoned tin mines to make the movie truly credible. <br /> <br /> This CFF drama is packed a lot, which has long been lost on children's television. you should check if you can track the copy.
