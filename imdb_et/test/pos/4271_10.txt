I saw this movie with a small screening. Even though its budget was low, the creative direction and intelligence of creativity helped to make this film a precious metal. It's April 8, 1994, each character in his "mid-20th century" and continues his artistic ambition (acting, music, film, writing) in learning to commit suicide by Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain. They get inspiration from San Francisco to Seattle and take part in Cobain vigil. This is where the film really rises and serves a number of funny and emotional scenes. Highlights include visiting the grave of Jimi Hendirx, Kurt Cobain's original childhood and campfire site. Honest original work.
