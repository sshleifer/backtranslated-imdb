It must be said that Tarsem Singh, the director of The Cell, has quite easily created his first feature, which is one of the most visually stunning films in contemporary cinema. <br /> <br /> The Cell is a visceral experience rather than a film. As a thriller, it rises over most of its peers with competent editing and cooling scores that effectively deliver an exceptionally fine atmosphere. Finally, Tarsem's skill is to develop and disrupt the set design and shapes that carry the film's sense of terror. commented negatively on the cell; I will deal with some of these issues when defending the film. The plot seems to be a major concern, and although it is not revolutionary and heavily borrows from the silence of Lamb, it was never meant to be the most important aspect of the film; the plot itself is a vehicle through which Tarsem's vision - simultaneously terrible and wonderful - is introduced to the public, just as the sheep's silence is second to the exciting study of these two wires; Lecter and Starling. Although sheep's silence is clearly the ultimate film, it is irrational when it comes to condemning the cell plot and, in the same breath, praising the silence of the Lambs. <br /> <br /> My final concern is to mention "MTV style" management. I have the pain of condemning judges using innovative camera and cinematographic technologies. The camera has the potential to be much more than just an event recording tool; corners, pans, color correction, and so on, all are fully utilized in the cells to create a dream-like feeling that would not otherwise be achieved. This is indispensable for the film because the underlying assumption is visualization of the subconscious serum killer. If you just want static pictures, stay on stage and give up the cinema at all. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Cell is very fun, frightening and breathtaking at its own pace and design. Anyone who is capable of looking at the past - perhaps uninspired, but never boring - will find one of the best 2000 films.
