This is probably the most fun movie I've ever seen in my Top-5 list! I wasn't a big Robin Hood fan or Robin Hood: Prince of thieves, but this movie was very different! It created Robin Hood and was HILARIOUS! I was very pleased how well it was put together and how well it worked! In addition to home, Mrs Doubtfire and Houseguest, this was the most fun move I've ever seen! I love this song especially; "We are tights for men!" If you have a good sense of humor, love this movie!
