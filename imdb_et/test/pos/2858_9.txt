I'm not sure why I chose "Nurse Betty" to borrow from my mother. I think just because I heard a little about this movie. But I'm glad I did. "Nurse Betty" is an original and smart film with humor and a darker side. <br /> <br /> It was one of Renee's first majors before she hit it in Hollywood. I see why he is an incredible actress. The scene in which he finally realizes what has happened and is his favorite in the soap opera, you see pain, confusion, fear and embarrassment on your face. Just to let you play the movie, he plays Betty. A hairy and insecure woman standing with her abusive husband is a waitress and in love with soap operas, especially where some dear doctor, Dr Dave Revell. When it happens that she accidentally sees her husband in a separate room, her reported murders are two of the clients she was, Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock. Then he just loses his mind and leaves the city after talking to the police and says he has to find his former fianc√©, dr. Dave Revelli. So, he drives down to California to find Dr. Revell and wants to work as a nurse to work with Dave, he saw this example so many times, but he's just an awesome sister when he rescues his wife's brother. Despite the fact that everyone tells him that he is misleading, he looks at them just as crazy. When he meets an actor who plays Dave Revell, George (his real name) thinks he is just a crazy fan trying to show. She just looks at her confused and believes she and her belong together. <br /> <br /> Renee was terrible, she was so believable she lost her mind in the movie. He has come so far and wants to admit it or not, he is a divine and great actor. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman plays one of the assassins Charlie, the father of these two dads. . He is so wonderful and nailed by Betty, and when he is behind him all over the country, he almost becomes Betty to fall in love with him. He and his son Wesley have to find Betty when they find that he was in a murder scene and can give his identity. When Charlie sees Betty and finally catches her, she's in love at first, but soothes and they know they have a real connection. It was a beautifully played scene, in my opinion Morgan has given a stronger result. He's just great. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly surprising Chris Rock, son of Wesley. He's so "gun" - the one who just does the job in haste and taking care of business. I loved his comic strips at the end of the show, where he and the gang he kept in hostage with an armed point just watched the soap opera together. Classic. "Nurse Betty" is a great movie that I would like to laugh at and in a nice, honest little movie that everyone could enjoy. <br /> <br /> 9/10
