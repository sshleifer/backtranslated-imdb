I just saw this movie the other day at the Santa Fe Film Festival. I was delighted with this honesty and humor. It was the most meaningful provocative film I've seen for a long time - I can't get it for some reason. It may not be for everyone because it makes you think. I don't know if people want to think so much about the shame in the movie. Actors playing Franklins are quite resourceful. I couldn't imagine playing these complicated people with such honesty. Although I thought that a couple of supportive characters were not as good as Franklin, I can completely forgive it because it is, in my opinion, an important film. I didn't expect it so much, but when I think of it for a few days, it has turned out to be a very relevant entertainment.
