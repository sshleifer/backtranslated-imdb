Like an adult, I'm grateful to make this movie randomly when I was doing. Over time, I experienced family problems. This particular film managed to capture what I saw from the closed world. How much mutual pressure is there too much? In fact, I had to buy this movie because it reached me to the level that most movies try to reach the audience. How far can an individual go for social reception? Who is the "bad" crowd? Teenagers try to find answers to these questions, but finally ... who is the "packaging manager" if one has to be? Is it strong? Beautiful? Maybe we all seem to like it? Can it be a moral character? As far as the film is concerned, it is cast together as if it had been predetermined. I only hope that more directors and manufacturers will try to create a job that will reach us all, as this particular film reached me. I wish I could vote over ten because this particular title deserves much more.
