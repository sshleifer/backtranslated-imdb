In real life, wife and husband Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star in Creation, describing Charles Darwin's life before the publication of "Origin of Species" published in 1859, his infamous, changing world evolution and natural choice. The Darwin study created a tremendous crackdown, a schism between its believers and scientists. He had said he was going to war against God and even "kill God." The film tends towards Darwin's life with his wife and four children. Jennifer Connelly is great for her very dedicated and loving woman. The initial revealing scene when he leads the dinner table in prayer and Charles does not say that "Amen" is a prophecy about what follows, and the sharp differences between the two. He is convinced that he will forever be a devil and will fail his family if he rejects God. <br /> <br /> Darwin has broken his strong love for his wife, faith and even stronger reason. In his vision, there are beautiful moments in tracking animals, separating their behaviors and sequences from their lives, explaining the choices to their children, the first-born Annie, who is very sick of curiosity. We see that he interacts with England's first orangutan, Jenny, playing it as if it were a child who understands every appearance and action. The eldest child, Annie, later dies and Charles becomes a ghost with her death, closest to her. In my opinion, this part was too long, weird and pulled out. I didn't like triple scenes, where he seems to have lost his mind and followed by his daughter's ghost, shouting and stroking. Although Charles thinks that his wife accuses him of a deadly disease, he says very poetically: "The truth is that if I knew what I know now, I will marry you tomorrow." Their bond is firm and unbreakable, despite the huge differences in beliefs. <br /> <br /> When Charles finishes his manuscript, he considers his wife to be the final copy, saying he can burn it if he disagrees. She will read it at the end of the night and will finally give her a package ready to be sent to the publisher. At the end, the reason and perhaps love too, the triumph, when he makes an accomplice out of his incredible opponent. <br /> <br /> It is interesting that Darwin got a complete Christian burial in the Westminster monastery, proving that his land, of course, looked at contradictory ideas, but they were already considered vital to human progress. <br /> <br /> The film definitely draws Darwin's family life, its joy and worries. I liked this aspect, but Fabio said it was like watching a documentary, quoting, "Hitler's passion for ping-pong". This is true in some ways and I cannot agree with his desire to learn more about Charles Darwin's theories of this film than we are. However, it remains a well-executed and flawless period of drama. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 7 Fabio: 7 Total Score: 14
