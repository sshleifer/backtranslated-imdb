I liked this movie. I saw it in a packed house at the Toronto International Film Festival the next day after the gala opener, which must be well gone. The director, Gavin Hood, was supposed to be present at the screening today, but unfortunately his twins were born just a few hours before, so he had to fly back. "2 deliveries within 24 hours" was how he was funny about it. <br /> <br /> Issues refer to 'extraordinary rendition' - a concept whereby suspects in the US can be sent without their parents' legal consent to Interrogation and Detention Abroad. <br /> <br /> It is quite predictable - an innocent Egyptian-American man who is accused of being "lost" by terrorists when he goes from South Africa to Laundry DC. He is sent abroad while his home wife (Reese Witherspoon) struggles to find and release him. But what makes this movie special is some nice choices when it comes to telling a story: 1) a human-like story of what's happening in a locality where a suicide bomb exploded; 2) the humanity of CIA agents who are trying to understand and be honest about what is actually happening; and 3) story-story chronology that makes it a tense, tense story that moves and shrinks at better moments. Ah - Relief! And a mixture of emotions that rotate when the story fights to the end. <br /> <br /> All-around strong, working with Meryl Streep as a special vixen.
