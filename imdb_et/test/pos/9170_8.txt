I have to admit that I liked this movie much more than I thought. Does Smith have such a clean cut that you just can't but like. The plot was a little romantic comedy stuff that somewhat resembles Jane Austen's 'Emma'. This man Kevin James has a real elegant comic timing and physical comedy. I've never seen my TV show, but it was very good in this movie. Amber Valletta was good enough. I don't remember why he was the rich celebrity of this movie, but if he had to be an actor or a model, casting might have been something he wanted. I liked Julie Ann Emery and I want her to have the most. But Eva Mendes stole the last show at best. Her beauty and charm, and just the right amount of standoffishnes I had always glued on the screen. I hope to see him more in the future. This movie is definitely worth it.
