slow motion but smart. passes you as you live. full of thought provoking ideas about Art Race and is cool. that one thing struck me hard was the idea of ​​rock n 'the role of lifestyle. <br /> <br /> All the performances were improvised, I'll say it again. ALL ACTIONS NEEDED ARE EFFECTED like a trick, but it doesn't make these characters real and like someone you hang. it is also an amazing thing if you think how strong this film is. Right from the beginning, in the order of title, he immediately creates Ben as being thrown out as he moves behind the crowd. <br /> <br /> So be it that your person who lives in a jazz / rocker lifestyle cool you like it when you intelligent and understand the great cinema for the complete mess you love, and if both of you could you be fav <br /> <br /> but if none of them thinks, you probably think it's boring and say it doesn't follow "one line" and write a crap look like Ben_Cheshire
