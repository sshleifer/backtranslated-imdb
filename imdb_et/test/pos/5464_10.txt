Delightful story behind the back of the curtains. The film follows the difficulty of David Letterman and Jay Leno as they struggle for a hard-hitting Tonight Show place. Letterman drew his desire for the coveted grace and Leno, led by his representative and the little devil, Helen Kushnick. <br /> <br /> Kathy Bates (Kushnick) is great in this movie, selling himself from top dogs like Bob Wright, Warren Littlefield and Howard Stringer. Towards the end of the movie, you are so tempted how it deals with the situation that has been delayed from guest bookings to the situation that you find more. <br /> <br /> John Michael Higgins (Letterman) plays his part on the road. Sometimes I found myself wondering if he had any connection with the actual Letterman. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone interested in entertainment or the world of business negotiations.
