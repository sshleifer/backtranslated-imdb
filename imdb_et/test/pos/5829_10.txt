One of the best TV shows out there, if not the best. Why? Simple: He has the courage to show us real life in prison, without any clich√©s and predictable twists. It is neither Prison Break nor any other exhibition that actually compares Oz to the Soprano, which looks like a story for children. Terrible, curse, explicit use of violence and drugs, males of male sexual organs and rape ... all this and more in Oz. But that's not Oz's best part; characters are the strongest point of this exhibition; they are all excellent and not annoying, even though we look at the brutal criminals. The actors are great, my favorite is the actors who play Ryan O'Reilly and Tobias Beecher because they are so unique and completely changing. And above all, they have no regrets for their actions. In general ... Oz is an amazing show, the best there. Forget about CSI and show stupid doctors ... it's a thing ... OZ!
