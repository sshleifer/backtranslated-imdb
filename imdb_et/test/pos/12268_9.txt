This movie is one of my favorite comedies all the time. Dialogue is crisp, speed is fast. This is not only a clever comedy, but an interesting look at what is happening behind the scenes of television news. br /> <br /> Ernie Merriman: (sarcastically) It must be nice to always believe you know better, always think you're the smartest person in the room. Jane: (seriously) NO, it's not, it's terrible! Aaron: He must be good looking Jane: How do you know that? Aaron: Nobody wants a bad-looking idiot in their room! <br /> <br /> Holly Hunter, Albert Brooks and William Hurt's performances were completely brilliant! Even years later, I remember this movie well. Often forgotten is the wonderfully funny Joan Cusack! I love the scene where newspaper workers compete to win the deadline. There are so many funny scenes that are hard to choose from. I highly recommend this movie.
