During the South Independence, GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes its troops to protect local women and children from Yankee invasion. In 1936, Hal Roach decided that his popular children are time to branch out into casual full-length films. With the great success of Shirley's temple in two periods of civil war in 1935 (LITTLE COLONEL, LITTLEST REBEL), it was natural for Roach to look his way toward the GANG. Although MGM produced and distributed by MGM quite proudly, GENERAL SPANKY was not critical. Small gangsters would remain in short topics in the future. <br /> <br /> Although he has been awarded a top-level billing and title role, George Spanky's McFarland contest is a little Billie in the first half of the film? Here were two of the best young actors ever to appear in American films. Due to the experience of all the old, experienced pros, these two gamin scenes and hearts could steal with the same brave. Constant joy, without the wrong remark between them, is an important reason for watching the movie today. <br /> <br /> Phillips Holmes gives a quiet, gentle performance as Spanky adult protector. Almost forgotten Holmes is a beautiful actor who died too fast during World War II. Genial Ralph Morgan is especially good as a sympathetic general in the union - his scenes with Spanky are quite fun. <br /> <br /> Other OUR GANGERS will appear at the center of the movie, especially Carl Alfalfa Switzer; she's going to go, just before the battle, mom. Even the beautiful Rosina Lawrence (GANG school teacher) shows that she plays Holmes loved one. <br /> <br /> Irving Pichel is especially slippery when the cowboy became a robust Yankee master. Bumbling Willie Best & feisty Louise Beavers plays the slaves of Miss Lawrence. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that there is racism in the film, which is not unusual for Hollywood in this era, but is almost absent from the original series of OUR. GANG shorts. <br /> <br /> 19th-century music fans will be able to focus on the soundtrack that is long legacy music.
