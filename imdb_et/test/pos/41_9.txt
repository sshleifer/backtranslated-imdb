What a great movie that is full of eccentric, unique characters that a great band has cast. The director also did an excellent job of keeping the story together, making these great performances (not confusing them) and using music (and this wonderful music) to be great. S. Epatha has a leading role. I had always heard what a great actor, and although I have enjoyed it under the Law and Order, it really shows what it can do with a fulfilling and complicated role. Macy Gray is terrible, Mos Def, as usual, wonderful. Lou Gossett, great. Jimmy Smits, terrible and not trying to concentrate because he is a star. Real ensemble actor. <br /> <br /> Rent it, enjoy it, groove it and treasure it. Something special.
