See that this is Anglo-Irish, I assure you that this reviewer is nothing but Bias. But I assure you that this is a lot of Irish movie - and not English, because the last comment seems to be suggested. This film was written by Neil Jorden and Conor McPherson and directed by Conor McPherson, both Irish. Cast is almost entirely Irish - it was in Ireland with an Irish team. Even Michael Gambon was born in Ireland - I remember him in an interview with this movie. <br /> <br /> Michael Cane had obviously entered to promote Box Office's work abroad. <br /> <br /> The movie was loved, I wanted to correct a completely uninformed comment! <br /> <br /> Now with a review - I loved Dylan Moran, I've always been his own fan and Michael Cane was a surprisingly good double act. It was nice to see Moran's choice as an actor, as he plays several different characters during the movie. I recommend this movie to anyone who has an interest in comedy - because it is a fresh, peculiar and inventive turn in the length of the Irish feature film. I laughed a lot. what else could you ask?
