I'm a huge Hitchcock fan, having seen a "rear window" on the TV. "Saboteur" is not the best for Hitchcock, although it is very good but not a masterpiece. It has its own bugs, some parts are rather slow, and it results in a rather incomplete write-off of the script. But the direction of Hitchcock is great and the performances were not so bad. While Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane are doing so well, Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd are very close to stealing the exhibition. The story is good, spoken of a corrupt person, very similar topics used for "39 steps" and "northwest", and wisely offers some essential escapades. The music score was absolutely outstanding; in the order of opening title, the music was phenomenal, almost like a distorted route, and I liked digging at Tchaikovsky's piano concert and Beethoven's fifth symphony. Cinematography is also crisp and smooth, the landscape and landscapes are almost blinding and there are many very effective scenes. Namely, the Statue of Liberty climax, but the circus troupe meeting and the shooting of Radio Music City Hall are also on the money. Generally not the best of Hitchcock, but definitely worth it. 8/10 Bethany Cox
