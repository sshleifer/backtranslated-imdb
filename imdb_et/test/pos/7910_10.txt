Finally, I discovered what I thought I remembered at the age of four. After seeing the VHS color version of the 1960s, I said I remember it with black-and-white vision twice before. Now, IMDb has helped me know the truth that two successful years, 1955 and 56, were broadcast twice (2 productions) in black and white. These are the ones I remember best at the age of four. I didn't know that 56 transmissions were not the same as 55. In 1960 I was 9 years old and color production just didn't do it for me. The black and white versions had a wonderful and equally amazing effect on today's high-tech films, even without computer effects. You had to be there! Please comment on whether you have a similar reaction to the b & w version.
