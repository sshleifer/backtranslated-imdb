Rita Hayworth lights up the screen in this fun, fancy and pleasant musical star of Gene Kelly. Rita plays the nightclub dancer Rusty Parker, who has dreams of being a successful Broadway star. Unfortunately, his career will not be at Danny McGuire's nightclub. If one of his colleagues says he's going to Cover Girl, he decides to follow his dreams and enter. He recalls his grandmother's publisher, who had been in love with him for many years. But if he finds this success, his boyfriend is not happy about it. <br /> <br /> I've never seen it before, and I'm so glad I did! He has such a scene and is a very good actor. Here are some good numbers, not musical best, but they are melodious and good to listen to. One thing I didn't like was the character of Gene Kelly. She should have supported her girlfriend! But it is still the only criticism of this film. Cover Girl is a brilliant, fluffy film - perfect escapism. Not everybody's perfect movie, but still an excellent film that comes from Rita Hayworth's star power. Great movie, really impressed.
