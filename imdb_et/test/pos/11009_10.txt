Interestingly, Plato and Aristotle's metaphysics, formal logic and abstract ontology form of the sciences that most people do not care about. But then, about a thousand years after Aristotle, the computer began to use human thinking and people who refused to reflect other than biological, physical, and chemical issues suddenly felt bad because they could not cope with the consequences that these computers would bring "overnight". "Welt Am Draht" by R. W. Fassbinder together with Tarkovsky's "Solaris" and Godard "Alphaville" is probably the first film that took a new lecture on philosophical issues in the film. Confusing questions about identity and reality are wisely built into various intertwined criminal stories that the audience is really trying to follow, as it is interested in dealing with cases. Fassbinder was a captain who sold his public summaries, adding theoretical knowledge to practical, appetizing forms. The basic problem that is understandable is that identity defines reality, but on the other hand, reality also requires identity. The idea of ​​a person with multiple identities is known to us only from the point of view of psychiatry. But logically speaking, the only reason we have only one identity is that our logic has only two values ​​(better and wrong). Now take only one added value, ie three: Then, as you can see, you already have three identities. What happens now when we say that Dr. Stiller is being killed? Then it is quite possible that only one of the three identities is lost and the other two remain and can save the individual from death. The second question is whether a person with multiple identities actually knows these identities at once. But the idea of ​​showing such sets of identities up or down, as shown in the scene with the hotel elevator, is misleading because identities and thus reality are not structured in a hierarchical way, but in a Heterarchical way. Strictly speaking, there is also no "artificial identity" because every identity is defined between two objects that share all their qualities with each other. Therefore, it is not an idea to assume that every person has only one identity, but also the consequence of an old double logic (another identity would mean that a person is at the same time and not). But now look around and see that the same object (which is by nature identical) perceives each subject in its own way. If, therefore, each subject sees the object differently, then why should an individual not be able to open the boundaries of his double individuality corset so that different individuals can change their individuality? Five years later, Fassbinder made this topic in his masterpiece “Despair.
