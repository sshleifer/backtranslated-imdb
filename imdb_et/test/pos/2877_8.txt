So WWE has done it. They're a cast of film, their first one to see No Evil, who is starring in his Kane. I got this movie and I waited for it to be a great movie ... It just seemed like a clich√© and looked like something new. To my surprise, it wasn't really halfway. The viewer noted that this is a good B horror movie, and frankly this is the best way to describe it. The question I asked myself was how Kane was supposed to detain ... Well, let's say he did the absolute bad ass of "Jacob Goodnight". He sold the role really well and really looked dangerous. But what can be expected from someone who is almost 7 feet tall and weighs about 320 solid flesh. Action was decent, and the story wasn't new, of course, but we all know it. Both the management and the cinema were done very well and the hotel was really damaged and well done in the background. It was headed by a film director, I was quite surprised. I recommend this movie if you are looking for useless whore and killing and just for some general fun. Think of this movie as the last Friday of the 13th film. And save space to the end, that's good. And stay well after the credit ...
