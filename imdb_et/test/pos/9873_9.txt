This movie is pretty good as it is, but the section of unpublished producers is my favorite movie in the series after the original. Jamie's story is treated differently, death scenes are made 10 times better, there is more material about rituals that give more stories about Micheal, Jamie and his child. There is also an alternative ending, which is also better. Why they didn't release this version instead of having an angry clue. If you find this version, look at it.
