I agree that this film achieved its goals perfectly. I saw it at Showtime late in the evening with a teenager and again in college. I thought it was funny. And there are boobs everywhere! At the end of the 70s and 80s, it seems that films of this type were made from R-rated films such as "Porkys" from the soft core "Au Pair Girls"; it is a shame that they have turned aside for popularity. What made HOTS great was that, like the previous two films, it is hell. HOTS is like a pet-friendly version of Animal House, where girls form a variety corporation and work on a campus. On the side, note that anyone who designed the clothes for "Hooters" girls must definitely see this movie.
