Instead of looking at "Pearl Harbor" recycled history, which has nothing new, except for a few real events with some people thrown away, the filmmakers could say they contributed to the spread of history. explosions that fill a happy romantic triangle. We should see Dark Blue World. <br /> <br /> This movie takes place in the historic World War, which Czech pilots left their homeland and went to fight for RAF instead of putting their hands and giving the Nazis. It was part of the history, at least once, of the external environment. The Triangle of Love occurs between the headlines, but one of them does not die comfortably as in Pearl Harbor, but by sacrificing true friendship. The film is a tragedy after a tragedy that does not even end the bittersweet, our hero does not enjoy his homeland, the return of love by his present lover, the return of love by a reunited lover, or an unconditional return. love for her lifelong pet. He is completely broken from heart and does not feel worse in the Russian labor camp. Such termination is something Hollywood would probably change if it were their script. <br /> <br /> The movie is sometimes played in a sentimental way, but it also shows people's humanity. In general, the film is useful.
