"Student Nurses" is a great film about four women who are linked by friendship and career. For the first time, it is possible to see a realistic image of external relationships outside the workplace, the risks and consequences of these relationships. This film also offers a rare opportunity to see veteran performance and television actress Katherine "Scottie" MacGregor as nurses tutor, "Miss Boswell". Ms. MacGregor is best known for her performance "Mrs. Oleson" in the TV series "Small house preer". Direction, music and ink are very good as well as Clancy B. Grass, III. This film offers a rare opportunity for those who are familiar with the central themes of the late 1960s and early 1970s that offer a "softer side of life" while recognizing female beauty.
