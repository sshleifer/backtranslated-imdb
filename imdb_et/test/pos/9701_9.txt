I have long been a big fan of Cky videos, Jackass and Viva La Bami. They've had a big run and I waited for my laughter to end. But that's not yet. This movie kept my mouth open all the time. I'm still laughing, casual. I went to the theater with low expectations, thinking it was no better than the first. Oh, how incredibly wrong I was. <br /> <br /> There were many great moments in the movie. If you're terrible, you don't like randomly placed raw humor, or if you don't like the first movie, you probably don't like it. But I said that I had to laugh about my pants almost hard. It was all kinds of different bowels, masochistic humor, toilet humor, puking, laugh, some big drops and huge damage done all. Ryan Dunn even branded Bami's rear end image that is stuck there for a long time. I'm sure you can only imagine how this film is raw. <br /> <br /> No pain, no use? Is it? This movie has already done well, causing all American theaters to laugh so hard that they want it longer. I know I did. This film did not feel at all short, especially when the credit continued. But I wish it had gone on forever. Now wait and see if they release Jackass number 3! All in all, it's a great movie when you get the men's nudity and a couple of sick pictures. Keep your kids out of this movie. They don't have to see it, at least until they're older. Support the team and buy it out of the DVD! I know I do.
