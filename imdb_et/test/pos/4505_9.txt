KITE RUNNER is one of the modern ethics that has been loved from time to time. For two continents, multiple generations, and many decades, this film touches on a number of things, including friendship, love, loss, and ultimately redemption. <br /> <br /> This is the main young young Amir (Zekeria Ebrahimi), a local Afghan boy who often plays hired help; mainly young Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada), Hazara's boy who is said to be inferior to the ruling Afghans.

The Communists are invading, and Amir and Hassan have separated, because the Afghan boy was improperly affected by Hassan. These two may never see each other again. <br /> <br /> Amir's father travels to get himself and his son out of Afghanistan, and finally they reach America. Here, two gas stations were founded and lived in niche markets selling their hands in the mouth. And when Amir's father begins to become ill, a new revelation will hit Amir's heart; one that he cannot ignore and requires his return to his beloved Kabul. <br /> <br /> Friendship, War and Reconciliation, Kite Runner is a truly fantastic cinema. The story never speaks in English correctly when we are abroad, and only when we are in America.

Special attention should be paid to Homayoun Ershadi, who plays Baba, Amir's heavy father and strong patriarch. Also to lead Khalid Abda as an older Amir is played well, especially when you return to Kabul to destroy it; pretty contrast when he left. <br /> <br /> Afghanistan Cinema Amir's escape and final return is nothing breathtaking, with snow-bound peaks that cause mouth relaxation (I'm not exactly sure what mountain area they used in the movie, but wherever it was, I want to go there This is a simple story that has said very well that it's worth watching the movie.
