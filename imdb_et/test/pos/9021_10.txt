In this movie "Virtual Sexuality", 17-year-old Justine is not in love. One day, when he's upright, he and his friend go to a virtual reality conference where he introduces a machine that can change your look, dood and whatever you like. She decides to try it, but she starts her own boyfriend by sending her dreams. Then suddenly there will be an explosion in the gas pipeline and his creation will live. I'm not saying any more, you have to watch a movie that is quite fun to watch.
