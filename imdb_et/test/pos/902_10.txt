I now have a holiday in Hong Kong and I just saw a movie at the cinema ... what I say ... it was so cool! <br /> <br /> All you wanted was this! Basically ... just see it when you get ... I get my friend to send me a vcd when it comes out. <br /> <br /> The only bad thing about America's charming style is that some hl players work ... like Edison ... "What's my man?!" but it added more humor ... hhehe <br /> <br /> See this ... especially if you like any of the following genres: HKfilm, action, comedy, sci fi! SEEITMAN! Edison also made this good song ... so download it ... Edison Tse - Heroes
