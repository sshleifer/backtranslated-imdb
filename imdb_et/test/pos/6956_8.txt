Director Jay Craven's Howard Frank Mosher's "Where the Rivers Flow Bottom" is one of the finest transitions from literature to screen. Craven is an admirer of Mosher's work - he also led the "Foreign Kingdom". <br /> <br /> Cast is great - especially Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal. The tower offers the best role of its career - Noel Lord, fiercely independent former forestry, at the heart of this story. Tantoo Cardinini's image of the Lord's living housewife / ordinary spouse is also dead. I'm so amazed and disappointed that neither of them was shown to the Oscar when that movie appeared. The occurrence of this caliber should be recognized. The only sign that is hard to swallow for me is the head of a power company, played by Michael J. Fox. She just sees her as a child in this role. I think a curse is related to a young person's appearance, no matter how many people want them. <br /> <br /> Craven has done a great job here to bring the Vermont character of the early 20th century to the screen - locations, corners, kits, all combining the time and place of the story to transport the viewer. Operator Paul Ryan was extraordinary. The Horseflies score is also superb - ideal for your mood and landscape. <br /> <br /> And the story itself ...? One of the most compelling examples of the eternally independent spirit of the American pioneer - a feature that is diminishing this day and age. When it appears today, it is often seen with suspicion and contempt. In Noah's Lord, we have the attribute that we admire for our values ​​and even our stubbornness. <br /> <br /> This is not a staggering "periodic piece", but a lively look at an era that has disappeared and a character that has all disappeared. These are not gilded heroes, but real people who have their strengths and weaknesses. Fight under difficult conditions to live your life and be at the same time peaceful with the world in which they live. Like today, there are those who use power that would otherwise be.
