Let me explain this. It's not a "good movie," but I'm so glad it is there, I'm so glad I saw it, and the role it plays in your DVD collection is sublime. It's the ultimate PG-13 romp, it's a college, as we think it's when we're in high school in high school, it requires so much belief that it can also happen on Mars. It's so healthy that even if it's trying to be dirty, it wouldn't make your grandmother uncomfortable. Watching it requires so little complexity (in fact I was thinking too much about what is happening when you do the job), it makes me feel like I'm 12 years old again. And this experience is worth more than $ 9.99.
