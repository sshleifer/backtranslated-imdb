Goldie Hawn's imagination of a simple young woman in love with a triangle with an older man, a dentist, played Walter Matthau with such joy that she won the best supporting actor Oscar in 1969. <br /> <br /> The film is another tribute to Ingrid Bergman. Rarely have we ever seen him in comedy and literally pulls his heels here as a special dentist pushing Matthau's scheme to tell Hawn they're married. <br /> <br /> It is such a pleasure to look at Matthau and Bergman against each other here. These are the making of a random love relationship. <br /> <br /> Like Matthau's friend, Jack Weston is also great for his partner. Rick Lenz also supports Hawn's recently found boyfriend.
