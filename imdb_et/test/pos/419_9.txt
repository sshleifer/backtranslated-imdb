Everywhere I hear people call it to show bad because its premise is too far drawn. The exhibition is great. <br /> <br /> The fact that this show is a bit of reality is a problem, but it's still enjoyable and fun. It is extremely traceable and even knowing that Mike wins, he can never win in life. David Morse is a great actor and he does an excellent job in the title. His supportive cast is great and I have to say that the location of the exhibition is great! <br /> <br /> All in all, I look at this example not because I am looking for a good reality or an exhibition that has many activities. I look at this play because it is a great example, a good premise and a great story every week. It is also a plus if I can choose the landmarks he is driving or know what he is at the intersection. I love this example and I love Philly !! Give it a picture!
