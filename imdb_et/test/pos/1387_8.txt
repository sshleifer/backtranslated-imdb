Okay, I just disagree with the previous comments that criticized this exhibition. I think this show is fantastic. (I mean when Jasmin Weber was still and Franz was still alive, so addicting!). And I was surprised when I found out that it was classified as soap because it just doesn't look the same and feel like soap in America. Soaps here are absolutely terrible! At least GZSZ films have real music and more credible stories. Moreover, GZSZ's operations are mostly plausible, especially for Josephine Schmidt and Felix Jascheroff. (Plus, soap participants have some of the hardest employees around the business because they have the most demanding work schedules). If the ratings are so high, it must do something right; soaps in America have been shown during the day and historically they have always had lower ratings. Give GZSZ a chance! Trust me, it's good!
