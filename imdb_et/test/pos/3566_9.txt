Leonard Maltin gave this film his terrible BOMB rating in his 1995 guide to films and videos. What movie did he look at? Kid Vengeance or God's weapon are bombs. This movie is a joy. It's awesome. It's literate. It is well installed. It is beautiful, captured, which makes the use of colors great. From the very beginning, the film grabs your attention and suggests to you that this film is a well-considered satire of the whole genre of Spaghetti in the West. The film is played laughing from beginning to end with respect to Douglas Fairbanks, 77 Sunset Strips and the famous showdown Good, Bad and Ineta. Edd Byrnes, George Hilton and Gilbert Roland work great with satire's work. It is too bad Mr. Maltin rated this movie so badly that it was unworthy. One might think that its cause is. I suspect that she was completely in the movie spot and was expecting something more serious than this movie was meant. Kudos belongs to everyone involved in this project. This film is a small pearl, waiting for people who care about literary films and appreciate satire.
