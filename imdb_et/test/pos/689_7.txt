<br /> <br /> *************************** MILD SPOILERS AHEAD ************ ************** <br /> <br /> We are submitting Dawn's English film with John Mills in a leading role. The second time I watched the DVD version was on a big screen TV and I have to say the movie is better than I thought I first saw it on the same screen. Maybe it was a big screen, what helped? <br /> <br /> I still say that the first segments of the movie are confusing, but when the submarine leaves the port and begins its mission, the film will start! Searching for the German battleship of Brandenburg and the adventures that accompanied it were absorbing and the details shown in the film are interesting! <br /> <br /> I'll increase my rating to 7/10. If you enjoy World War II movies, I think it's interesting when the submarine starts running. Some sub-men also have a sense of humor.
