This super horrible South Gothic melodrama is the officer of Clint Eastwood, a wounded confederate of civil war, who is taken by a school of rural girls and who is being looked after. There is a strange exposure of the sex of a supposedly "dangerous" man to a seemingly innocent party of women who prove themselves as brutally as men fighting against each other in battle areas. It's a classic spider and flight story, but here's one single flight and a whole bunch of spiders. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page plays school headmaster and delivers distinctive sensational performance. The page was trained as a theater actor and appears in all his performances. No matter what role he played, he always devoted himself to 100%, and never lets himself out of his character. It's here, with that deadly spinster who takes sexual repression for his helpless man. All other girls also react to her in a specific way. The two most striking are slutty girls who can't wait to throw themselves at him, and a virgin (who plays who is other than Elizabeth Hartman?), Who acts like he falls to the dead when someone as much as the word said "penis" for him. The Schematic Madonna and the Horse Line would look hard at hand if the film doesn't keep you so turned off and so completely uncertain what will happen next. <br /> <br /> The most memorable scene for me was the film, when a group of women carried out an amputation of Eastwood's leg, which is infected with gangrene. Again, the spider / fly allusion is clear: they hobble him so that he has a lot harder to escape from his web. <br /> <br /> Classic cooler. Not a big movie, but a sickly fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: A-
