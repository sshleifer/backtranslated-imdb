If you haven't seen this 80's Network News station from Washington office, if I highly recommend it. This is a sad comment on the direction of news reporting in this country, but speaks the story wisely. The characters are well developed and Albert Brooks's performance is fabulous. He provides all his features with a comedy, undervalued comedy. I'm not a fan of Albert Brooks at all, so it was a welcome surprise. I have a friend who works as a local news station producer and suggested that it is as close to reality as a film writer and director to do his research. an overview of the world of network news. It's not nearly as dark as the second movie I recommend in the same genre “Network”.
