My mother and I went to the premiere of Ft Worth mainly to see George Strait, but finally we got the chance to see the movie premiered at Bass Hall. What a wonderful, beautiful film that not only reflects the beautiful Texas landscape, but also a very good line of emotion. It was well written, staged and produced and my mother and I loved it from start to finish! Thank you Jay for giving us the chance to be part of the premiere of this wonderful movie. It was a night we never forget. Like watching the movie wasn't enough, we were also happy to sit in front of 4 lines of my favorite singer George Strait! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Continue the excellent work and again, thank you! <br /> <br /> Debbie McClendon & Maureen Daugherty Ft. Worth, TX
