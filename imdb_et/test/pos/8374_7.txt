Unusual film for the audience outside the US. Lena Horne looks fabulous and so is Ralph Cooper. There are no added wallpapers as in other musicals, so you won't hear the taps win, which is great realism. Music is muted to hear what the dances are. Action is a little blunt and the cast speaks slowly so you think the film is older than it is. Costumes are bold to the end of time in dance routines. Often it seems that you are part of the audience during the exhibition. What furniture you see is very modern, which adds the world to the film. Need for all film films.
