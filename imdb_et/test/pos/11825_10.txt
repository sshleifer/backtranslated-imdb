Cure is a prominent real-life drama that deals with a very sensitive topic. This is the story of deep and shaky friendship between two boys Eric and Dexter. The latter has acquired AIDS from a blood transfusion. So he and his mother (Annabella Sciorra) have become the evaders that the public died and labeled as a dangerous company, mainly from the general ignorance of the disease. <br /> <br /> When Eric (Brad Renfro, "Client" and "Apt Student") and his mother move into a house next to them, he has to deal with public insults and fear of catching AIDS himself. But Eric overcomes his fear and risks everything. At first he talks to Dexter, but eventually climbs up from the garden and wisely joins the boy (playing Jurassic Park Joseph Mazzello) and his games. Very soon he creates a true friendship with Dexter, who is delicately built and weak due to his condition. <br /> <br /> The central theme of the movie? a topic that makes it at the same time widely authentic and tragic? is how Eric and Dexter try to find the ultimate treatment. At first, do they experiment with all kinds of plants and leaves? it is very naive, but also real, because it shows how young children treat such horrible diseases and how strongly they believe in the magic of the world. When they hear about the alleged treatment that has developed in the south, they do not hesitate and do not take them for adventure that brings them even closer and symbolizes the supreme aspiration of hope. <br /> <br /> So they board the ship and head towards the Mississippi River. A real adventure begins as a dangerous entrepreneur, at the same time emotionally intriguing and instructive. The scene in which Dexter expresses his fears and talks about the end of the universe, where everything is dark and cold, Eric tells him his sneaker, a symbol that everywhere a boy can go is Eric and is always with him; he never has to be alone. This sequence, which is one of the most compelling features of the film, includes a very convincing communication between the two players who can avoid inconvenient and dirty dialogues and deliver a very real performance that ultimately caresses their tenderness and honesty. br /> <br /> I'm not going to describe the plot because I'm not going to give too much information. However, the end result is emotionally tough and makes the audience so tragic that anyone who watches the film feels personally affected. This aspect makes this film so strong, both prominent and convincing. The emotional burden on each character is so real and damp that even tougher members of the audience may need some clothes. <br /> <br /> 10 makes this movie fair and is not too high a rating. I have hardly ever seen any other film in my life that deals with such an emotional problem with such intelligent and sensitive features. This is the story of how two boys enrich each other's lives and how they teach each other a sense of life. So Dexter goes beyond his isolation and sadness, and Eric learns what really matters in life; and both understand how much of a gift is true friendship when it comes to the most difficult moments of life. <br /> <br /> Is this movie tragic? but its message is thin inspiration.
