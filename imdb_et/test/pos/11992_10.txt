Like Richard Pryor, Mason never got the material he served. Whatever you know about her is probably wrong. Go along the accent and go see your condition. You're very surprised - he's one of the best stand-ups I've seen and I've seen a lot of stand-up comedy (from Lenny Bruce to Eddie Murphy to Jerry Seinfeldin to Chris Rock - Jackie Mason is definitely there). He is known as a comic comic. Even Howard Stern said he was one of the top 3 most entertaining comedies. <br /> <br /> Mason is not ridiculous about Dangerfield's call. Dangerfield is known as a large Mason fan. Dangerfield's career did not go far until he began to follow Mason's exhibitions. This is when Mason gave Dangerfield his inspiration, "don't get respect". Although I think Dangerfield is great, see both of them standing and you see Mason a better comedian.
