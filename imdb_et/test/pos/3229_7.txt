Fuckland is an interesting film. I personally love Dogma's movement. I wish it lasted longer. It looks like it's dead already. Many critics tried to close their sin. I do not know why. This is the most interesting movement in the film world after the new French wave. After Fuckland I have seen the first three in the series, Festen, Idioterne and Mifune. They were all great, Festen is, in my opinion, a masterpiece. Fuckland is not against them. I was just fascinated by the movie. It is played as if it were a real documentary, with a real person who was so obsessed with the camera that he refused to put it down. At some points in the film it turns out that this is a complete fiction, but this illusion was amazing for a long time. I want the filmmakers to have something interesting on the screen. Basically, this is a man, Fabian, an Argentine who visits the Faulkland Islands. The Argentines were allowed to the islands only in the last few months, and Fabian plans to impregnate the children with Argentina. He puts his eyes on one and most of the film is spent on his seduction. Two participants are very natural. Camilla Heany only hints that she is an actor. Fabian Stratas seems completely real. The film's policy is somewhat confusing to me because I only have the situation around the archipelago and its recent history. I was 3 years old when I thought Faulkland was invading. The last bit of the movie doesn't work at all. I don't get what the filmmakers went there. However, Fuckland is an interesting Dogma test. However, it breaks some of Dogma's rules, especially the non-diagonal music rule. There's a lot of it. 7/10
