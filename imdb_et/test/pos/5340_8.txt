This scene shows how Wallace's experiment, using its invention of brain manipulation, goes awfully wrong by creating "Were Rabbit". His desire for social entrepreneurship is to improve society, so a "Brain Manipulator" machine has been created. He threatened his life to help solve the Tottington pest rabbit problem and, more importantly, to overcome the accumulation and storage of basements in his cellar. Though he thought his experiment was working, it put more pressure on him and Gromits to find a solution to the annual vegetable competition that risks his life. The quiet faithful dog and loyal helper Gromit is constantly finding innovative ways to save his lord from his radical crazy inventions that are terribly wrong. What is interesting about this film is trying to identify who is more entrepreneurial, Wallace or Gromit?
