Watching these two movies at the same time is not a bad idea to get the feeling of early film production and to act on camera styles. I'm joking about Garbo (but not much) about his naturalness. Robeson is majestic. But his performance is directed to a great procession theater. Something else that struck me was movies about empowering women and minorities. There was no movie about Hollywood that allowed the voices of marginal stars like Anna and Brutus to come to the fore. These were very progressive films for their time. It is quite likely that O'Neill saw how to write on the wall before everyone else did about the future of America.
