May contain spoiler <br /> <br /> This historical film was so refreshing. Although it may be an irritation to actual events, it shows the heartless nature of Emperor Qui, which he was later infamous. And there were no personalities created with a computer. I think it's great that China has produced such an epic film. The costumes and settings were beautiful, the performances were also great. Dignity and Death are the main theme of this film and I think it reflects Chinese history and culture. I also had a little hint of terracotta soldiers, a 3D map that had been cut off from the capture of Chinese soldiers. Emperor Qui, of course, later with his life-size terracotta soldiers. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the dwarf scene, he was a very interesting character even if he had only a small scene. <Br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br />
