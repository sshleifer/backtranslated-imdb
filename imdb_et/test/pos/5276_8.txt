Well, if this film was done much later in the history of the cinema, it wouldn't be particularly useful. But in 1898 the films were in their infancy and they were almost all boring and had no real story. Today, almost all of them have been hopelessly boring and very short - often less than one minute long! So the short clip of this light is pretty swell and can just laugh. Two men, a grinder and a chimney sweeper get into each other - they drop and throw the flour and coal powders around each other as they tend to. It's all - the movie is over before you know it.
