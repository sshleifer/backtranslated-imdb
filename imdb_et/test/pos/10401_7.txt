Another hand-held horror is another separating movie that fans should still look for and make their thoughts. <br /> <br /> Imagine a cross between the Blair Witchcraft and The Grudge and you are the general content of this movie. This is another video-recorded horror, but this time most of them are brought together with a video document readiness that has never been stopped by a supernatural researcher who disappeared. <br /> <br /> I was definitely afraid of watching the movie (Does anyone make terribly better results than our Asian friends?), but the horrible moments, really horrible moments, were, unfortunately, a little less and farther than I hoped. I also felt that I was two or three steps in front of the investigator when there was an obvious "revelation" so I couldn't recommend it as high as [* Rec]. <br /> <br /> Having said that, it would be highly advisable for me not to recommend a film that lasts very ectoplasmically with worms, contains at least two subtle spooky ghost moments and convinced that I have to turn on the lights for a while when the sun fell. br /> <br /> Make sure you have enjoyed some of the latest hand-held genre editions. Finale is hairy. <br /> <br /> Look at it if you like: the last broadcast, pulse, angel heart.
