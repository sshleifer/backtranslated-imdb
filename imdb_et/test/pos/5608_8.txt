This 1-hour 30-minute joke is best understood by Catholics, the first religion of self-healing comics around the world. This does not mean that it cannot stand by itself, what it does, that the film is not without its mistakes, which it received. Technical issues, mostly: the belief that in 1998 there was a digital response, when in fact it was in its infancy - the beta beta, if you like, and the restructuring will never improve it. For God's love, Hal ... please take your red. Or three. <br /> <br /> If you like Hartley movies, of course, you'll love it. I liked it because I liked the Grim / Fool, and it was backed up by: I couldn't see a worrying self-forecast, an airplane that rises on the overhead line used as an Armageddon hiding in this 1998 film. Just like Cheney would have got the whole idea of ​​Halis. It's true - Hartley moves his players into the camera, as is the House of Commons, but one piece that needs to rest. After all, we have already paid attention to the actors and writing is alive. Not a big letter, but ... fine. Can I use the word fervent? Purposeful, intelligent, not comforting. <br /> <br /> Absolutely love PJ Harvey in it, of course I love him everywhere. Strangely, when Helen Mirren needs a younger self, she should look up Harvey and bring a bottle of blonde.
