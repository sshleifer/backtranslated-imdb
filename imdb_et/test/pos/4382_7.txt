After seeing "oh so well-known" Fargo and thinking that it was nothing more than average, I was wandering about thinking about renting another Coen masterpiece. This time I was much less disappointed when I was with Fargo and I have to say that most of this credit goes to good jokes and to George Clooney's good shows. Well done by Mr Clooney, do more of these and less "perfect storm" movies. You can act and you showed it here. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
