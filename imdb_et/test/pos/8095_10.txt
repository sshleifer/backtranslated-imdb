Although I haven't seen it yet, I know that Chaplin is a genius, and only one of his talents would take this bold theme - a comedy about Hitler. All the great satires are based on going to the edge. All the great comedies also deal with the other side - sin. This film seems to be a skirt for both sides. Like Kubrick's dr. Strangelove, the Great Dictator is dealing with history through a distorted lens. The only way to cope with the horrors of this world is laughing at it. And hopefully we can learn to look at the world with a laugh in a new light. The second movie I think is the Emir Kusturica subway and Fando and Lis. So let me look at the movie first.
