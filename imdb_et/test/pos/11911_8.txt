Having been raised during the release of this movie, it is likely to have affected my low mind, but it is in no way a bad film. This is a film hostage to a certain extent of a school area that is somewhat loved by teenage boys who do not seem to be out of trouble. What's wrong with that? It has no big special effects, but what? Who needs special effects? The decline in cinema began with the popularization of special effects. Coincidence? I don't think so. This made the films potentially good plots and feelings and made them big, less or less white for innocent children and medicines. Well, you know that not all movies need special effects. About three-quarters of the IMDb's top 250 films are without special effects, but the highlights of almost all times have some special effects. Think about it: Star Wars, E.T., Ghostbusters, etc. All the good movies, but the rest of the cutting-edge films are usually drifted with non-sensitive plots and lots of eye candy. Well, some movies don't need this spam. <br /> <br /> Excuse me for not touching the tangent I usually do, but I'm just so tired that special effects junk. Back to: Toy Soldiers is just a great movie. I admit that some of the content is a bit dirty and ripped, but then, every movie will somehow crumble another. Think about Resovoir for dogs. Countless "recognition" sites dictate the fact that the beloved Quentin Tarentino, whom I like, has copied many of his many films to making his first Reservoir Dogs. Many say that the entire plot has been torn off by a scene from scenes from Japanese and Chinese gangster, which Mr Tarentino so much loved and probably still does. Excuse me again for the tangent. <br /> <br /> Game soldiers are fun. It has overall responsibility for young people who are unwanted, ie hostage-takers. It is fun to see that children take over when they are holding something they do not want to do. Hell, the angry inspired rebellion of teenagers was the main theme of the 80's comedies. Plus there is tension and excitement when the characters are used with firearms and knocked by bad guys etc. The pros have some emotional points about the film. When one character dies, others have to cope and adapt. It is not perfect action, but it will win most of the other outflows. In short, Toy Soldiers are exciting, interesting and fun. How do you dare to break a blast to rate this movie badly! Shame on you all! <br /> <br /> Personal Rating: 8/10
