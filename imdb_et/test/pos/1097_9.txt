Yes, maybe there are parts of the film that need little stopping, but it doesn't take away the charm and surprise of the movie. It was shown as part of our city youth film festival and was a favorite of the organizing committee. What is not surprising. Theme - come up with a race interrupted, although South Africa is very topical after apartheid and the topic is inspiring. Of course, as mentioned in the previous note, the film has shortcomings, but the realism of the setting and the way the director treats his substance is against these drawbacks. I saw it with my husband and we returned with the children that same evening. Film to watch, meditate, discuss and act.
