* POSSIBLE SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I thought Pitch Black was nice, pleasant in terms of pleasant effects - I liked the larger wild animals, although they are not a patch of aliens aliens. It had a pretty good atmosphere I felt Vin Diesel helped with. <br /> <br /> One thing that bundled me was how it rains. If the planet has three suns and it is almost in daylight, when the humidity came, forming clouds and thus rain? <br /> <br /> I liked that Fry died at the end - it reminded me of the new Hollywood movies of the 1970s, where the main heroine didn't finish it.
