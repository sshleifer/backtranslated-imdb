Well, I enjoy this movie, though sometimes it becomes too much a stereotypical situation. I wasn't thinking at the time of the "punishment park" in the past, but I think it's not really here. <br /> <br /> You have to watch this movie differently. This shows how much violence you can find in our world. It reminds us that we live in a world dominated by violence and that no one can escape from it. If someone refuses to "take responsibility", it will be thrown out of our society ... All our history is made by wars, we should never forget it. In fact, this is only when we finally accept the truth that maybe we will change and realize that our intellectual skills have improved. So we could use them to find other ways to solve their problems. <br /> <br /> In two words, this movie can be seen, maybe it will help us accept the truth ...
