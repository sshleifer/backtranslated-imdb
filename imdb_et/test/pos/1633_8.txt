When the Da Vinci Code introduced us to Dr. Robert Langdon and his ability to solve puzzles, angels and demons give ante, providing an enormous puzzle with an 8-hour limit. <br /> <br /> Award-winning actors Ron Howard do a good job of guiding a story that was easy to follow and more easily received. The Da Vinci code threw you so many corners in such a short time that a quick break in the bathroom would leave you a little confused. I didn't feel that it was with angels and demons, the plot was straight and the level of interest remained all the time. <br /> <br /> Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) movie. His portrayal of the elitist but misunderstood position of the Catholic Church was very good and combined with his treatment with Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor). There is not much time for Tom Hanks, because the film focuses more on the story than character formation, and it made me well that I had more than enough introduction from the first film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he found that the Ayelet Zurer character, Vittoria Vetra, was an unnecessary assistant to femme, because his lines were a bit limited and seemed like an afterthought. He plays a key role at the beginning of things, but soon Langdon's "acquaintance" will fall more than the background of the necessary partner. <br /> <br /> The plot itself is one of the organizations that, in the past, the Catholic Church (there is little there) has been seeking revenge in the most artistic way. Some church men are abducted and executed at specific times until the end of the church itself ends. Dr. Robert Landon has been presented to help decipher clues and teams with the beautiful Vittoria Vetra, a scientist who saw a colleague dying in the hands of a church enemy. <br /> <br /> Music remains relevant and cinematic is beautiful, I could call it bad things, but what makes angels and demons a complete job is the conclusion. It was an overwhelmingly surprising end to what I saw in the film, and I was impressed how I was when I hit. Like someone else, I appreciate the great wrapping and this film wraps it quite tight and falls on it quite a bow. Needless to say, I left the theater all the way calmly. <br /> <br /> If you are religious and you are not sure if this film offends your Catholic principles. I can say that if the DaVinci code painted catholicism as a group of shadows on the sadists, these angels and demons paint with a much lighter brush. The church is shown as a collective of good men who suffer for the sins of evil and misleading men who carried their colors and even few who have penetrated into their modern ranks.
