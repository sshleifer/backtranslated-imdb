"twin peaks" and "blue velvet" have always been my favorite films twice, and although lynch's past films have been a bit disappointing for me, they are always worth watching many times. To be embarrassing, lynch can be like a good wine - it must be flavored and hot. but in the end you have to make your thoughts on what you have seen, because lynch never gives you complete answers. <br /> <br /> Many people go out of the "mulchland ride" that may want to disprove the mind-bending visual mosaic puzzle that has unfolded before them. but this movie has twisted logic, you just have to look for clues. Betty (Naomi Wool) arrives in search of Hollywood, eye-eye and stardom. then he finds amnesia in the bathroom who has escaped the attempted murder while driving to the mulholland. Together they try to reveal the secrets of Amnesia life. it all leads to a club called silencio, where the blue box reveals everything. and that is when the movie throws everything out of the window. the people we thought were quite different people ... is that a dream? a memory of life's past enemies? you love or hate this movie. David Lynch always takes such extreme reactions from his viewers. but because his universe itself is always extreme, his films produce such reactions. <br /> <br /> It's best to look at this movie thematically, not as a straight line narrative. and appreciate that lynch is a filmmaker who still lets you make your own conclusions. he has had many imitators, especially the "vanilla sky", where the mindset film decides to give you all the answers in the last rush for five minutes and you will probably forget this movie as soon as you step out of the cinema. Mulholland is driving you to haunt.
