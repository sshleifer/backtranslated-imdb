I was wrapped up to see that many other people enjoyed this movie. First I watched it when I was early in my teens and then many times late, several times later. Then, unfortunately, no more. I'm almost 49 years old now and I want to be able to do it on DVD. Why not? Best of Anthony Quinn's role, no one could have played more for the part or parts he was playing - I have mentioned it to other movie ages of a similar age and unfortunately no one knows it. As a daughter of a generation who passed through the Second World War and its consequences (and I, too, deeply enthusiastic about this generation), I think this film gave me an excellent cinematic about some of the heartbreaking issues of the day. In the classic recent scenes, this movie is special.
