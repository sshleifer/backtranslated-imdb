044: The Big Trail (1930) - released 10/24/1930; <br /> <br /> MESSAGES: Richard Harris, Harold Pinter, Robert Atkins. <br /> <br /> DOUG: In Hollywood, Raoul Walsh opened his latest film The Big Trail, west of the track west of the border, starring 23-year-old actor John Wayne. In 1930, we see many "first" but few "better" ones. In addition to the first John Wayne movie, we also have the first widescreen (although we only looked at full-frame version). Interestingly, widescreen filming was essentially the same reason that the widescreen became more popular later: to compete with television, which had not yet appeared commercially, but was still curious. However, this film was very good, giving us a sudden glimpse of Oklahoma track. Open Title Cards tell us that this is the most traditional area of ​​America-related land, the area to which it should live, etc., and this is a great example of this. Walsh gives us amazing visual examples of a wagon company in the desert (when they reach the cliff, they must bind each wagon one by one) and we also have a subgroup of revenge involving Wayne who is trying to kill one of his friends. (I think I remember something like Stagecoach). Wayne's tough cowboy routine is at least partially present, and the next films will definitely evolve. Since this film represents all of Wayne's 30th century Odyssey, we don't see his face again until Stagecoach, but when we do, we see him until the end of Odyssey and beyond. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Ah, our first sound for West and John Wayne's first major role. This is the great track of Raoul Walsh. This review is short because it has been weeks since I watched it. I enjoyed this movie, but it was far from a masterpiece. For the most part, the predicted adventure was a few surprises, such as the bad boys' brains, Red Flack (Tyrone Power Sr. in his last role) being killed halfway; I thought he would be the boss at the end, but it ended with Bill Thorpe (Ian Keith). I remember that I didn't like Breck (Wayne) Thorpe killing and ending revenge. I realized it was what he was supposed to do, but I really didn't like his discussion when he told Ruth why he had to. I think he had a much greater responsibility towards the hundreds of settlers he led through the harsh western parts. <br /> <br /> The last movie was seen in Animal Crackers (1930). Last film chronologically: Soup to Nuts (1930). Next film: L'Age D'or (1930).
