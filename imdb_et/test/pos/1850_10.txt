I saw this movie with my mom and I loved it! It was such a sweet story, (not to mention the funny pain!) They never make such movies ... ever! My favorite thing is when Grace (Minnie Driver) gets to know her boyfriend's death and has a dead woman's heart and she screams, "WHAT WAS GOD understood?" I believe that everyone (regardless of who you believe) has such thoughts for some time. But even though it is very happy, it can just make you believe in true love and destiny once and for all. (Sigh) especially in the above scene, it's terrible and so funny!). They will do a good pair and I hope to see them soon again. 10/10 Stars
