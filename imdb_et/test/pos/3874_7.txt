"Back in the day" is interesting but faulty. And the rule is Reggie Cooper, an honest but sad man who is trying to cope with his father's death. He meets his old friend J-Bone (Ving Rhames), who is trying to force Reggie into guilt. Reggie also falls in love with Alica (Tatyana Ali), the daughter of the preacher. Now he has to choose: love or crime. <br /> <br /> And the rule makes competent work as Reggie. At least he tries to act. Ving Rhames is perfect as J-Bone. It brings a lot of energy and danger to the role. Joe Morton as a preacher is his usual great self, but he doesn't do much. Same problem for Giancarlo Esposito as Reggie's father. He needed more screen time. I don't want to say that, but Pam Grier is quite terrible as Mrs Cooper. He crosses every scene and brings the movie down. Tia Carrere and Frank Langella are in this, but do not make the plot important. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, you should see it with Ving Rhames and Joe Morton's skills and writing and directing.
