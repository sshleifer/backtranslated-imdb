Ahhhh, 1984 .... I was young and stupid, and I just developed a taste for these exotic cigarettes while living in Manchester with the Moss Side squat, where the most incredible cockroach infection was. <br /> <br /> After some of these doobies, this exhibition was a ROTFLMAO material - I was an avid fan. Then I look down on the floor (or up to the walls or almost anywhere) and see my own "little armadillos" collection. <br /> <br /> It is not sure if this is a chemical improvement, but I remember that when the apparent surrealism of the show was fantastic - it was the second favorite thing on TV (# 1 was Luis Bunuel's movie show channel on channel 4). Radical art lives! <br /> <br /> You also have to set up this theme! .... I swear, I'll never drink again.
