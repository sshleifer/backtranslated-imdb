What is to say about "Pink Flamingos"? It is neither criticism nor even an explanation, because it does not really want to be like any other film you have seen. You get it or you don't want to laugh at it or roll your eyes off (or both). John Waters is an odd filmmaker, mixing the innocent, childish humor as well as the shockingly offensive moments designed to ... well know who his intentions were. It's like a form of attack, though it's funny. <br /> <br /> What makes the Waters humor so infectious and effective is that its characters live in a world that may seem completely familiar to the alien and the viewer. like the small rivals that make up the "Pink Flamingos" plot. Certainly, everyone has experienced such a thing at some point, but it was almost certainly not a "Filthiest Person Alive". What makes the film impressive for me is the way Waters creates shy, independent environments, and doesn't let you down. The people in his films are perfectly in line with one another. For example, when Cotton tells Babs he doesn't want to go with him because Crackers brings his "friend's friend" to the trailer, Babs knowingly reacts to ridicule and tells him, next to a conspiracy. "little throw just PERFECT ..." At this moment we don't know yet that Crackers is going to take his "lady's mouth" to push live chickens on his naked body, while Cotton looks orgasmically through the window, but this strange is quite normal and understandable in a fictitiously degenerate world created by the waters. Another example would be chats between girls in the basement and Channing, Marbles deviant butler. For the first time we see them, Waters cuts harshly at Connie's cozy office, where Channing falls into the basement where we see there are two women, one dead and one very lively and p *** ed. Susan is not an overflowing victim, but is furious and abusive at Channing, jumping to launch a full-length verbal attack on her prison. They both have a strange understanding of the strange situation and were not scared by so many kidnappings because he is violently offended and fairly furious. He doesn't let eleven times when Channing is in his eyes, and two scenes with his cheerful torment are two movie comics. Later in the film, when the divine and the crackers break into Marbles' home and discover their crimes in the basement of abducted women, it is a total lack of support that the divine and his family have for the rebellious brand, that the marbles despise, is something that the Divine does not know, corruption, developed by his newcomers, and he despises it. Besides, although kidnapping does not seem like the Divine thinks twice, he is outraged that the girls are held there and blessed freely, freeing the revenge they make on Channing. <br /> <br /> At the other end of the slag spectrum, Waters sometimes reminds us of a series of his twisted fantasy world and "real" world. For the first time, we see Connie casting a little character on Sandy Sandstone, who has never heard of divinity. But the cookie, on the other hand, reacts with the title of the divine headline as the "most dirty man", showing that he lives in this unspoken and understandable madness world. <br /> <br /> Something must also be said about how players face their roles, especially the divine who doesn't leave a comment. He never turns the ridiculous joy and character he has given, and it takes "Pink Flamingos" to a new level or strange. People believed that the divine was in real life and that it is easy to understand, because when you watch a movie, you don't really think about the movie, the people who did it. Because they really do things that are unheard of in the script, you start to think it's not a story, but a strange documentary. <br /> <br /> But even more, "Pink Flamingos" is not as much a movie as it is an event, or something that happens to you. Although the value of this shock is mostly lost to me (I say mostly because ** the scene of the hole and the chicken scene make me cure), I find this movie to be fun and habitual.
