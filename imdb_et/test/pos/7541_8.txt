Choose your destiny: The fourth form of terrible dachshunds, playing practical jokes that include axes, or ... ummm ... well-developed sixth form girls who discovered cigarettes, gin, sex and how men could be misled some time ago. The problem is that one set is included. They're all there in St. In Trinian, this remarkably simple English school for girls, led by Director Milicent Fritton (Alastair Sim). As Miss Fritton wants to point out: "In other schools, girls are sent to a ruthless world, but when our girls leave, it is a ruthless world that needs to be prepared." Miss Fritton sounds like the melding of Julia Child and Eleanor Roosevelt, and certainly is Sim's droll and deadpan comic genes. In St Trinian bulls, the team of Frank Launder and the Sidney Gilliat team, the chaotic comedy, is St. Trinian financial disaster as usual. However, salvation can be at hand when a rich sheik sends her daughter to the fourth form and gets the correct English education. Sheik is also a horse owner and one of her award-winning racers, an Arab boy, is being trained near the school. It is only a matter of time before girls in the fourth form form a racing pool and heavily invested by an Arab boy, where Miss Fritton adds to the pool which foundations have left school. (A large part of the money of the fourth form girl comes from the gene they make in chemistry, then the bottle and the Cockney fixer, the Flash Harry (George Cole) is dropped. You know quite well, "says Miss Fritton about sampling stuff," but sends some bottles to my room. ") <br /> <br /> Miss Fritton, however, has a brother Clarence Fritton (who has some casting coincidence, including Alastair Sim), a bookmaker who has not only placed a bundle on another horse, but also has And she has placed early Arabella in the sixth form to keep her informed. Soon the sixth form has been kidnapped by an Arab boy, the fourth form has taken the horse back, Flash Harry has joined forces with Miss Fritton, sixth-form girls have decided that the Arab boy is not Separated from St. Her Homburg Gang Arrived, Parents Ride to the Elders Day, and the Ministry of Education has arrived at the very right person for the inspector. which is more dangerous, African spears or flour bombs. <br /> <br /> Alastair Sim as Millicent Fritton turns to power transmission. Miss Fritton is a tall woman with stubborn joy, fond of long dresses with embroidered lace and Edward hats. He takes all the steps, even in the fourth former stunning chemistry class, and after a few minutes of the explosion listening the results. "Oh dear. I told Bessie to be cautious with this nitro-glycerin!" He firmly believes that St. Trinian is "gay arcade of happy girls." Sim was one of Britain's great eccentric actors. Other than small (and not so few) girls who do terrible things, there is a lot of movie joy.
