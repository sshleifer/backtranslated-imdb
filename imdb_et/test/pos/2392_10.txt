I've been writing a fiction for hard-boiled crime for several years. When a writer develops a story, he always has the character / actor to put the story into practice. Last weekend, I found Paulus Varios new, playing Uncle Bieno Eddie Monroes. It was a sliding film brought out by Vario's presence both on the screen and on the screen (as his voice narration has been heard). I especially liked the actor playing Benny's brother and Eddie's ex-wife, although everyone did an exciting job in this exciting movie where they played with bad boys and double crossing. Nice work everywhere ... and Mr. Vario shone the brightest. She must be my Tony Gang ever ...
