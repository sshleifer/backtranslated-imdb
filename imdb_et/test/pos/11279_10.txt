What this movie is not: yes, entertainment <br /> <br /> What this movie is about: visual interest, hard to pass, deliberate <br /> <br /> I feel this movie puts the viewer (if he or he is ready) through a time clip where they experience a world without languages. Like the way animals experience the world. You will not watch this movie as much as you know the terrible series of events that "feel" like in real time. <br /> <br /> Consistently, it goes a lot longer than it is convenient. This movie can be edited in a short time up to 20 minutes and it would be a completely different film. It would be cool and entertaining, but the experience disappears. I've seen many cool movies, but I've never experienced it. If you get your head in the right place for it, you should really appreciate (but probably not "enjoy") what they have achieved here. 10 out of 10
