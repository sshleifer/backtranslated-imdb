Based on actual events in 1905, the silent film BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN concerns a Russian imperial ship with terrible conditions. Citizens of the ship, the port city of Odessa have attacked the support of the armed forces - and therefore fall under the grace of the Imperial forces, who are attacking the civilian supporters in the wild. <br /> <br /> POTEMKIN is a movie whose single characters are much less important than the groups and crowds they are members of, and it reaches incredible power, showing clashes between groups and the crowd in a number of exceptionally visualized and edited sequences. Amazingly, all of these sequences succeed in passing the previous one, and the film is actually based on power, as it moves from the rebellion to the citizens' rally to the massacre of Odessa - one of the most famous sequences of the entire film history. Filming, where the real events actually took place, is an extraordinary vision of director Eisenstein when he builds - not only from the sequence but from the moment to the moment in every sequence - some of the most memorable images ever devoted to the film. <br /> <br /> POTEMKIN is something inaccurate to describe a great movie. This is an absolute necessity, absolutely essential for anyone who is really interested in cinema as an art form, pure visual cinema at its most brilliant, often imitated, rarely equal, ever better. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
