An interesting story and a sympathetic treatment of racial discrimination, the Son of God is quite long and contains some hammy actions, but in general it remains an exciting film. <br /> <br /> The story of Chinese white (Rchard Barthelmess) begins when Barthelmess leaves college after being offended by a trio of co-authors. He starts a world tour to discover himself and reaches the secretary of the British playwright (Claude King). Monte Carlo meets her beautiful Alanna Wagner (Constance Bennett) and falls in love. But when he discovers that he is Chinese, he gets resentful in a memorable scene. <br /> <br /> Alanna gets into the spiritual spiral of guilt and love and makes some attempts to contact Barthelmess. When his father dies, he takes over the business (banking?) And dons a Chinese devil as a symbol of his hatred for the White Race that has imprisoned him. After a San Francisco detective tells her the truth about her birth, Barthelmess decides to honor her Chinese father and mother. <br /> <br /> And I agree that one reviewer never saw this movie. Alanna proclaims her love for Sami before she tells her about her recent discovery. And it makes the whole movie different. <br /> <br /> Barthelmess and Bennett have a couple of scenes where they chew on the landscape, but in general it's a solid and interesting drama. Frank Albertson is good as a nice college ball, Claude King is strong as a playwright Bathurst, Bess Flowers has one scene like Oklahoma India and E. Alyn Warren is a Chinese father, Dorothy Mathews is a nasty Alice. Not so good is Anders Randolf as Bennett's father and Mildred Van Dorn as Eileen. Also note the gorgeous blonde Barthelmess right on the roulette table. What is this stunning guy who was!
