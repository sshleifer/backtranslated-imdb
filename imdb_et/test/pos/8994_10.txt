I wanted to see this movie since the preview appeared. I don't understand why everyone is so hard on this film. It may not all be technically correct for rugby sport, but this film is not primarily about sport. It's about the rugby team that is taught how to be more than the world is waiting for them. They are taught to become a man, not to be temporarily useless boys. Hollywood is never 100% correct in its products. They are ready to produce the product. Something fun. The story of coach Gelwix and what he has taught over the years is just amazing. He teaches about service, honor, honesty, and moral purity. How many other films are teaching our young people these days? I was proud to have seen such an amazing story that taught respect and respect.
