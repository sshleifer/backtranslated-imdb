Director Jacques Tourneur (cat people, past, demon) and wrote Phillip Dunne (how green was in my valley). The main character of this Captain Anne Providence is based on the real female pirate Anne Boney, who lived and traveled through the 18th century Atlantic Ocean. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a battle of the sea, where Anne (Jean Peters) pirate ship attacks a merchant ship on its way from South America to Europe. As a result, high-value treasures have been imprisoned with a beautiful French officer Pierre La Rochelle (Louis Jourdan). Anne reaches out to fall in love with her, and apparently her feelings are interconnected, but only when she releases her when she discovers that she has a pretty young woman, Molly (Debra Paget), with whom she loves a lot. Anne starts a retaliation for both, but with an unexpected fate it spins a big sacrifice to save them. The Black Beard pirate cliché also makes its appearance here, this time by Thomas Gomez. <br /> <br /> Although Indian Anne is probably no more than a repetition of pirate film clichés, it is still a classic moment in beautiful visual images and marine battles that have been filmed in Technicolor as well as in some aspects of the story, and especially in personal touches. Jacques Tourneur led. 7/10
