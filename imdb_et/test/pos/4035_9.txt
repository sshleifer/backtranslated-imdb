"D.O.A" is an inclusive and fun little picture from start to finish. Dennis Quaid is in the best position; and, unfortunately, Quaid is one of Hollywood's least-used talents. He then beau Meg Ryan also appears with him, but as usual, it doesn't really make a big difference. <br /> <br /> The film is stylishly focused all the time, based on a number of influences that capture its "delicate" feel. Do you think it is actually run by two people? The answer is no. The whole thing is brilliant, from innovative camera work to black and white photography. All these elements help keep the procedure fresh. <br /> <br /> Truly the biggest thrill here is to have a dialogue, it's gentle, but complicated, not to waste a word and yet to be fun. Its scenario is like a pocket work of art. <br /> <br /> It was an unnoticeable time for me to finally catch up late in the evening. If this is the first thing you have heard about it, don't miss it like I did! To catch up soon, it's really top-notch ...! <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for a specific genre of flick that can surprise you every step, it's really worth the bill. /> <br />
