I really loved this movie and spent several years getting it. It is not just available and has not been on television for many years. I liked it and the songs because he had something to say and thought how each person looks at different views. Also, we often do not understand what we have until it no longer exists. My 12-year-old daughter just discovered music and comes with some songs. One day I hope to get a copy of the movie so he can see it. (Oh, I would like to see it again!) <br /> <br />
