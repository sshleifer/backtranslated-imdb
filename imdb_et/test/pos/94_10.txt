This wonderful short strikes home for anyone who specifically asked for something as a child, because it was a hip or cool, just to be given something that would celebrate your life with your peers and what the mother or father (or both) said was not important because you began to seriously consider the inclusion of a witness protection program to avoid ridicule. For those US residents who are not afraid because you are not following ice hockey, it's like a Dallas Cowboy fan who gets Washington Redskins jerseys or Yankees fans, getting a Red Sox. It's not pretty pretty. Think of our European friends with two big rival football (soccer) clubs and imagine that someone gets a fan from another. Ouch !!!
