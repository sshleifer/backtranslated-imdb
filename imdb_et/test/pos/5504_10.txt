I think this movie is the most misunderstood movie of Jerry Lewis' career. It's a little slow start, but after it's going, it's very funny and using Jerry's irony like ever in his earlier movies ..., ie Who's in the store, nut professors, etc. A look at Dirty Dozen, instead of getting military personnel to death to make a suicide mission, as in this movie, you have 4, 4-f's & 2 tags. Including former L. A. Dodgers, All-Star Centerfielder, Willie Davis as Linc! HILARIOUS! Love this movie!
