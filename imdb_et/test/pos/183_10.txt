This film is undoubtedly one of the greatest attractions of cinema history. Looking at this film, we can only note retrospectively that in the 1950s world cinema there was such a purely humanistic dramaturgy, such a strong and sufficient sound-image editing, and almost religious admiration for ethical choices in human life. Cinema was not just one art form. It was much larger than normal life and it gave many people hope to live after the tragic war. It has been said that even Picasso was taken and shouted that such a work of art can only appear once in 100 years! The target group was also different. I read that after Kurosawa "Ikiru (Live)" in her first edition, the young couple quietly said to each other, "This is a good movie, isn't it?" I think modern cinema, although it has been technically advanced and has opened up a new narrative perspective, has lost the most important --- audience confidence. Cienma was once the most popular art, and unlike modern art and contemporary music, millions of people created and ideals. From this point of view, "Letyat zhuravli" must always be in the classical pantheon such as "City light", "Ikiru" and "La Strada".
