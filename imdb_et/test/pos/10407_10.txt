This review includes some small but significant spoilers. <br /> <br /> --- <br /> <br /> I just finished viewing my Noroi copy ... <br /> <br /> ..and it was great! It may sound funny, but many times during the movie I forgot that it was not a real XD Actor is convincing, although Masafumi Kobayashi (playing myself, I think ...) sometimes seems a little hey. Marika Matsumoto (Yuka Takashi Shimizu Rinne) seemed to change the level of credibility throughout the film: sometimes she is really good, the next moment she is really cheerful (especially at the end of exorcism and subsequent relocation.) <br /> <br / > At first, the ridiculous character was Hori, a man who was captured by a laptop, believing that "ectoplasmic worms" would all eat, he initially offered an inadvertent comic (like a stereotypical alien robber type victim), but near the end there are some really horrible scenes. <br /> <br /> The plot was very interesting and really kept me interested in how everything is interrelated. Some things that have not really been explained (like the mass suicide in Tokyo Park and where the Southeast boy came) but everything else turned out well, the end is GOT to be one of the most alarming, if not the most frightening, sequences I've ever rejoiced. All in all, Noroi is very good for 2 hours and the new Hong Kong R3 DVD gives you a great picture and sound (the most important of English SUBTITLES-Engrish for free!) for an excellent J-Horror experience. I suggest you take it.
