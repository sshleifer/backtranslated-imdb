I remember seeing the film in my later teenage or television at the beginning of the 20s - probably HBO. I watched it with my parents, brother and some friends. Since it was about 30 years ago, I don't remember much of the story. I remember our entire group watching it was the most fun movie we've ever seen. When it was over, our stomachs laughed so much. My dad worked in the hospital so it made it better. <br /> <br /> Every time I see a feast on the TV list, I can see if it is there. It's never my mischief. Although I loved the parties, I feel it is more fun. Peter Sellers was big as a curious hospital administrator. Why it has never been published on video is a mystery to me. It's classic, but it doesn't seem like anyone under 35 or 40 can see it. I bought it for another if they ever released it on a DVD.
