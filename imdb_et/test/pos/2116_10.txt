Anyone interested in Texas must have this DVD. It's just a good movie about true Texas, with great scenes. It took a lot of Texas to do this right. Hollywood would never have received it. There are so many fine things that Tubb put in the film and may not even think about it, but it makes the show. <br /> <br /> Guests are not expected to come at all. Every letter fits perfectly and does not pull the movie. Many visitors are so perfect that when you roll on credit, you go back to the movie to find the movie. Strait's roll is dead, it can't be better done in real life. <br /> <br /> The other side of the movie is completely different from the first, it's a little "hockey," but that's fine. Somehow running a story. "Hokey" stuff is like a post-school special, but it seems plausible and natural. <br /> <br /> I've never heard anyone use Sonny Pruitt earlier than the locals I grew up with. It was a cake color for me. <br /> <br /> Certainly it is collectible, right there with Pure Country, Sugarland Express, Jr. Bonner, Texasville, The Last Picture Show, Giant and Of course Hud. <br /> <br /> Gig'em Aggies '86
