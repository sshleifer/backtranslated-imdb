A fun, entertaining movie about WWII German spy (Julie Andrews!), Falling in love with an American pilot (Rock Hudson), trying to get her secrets. For some reason, critics attacked it in 1970 when the public died of it - I don't understand why. It is beautifully fired, with wonderful costumes and interiors and exciting balloons. Andrewsel has also cut the tape (strictly PG material) and sang the beautiful song "Whistling in the Dark". The film has problems. Andrews and Hudson did not reach this time - and it shows. Their love scenes lack spark and have zero-sex chemistry. However, they switch to OK in playback. The film is a bit long (even a 105-minute director cut saw) and ends up being too dark and serious. It's still worth catching. Try to see how the directors cut ... the other runs for half an hour longer!
