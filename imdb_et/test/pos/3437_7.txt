"Jaded" should not be considered an erotic thriller, because sexual scenes are not meant to look joy unlike films like "Human Behavior" or "Family Friend". <br /> <br /> "Jaded" is not easy to see, because it is hard to imagine the story and it is not common in society. From the beginning of the movie, with the first scene, stronger scenes are expected. <br /> <br /> Rape was not (in my opinion) a well-created scene. I think the director did not use general camera techniques in the film. That's why it sometimes seems boring and boring almost to the end. <br /> <br /> The performances are very good in all five female characters. These women gave strong, intense but incredible performances that show the dramatic abilities of the actors. <br /> <br /> Legal concepts helped to understand the plot's severity because the legal term for sodomy differs from simple rape. From the point of view of defending meg, sodomy must be punished as rape (a large class B crime), although it is a different crime. Pat and Alex's defense minister claim that Meg enjoyed and asked for it. This is where the film becomes interesting to see who is trying to tell the truth. Surely the only thing is that the sex element fits into the legal definition of a crime. <br /> <br /> See "Jaded" if you like legal issues that aren't very common in your society. If not, try it because it's a very good and strong drama.
