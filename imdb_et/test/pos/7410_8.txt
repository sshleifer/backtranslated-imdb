I thought the human tragedies of war were humble. A small but altruistic view of a family's interaction with an enemy during the Kentucky Civil War. This film reduces the "glamor" of war; it shows its effect not only on the soldier, but on the whole family. <br /> <br /> Many modern movies show war as an opportunity to emphasize war heroes and other glamorous qualities, but very few events to show the true impact of war actually take the community. This movie is trying to look at the memory of these people these days. This film is an open translation of actual events, when in reality this film is probably the reality of hundreds, maybe thousands of "real events" during the civil war. I am very interested in seeing this film for those interested in our civil war.
