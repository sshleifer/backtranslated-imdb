Not as well known as English, American, German and French cinema, although the 20th cinema from Sweden was also quite good, interesting and revolutionary. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is his story. The story is about the way A Christmas Carol, where death itself falls to the dead for his past, present and what might have been. This is, of course, a story that focuses on morality and does it very well. The message is very robust and effective. Of course, this is also due to the effective management of the father of Swedish cinema; Victor Sjöström. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the novel by Selma Lagerlöf from other Swedish writers. This story is customized by Victor Sjöström, who might have had to issue some more elements to make the story and film move better. Maybe it will take a while before the film begins to get into shape and the story becomes clear, but in the form and pace of the film it becomes really wonderful. <br /> <br /> Not only does the film have a great story, it also looks good. The film uses some early and effective effects and uses the right color filters to create the right mood and shows what it is, past, present and future. <br /> <br /> He also plays the main character. Of course, the operation of the film is from time to time, according to today's standards, but not as bad as, for example, the early German films. After all, this film is more of a story and a moral than it does, so it's not really important or annoying. <br /> <br /> A really big and effective underrated silent film class from Sweden. <br /> <br /> 9/10
