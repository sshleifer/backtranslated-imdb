Oh, I remember this exhibition at 16.00. during my higher days. It was not a pleasant experience because I remember watching it while doing my homework. <br /> <br /> However, the play showed my attention when Alex showed his special powers and dealt with typical younger problems. > <br /> But the exhibition was not just about adventures and special powers; for the younger audience, it was more of an educational force to gain more interest in schools and biology. <br /> <br /> Leading actor (don't remember his name and I'm too lazy to copy and paste the main details) gave a fantastic result. He made the show traceable. <br /> <br /> They just don't make such shows anymore ...
