The first adventure of Jim Henson's beloved Mupet characters is a highly competent musical comedy, such as Kermit. Frog leaves his carefree and warm surroundings on bright lights (eg by the broken Hollywood representative Dom DeLue who heard him); on the journey he meets Fozzie Bear (James Coburn at El Sleazo, who is a cheater for Telly Savala and Madeline Kahn, a patron!), a piano playing dog Rowlf, the best drummers on animals and his board back, funky band, Queen Miss Piggy beauty egomaniacal (ceremony led by Elliott Gould and Edgar Bergen) and so on. Kermit et al. continued frogleg burger magnate Charles Durning and reluctant Austin Pendleton, sold cars, ice cream and balloons according to Milton Berle, Bob Hope and Richard Pryor, who offered food by the stealth waiter Steve Martin, almost mad German scientist Mel Brooks and finally I landed the mogul of the listening movie at the Orson Welles office (who is the secretary of Cloris Leachman! A pleasant singing point is Paul Williams' pleasure to appear as a live pianist at El Sleazo. For a record, I've recently acquired four following Muppet movies and I should watch them for weeks, when their turn arrives.
