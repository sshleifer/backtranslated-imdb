It's a very enjoyable, well-functioning film. It's funny and sometimes fun. The final is a bit disappointing because it tries to pack everything in a clean package. The film is better remembered for its priceless vignettes: Jane Austen's play, camping trip for example. B&H does not attempt to reflect the dominant attitudes towards homosexuality and bisexuality. Most symbols are against sexual diversity. In this sense, it is a happy holiday from a homophobic society. And this is a sign of flexibility, a relaxation of rigid sexual categories - perhaps a happy future.
