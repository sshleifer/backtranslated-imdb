From the perspective of a hectic, modern world where we live, so-called good old days always seem so peaceful and innocent; the idyllic time that has passed on the silver screen is only memories and shadows, such as 'Christmas In Connecticut', a warm and loving film directed by Peter Godfrey. Barbara Stanwyck stands for Elizabeth Lane, a journalist of the popular magazine Martha Stewart, who writes about life on her beloved farm in Connecticut, always with the latest recipe. One of his biggest fans is Alexander Yardley, played by the magazine publisher Sidney Greenstreet. Yardley has never visited his farm, and in response to the idea expressed by her sister Mary (Joyce Compton), she decides to spend her old fashioned Christmas with Elizabeth, her husband and child, and as a special guest, some Mr Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan), a sailor just returned from a fifteen-day raft after the ship's torpedoing. Of course, Elizabeth cannot refuse her boss, but there are problems; not the least of them is that he does not have a farm and writes his column in the comfort of a high-rise building. This makes him and his editor, Dudley Beecham (Robert Shayne), in a precarious situation, because one thing Mr Yardley demands from his staff is full honesty. Here is a charming and pleasantly romantic comedy that brings the audience back to seemingly simpler times and places, sharing a Christmas party with a warm fireplace, good food and goodness. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck absolutely sparkles like Elizabeth, with a smile and presence warmer than what the biggest fire could offer, and completely persuasive as a city girl completely out of the farm. Morgan also has a price and a bit na√Øve sailor whose confidence with his companion is admirable. Even if the scam surrounds him, he is a guy you know, but I land on his feet and eventually it's Elizabeth. However, one of the real joys of the film is Sidney Greenstreet. His Yardley has an outer surface, but you will undoubtedly know that this is a man whose heart is as big as Texas. It's a simple, honest imagination and a joy to watch her. The most memorable scenes in the movie are her. <br /> <br /> Supporting part includes Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan), terrible Una O'Connor (Norah), Frank Jenks (Sinkewicz) and Dick Elliott (Judge Crothers). A good powerful movie that plays especially during Christmas (though it would work every season) is a memorable movie that won't take you too seriously, thoroughly lifting up and leaving you in a warm heart and a feeling of peace that makes the world feel. It's a real classic and one you don't want to miss. I appreciate this one 10/10. <br /> <br />
