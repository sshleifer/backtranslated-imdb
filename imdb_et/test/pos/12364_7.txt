Victor Sjöström was the captain of this film, having played, directed and even written a script! It's pretty amazing. Although today there is little idea that Sjöström was, he may be familiar to Ingmar Bergman fans as the star of Bergman's most famous films WILD STRAWBERRIES. <br /> <br /> This movie is a very confused bag. On the one hand, you must respect it, because in 1921 it is a very good film. The idea that Grim Reaper sits with a dead person to discuss his wasted life is quite imaginative. In addition, the special effect of Phantom's transportation is quite convincing and technically it is a well-designed film. On the other hand, it is an amazingly dated and preaching film - more like something you should expect from a Sunday school instead of an honest theater. In addition, some animal elements do not make sense. Instead of leaving as a dedicated or a good one, a Salvation Army worker who dies seems to be a juicy - very sad and confusing juice. Why does he "love" this man? Am I missing something? <br /> <br /> So my suggestion is that if you are quiet in love (like me), always look at it. But if you are not a silent fan, this film may not convince you that this style film is brilliant because the story is so melodic and dated.
