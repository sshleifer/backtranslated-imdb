I saw this movie on Monday with Mr. Zwarts hometown in Fredrikstad. There, between managers, musicians and other Norwegian celebrities, I laughed and laughed ... I just couldn't stop. If you like black humor comedy, sharp lines and a great actress - this is one tip you need to see! It's like mixing "True Romance" and "The Wedding Singer" and add a dash "Mad about you" Hilarios! <br /> <br /> 10 points!
