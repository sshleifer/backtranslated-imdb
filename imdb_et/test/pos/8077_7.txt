So forgive * really * flat play-play scene, cardboard background and studio like stadium. For this part I should have given 7 instead of movie 5, but read on ... <br /> <br /> There are many similarities to "Substitutions" on the platform. Some say this movie hangs in "Substitutions", while some say this script wrote it. <br /> <br /> Both films require some "suspension of belief on a basic basis, and this is especially difficult for" Second String "because it has a NFL licensing team and all the history behind it. not to mention the strings, the big scores have to be overcome over and over again, with the budget limited to shooting the game team, which makes it even worse. <br /> <br "In substitution" the prerequisite and the league are fictional, but you know that this happens in real life, I believe it is easier to receive a fictitious story and setup with a real event ("oh yes, this happens before!" with a fictional scenario ("Bill can't win a Superbowl!"; some scenes were actually a season Raven game, real stadium, real audience, and some NFL game at a similar shooting angle. <br /> <br /> But let's say both movies came out the same day and we'll delete the budget factor (so it was missed) ive gaming scene): In general, I like the "second string" over "Replacement", not much, but I like it more. <br /> <br /> This has a "relatively better" character development. In "substitutions", the Keanu character is too "synchronized with the world" and all he cares about may be a girl? In the second string, you see QB struggle to return to work and deal with his past coach. Or a dirty problem. Of course, this "ball-keeping all day" solution is not new, but we see progress in determining it. <br /> <br /> How do you play these tricks? I think it is "relatively realistic" than "Replacement". "Dan Marino" as a fake knee pass, flea flicker, wild cat full back rush, all real except sometimes it seems a bit too easy. But for me it is better than "Replacement" in the middle to catch and rush the 50 meter call or how the 60 meter long field goal is too easy. OH BTW, I'm glad they didn't force the TE kicker to shoot .... <br /> <br /> Of course --- if you look at this movie objectively over other football movies, it may just be 5 of 10 movies. But some say it's a worse football movie? Try "The Comebacks".
