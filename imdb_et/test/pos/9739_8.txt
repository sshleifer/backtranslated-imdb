The brainchild of "Flash Gordon" by Alex Raymond, the pioneer of comics, was the greatest father of all sci-fi epics. This series is the first time Flash was brought to life in celluloid. Despite the small budget, it is a great opera opera. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the devastating destruction of Earth, when the planet Mongo comes through space in a collision course. Maverick's scientist Dr. Zarkov manages a self-esteemed missile ship for the upcoming planet, making sure he can do something to stop the retreating body. He gets some last-minute recruits in the form of the inventive athlete Flash Gordon and the beautiful Dale Arden. When they arrive in Mongo, their problems really start. They run against the fearsome emperor Ming, the savior of his world, the conqueror, who have ambitious plans for the Earth. mixed foreign cultures with which it is exposed; the allies he does; the spaceships he flies; The battles he is fighting, and the monsters he captures. Here is the echo of famous stories like Troy and Camelot and Sherwood Forrest. You have a passionate, beautiful hero to save the kingdom (Flash); King of evil (Ming); Old Wise Man (Zarkov); Lovely girl (Dale); seductive siren (Aura); loyal allies (Thun, Barin, Vultan); Plus monsters, dragons and various beasties. <br /> <br /> Flash is a modern Robin Hood, Jason or Beowulf. Ming is Prince John or Aggamemnon. Dale is Helen of Troy or Gwenevere or Maid Marion. Zarkov is Merlin or Odysseus. (Or Gandalf) Thun / Barin / Vultan are good men or knights on the round table. <br /> <br /> You get the idea. <br /> <br /> You can't help but notice how many ideas of "Flash Gordon" appear later in STAR WARS. Cloud City; Ice World; Forest moon; Scrollable opening text (from the second series); There are others, but you get the essence. The whole sci-fi genre owes much debt to this timeless classic. <br /> <br /> Buster Crabb is the perfect way to act, and I personally think he has a better role than any current action. stars. He also played Buck Rogers and Tarzani. <br /> <br /> Charles Middleton is stupid as Ming's embodiment. Of course, he seems a bit melodramatic today, but that was what was expected of their bad guys in the 30s. <br /> <br /> Jean Rogers is interested in our hero's love with Dale Arden, and I had the impression when I first saw him. I can easily understand why Flash always saved me. She is the main good girl who contrasts with the seductive manipulation of Aura, the central bad girls. <br /> <br /> Supporting casting seemed to be the perfect choice for emulating comic strips and despite the stupid FX now. it was an exciting action in this groundbreaking series. <br /> <br /> The whole fun romp and the start of the movie's sci-fi genre.
