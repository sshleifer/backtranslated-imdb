I consider myself a random fan of Dario Argento. By any really good flick (like "Deep Red" and "Tenebre"), it looks like it's the same. However, there is no denial that, if he is his best, there are few horror leaders who can do it. I find "Opera" Argento's best work. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a movie with all its brands. There are no well-developed characters and the plot makes little sense when you start checking it. However, think of Argento as Brian DePalma's European equivalent - style is all that matters here, so much it becomes a substance. A typical Argentole, there are some beautifully filmed murders. Those who do not know the work of a man can perceive it as a sadistic comment (and perhaps taking into account their often time-scoring), but that is true. Argento takes on the outstanding visual detail of the murder. She really turns graphic violence into an art form. Plus, his direction and his films look perfect. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Opera is one of his most frightening products. Argento is the only director I feel that flourishing rock music works well in horror sequences (when others try to pull it out, it's terrible). They work differently because Cristina Marsillach plays a beautiful and reasonably sympathetic but never-animating nooroper. The rest of the participants are workers and work done, but again, with argon, it never does. Its beautiful colors, terrible violence and a common fever dream / nightmare. (9/10)
