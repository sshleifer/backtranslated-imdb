Now, more than ever, we need peace and love in this world! <br /> <br /> This movie is a great proof of the wonderful music of Broadway and the fabulous choreography of the legendary Twila Tharp! I saw it again after many years, and it's still fine. <br /> <br /> Thank you for putting MGM / UA on this DVD! I love the opportunity to see on the widescreen. MGM stones do so on many of your DVDs. <br /> <br /> Ya must love Treat Williams like Berger and John Savage as Claude. They couldn't choose the best actors and actors for this movie! Beverly D'Angelo is such a "hot mama" in such a movie - I forgot how hot! WOW! <br /> <br /> Strong cast is absolutely great, <br /> <br /> with the late Nell Carter, who makes a couple of scenes on the scene, as well as the coir Charlotte Ray (Mrs Garrett's 'Facts about life') <br /> <br /> The story ends a bit, but in the late 1960s, the anti-war mood is still relevant and relevant today. <br /> <br /> It's beautifully filmed (quite a bit on the ground) and is so colorful and cute and really enhances the spirit of 1968 on the big screen. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie when it was released in 1979 when I was 15, and then moved, and it still moves in 40. Some of the other reviews here say they think it should have been done before - I don't think Hollywood was ready to make such a movie at the end of the '60s in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> The Vietnam War ended in 1975 and the whole thing went a little too close to home, I think this story will be filmed before it was (like 1969, 70, 71) <br /> <br /> Bravo to Milos Foreman! I love this movie !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> It's nice to see it again, this time on DVD. It was never better!
