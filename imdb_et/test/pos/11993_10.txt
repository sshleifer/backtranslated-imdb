One of the most interesting things is that this 1988 film is very intuitive as a "only name" sequel. There's nothing wrong with that, except: Chevy Chase's return to Ty Webb. It connects the viewer with that character (from the original Caddyshack in 1980) and makes fans think or want Caddyshack II to be similar to the first one. <br /> <br /> There are rumors that Rodney Dangerfield had to return. He carried much of the first film so his return would be Caddyshack 2. Jackie Mason is "new" Rodney for this movie and does a decent job, although their comic delivery is different. Dan Aykroyd was a big but not enough movie. He should have included how much of the screen was Bill Murray in the first. Robert Stack (airplane!) Was a good new "Ted Knight / Villian" role. (We miss you, Ted!) Danny Noonan should have come back. So many others could have shown back what happened to their characters eight years later. Bushwood shouldn't have gone through the entire makeover. Instead, the characters concerned, not the club itself, should have been as they were in the first. When you watch this movie, remember that this is not a big sequel and you may think it is another good or bad eighties comedy. The first fans should see it, but should not be shocked if the original and part II comparisons are so far away.
