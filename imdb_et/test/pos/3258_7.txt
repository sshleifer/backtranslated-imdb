"Two Hands" is a fun Australian gangster movie that has been placed in the real home of Sydney. I bet the tourists never plan to see Sydney and Bondi look out for this movie: all sweaty bodies, the overwhelming night, and the gangsters in nylon shorts and jandals. Heath Ledger is watching an amateur boxer, becoming part of the local King's Cross boss. She seemed pretty wonderful with her green female beater and blue smuggler. A sweaty tattooed body changes from him. I've always been a "Boy and Home" boy, and he's been in this soap that's a little milder than Weetbix's "neighbors". The film is really worth seeing a combination of this sardonic humor and unpleasant violence - the drowning state will soon require nightmares. Totty Awards: Country girl love the interest of city brother and tattooed streetkid.
