I wish I could have met with East Lupine. If people ask you who would have 6 extraordinary 20th century people for dinner, then I would be one person. I think he is now one of the biggest people in the film industry who is not experienced and experienced. His biography would change with a great TV movie (Hey, Mr. Bogdanovich ........). East Lupino has been the driving force behind many exciting 40s and 50s films. I remember seeing that he saw him in a terrible part when the AIP film was in the late 1970s. He was bitten by a big worm at the kitchen sink. Ugh. I should have contacted him when he died not long ago .. more than a worm. East Lupino was often a producer and leading actor on the dangerous soil of the High Sierra, Roadhouse and Emergency RKO thriller. Later, with his wife, Howard Duff, there were many timeless noir dramas that are still very engaging. One of them is JENNIFER, which I think is the last film with monograms. In 1953, Monogram officially renamed Allied Artist and JENNIFER has both company names on opening credits. This is a boss haunted house thriller, which is as frightening as 8 years later by both The Innocents and The Haunting. Really chilling and very creepy, this little movie is just such a great movie from East Lupino. Try it and find it ... you always remember it and as I feel it is a great and almost forgotten actor / producer.
