I like this movie because all the stars and dance and the story that comes with it. Rita Hayworth was the most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were proud. Though musical, I thought Rita Hayworth made a dramatic show in this film. As for his dancing, I think he was great. Even Betty Grable confirmed Rita's dance in this movie when she commented that Rita was dancing around her own dance and face, Betty Grable was a great dancer. Cinematography and vivid colors are also mentioned. Rita wants to be a magazine cover girl, but she's also in love with her mentor, played by Gene Kelly. Does he leave Kelly to fulfill the love of his dreams and bypass and the Broadway Stardom, or will he stay around to find a unique pearl that will change his life forever? You have to watch the movie to find out!
