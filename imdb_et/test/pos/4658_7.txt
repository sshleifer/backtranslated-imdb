Somewhere in the dark wells of my brain cells, I play a song in my head. I will not forget how hard I try. It's MIDNIGHT MADNESS and it's going to get you! I want to find a copy of it in a 45-minute recording. Five different teams run by one night L.A. The two unkempt game-champion with two proud assistants is the champion of all the madness that will trigger LA. All the teams are stereotypes (this film has been in the hands of Eddie Deezen since 1980, before the political correctness has been turned upside down): "good guys", "nerds" led by "jocks", "no-need" a-man type women ", especially redhead. Undoubtedly the twins are screaming. And finally, "bad guys" with Stephen Furst. Furst is funny as an overweight slave Harold, whose attempt to use a computer to decipher various clues leads to confusion. Such films are no longer made. These days, the films must have slightly darker characters and other meaningless "edginess". Go back to the days when "good guys" led by David Naughton were still good and not hopelessly in conflict. So get all the serious complaints and go back to the 1980s. This is MIDNIGHT MADNESS. . .
