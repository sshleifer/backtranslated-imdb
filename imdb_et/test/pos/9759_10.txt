Jean Paget, Joe Harman and Noel Strachan - all are insecure heroes and survivors. Petite, but strong Jean, whose strength and determination to save lives, drives hundreds of miles and peaceful self-discipline and persuasive powers, Joe Harman ("oh my word"), who took risks against Jean and other prisoners, only the worst imaginable pain and Noel Strahan who trusted Jean, regardless of the odds. His good humor and resilience will inspire everyone around him, and those who have the courage to go with him will be rewarded. Beautiful scenery and musical result adds adventure. Despite the length, I was never bored. These ordinary people did extraordinary things and were based on a real story. Someone borrowed my VHS a few years ago and I never saw it again and again. Learned my lesson, mates and buys another copy. It is a shame that the mini devices are not on the DVD.
