I liked this movie too much. My only problem is that I thought the actor who played the criminal was a small rent Michael Ironside. Corse Ironside is just a small rent for Jack Nicholson. I think Mike was busy "Highlander 2: The Quickening" this year. Unfortunately, Beastmaster 2 would have been a much better career move. This is definitely the best Beastmaster in the series and in many ways resembles this great big screen classic, "Universe Masters". Not only does this mean incomparable Mark Singer, but also the amazing supportive cast, especially the second "Slider" girl, Uncle Phili's "Fresh Prince of Belair" and the evil chick "Superman 2". It shook my world and it must be seen by anyone who has no social or physical outlets. BEASTMASTER FOREVER !!! ROCK'N ROLL !!!
