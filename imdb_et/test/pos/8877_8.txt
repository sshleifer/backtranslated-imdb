One thing I really do not forget about this movie is its beginning: classic comedy, brilliant mastery. I love it. Look at it for yourself (here's no spoiler! :-). DeVito and Crystal sparring in the movie, DeVito is the perfect oppressed son. One of my favorites. Highly recommended for Crystal fans.
