Miyazaki has been making his mojo since the 1970s and lately his films have turned it into an American shore of Disney and fans of his great talents. Ponyo is no exception. While some of his other films are more easily accessible to the US audience, some may find a bit of the "Japanese" variety. For the same reason, Pom Poko is very "Japanese" and the US audience does not make sense, so there are also some Ponyo elements. It should not harm you from the fun movie of growth, hope and friendship. <br /> <br /> What is good is Miyazaki's very complicated and magical animation and story with miracle and fantasy elements. This, together with the characteristic use of characteristic development and the main characters, often use girls and women. He gets out of his zone with Ponyo, as the main character is a little boy who lives with his mother in a small village by the sea when his father is at work on the high seas. Although not lonely, Sosuke is like any other curious boy who likes adventure and sea fun. Like spiritual strangers, we see different worlds of people and marine creatures, and I feel that Miyazaki can try to draw the attention of viewers to the vast and undiscovered nature of things that live under the sea and with our acceptance and affairs. it is different. <br /> <br /> I was able to see the last year's subtitled version and I was pleased with this story and plot. Miyazaki has argued that "this is my last film" for many years, but soon after he was thrilled he gave us hope for a moving castle. Ponyo is definitely a proof that Miyazaki has not hung up on his forces and continues to enjoy joy, innovation and the most creative animated films of all time. Look at Pony's open mind and hatred childhood fantasy and imagination, and you will be transported back when catching fireflies and secret hiding places were more important than dull adult stuff and eating your vegetables.
