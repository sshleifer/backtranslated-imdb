Hadnt heard a lot about this movie except that it was a National Award and an Oscar. His marathon film, I can't put the marathon out of the orange apple. But when I saw a movie that played on Sunday night in DD1, I just joined. Now I'm not a judge of cinematographic techniques and operational skills. But I've been watching a lot of movies, for a variety of genres and for the average viewer I recommend this movie. The feeling is very good and realistic, although there are some melodramatic moments. See that you know people. Recently, he has not seen any film about the heart, especially in the Hindi cinema. The crowning achievement of the film is when the young boy returns home. The camera is moving around to expose the boy, wearing black glasses, having lost his eyes, the boy hears that other children are spraying with water and are killing. I was amazed. And the two hours I spent watching the movie - very worth it :-)
