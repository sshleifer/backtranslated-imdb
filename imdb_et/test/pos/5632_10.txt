It can actually be the best film of 1999. No. I'm not kidding. This documentary, directed by Chris Smith, takes into account the spirit of artistic compulsion. Smith does the smart things that every filmmaker should do: he keeps the invisible and refuses to judge his subject. <br /> <br /> As the viewer looks at Mark and his efforts, no matter how functionally aggressive they can stop their movies. He refuses to compromise and repeatedly suffers. But to forget, remember Speilberg, Scorsese, and others began to humble. <br /> <br /> And what a great subject he chooses. Mark, his family and friends are all exciting characters that are much more than the characters created in fictional cinematographic products last year. This film vibrates on touching comedy, tragedy, sympathy, and guides us to every viewer who wants to create, despite talent problems, to hit their bucks and do something. <br /> <br /> The film has talked about artists and their passions. This also applies to families, regardless of their dependency and dysfunction, and how unique and beautiful the organism is. Mark proves in the film that he is fully committed not only to his dreams, but also to his family - and to him. <br /> <br /> Why this film was not a candidate for the documentary of the year, between me and the criminal (that is, it was eligible last year). This movie must be searched and valued.
