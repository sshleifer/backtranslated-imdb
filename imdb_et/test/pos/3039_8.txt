I do not see it as the best movie ever made by Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Coming Home) but a true respect for teachers. to reach a group of students and bring them to the main literacy and awareness world. His methods were criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs like Mr. Skeffington (Hume Cronyn), but teachers like Conroy are always winners. high for him. he did not play a role and I found that he was completely plausible. Voight is Conrack. <br /> <br /> In addition to teaching love, we also see another important point in this film. No matter how good you are in your work, when you are expensive, the bureaucrats will get you.
