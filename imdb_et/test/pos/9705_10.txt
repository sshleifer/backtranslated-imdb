Johnny Knoxville and Jackass boys move over "Jackass Number Two". When the press was screened, laughter was so loud and striking that the whole dialogue was hard to hear. Stunts are up and the worship is more funny and outrageous than ever. <br /> <br /> All the boys put their strength to make a big movie and they succeeded. If you like this genre, you love this movie. If not, don't worry. <br /> <br /> Some of the funniest bits are the bowels that the boys play themselves, and they don't think what happens to them. They're doing something for stunt work. Many critics have tried Johnny Knoxville for a less active role in the first film, but not to worry, he is number two in the front and middle, and they have enough material to be halfway. Number triple. <br /> <br /> This must be for fans of this type of humor. <br /> <br /> Chris Sansone, Entertainment Editor, Fort Bend Herald
