I saw it for the first time in the 70s on syndicate television and admired the values ​​of the production that were high-tech by that time. Remastered video is rich and colorful, much more intense than light 35mm TVs. This film deserves more attention: it paved the way for UFO, Space: 1999, and even Star Wars with detailed miniatures and smart ideas. Of course, the story of an alternative anti-material planet Earth has been recycled 100 times since Star Trek, but the beauty of this film is its self-conscious European elegant design: Rolls Royce's spacecraft to the Euro Sec letterhead business document, JFSS or Dopplegangers, as called in Europe, is enjoyable for the imaginary vision of Europe in the shadow of superpowers. The ambitious epic of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson is a bit annoying when the American astronaut finally realizes that he is on the doppleganger's surface and is literally downward after entering a poetically graceful pendulum train. The mediocre story has contributed to the great and lyrical classical score given by the recent great Barry Gray, UK John Williams.
