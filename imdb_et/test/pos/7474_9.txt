I saw this movie in Paris. I accidentally went to the wrong theater and I realized that it was not a preview or a short film. <br /> <br /> Paulina does phenomenal work with her attention. I can't say enough if I had the impression that I saw this with the death of a real femme. The rest of the majority also very well. Don't make me wrong, it's not the biggest movie ever made, but because I didn't know anything about it, I got a lasting and very positive impression. <br /> <br /> Finally, French didn't speak French once! I didn't stop talking about this movie 3 weeks after that.
