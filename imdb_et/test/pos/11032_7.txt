I remember this movie, it was the first movie I was in the cinema I watched where the picture was in dark places where I was very nervous, it was back 74/75 my dad took me to my brother and sister in Newbury cinema Newbury Berkshire England. I remember movie tigers and lots of snow, as well as the appearance of Grizzly Adams actor Dan Haggery, which I think one of the tigers will get down and die. If anyone knows where to find it on DVD, etc., please let me know. Now the cinema is turned into a sports club, which is a great shame, because the nearest cinema is now 20 miles away, it would be nice to hear from others who have seen this film or the like.
