There have been many films about people who return home from wars and who they can handle, but "War at home" is worth it. The Vietnamese veteran Jeremy Collier (Emilio Estevez), who has difficulty connecting with his Texas family, is very likely to have done much of the film. But nothing can prepare you if it does. <br /> <br /> Part of what makes this movie so good is how it gives the viewer both a Texas and a generation gap. Jeremy's parents, Bob (Martin Sheen) and Maurine (Kathy Bates), obviously have a problem with their son's attitude to both war and American rejection. His sister Karen (Kimberly Williams) is not sure who she is with. But after dinner there can be no neutrality. <br /> <br /> So we Americans may never get over the Vietnam War completely, but this movie may obviously help us seriously look at how it affects many people. Emilio Estevez certainly did a good job. Also starring Corin Nemec and Carla Gugino.
