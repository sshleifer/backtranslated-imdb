"Nuovomondo (2006)" (shown in US "The Golden Door") was written and directed by Emanuele Crialese. This movie is different - and I think it's better - than most movies of impoverished people who leave Europe and come to the United States. <br /> <br /> The film starts with the poor, rural scenes of Sicily. We always hear that Sicily is a rocky island, but you don't really understand the consequences of this phrase until you see the "Golden Door" for the first half hour. <br /> <br /> The center of the movie is dedicated to a long trip to the US. Most of the immigration films show us ten minutes of people in the third grade section as a sick sea and then show us the Degree of Freedom. Not that movie - we understand life below the formation and it's not charming. (We don't really see the Freedom Ward.) <br /> <br /> Finally, a typical film gives us ten more minutes to Ellis Iceland and then immigrants enter the New York Lower East Side. Not here - Ellis Iceland's experience is about one-third of film material. <br /> <br /> Vincenzo Amato is outstanding as Salvatore Mancuso, who brings his two sons and his mother to the new world. Charlotte Gainsbourg is as good as Lucy Reed, a mysterious English woman who speaks fluent Italian. <br /> <br /> The film has some strange touches, especially Nina Simone's songs. There must be a symbolism, but I couldn't understand it. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer has already pointed out that this movie is better viewed in theater than on DVD. Still, a big screen or a small screen is worth a look.
