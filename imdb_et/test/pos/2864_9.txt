Okay, I celebrated this spoiler, so don't irritate me when I roll it up. Now I went to the movie to wait for a very predictable movie. And I was right because almost every horror blow I've ever seen was predictable, but not as bad as most. What helped the story, I didn't expect Kane's madness to be "WHY". But there was, and somewhat foggy, you still got the idea and realized the madness. Now, of course, if you like something that frightens you for the night, it's not the movie you're looking for. But if a Saw fan or any other film claiming that their fame is due to sadistic content, this is the movie to watch. Now that I really spoil the spoiler for another warning. I give this movie 9, perhaps because I am a WWE fan and a Kane fan, but who doesn't like the movie a little better when he celebrates someone we love. But this movie could have scored 10 for me. . . (spoiler) ----> at the end of the movie when it showed Kane a death on the sidewalk. Although the dog in the pee was "CUTE", it could have been a classic Kane / Undertaker with a quick sitting and turning. The perfect 10 would have been if it had happened. It was a great opportunity, but did not WWE think about it or the future sequel begins with what I mentioned. That is all. (9)
