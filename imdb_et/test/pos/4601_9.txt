This movie was quite a pleasant surprise. I had been waiting for this for a long time and was afraid that it would not meet my expectations. <br /> <br /> It surpassed them. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie <br /> <br /> Fun from start to finish (just stay after the end of the credit!) It is quite remarkable how stupid and annoying characters can be so smart, smart and interesting . <br /> <br /> This is an obvious matte paintings, the future Earth of the film resembles the Planet Apes series and other Sci-Fi movies of this era. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film is essentially Planet of the Apes, but with people who are the spiritual equivalent of monkeys. <br /> <br /> It moves at a rather lively pace, and Luke Wilson wears the movie quite well, with a character that resembles what he played in a "bottle-rocket". "(In the earlier scene, there is even a slight nuance of the" bottle rocket "). <br /> <br /> Maya Rudoulph is also surprisingly good as a former" painter "who was also frozen. <Br /> <br /> Despite all his Of the strengths, the "Idiocrat" movie is a distinct feeling that was removed from the director / editor before it was refined. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why a movie that's funny would just be in a theater without advanced screening there are no trailers, no marketing. <br /> <br /> It would have been like a studio that they decided not to spend anymore or maybe they thought the film had a cult classic, and the only way to become a true cult class was that it didn't work Anyway, it is a shame, because Mike Judge and especially this film deserve a better one. <br /> <br /> I predict that this movie will have real feet on the DVD and the word mouth will drive to the success it deserves. /> <br /> Maybe Fox leaders saw themselves in the characters, confused, and thought it was a documentary?
