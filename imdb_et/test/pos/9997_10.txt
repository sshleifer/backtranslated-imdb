Wow, here's another great golf game. It has been at least three in the last few years that I really enjoyed, well done, beautifully filmed and inspiring. The other two were "Bobby Jones: Genius Strike" and "The Legend Of Bagger Vance". <br /> <br /> This is a real undercut when ever there was. To get the amateur to capture all the professionals and win the United States Open Golf Tournament is an outrageous feat. I believe that this is the only time in 100 years when it has ever been achieved. How much of this movie is fiction, decorated with a dramatic effect, I don't know. I know I plan to read the book and I know that in real life Francis Ouimetil had a three-lead lead with only two holes, unlike what we saw in the movie. <br /> <br /> Whatever. The victory of Francis Ouime over the Harry Vardon and Ted Ray Golf Marks is a fact. This is an amazing story and the filmmakers did it up here. It is not just something for golf fans; this is a fun movie. Knit for an actor-turned director Bill Paxton for a great job. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's just golf, but there are subplots like Ouimet's relationship with his father and a beautiful young woman who's probably interested in her. It is also a story about giving someone a small child a chance. The film also discusses the Vardon demons that come from the wrong side of the rails and try to do it in the elite sport that it was for Europeans and Americans. <br /> <br /> Shia LaBeouf is as powerful as Ouimet as Steven Dillane as Vardon. For those who don't know, Vardon, like his day, was Tiger Woods, perhaps even insurmountable. The film depicts Vardon as a warm and nice guy; real person. another big competitor Ray (Stephen Marcus) is somewhat brutal nasty guy. <br /> <br /> The fourth main character of this golf story can be the coolest person in the movie: the fifth classic boy who finishes the Ouime frame. He (Josh Flitter) brings a lot of humor and charm to the film. <br /> <br /> If all of this - two powerful plus-hidden feature films and the last hole down - wasn't true, you think, "Oh, man, this is a hockey. Who could believe it?" This makes the story of this real life fun to finally capture the movie. As with another sports film of 2005 - "Cinderella Man" - here is another great film that was unfairly ignored when it came to prizes. I think nice movies won't win prizes ..... just the hearts of their viewers.
