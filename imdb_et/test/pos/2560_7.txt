Better than I expected a movie that sells itself under the premise of nymphomania and inter-racial inheritance. The music is great and the cinematic work focuses heavily on converting Ricci into a Betty Paige trailer trolley and it works. Samuel L. can scream a lot of what he's good at, as well as playing a lot of blues guitar he sees cool. Even Justin Timberlake was a boy with mental disorder. I have the feeling that this material would have been a complete s *% #, but I just managed to remove the barley from its strange little transgressive cellulose niche, but still an effective drama.
