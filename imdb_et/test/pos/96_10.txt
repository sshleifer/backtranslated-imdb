Having grown up in Canada, I saw it many times in the CBC. I've seen it many times, many ages in my life, and every time the reactions are the same. This is a cheerful bittersweet, a beautifully animated movie that pulls in your heart. I'm sure I have it on some VHS tapes somewhere digging. <br /> <br /> Every growing boy can be related to the situation and wants to fit his favorite generations. Scene and see the kids face when her mother fills the Eatons catalog and her jumping around the room is invaluable. I have not seen anyone who did not see this young man's carefree mood on the film and this little short story. <br /> <br /> Of course I am a Montreal enthusiast and it gives me special recognition. Ultimately, it is the nostalgic look and feel of the pond hockey and the memories of your family that will tell you that you should be excellent for what you get, even if it is not what you wanted. And yes, the animation is also beautiful;) <br /> <br /> of 10 out of 10
