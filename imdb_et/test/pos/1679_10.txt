Rififi deserves a reputation for the famous harp-scene, and this scene deserves all this credit. It is a masterful piece, characteristic of communication and photography. But Rififs is not exactly this one scene - the scene of each film is both masterfully assembled and taught as a whole, not only temporary, plot and character, but a divinely spoken moral story that sets the scene for a movie for the next few years. <br /> <br /> Kinematically and technically, the sequence of throws can be the most impressive scene in the film, but for me this is the last scene with the most powerful - Tony le St√©phanoise's hallucinogenic redemption.
