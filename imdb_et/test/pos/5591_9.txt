This story of the troubles caused by the excessive, impossible, dominant and reckless mother (Laura Hope Crews) for her two grown sons and their girls is a powerful tool for Irene Dunni (new daughter-in-law), Joel McCrea (number-one son ), Eric Linden (number two sons) and Frances Dee (double sibling). Here's a show of pure tyranny of the mother's jealousy and peculiarity, because four good people find their own lives damaged, their plans changed, and their identities threatened. Irene Dunn is a star in her role. Joel McCrea's performance is open and clear, and Laura Hope Crews is the mother's masterful. <br /> <br /> But this reviewer believes Frances Dee is the best. He is the first sign of the story that shows the strength of his inner feelings. His depiction of his broken heartbeat on the heartbeat is intestinal intake and even raw. Dee casts the viewer and takes you to your pain without even seeing the face! <br /> <br /> Frances Dee, like Laura Hope Crews, has been overlooked for too long and is now almost forgotten as a great actor who she was. No actor who started the film after World War II has said anything about Frances Dee. <br /> <br /> If you are lucky to see the silver wire that was never released to the TV, you will find this "old-fashioned drawing room" an outstanding film that shows very well 74 years after the 1933 release because it is full of great performances.
