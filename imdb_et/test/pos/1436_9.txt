STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Once heroin addicted Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra) gets out of prison for her worship jailbird's partner Sparrow (Arnold Stang), his wife Zosch (Eleanor Parker) and Molly's side (Kim Novak.) to the painful exhaustion. it comes when he is stuck, doing the only other thing he was good at other than the junke cards of high-end games. And try, as he may, even the prison has not treated him for his addiction to the devil's drugs, which caused him to lie and deceive all the people around them and lead him to desperate actions to feed his habit. His longing to come off is his only motivation for a happy ending. <br /> <br /> When people think of Frank Sinatra, they generally think of classical high songs such as Under My Skin, New York New York, and it was Ole Sa. But that nobody would forget that he was actually a well-known actor, and if his performance here from today's eternity was not enough, he is also remembered for the cutting-edge drama that deals with what was at that time a highly taboo subject on drug abuse. <br /> <br /> The film is often referred to as one of the first to have graphical use of heroin (probably due to 15 certificates) at a time when it was still a subject that was still heavily pushed underground. In depicting his main protagonist, Sinatra is good, giving great success to the man's despair, despair and sincerity, which loses every opportunity given to him. His cold turkey image is much more intense than Ewan McGregor's Trainspotting. The first composition that impresses is Parker, as a machine-demanding, spouse's pain, using her husband's guilt and conscientiousness over the whole effect. Novak as his secret lover still manages some strong moments but has fewer stars than Parker. Stang does his usual comic strip, such as the worshiping sidekick, who drives the leading man with his magnificent New York accent. <br /> <br /> Director Otto Preminger allows you to drag the pace from time to time, but it is still a very absorbing film all the time, with many unexpected twists and what you should admire for being one of the first movies to bring a grim topic so vigorously in life. ****
