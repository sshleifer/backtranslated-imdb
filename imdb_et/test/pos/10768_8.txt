In his 2nd film of historical martial arts, Chiba depicts her real life sensei Mas Oyama. The film even creates an incredible game from Oyama, which kills a frightening bull with bare hands (Oyama did it more than 50 times in real life). Dynamic Combat Choreography with authentic Kyokushinkai techniques. Ironically, this is one of the rare Sonny Chiba films in which he does not tear or hang on the body of opponents. Must see Sonny Chiba fans, who is definitely one of his five best films
