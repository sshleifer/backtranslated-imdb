This movie begins with the college T'n'A flick, but becomes pretty ugly after the main character's sister is a gang raped by a biker gang flying van. It has a pretty good pace and James Van Patten is doing a good job in this Cannon relief movie. It was the first movie I ever saw in Parkway Drive, here in Toronto. The main feature was "Alphabet City" and "The Young Warriors had an added feature. 2 of the" Young Warriors "was much more entertaining and memorable., It would be a great collection.
