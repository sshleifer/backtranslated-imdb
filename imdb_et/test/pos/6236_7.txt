This is a weird odd headed by a man who edited "Texas Chainsaw Massacre". Chuck Conners gives the owner of a spirited "wax" museum who is going to blast our dead teenagers. Wax figures seem "so real" that one teenager is pointing. Heh, heh, heh ... Not as much a movie as a weird combination of psychological horror and the old "House of Wax". I mean many many horror movies that are worse than that.
