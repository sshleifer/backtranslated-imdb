This wonderful musical film, in beautiful Technicolor, is so wonderful that every Irish person is proud. Ireland's joy and celebration are perfect, brilliant light, great settings and great theaters, beautiful Irish music and the perfect Irish tenor voice by Dennis Morgan, "happy" Irish to have such a wonderful movie over and over again! Not only St. Patty's Day, but for you, all year round. <br /> <br /> One of the jewels produced by Jack L. Warner at the time he was the head of the Burbank studio in the 1940s. /> <br /> Shame on Warner Brothers that you don't have this good picture on home video and DVD!
