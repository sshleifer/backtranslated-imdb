"Outside Africa" ​​dead spots and the super-image postcard that I was almost buried could have been read by Isak Dinesen. So when my brother "Babette Party" bought it and knowing it was based on the story of Dinesen, I didn't drive the VCR exactly. But as the titles rolled out, it became clear that this is not a normal film. Jutland (where it is set) is not Africa; the cooling mist that collects the camera in the frames is not inviting. Cold, forbidden sea; heavy, gray clouds; bright, icy green cliffs - come up with difficulties showing the face of director Gabriel Axel's curtain. The toughest is Bodil Kjeri as Philippa; the most memorable of this film is the most memorable face. It stands as a map that puts us in the coveted wonder of the apostolate of our minister; as in the long forgotten maze of fjords, where the complications of the consistency and dedication of his church are hanging like glowing items. <br /> <br /> I collect the Dinesen point of how the world is drawn inexplicably to a Christian's commitment when Philippa has been rejected by her only serious defendant (because she fears she will never measure the rules and rigors of her small religious clicks), and she returns to find her lover, whom she considers to be the main chef of the continent. I think this is also his idea that Christ responds to the doubts and regrets of the advancement of these worlds (Philippa's sister Martina restores the efforts of visiting baritone (Jean-Philippe Lafont, whose beauty creates a surprising contrast to his discovery of the surrounding spirituality)) to make him an opera star, title The character leaves France and its enviable reputation and looks for a sanctuary as a servant of two spinsters) to continue the artistic victory only for God and those closest to him. But this is Axel, who weaves the vitality of these people with Martina's voice and Babette Hersant's desk and makes no sense what you will never expect from a movie about sacrifice, faith, and religious belief. <br /> <br /> What sets this film on other religious films is its humorous humor. "The Babette Party", that is, the banquet itself - the memorial of the minister's 100th anniversary postum - is a clash of well-organized mindsets that offer comics, as shown by an actor ensemble that is incomparable in its subjectivity. It is this dirty comedy that enriches the sacred feelings. Together, they rarely make divine films. They leave the believer hopeful and unexpectedly decisive and humble.
