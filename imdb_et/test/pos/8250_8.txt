British Cemetery Comedy Pearl. The bad American schlub Pinky Green (Richard Jordan, who plays the other bad guy, but this time the divine) gets out of the British prison and tries to go straight, but his carer's job at the bank is too attractive for his never-reformed criminal friends led by really nasty Ivan (David Niven one of its last roles). Pinky is against, but attracting this money is too much for him. Things are practicing and riding and everyone is happy to see. Jordan has to play 20 bad boys during his career, but he has never played the same twice - it's just too pleasant to hate. Niven never played a finer bad, oil. Two good actors we've lost, I would like us to be back.
