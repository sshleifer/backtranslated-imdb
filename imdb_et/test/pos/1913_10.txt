Dolemite is the object of my deepest affection for me. It has everything: a gang of karate fighting prostitutes, Dolemite strikes his fist through the stomach of Willie Green (directed by Martin), high pumps and 100-gallon dalmation-print hats. Moore's unique comedy rape, which is actually roasted, is close to the hip-hop roots. No wonder Dr. Dre mentioned "Dolemite" 3 times in his classic album "The Chronic". Add the best character list so that the movie can ever be rewarded, like a horny preacher, a hamburgerpimp and, of course, "someone nobody knows until it's time." Credit should be given to the style director D'Urville Martin, who has not paid as much attention as he should look at the film fans' circles (I've been looking for my own and Fred Williamsons films early) in the 70s and can't find them. <br /> <br /> Many people are really under this movie and say it's really bad, and it's true that you see boom marks that appear everywhere (see DP Nicholas Josef Von Sternberg, for whom I think it was a very early effort, there are a lot of things for this movie. First, there is no other movie. Second, you see Rudy Ray Moore (very sanitary; everyone who hasn't seen Moore's outrageous device, use your imagination). The active scenes are pretty bad, but the dialogue between the characters when they talk more to the trash than it does is full of strange little details (like the fact that the Hamburger Pimp carries the Dolemite T- a shirt, was it deliberate, or did the man just choose what shirt was on the set and put it on?) you come back to watch it over and over again. <br /> <br /> At least I have. <br /> <br / >
