This classical music "Sweeney Todd" TV show does not do justice to production, but is still quite appealing. <br /> <br /> First of all, the most enjoyable aspect of this version is the production project, from the wheel to the stunning amazing door. Then the performance is great, immediately slipping down. <br /> <br /> The main failure here is the performances that people give. Oh, they're plausible, it's okay, but it's pretty frustrating if no one seems to hit their clues at the right time, as fast as saying "Kiss Me." Actually, the actor playing Johanna is not only uncomfortable, but also a bit off-key. And Angela Lansbury's slightly overdone coke accent is a bit irritating. Another thing is exactly what is so bad about Judge Turpin's "Johanna" performance that is forbidden from the American theater, but not the cannibal "Little Priest"? <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's a great product. It's an excitement to see how people do what they love - and I'm not even talking about "meat pies".
