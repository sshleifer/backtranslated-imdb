If Hollywood had the hearts of the audience, we would see 20 films a year behind this film. There are many personal development experiences in this film, and although the characters are still very human, the lessons learned are not that greed brings you profit or does-do-whatever-you-so-long-with -On-okay-with- it, no, this is what our sad, desensitized life needs, more sense ... more love ... more-with-like-you-would-have-made-to-you-do-it ... more hope. (thanks to Ursula!) This movie is intelligent, not "mama" cracks that run in so-called comedies. People have to feel good. This film will make you feel good and perhaps inspire you better for your life and the lives of others. sidenote Every person takes into account ticket sales. This is a truly independent film. If you want more quality movies, you need to support them.
