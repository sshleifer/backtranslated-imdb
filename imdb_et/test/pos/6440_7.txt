In 1850, in Yorkshire, the boy was accused of sweeping chimneys for theft with his curved captain and running away. He gets into a treacherous local river and is transported to an underwater area where he makes many friends and rescues mythical water babies from evil sharks. <br /> <br /> Based on Charles Kingsley's book, it is a nice children's film, half-life, and half animation, both in Victorian times and in a terribly pleasing image and terrible underwater adventure. It's really two movies in one, which somehow complement each other and combine into a much richer whole. The animation of Tony Cuthbert, Jack Stokes and Miroslaw Kijowicz is great, as is the music of Ted Scaife and the music of Phil Coulter and Bill Martin. Pender has a very rough-diamond quality because (literal) fish out of the water - I love the moment he is on the mansion, sees all the chimneys and shouts "Blimey !!" at the top of your voice. Mason and Cribbins are the toughest, toughest tempters you might see in the drama of the costume (if you want to see real Victorian values, don't look at Sense and sensitivity, look at it), and Whitelaw, Pertwee (who makes eleven voices) and Percival are all great. So a good children's movie should be - a good old singalong fun, but also a little thoughtful, sad and scary. High Cockallorum !!
