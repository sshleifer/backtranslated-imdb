When driving to his beloved Betty-Anni, Adam (Eric Jungmann) is driving his former schoolmate Harley (Justin Urich) to the back of his car. Adam has been uncomfortable and embarrassed by Harley because of Betty-Anni. Harley travels on the road with some bar amusements, and later drives their giant monster truck. After some incidents, they give the elevator to the hacker Sarah (Aimee Brooks) and were previously terrorized by a scary monster who travels with a monster truck. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that I have one of the most annoying characters ever seen in the horror film, Harley, "Monster Man" is a surprisingly good garbage-horror comedy. The story is a collection of clich√©s that begin as "Joy Ride" or "Duel"; then one of countless "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" attacks turns; there is a surprising twist that ends with a tricky sequel. Have fun scenes, Aimee Brooks is extremely sexy and this movie really attracts. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Monster Man"
