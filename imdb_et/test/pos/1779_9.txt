'Identity? . . . . I am part of my surroundings and I became separated from them, and it is able to make these distinctions clearly, allowing us to have an identity and what is ever in our identity that has ever happened to us ”(Ntozake Shange qtd in" Fires in Mirror "). /> <br /> Pieces like Decalogue V used to scare me. I felt that if I accepted them, I would be something to compromise on. What I had never thought of is not worth it. I understand what naturalism is trying to say. katharsis and one that existed and what is still alive that I still think it is still working in me. The film was not in itself reasonable. It does not have to say that the death penalty is an evil thing. whether they should die for another movie, which Decalogue shows that good, beautiful people exist who kill other people when their society and primary penetrate them. <br /> <br /> The "science" of naturalness is what o n helped me understand Decalogue V. It's not worth the writing room, why go, why don't I let myself go, but now I see worthy artwork. like it to make people, or maybe make people do something. <br /> <br /> There is a method for Lazar's compromise. . . light. Much of this meaning makes sense only retrospectively. It should not be too strange to the idea: after all, how much respectful science is not retrospectively retrieved. I can say when I say it, but naturalism seems so much more productive and so much less nihilistic when I have the ability to say for myself, "this destruction, this process, this natural process, makes me fail." <br /> <br /> I don't think naturalism paints a portrait of mankind's doomsday that tells us to give up our powdered wigs and head forest. Instead, I think it's a catalog of evidence and experiments that we, of course, freely ignore. We cannot ignore everything we want to ignore if we want to give naturalists more corpses for burial. Of course, despite their aesthetics, specially designed without the likelihood of their characters being fatal and catastrophic, these are the inactivity of the elderly and written snobby. I see the risk that is being dragged in the hope that the audience understands what to do, what they see. As already mentioned, there is a risk that hopeless vision in their destiny is immortal. There is a danger in the natural hopeful nature because it does not match their worldview. <br /> <br /> And I don't think "hopeful" must be prosperous or happy. I have not seen it, but it seems that American Beauty proves the inadequacy of the facts as a provider of vision or convenience. There are both aces and symbols, but also beggars who don't know where their humanity is casting because they can't find anything that separates them from their landscape. <br /> <br /> Landscapes can be portrayed very and beautifully, but they are not really landscapes. They change, certainly and dramatically, but only with a large number of natural laws that no one really can overcome. But you can't change it yourself.
