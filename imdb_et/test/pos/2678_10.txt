Wow, this is my best sitcom from friends. If you have had a day of nonsense, sit down with beers (if you are old enough that it is not a root beer.) And look at a few episodes, this is the perfect happiness. /> <br /> What I like most is that all shows are very funny and they all have a fantastic timing of comedy. After a while you send it to the characters and care about them. I think the secret to the success of exhibitions is that they have an enviable life. Doug is greasy, but still satisfied, he loves his wife for his work and friends. The right father is an ointment flight, but he's not filling.
