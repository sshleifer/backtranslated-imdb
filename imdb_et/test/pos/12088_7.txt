First of all, I would like to point out that I really enjoyed this documentary. Not only did it have great music, but also pictures and editing were wonderful. But all of these positive film-related things do not change the way he plays Orientalist "East meet West", which interferes with many peat like me. Okay, this movie tells the story of traditional and modern Turkish music very well, which is good, something that would show the unknown European and American that this country is not just a murder of Armenians and Kurds. However, the problem with the film is that it looks at what it defines from the "west" sight of the "east". I mean, as one jazz musician says in the movie, maybe not from the east and the west, maybe it's just a myth, a lie created by "western" ruling leaders to keep fear and hostility alive so they can continue the world management and "keep cash flow"? <br /> <br /> Why don't you think about it?
