A refreshing black comedy featuring some of Australia's best. Just like Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels, London's Gangster's funny side, Two Hands lashed through the Sydney underworld. It wouldn't be as funny as it would be so close to poetry. <br /> <br /> Australian Classic. If Australia could pull such rabbits from its hat, it can actually be for the film industry, which is worth keeping an eye on.
