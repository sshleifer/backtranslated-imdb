At the end of this movie, I like a little girl, and I dare to hold someone without noise. Absolutely close to heart, but it deepens your core. <br /> <br /> Ann Margaret, a 10-member sick sick mother who knew that her arthritic-steel spouse is not capable of supporting the family when she's gone, arranges the adoption of her children before she mixes. This role really deserves the Oscar. <br /> <br /> You know this poor family because the dying mother gives her everything to make sure her kids don't get into a poorly managed orphanage system. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it - get it if you can.
