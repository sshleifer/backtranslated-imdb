I loved this movie. To be very fair, the film starts very slowly, no characters are terrible. In this way, it continues toward the good side of the film. <br /> <br /> But if you're patient, you'll get a big prize. As the first half of the film lacks character development and / or compassion, it is sufficiently compensated for in the second half. It's a bit like a skateboarder - slow, uphill climbing to drive, and then speed, turns and a few surprises. <br /> <br /> As usual, Meryl Streep is wonderful. He is the best actor of our time. William Hurt is good as a bit of wood patches. Renee Zellweger does a great job of showing that her presentation at Jerry McGuire was not a fluke.
