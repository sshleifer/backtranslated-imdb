Always cheerful Kevin Spacey makes us ask again for a certain truth in our lives. After believing in us, he is a mumbling little time for the classic ordinary suspect (only to reveal the true power of kinematic fraud); this time he takes us to believe he is Prot, a pleasant alien who takes the human form as he travels along the land. in a hospital in Manhattan's psychiatric facility. Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) will soon accept him and even wonder if Prot is actually the supreme being of the K-PAX planet, or maybe he is just a forgotten person with severe psychiatric problems. Although the end can be seen and discussed in many ways, it remains a difficult, enlightening journey that leaves a lot of interesting / philosophical questions behind it.
