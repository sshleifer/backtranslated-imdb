I thought I'd watch this movie again for so many years. On the contrary, I was more impressed now than my professional youth with honest and brave humor. In 1969, the transition of African-American groups from overwhelming reconciliation and integration policies to confrontation and self-determination was still rather new and more than controversial. The depiction of both the institution and the agency was a boldness and a finesse because they were the cartoons they often brought closer to in real life. Particular mention should be made of Arnold Johnson's appearance: he successfully kept his character from being lost from sociopathy or outbreaks. I'd rather look at it than "love with love" on any old day!
