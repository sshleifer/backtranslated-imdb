From one of the best films, Tom Hanks celebrates Congress Charlie Wilson in this sardonic funny and extremely relevant (fairly current event) historical comedy drama surrounding the 1980s / Soviet fiasco of Afghanistan. The Soviets attacked Afghanistan who killed hundreds of people. Why should someone care? People die, right? No, the reason why the United States participated through Charlie Wilson was because the Afghans began to enter Sh_t illegally to Pakistan, which in turn freed Pakistani President Mohammad Zia ul-Haqi. To overcome this situation, Charlie Wilson is trying to work with the sixth richest woman and religious fanatic in Texas, Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts) and amusing and vigorous American spy CIA, Gust Avrakos (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to help Afghans outfit Soviet fighters with high-tech weapons to try to attack their land. <br /> <br /> Although certainly not a serious Oscar competitor for the best picture, the Charlie Wilson War is probably one of the best political films of the year. Academy Award Winner Mike Nichols gives solid leadership when expected, while Emmy Award Winner Aaron Sorkin (Sports Night, West Wing) offers a remarkable scenario that balances comedy and drama. There is also a great deal of action. Tom Hanks delivers his best and most enjoyable result as his 2000 Oscar nominee is a member of FedEx, who is left on the tropical island of Cast Away. Hanks takes like a butterfly character like Wilson and with her brand she becomes a nice guy. Amy Adams and Ned Beatty are as reliable as ever, but the film's actual show is from Philip Seymour Hoffman. Supposedly, the best actor in the Hoffman film industry is the role of a small supporter and it raises everything around him. From her first scene where she screams to her boss before her window penetrates, Hoffman sucks you in. The only disappointment that hurts is is the surprisingly redundant Hollywood star, Julia Roberts. Hamming his way through another movie, Roberts' overwhelming and gigantic image of a rich Texas oil woman hits all the wrong comments and is most often unpleasant. After 97 minutes, the film is short and cute, and that doesn't mean it won't pull at some point, but if it drags it, it will be in a very short time. <br /> <br /> Finally, "Charlie Wilson's War" is by no means a perfect movie, but it's definitely worth a look.
