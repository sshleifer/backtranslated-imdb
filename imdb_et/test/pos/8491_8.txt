Jamie Foxx does a good job of proclaiming the famous blues / soul / country singer Ray Charles. In the case of film credit, it shows both good and bad in terms of Charles's character and his choices, both personally and professionally. <br /> <br /> This is a glossy film that gives you a rich feeling at the time of the story. Not only does it look good, it sounds good. I just want more music here. Once it is entered, it is fabulous, but it is not enough. Assuming that the story was true at least for review purposes, I was impressed and disappointed by Charles, which means that the story left some memorable impressions because I write it 16 months after viewing it. The main impressions are as follows: <br /> <br /> ALL - Ray's revival of great talents and his foresight to step out and take chances with music, such as "state" for a while. The man was confident, but did not come across the arrogant. It was also memorable to beat his heroin addiction - without help! It's just amazing. <br /> <br /> BAD - I also remember, through this movie, how Ray first captured and was disappointed that he was so unfaithful to his wife. The really sad comment was that her husband was bothered by her because she was too small for her lack of games because she was all over her fraud, even if she was a member of her singing group. The only downside I had with filmmakers was the over-emphasis of his problems on one of the early childhood events, his brother's accidental death. This tragedy was used as the burden of Ray's error for all adults, another example of a culture where people refuse to take responsibility for their actions. <br /> <br /> Note: there is an expanded version of DVD but it is a word that is so poorly edited that it is not worth viewing, so paste it into a "theater version".
