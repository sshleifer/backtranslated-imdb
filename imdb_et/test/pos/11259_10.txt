I saw this movie last night and it was one of the best movies I saw. It was very well targeted and the actor was excellent, very convincing. The music was good and the cinema was beautifully photographed. Dreamlessly take the Requiem hopelessness and you can waste. A great image of the world of drug addiction and its consequences, which everyone can communicate with. cudos mtv to give us a good flick for change! * $ *% as Crossroads.
