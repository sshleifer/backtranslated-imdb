Eddie Monroe is Hooooot. She is a great actor and I could be her girl anytime. He's so good. I was so sad at the end. I will not destroy the end, but wow. Girls are so cruel. Her girl was wrong. If Eddie was my man, I would never have respect. These Mobsters were spooky. The story of morality is Trust No One. Your friends get into u when they get. Oh and Eddie tell your girlfriend that my mine, she should move the egg! I recommend watching the movie. Why? Becasur I said that. It kept my eyes on the screen. My sister loved it so that I can see it again, because now my friends want to see it and it's worth it twice. Peace, happy New Year!
