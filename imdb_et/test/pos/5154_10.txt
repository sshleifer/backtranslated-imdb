I laughed loudly several times during this movie, but I gave her a brief look and you think it was something else. I adore the pace and how it slowly burns you when you are presented with these gobsmackingly beautiful tables. Andersson gives us something else. Show us something I haven't seen in my last movie. He is compositionally extraordinary and, with his camera fixation method that allows us to take place, he opens the door to mankind and we take a position that reflects our own lives, our small lives. This is a powerful stuff. It is the simplicity with which it allows events to occur, which creates the opposite feeling. Everything in front of the camera is nothing but simple. Andersson's attention to detail is extraordinary. I believe most scenes, if not all, are made from scratch based on their designs. I can't recommend this movie enough. For me it took the place and I came out of it, having seen a world that was broken and beautiful, starch and painful, barren and magnificent. Immediately alien and familiar. This film is brilliant and life-affirming. I know, because I came with a smile feeling wonderful. He's been doing this for seven years. If he did this movie only then, he would still be surprised.
