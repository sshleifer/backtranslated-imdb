I'm rarely involved in movies about smart women who have problems with authority, but "Toy Soldiers" has been looking at me repeatedly. It is as much a film about Billy Tepper who grows and becomes adult, and I give credit to Sean Astin and the writer / director Daniel Petrie Jr that they don't do much, but let him just discover and throw it up. The adultery of Tepper's friends, their grief over Joey's death and their joy in their survival are all really moving. And I have to admit that I'm taking some patriotic (and perhaps a little reptile) when the US Army guys finally move and hit some drug terrorists right. Ooh-rah, General Kramer! And the heroic Robert Folk score is cherry up. I'm sure I could find one hundred reasons that don't like "toy soldiers", but as long as we don't take it seriously, I don't see the need. This is one of the most pleasant "bad" movies in my pantheon.
