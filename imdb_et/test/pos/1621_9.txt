I recently got a movie and I can say it's a good movie. There are many famous Roman monuments and historical sites. It's the same writer and director of the Da Vinci code. Tom Hanks stars with Ewan McGregor and Ayelet Zurer. The film begins with a space and time experiment in Sweden until the most angry enemy of the church, the Illuminati, steals one canister. It is difficult to discuss the plot without damaging it. His race across Rome after the Illuminati route to get to the Illuminati's secret meeting place. Compete for time to find the Illuminati Road. Over all this movie, worth seeing, I watched it 3 times and I like it to finally buy it. It's much better than the 2010 film. And at the end there is one awesome line.
