"L'appartement" must be one of the best French films I've ever seen (with "hate" as well as Vincent Cassel and their wonderful Gerard DÃ©pardieu / Pierre Richard films). Cassel and Bellucci are amazing in leadership roles. Besides the Brotherhood of Wolves and Dobermann, I haven't seen a bad movie with this couple yet. "L'appartement" sucks you from the start and the twists keep you excited until the end. The storytelling of the fragments hasn't really worked well for Pulp Fiction since then. We just hope that with this unique romance / mystery thriller there is no godawful American remake. (EDIT: Guess what! It's been a godawful American remake!)!
