Kite Runner Should Win Oscar! It's perfect in every sense, story, scenario, actor, cinematography ... One doesn't think it's filmed in China. The life story of two childhood friends and their adults leaves a lasting impression. Image of Afghan life under the Taliban is too real and terrible. I haven't read the book, but I've seen comments that put the movie down because "the book is always better" ... It's not really important. Nobody let "Gone With The Wind" because it wasn't right for the book! In fact, he won the Academy Award for Best Picture and several other Oscars. I think this movie is brilliant - for BRAVO writer and director and actors!
