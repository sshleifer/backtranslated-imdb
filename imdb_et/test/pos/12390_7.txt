Of course, how he could. He obviously chose several aspects of this excellent film, which was also based on the sensational French case of a "World Health Organization doctor" who murdered his family and himself when he finally uncovered it. Emilio refers to his son as a "monster," he sings his car radio, hangs on a park bench, and specializes in his family and friends fraud investment schemes - all of which are directly raised from "Out," which came out before "someone's life." too bad because this film itself is pretty good, good actor and writing. ‚ÄùWhen Vincent from" Time Out "has a much finer character who seems to be ethical, though sometimes he gets knotted, the protagonist seems to have no character out of it except for his winning appearance and charm, seriously, the part where he used X-rays to show his mother-in-law cancer that he would pay more for his father, he uses a fine twist of the same scam to prevent eviction from his fancy home because he did not pay the time for the lease - it is almost too much. The guy is not shameful, in fact he is the leader of the "stepfather" than some poor schmuck who are fired and are so humane not being able to face the disappointment of his family and friends and being forced to invent a shiny new life for himself, as Vincent did "Time Out". Thus, there is a tension placed on the "life of someone" and a violent conclusion. One thing "no one has to do with life" is that "Time Out" was definitely not the interest of a woman who trusted the protagonist. It is not hard to see how sexy babysitter is able to fascinate and announce Em to such an extent that she ignored the danger of her natural curiosity and allowed her to lower her less than a carefully constructed con. Given these reservations, this is a pretty good movie we found fun. If you have a long time on similar elements that go deeper and are intellectually and mentally satisfying, I strongly recommend "Time Out".
