What I most enjoyed in this film was the Corfu landscape, being Greece, I adore my country and I liked the attractive director's point of view. Based on a true story over the years when Greece was in a hurry to stand with its two legs through war, Nazis and hardships. The Italian soldier and the Greek girl fall in love, but the times are tough and have many sacrifices. Nicholas Cage, who sees the big view evenly, gives a passionate insight into his unfulfilled (at first) love. I adored Christian Bale, who played the heroine's wife in Mandra, she looks very good as Greek, her personality fit with the Greek patriot! A real fighter out there or what! One of the movies I want to buy and keep in my collection ... forever!
