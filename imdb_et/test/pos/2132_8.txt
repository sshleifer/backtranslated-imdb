I liked this movie even when this movie seems to be so hated and I think it's even better than The Deer Hunter, which was overrated. Both this film and the dragon of the year are very underestimated, although I saw why no one would want this movie. After three and a half hours, the film goes too long and the other side of the movie is much better than the first half. Kris Kristofferson and Christopher Walken are fighting over Isabelle Huppert, but she can't make her thoughts on which one to be. Sam Waterston is a villain who has a list of 125 people to be killed, who have said anarchists and thieves. There's also a huge cast of Jeff Bridges, Brad Dourif and young Mickey Rourke.
