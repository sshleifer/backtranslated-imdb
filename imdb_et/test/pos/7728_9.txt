There are several ways to misunderstand this movie, and some of them are shown in some earlier comments. This is a film that needs to be analyzed as a leisure theme of a well-known theme, so it's not to be compared to opera, a book, or other Carmen films that have been viewed before. It just stands for itself and I have to say that this Carmen does it very well. It is a mistake to compare because it is the first step in prohibiting films from being able to be autonomous creative works of art. Vicente Aranda is the master of the atmosphere and the artistic direction, costumes and photography are very well assembled to achieve a pleasant aesthetic experience. Let's take it as it is. <br /> <br /> And this brings us to the next misunderstanding. Someone complains about the film because of typical Spanish clichés. Historically, the film has been very well researched and you can see the results of this very serious work in every scene. This is not only an accurate portrait of the nose of "black Spain" and the espadrilles, which Goya was so vividly depicted, but also part of the history seen by an alien who is fascinated by the folklore of this society. Frankly, anyone who does not want to see a cliché in Spain should buy a Carmen ticket, but in that case they will be presented before they become one, and the way to see them is to get rid of their prejudices. Another important requirement for a proper understanding of this film is the language of speaking. It is unacceptable to criticize any actor acting because he has not understood his lines. If all the other audiences did, the problem is likely to be elsewhere. Paz Vega is a strange dictation with his Andalusian accent and everything he says is understandable and reliable. The Argentine partner Leonardo Sbaraglia also gives a convincing portrait of a Basque officer who became a "bandolero", and his accent is well learned. <br /> <br /> Less important is the minimally open approach material. Saying that Paz Vega is "terrible" suggests that the author of the phrase entered the theater for the wrong reasons. In Spain, we already had a critic in one of the most prestigious papers that suggested to us the images he found homosexually awakening, without directly mentioning it. And for the rest, it was not entirely honest, especially for those who had not discovered that the man wrote with his parts of anatomy that many readers did not necessarily have to take care. I do not recommend at all that the reviewer had the same motivation, but expectations must be different, because among us who went to see a talented and beautiful actor, there is almost a classic role, because that is what we got. Paz Vega is Carmen and a great, Vicente Aranda movie.
