I loved this movie - the actors were wonderful and fit with their roles. The story itself was great (and the device was perfect and the message from people's response to war, the danger and the risk was exceptional. The person who wrote the music score also made music for Life (my second favorite) - his comment was obviously "... it wasn't like an English movie, it was like an Italian movie." I think he's right! Callum Blue is suitable for Eric Newby. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a story that is true and morally resurrecting, as well as a beautiful love story.
