Seriously, all John Malkovich's films are very good. These include Clint Eastwood, Rene Russo, John Mahoney (Frasier), Dylan McDermott (Practice) and many other great actors. <br /> <br /> Clint gets old, but thanks to this she is also a fantastic director (independently). <br /> <br /> We are used to Wolfgang's "water film" like Das Boot, Poseidon, and Perfect Storm - it was really different, but just as manageable. <br /> <br /> The assassination assumption is as serious as it is, the movie is very fast, some violence is a bit ... But generally recommended (but not for children).
