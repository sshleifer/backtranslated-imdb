Being 15 years old, I enjoyed this flick! I'm more involved with Ann August than most. My mother is not eccentric as Adele, but the feelings of loneliness are the same. This film is perfect in the Ating aspects and Natalie and Susan's performances are so intertwined that it is the best on the screen for two years. Their chemistry brings characters to life, they become real people! I recommend this flick to anyone who is hoping to escape. Because there are a lot of people who want to be "everywhere, but here", including me! and if possible, watch this movie with your best friend or mother. His tears that will make everyone around you more confused!
