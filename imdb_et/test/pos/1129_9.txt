I've been watching two episodes so far, I like it. Even if I am no longer in college, it makes me a great college life. I wish I spent a little more time socializing. I feel rusty. When I hurried to my brotherhood, my big brother like Cappie wasn't at all, I wish I had a big brother like him. So, if such an exhibition can actually identify people with a character, it is a pretty good show. Can we also call it "desperate spouses"? some writers must be Greeks themselves, the story seems to reflect somewhat real brotherhood and corporation life. It was taken in high definition. And they filmed outside the studios. so the quality of the picture is very good. They could make this good movie. Unlike a movie that only takes a few hours, I can have about 45 minutes of entertainment on television every week. <br /> <br /> Casting is great, actors are about the right age and they're new and fresh, making them more real. It practically shows everyone. There are also Asian and black frat boys and corporation girls. It is almost a bit shocking that they had a small story about two men who had sex in the first episode of fraternity, then they tried to go back to another episode. I don't think I've seen anything like this on television. This exhibition reminded me in some way of Warner Bro's teen TV shows, called young Americans, which were canceled in early 2001. <br /> <br /> Greek life can be fun, but at the same time students have to learn exams, etc .; by the time people actually have free time in their lives, they will no longer have the corporation's brotherhood. I don't know how long this show will run sooner or later, these people will have to "stop" college. Maybe they will find 4 more fun colleges!
