I recommend idiocracy to everyone. Luke Wilson is very funny, the film is insightful and made me laugh so much that I had tears several times. Until the end, when I started breathing and realized how close we are to the judge's vision tomorrow. <br /> <br /> Keep an eye on the boy's Mac ads (Justin Long). like Dr. Lexus. I found my presentation Oscar-worthy, especially considering what recent Oscars have been released ... besides, she is cute. <br /> <br /> In short, Idiocrat is a deadly funny look at a potential future where people have been named after the product names (the president's average name is Mountain Dew), hospital visits cost $ 5 billion, there are garbage mountains because no one is smart enough to understand what to do with it, and nobody cares about it. nothing but money. All because they only breed fools. It seems to me familiar, somehow. Oh, yeah; that's what I mean when I see professional wrestling ... <br /> <br /> Seriously, watch this movie. This is a good laugh and it makes you think.
