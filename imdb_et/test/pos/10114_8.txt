Call it manipulative if you want, but I fell for it. Of course, there could have been more character formation. Yes, there could have been better cinematography and less continuous weekly film, but Ed Harris was impeccable, Cuban Gooding divine and touching, and let's face people in real life, as many of us really come to know the motivation of others. Not much. We got a little glimpse of the coach's motivation (a very provocative dialogue in my opinion, not to forget soon), so I think it was a lovely respect for one person who broke out of his "comfort zone" to reach another person and in the meantime hundreds of lives affected more. I liked the lesson we all need. Why is it that the right thing is so often the hardest? I recommend this beautiful little movie to everyone with heart. You don't have to be disappointed. And bring your Kleenex. 8/10
