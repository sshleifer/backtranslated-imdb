I really appreciate what Jung-won did before he died. Everything. I want to say that her choice for love is selfish. If he chose Da-rim, it is good for him. But Da-rim needs more time to recover from death. Obviously he doesn't want to let that. As he did in the film, he decided to give up. So it was just a temporary torment for Da-rim. <br /> <br /> For comparison, my life without me is very different. Their behavior shows a great difference between Eastern culture and Western culture. I can't say what's better. Everyone has the right to choose. It is up to you to decide. Life is equal to everyone. We can only live once. Any choice is acceptable if only you think it is right for you. Just calm down. Get more from the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best Korean movies I've ever watched. 9/10
