I read covertly disguised comments on previous comments, which confirmed that this film showed an attack on homosexual boys for their homosexuality. <br /> <br /> It can't be misleading. "Eighteen" is not a gay movie. It has only three gay characters and one of them is the victim of the prejudices of those who wrote the comments, despite the recognition of justice. <br /> <br /> Pipi's grandfather was not gay. The gentle scene of the soldier and his sergeants is the bondage of the male at the moment of death. But some people have been terrified of a kiss and a welcome scene from a man killed by a bomb. <br /> <br /> The film's focus is on the direct relationship between Pipi and this sweet girl and the face they face. social responsibility and parenthood. <br /> <br /> Ralph Rewes www.r1313.info
