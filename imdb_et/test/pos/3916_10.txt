OK, so Paris Hilton sucks in (typical Malibu Barbie), but the rest of the participants are just great! I watched the movie last night and it kept me completely through the film. Chad Michael Murray IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT and he is just ace actress. Hero together. The main girl who is a nickname (chad) is such a great actor. Thumbs up. I think it's so different from these days, most of them going to psychopaths, possessions, ghosts, but here's the topic of wax! I found the miners completely in the house by the foam models, although they saw it as real. I still haven't got a twins story, I'm looking forward to getting a DVD and watching it again. Tiny to this great movie! 11/10 All those people who do not like it do not doubt 2 criticize my opinion, because everyone thinks it is so cool. I also think that the Paris scene, when it slips into its underwear, is totally uncomfortable. Why not just get a dog shagging some cat .. be more fun then. When the scene of the death of Paris came, I thought it was poor because he was still running, though the knife just went on his feet. Hmm .. interesting. <br /> <br />! ALL ALL TYPE!
