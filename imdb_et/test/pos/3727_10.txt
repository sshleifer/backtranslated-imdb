It's hard to use words for this movie because it doesn't contain any of itself. <br /> <br /> But the images that it delivers, both powerful and sweeping, remind us why we're watching movies. And you can say, "Well, Leonard Maltin doesn't like it, it can't be so good." But you're wrong. Watch this movie. French cinema shine and ensemble.
