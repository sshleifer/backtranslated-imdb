Although caricatures and / or references to people or things in the entertainment industry or even brands are usually in such shorts, they are not used here. Most individual gags are quite common. As I give examples, there are spoilers below: <br /> <br /> There are only three (well, technically four-there are fast, at the end caricatures) cartoons I noticed, which is low for this type of short, though is characterized by sufficient activity. They are Jack Benny (Jack Bunny), Leopold Stowkowski and Immaculate Ned Sparks (if the crab is possible, it is good that if the crab was tied to the Warner Brothers in the short 1930s - 1940s would be Ned Sparks). There are also references to Billy Rose Aqua and radio show "Henry Aldrich" (Coming, mother!), Game Superman (Superguy here) and villain on "King Kong". It is just for this type of diapers. <br /> <br /> The products themselves are mostly generic and gags play more basic components in unusual situations, such as turtles coming from the juice jar to attack the frog as tanks Tomato cans that make Can-can gingerbread men who change Paratroopers using parachute tissue and so on ... Gags are very good and this is a great example of Bob Clampett's comic book. According to this point, the director has not done the best job, but it is not sneezing. This short can be found in the Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Volume 3, which is a great set that I highly recommend. recommended by yourself.
