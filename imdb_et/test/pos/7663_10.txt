I can never understand why people watch movies they haven't fully understood. I know people are reading the reviews on these pages of this movie, and it keeps them looking for copies of this rather forgotten, late 20th, but 1932 movie. name in titles. Myrna Loy, known as a comic artist with countless affectionate roles, shows herself in all these. He was a real dramatic actor, something I didn't know before watching this movie, which preceded all of his famous roles. He is exciting and moving here, two things he never contradicted with graceful and refined William Powell. I'm still quite shocked how good he was. <br /> <br /> Becky Sharp (1935), the first three-tiered Technicolor feature, is more familiar, but it is much better artistic and adaptive. It is also very amazing as an expression of the film style that was dying. You can't accept my word, you have to see it.
