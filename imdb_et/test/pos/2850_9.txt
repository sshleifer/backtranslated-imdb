I was very impressed with Nurse Betty all the time. It has a great ensemble of characters, an original plot and an end that I should see, but did not and pulls the strings of your heart. <br /> <br /> If there is something I liked most about this movie, it was Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock. These two are great and it warms my heart that Rock is not going to make its Hollywood weapon fare like Lethal Weapon 4 for the rest of his life. Freeman is always like a man, really his work should no longer be criticized for criticism. Hell, Kiss the Girls was being watched with her. <br /> <br /> Renee Zellwegger is doing the best she can with her role, and Kinnear is good at her obsession. <br /> <br /> Sweet movie with pleasant violence to satisfy men's blood. 9 out of 10 <br /> <br />
