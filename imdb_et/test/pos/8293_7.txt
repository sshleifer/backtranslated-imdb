This is definitely a good movie, beautifully photographed and fancy. However, it should definitely be criticized and Mizoguchi because it is not without shortcomings and weaknesses. Mizoguchi was really cared for by women and wanted to make statements about the lack of human sympathy and total cruelty, but he is sometimes ahead of himself, trying to misrepresent this statement. This is definitely the case with Crucified Lovers, Princess Yang Kwei Fei and Zankiku Monogatari. He sets the scenario in feudal Japan, which leaves the viewer in part with a better exclamation: "boy, is feudal sucking, I'm glad it is over ...". And, of course, some scenarios, like the weaker films above Mizoguch, would be impossible in the literature today. Her female characters also sometimes become the archetypes of unrealistic self-sacrifices, which also makes the scenario less attractive. Saying "Crucified Lovers" is a good film, with so few relative weaknesses, although Ueda sometimes chilly, cynical prose, helps the screenwriter to separate that movie. I still prefer to give preference to and recommend Mizoguch's 1936 realistic Osaka Elegy and Gion sisters, as well as his recent masterpieces, showing more restraint and subtlety: "Ugetsu, Sansho Dayu" and "Oharu's Life".
