Just like in Rifif, the most powerful scene in the film is the perfect silence of the juvenile heritage. The scene is a masterpiece in its implementation, each robber has his own professional task, where each one successfully combines his unique talent towards the goal and for everyone up to a month ago. /> Many scenes play very slowly. In fact, the opening plan is a long introduction to both Core and Vogel, as we see that Corey is released from prison and Vogel escapes by capturing in prison. These two characters are then methodologically put together in a fate roadside eatery because Vogel hides Corey's car inside. From this unlikely break, two strangers agree that they become a partner to dedicate the perfect and precise jewel of them. <br /> <br /> However, in order to pull these thrusts, they must include the help of the third man Jansen. Jansen is hired by a man of a certain gun. His involvement in the mix was an interesting and desperate choice. During his lease, Jansen was in battle with DT and spent most of his day in bed with hallucination lizards, snakes and spiders. His transition from the dreamy and hallucinatory world of William S. Burroughs to a dream of lasting revenge and the sober-sharp shooter is very fast and perhaps the only true wrong moment on the film, but it's just very picky for me. <Br / Another remarkably wrong remark was a note from a police inspector, Matte. Sometimes he seemed to be great when he was able to arm the right people or gather information and wait for the prisoner. At other times, he seemed to have retired 10 years earlier, especially at the beginning of the Vogel forest ride. <br /> <br /> I don't know if I have too much hidden meaning from the beginning of the movie. At the beginning of the movie, when the police car travels through the city, the first picture we see as a red stop light. My first thought was that it could be a "red circle" and that if I wanted to have a deeper meaning in the film, maybe it was the car or rather the people inside it, through the red light. those who stop the jeweler. Hmmmm? <br /> <br /> Maybe the red circle refers to the stealing circle of the drum? Maybe it was a burning sled? Not important. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie, but it doesn't recognize it. The end is a little disappointing. It seemed rushed for a movie that seemed like such a delicious slow burn. 9/10 <br /> <br /> Clark Richards
