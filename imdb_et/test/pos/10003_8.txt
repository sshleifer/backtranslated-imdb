Bill Paxton has taken the true story of the 1913 US golf course and made a movie that is much more than a normal golf game. The film also discusses the tensions in the early 20th century in the classroom and touches on the deep anti-Catholic prejudices of both British and American companies. But there is a film in the heart that the millennium of the triennial is in conflict. <br /> <br /> The show is exemplary. Stephen Dillane is traditionally superb, but the film's revelation is Shia LaBoeuf, who provides disciplined, dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a French-Irish child, fighting his way through the prejudice of the New England WASP agency. For those who are only familiar with their "Stevens" blow, demonstrating their maturity is a delightful surprise. And Josh Flitter, as a ten-year-old caddy, is threatening to steal every scene in which he appears. <br /> <br /> An old-fashioned movie in the best sense: fine action, clear leadership and a great story that grabs to the end - the last scene, which is a gracious arrow to Casablanca, is just one of the many pleasures that make a great movie.
