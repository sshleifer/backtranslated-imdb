.. this film was made when Hitler (and Mussolini, who is also in the film) was at the top, and many politicians and even the Roman Church used Nazism to look cruel and evil. Especially in the US, there were many people who did not understand what actually happened in Germany and Europe (for example, Charles Lindenbergh). It would be like a great actor Berlusconi or Chirac's parody today. Chaplin may have made a lot of mistakes in his life, but it is really a masterpiece of humanity and a great demonstration by IMHO, which he was a brave man. The movie is funny and deep, the last speech has awful strength and is still being updated. I think this movie is one of the best made.
