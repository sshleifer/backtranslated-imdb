I think this short TV series was absolutely wonderful and gave a thorough and clear explanation of everything that was on the screen at that time. It was far from David Attenborough's best. Personally, I thought it was one of the best documentaries of the last ten years. It's definitely worth the money for people! <br /> <br /> I also found some abyss and deep water in the most exciting and interesting part. It was incredible to know that the "blue planet" team discovered more than 10 new underwater species! <br /> <br /> In this documentary, Atemborough almost certainly lived his high reputation. <br /> <br /> It was a masterpiece and is always considered one of the best contemporary documentary films. <br /> <br /> Many congratulations to the blue planet team.
