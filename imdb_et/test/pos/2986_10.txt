A remarkable film that brings to the surface all kinds of feelings when I had a lot, much younger. I loved it and Elton John's music. I remember being in a movie when I was a kid, and for some reason (limited release?) I never knew anyone else who saw it when the movie was released. <br /> <br /> The dreams that inspired me I've been left with me for decades, and seeing the movie again recently brought everyone back to the rush, but I testify that my kids (in their 20s) haven't experienced the same emotional speed. Generational thing? <br /> <br /> Why is it not on DVD?
