"Uzumaki" takes place in a small Japanese countryside where people go crazy. They go around nuts and spirals. The crisis is getting worse as people become deeds and swirls appear everywhere. "Uzumaki" must be one of the most bizarre and original horror films I've seen. The plot is really smart and the gore scenes are really funny because the film doesn't take itself too seriously. "Uzumaki" is wonderfully captured and the use of colors is top-notch The characters are pleasant and there are enough shocking surprises to satisfy the Japanese horror. Despite some fun scenes, the overall tone of this movie is quite dark. "Uzumaki" is not as good as "Ring", "Ju-on" or "Audition", but if you like Japanese horror movies, you won't be disappointed.
