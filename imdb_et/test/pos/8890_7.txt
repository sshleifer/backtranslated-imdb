A tasty nasty black comedy about middle aged schlub (Danny DeVito) who wants to kick off a mother and peel a plan to do it with a bitter divorce who wants to defeat her former wife. The film is completely unologistic in its cynicism and gives us something to please, but once it works rather than turn off the movie. <br /> <br /> Anne Ramsey, when she is a bright mother of DeVito's battle, steals the show in a grotesque funny performance. Even if he is horrible, you get rooting for him, because he seems to be able to hit both DeVito and Crystals at the same time, linking both hands behind his back. <br /> <br /> Rating: B +
