Not much more to say than it's a masterpiece. this film contains a lot of messages that everyone should take to heart. especially - women do not hit their men's dreams the same way - that's why you love her first! Those who intend to die live in the grave. Those who live are awakening. Even our Lord spoke of crying out who buried his talent, the fear that he might be wrong and attract the Master. Take the risk, get out of the boat and go on the water. Life is a journey that does not end in the grave, but in our mind and soul.
