This versatile thriller kept my attention. It is worrying and informative to see how abused human behavior can be. It is also instructive which earlier wounds may motivate current behavior. No one, Sandra Bullock's partner, is very pleasant. But everything is plausible. Sandra did a great job. His character, Cassie, lives with all his pain and fear and protection. He is a survivor and finally his life experience leads to a healing moment. I enjoyed this movie very much. Tom Landers
