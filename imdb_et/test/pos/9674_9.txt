It's a big show that it makes me wonder why this air was pulled so many times. But I believe it is here now! This show cant compare to any other, before the Simpsons was pretty "on the edge" and when it came to Family Guy, and they are stretching it to go "edge". The things that it shows are incredible. Fully watch! If you like the Simpsons, then LOVE a family man!
