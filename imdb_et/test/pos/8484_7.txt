Ray is partly interesting and technically very well done, but Ray is often slow and overlooks some important details about Ray's life. All the films show us the parts where he is the most important and the most successful, which is good, just I wanted to see some bits of his older life. Jamie Fox mimics Ray Charles, sometimes it's completely surprised. I have to say that Jamie is the reason I got this movie. The first half is much better than the other. It's more interesting, it has more Oomph, and it's almost as slow as the other. I wasn't a big fan of Ray Charles to get started honestly, so I had no expectations about the film that ever. Ray's biggest problem was to be over long. It could have been very easy to cut, more relevant scenes than those they used. I found the beginning of Ray's life when he just started to succeed, the most interesting. He was then a modest and somewhat gentleman. And while the film may have exaggerated his actions, he got too much to care for me. <br /> <br /> Performance. Jamie Fox plays Ray in the performance. He looks like Ray, speaks like Ray, works like Ray. He even sings like Ray! It's much more than an impression I believed he was, Ray Charles. He was the heart of the film, and without his presence, the film would have been complete and proud. <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Ray is sometimes interesting, terrible to others. When everything was said and done, I was disappointed when the routine seemed at times. Just because it's a bibliographic film, Doesen doesn't mean it's automatically worth Oscar. Jamie Fox deserves his Oscar, but at best the film is above average. It's worth watching, but if I were you, I would keep my expectations quite comfortable. <br /> <br /> 7/10
