The best part of this movie is that you can watch it again and again. I've been watching this movie for at least 10 times in the last 12 years, and still it makes me smile as I watch it for the first time. I have a very good comic, like Orgazmo, Cheech n chong, Monty Python series and many others, but this is one of my favorite films in Hindi. Some of these recently in Hindi are Golmaal, Munnabhai series and Herapheri series. So all I can say is that Hindi comedy is finally developing. But Andaz Apna Apna is quite different from the above films. What I call Hindi rocks for comedy and very few, which is found in the Hindi cinema in 1994. Cersers Rajkumar for Santoshi for a great movie.
