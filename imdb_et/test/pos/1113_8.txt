Portrait of a long time wonder that I've seen for a long time - and I'm not just talking about Australian films. This work seems to have been made "under the radar" and it is really a fascinating job that has recently seen an unseen world in Australia. making a movie. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is rather slow and strange - it seems that it is still tending and it is not quite sure if it is a thriller or a "main movie". But the stunning aspect of Alex Frayne's film is its iron fist and ruthless direction. It never threatens, it is very controlled, accurate and completely confident. Cinematography is some of the most artistic, beautiful and lyrical things I've seen. Sound is all psychological, music builds tension. , this is a bit of an impost - but by that time the film has a little trance, a sort of hypnosis, and you have sold the riddle - this is not the real answer.
