First of all, I must say that I am a big fan of Lucio Fulci and Dario Argento. Although I haven't seen all my movies, I enjoyed almost everyone I saw. I like giallos and I thought Argento was the captain of this genre, having seen films like "Tenebre" and "Phenomena". But after I saw Fulci's "New York Ripper", I found out that he could make good giallos from his graphic zombie films and even cross Argento to a certain level. <br /> <br /> I love Fulci style, and yes I love gore, but this movie thinks that although it has more developed plot and signs than its other movies, it's not his best. I don't like that it can sometimes cause confusion, especially at the end. And the fact that we go from one suspect to another and then to another until we even suspect that a slow little girl is for a moment, I think it's going too far. I know that you should guess yourself in giallo and the killer should be very hard to find, but this movie plays a little too much on our mind. But I did like a scene when the witch was killed, I think it's very well done and gave me chills. Action is also pretty good and photography is great. While this is not a bad film, I think Lucio Fulci has made it a better movie and I think his best is "The Beyond", a very different film, but more of an atmosphere and a visual experience. <br /> <br /> I give "Don't Torture Duck" from 7 out of 10. <br /> <br />
