I believe this film was made not so much for a princess sum that was Â£ 8,000, but it didn't really show. There was nothing amateurish about the production or the actors, the characters were harsh and real, and the location could have been one of the desert regions of the world, not on the not too hot beach north of Aberdeen. The actors were quite easily accepted as a cluster of mercenaries that remained on a mysterious, abandoned and uncharted planet, none of which seemed to be particularly friendly to each other, but were ready to fight to keep themselves and their comrades alive. There was no great explanation of what was going on, what could really be created, so a lot of the plot remained in his imagination rather than The Big Empty, which was also a pleasant film for me. I found that most of the time I warmed up the characters, some perhaps unintentionally entertaining moments, the men were so common that they felt that they would get empathy with them and that the climax and end of the film ended quite amazingly. I think Mr Stirton and his team should be proud of themselves, I have seen worse films with a budget of one million.
