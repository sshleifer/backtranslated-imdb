Dead Man Walking, Totally Brilliant, Tears End! You can't watch this movie and not think about the issues it raises; how can you justify killing (whether it is a murder or a death penalty) and at what point in time forgiveness is possible (not just mentally). Don't look at this movie as under you! But SEE THIS!
