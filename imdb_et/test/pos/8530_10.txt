Well, first of all - I'm a big fan of horror movies, but still - I'm pretty sick of all the damned American horror movies. They are all the same thing - blood and violence. It's not even scary. Well, it's not blood wrong and everything - it doesn't bother me - but it doesn't make the movie horrible! That's why I find this movie to be entertaining - it's nice to see satire that is fun from the concept of "the main horror of the US". American splatter / gore movies, they don't think they are horrible, just funny. It's OK. But if they think they are "horrible", it will usually be pathetic. However, there are some great American horror movies (Poltergeist, Psycho, Birds), but in the end everything is the same thing. That's why this movie came as a relief. Evil Ed is not just a cult film - it's classic! I can't wait until Captain Director Anders Jacobsson makes another damn devastating movie! Until I have Evil Edi again - and again - and look again! But I don't care - it's such a great movie!
