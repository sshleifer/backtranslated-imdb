Rififi is a great movie that has been overlooked. It's a criminal drama where a man gets out of prison and plans another job. It's over the used story, but it's different from others. They round off the usual suspects of the task. This film looks at how the family breaks down over time. The real hunt-scene is one of the best I've ever seen. Instead of a sensitive soundtrack, the director decided to remain silent for about thirty minutes. It fits perfectly with the mood and is often copied these days. Of course, the thing goes out of hand and people die and it ends at the end of a big crowd. <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for a great movie noir that many people are not talking about it is a great pickup.
