"Opera" is an excellent film with some wonderful, imaginative images. The opera singer (Cristina Marsillach) has been kidnapped by a murderer who forces her to look at her all who she knows to kill and bind her and record the needles under her eyes. the needles are due to the fact that Argento does not like the people covering their eyes when watching their films. â€œFor years I have been irritated by people who cover their eyes during their films. I want people to see them and not prevent a positive confrontation of these fears, looking away. So I thought to myself, "How could it be achieved and forcing someone to look at the harshest murders and make sure they can't prevent them from Eyes?" The answer I came up with is the core of "opera". says Argento. Lots of arrests, wonderful cinematography and brutal murders. wound, Daria Nicolodi gets into the eyes l ooking through the abyss, etc. For anyone who has not yet received it, try it.
