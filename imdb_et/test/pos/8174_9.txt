I've found this epic to be amazing, striking, and even heart-breaking. Some monumentality in beautiful and decorative wealth, great dramatic movement and dynamism. The choreography here is very enjoyable, the actors are very enjoyable. Have I been a big fan of CROUCHING TIGER? also, but it was even better. They have Kitano's ingenuity to enjoy. This beauty adventure cinema is an act of courage. When was the break so subtle and real? And the art of showing a large crowd, giant armies? The film has something deeply satisfying and unswervingly good taste. There is a tremendous joy in making such an intentionally impressive and clean exhibition. It's good without words. Few, few adventure movies, let alone epics, gave me such uninterrupted joy. <br /> <br /> The fan can be monumental. ? is not monumental art? but there is monumental fun like Leone's movies, like some of the 60's epics; as well as the trilogy of hobbits. This is great-sized fun.
