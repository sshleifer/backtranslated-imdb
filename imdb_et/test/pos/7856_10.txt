This film was a surprise. The plot summarizes the gift and the stars Clint Eastwood and the great Geraldine Page. I didn't know what to expect. There's an opening plan where the wounded soldier says age 12 is old enough to kiss and continue to give the baby a long and very mature mouth in the mouth. The child takes her to the girls internship where she lives. He uses the situation to try to seduce the Page, his assistant and another student. Jealousy, sexual tension, incest, intrigue, and makabre all sound in this wonderfully original story. <br /> <br /> I've read other comments here and found little to accept. But I wanted to clarify what I said earlier that there are no sympathetic signs in the film. I find there is one. An attractive female slave is successfully opposed to a soldier's progress that works well because it concerns the common history of black women slaves used by white men. Although his strength and lack of illusion is the sum of his experiences, I think it is a sympathetic character. She, more than any other woman and girl in school, has a legitimate reason to participate in what is finally happening.
