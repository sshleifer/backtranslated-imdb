i love this example! it's amazing ... I can never leave an episode even when I saw it. the actors are ideal for parts ...... I love Gilmore girls! I've been able to see all my friends. even their parents are watching it now. I look at it every day and usually look at it more than once a day. I wish my mother was like Lorelei. my friends say I speak and act like Lorelei. Loreleil and Roryl have an excellent mother-daughter relationship. this is a great tea show because they actually learn to watch it. my vocabulary has widened from Gilmore Girls. Lauren Graham and Alexis bled el are ideal for Lorelei and Rory parts. I think Luke and Lorelai should marry because Chris has left Lorele and Rory too many times. and has also broken Lorelei's heart too.
