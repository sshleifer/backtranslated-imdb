HOOT is for those three teenage children who are trying to save a bunch of owls. Now I think the right they have and what is wrong. in this film, the name Roy Eberhardt (Logan lerman) was moved from Montana to Florida. and when he arrives on the bus, the name of the bully Dana Matherson begins to harass him the next day, when Roy strikes the bully and runs off a bus that rides a mysterious rolling boy. After all, Roy finally meets a running boy named Mullet Fingers (Cody linley), in fact, his nickname given to him by his stepfather, Beatrice (Brie Larson), because he can catch the bubbles with his bare hands. Mullet Fingers and Roy are making friends and join Beatrice to build a new pancake restaurant. Mullet Fingers is one of the vandalists out there and later on he gets one of the dogs who put the construction works there. so they stood at the tail of the bulldozer, and everyone could see the owls that turned out to be a great movie because it showed where children can change in life when they are right and wrong. what's great about this movie. it teaches everyone all about nature and how important it is.
