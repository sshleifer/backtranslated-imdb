Euro-horror fans - Movie Madness, a Portland video / DVD store, has a dedicated part of this genre - can't afford what Sergio Martino's intestinal disruption is "L'isola degli uomini pesce" ("Screamers" in the United States). Countries). Here is a recession: some of the surviving lands of a marine casualty land in 1891 on a non-Caribbean island. The island is inhabited by a landowner, a scientist (Joseph Cotten) and his daughter (Barbara Bach). Of course, it turns out that the landowner makes the fish-men race to the scientist. And while fishermen stay calm until they can drink their drink, they will otherwise be disgusting. <br /> <br /> This movie is a kind of mix of genres: Euro-horror, swashbuckling, voodoo, and maybe a little "Dr. Moreau Island". But this is mostly an excuse for the fish men to destroy the convicts; you have to love it! I wouldn't be surprised if the Euro-horror genre gave Quentin Tarantino some of his idea of ​​"Grindhouse". After all, the European Horror Directors have no disruption to what they are showing. That's what you definitely like. <br /> <br /> So, Joseph Cotten is the only member of Alfred Hitchcock's film (I mean "Shadow of Doubt"), who later joined Ringo Starr soon with his wife and Audrey Hepburn's ex (who I mean Mel Ferrer) Italian horror. Things we see in life ...
