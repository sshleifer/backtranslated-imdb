I remember this movie over and over when I was a child. I love it. Although I've not watched it recently, I'm sure I enjoy it today. This is a very light funny movie that will make everyone laugh. The situations of each character were so funny and imaginative! I especially liked where the girl traveled with her mother's ashes (who reached them after the explosion on the road), robbers and nuns. These nice humor styles have been lost a lot these days. It also proved that actor Paul Keenan (Dynasty / Days of Days) was a great start. I recommend it to someone happy to find it in your local video store.
