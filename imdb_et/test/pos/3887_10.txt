Garlin is undoubtedly a comedian comedian and comedian for anyone looking for a good time. His first film, which is entirely his own creation and production, talks about fighting with Chicago actress James Aaron, with whom Jeff apparently identifies. He perfectly connects James to Paddy Chayefsky's "Marty" and Jackie Gleason's poor soul as he uncovers James's dilemmas with a number of actors who are real Jeff friends, many associates of Second City alumni. <br /> <br /> She rejoices Sarah Silverman's diameter and terribly absurd humor to show how, despite common sense and talents, life satisfaction can all too often frustrate. Bonnie Hunt gives romantic love. <br /> <br /> Don't let the simple story mislead, characters and conflicts are well thought out and ring. Those who follow Garlin's career and realize that his humor is based on narration of reality may not necessarily create fiction that is too easy to understand, appreciates his dialogue-based story. <br /> <br /> We will certainly see Garlin much more than a director and writer with other talented intelligent comedies who are challenging to make life funny.
