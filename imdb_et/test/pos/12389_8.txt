It kept me on the edge of my seat. True, the story is a couple of pits in the plot, but its tension, the way the director just challenges, is just exciting. <br /> <br /> José Coronado and Adriana Ozores have two of Spain's best actresses (see La vida mancha and Héctor) and here they appear to be a happy top middle class couple. Under it is the truth that the whole life of Coronado is wrong. He is not an economist, never went to college or worked in the Spanish central bank reserve, as everyone else believes. We get some knowledge about how he had to appear or be able to do that, and although it is not very plausible, it is somehow plausible. <br /> <br /> Internal scam operations are displayed intermittently, but are reliable because Coronado is a source of self-confidence and confidence. He does not only believe in scam, but also believes in the premise of the film, so he carries it. 10 years, but again, because he is an allegedly brilliant economist. <br /> <br /> In the national tone it is said that the film is not "clearly Spanish" as if it were a good impression test film. True, it has no chestnuts or odd rabbits, but a tight thriller. You want to know how this story ends when you look.
