If "Love Me Tonight" is "musical music that doesn't like music," it must be said that "Gay Desperado" is certainly not musical for people who don't like opera. In fact - although this comic operetta is probably based - is not really a musical at all, but a story of an attack attack with interpolated independent scores to show the voice of one character; Nino Martini, like the young singer Chivo, who joins the bandit's troops to get the radio on the ground (no, then the plot doesn't make much sense later), is a glorious golden tenor whose style is not the day since it was recorded . Some of his musical contemporary trillings and warblings belong to the past fashion, but the removal of Chivo's bow "Nessun Dorma" from the world championship is very easy. Unfortunately, although he has a gripping smile and a decent dramatic range, he is not able to act and sing at the same time. The result is that otherwise a fast paced movie will drag every time Chivo puts his chest on his chest and begins to say, and the viewer's tolerance to the result will probably depend on his operative performance. In addition to this drawback, the film is an enjoyable broad-haired satire of Hollywood conventions, and especially the Mexican bandit stereotype, which achieves the vital purpose of all such fraud to make its characters sufficient in its law to keep the viewer interested if the joke would otherwise have grown. The leader of the bandit and his sidekick has a traditional double-ratio relationship, carved by a mirror-carved teak-face and a heroic heroine (a young East Lupino) who performs a general "you say you hate me, but you really love me" routine with a refreshing twist. /> <br /> In general, the movie is fun and pretty funny, and I feel I got my money - but it cannot be denied that musical interludes, in their own way admirable, cause serious afflictions.
