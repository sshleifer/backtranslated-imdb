This is a special movie when you know the context. In his eighties, Antonion was struck by strokes. He's muted and half-paralyzed, his friends, who by the way is the best thing the film world has done, have arranged to "direct" the last important film. The idea is that he can just read the story by looking at it. So we have a movie: about a director who hopes for songs with a simple look. And the question of the (four) story is how the visual imagination determines love. <br /> <br /> The film is created by giving us the means to bring it through our own imagination. The result is a clean film world: every person (except the director) is cute in the aspect or movement. Some of these women are ultralovely and they exist in a dreamy foggy face. There is no nuance, no hint that something exists, but what we see; nothing wants to work beyond what we create. <br /> <br /> I don't know of any other film that so successfully manipulates our own visual longing for the world we see. He understands something about touching. No one understands Van Morrison visually as he does. Morrison's Celtic space music is based on exactly the same concept: sensual touch, which means, but does not physically touch. <br /> <br /> Antonion's redhead woman will appear as a merchant, and she will also manage the inconvenience of "DVDs on DVD. <br /> <br /> Tedi rating - 3/4: worth a look.
