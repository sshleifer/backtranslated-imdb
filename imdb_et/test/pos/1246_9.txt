I really enjoyed this movie. Yes, during the whole film, there was disrespect, but Bruce Willis learned from The Kid that there is more value in returning others, and his mismatch in life has to change. This movie was a refreshing change in the trash that Hollywood is trying to push down our throat. You need to learn very well in this movie. I really believe it was the best in Disney, though a few things could have been left out. I had the impression that there was no passion and no sexual inuendo. It's not perfect, but much better than everything else there.
