*** Front Spoilers *** In my late childhood, there were two cinematic icons: Star Wars and this film by the Czech genius Karel Zeman. Encyclopedia of Jules Verne, in which XIX century illustrations live in fine black and white photography, combined with stop-motion and traditional animation.

Elliptical and elegant is also the death of the villain, whose (probably nuclear) explosion will send his hat across the sea.
