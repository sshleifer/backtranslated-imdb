I think FARSCAPE is the best sci-fi sci-fi and is one of the best sci-fi TV series all the time (ranked there by Dr. Who, Blake 7, Red Dwarf, MST3K and B5 above). I find that Farscape characters and races are much more interesting and imaginative than the usual "people-birthmarks" found in many series. Impacts are pretty good and stories are involved. Despite the fact that the season 2 and some seasons do not have much to do, I think that character development is very well done.
