I testify that I couldn't get a little attention, but I got enough of the story to agree that this is a great family film from director Lionel Jefferies, who played Chitty Chitty Bang Bang's grandfather Potts. Basically, it starts with a happy middle-class family living in Victoria, London. One night the Father (Iain Cuthbertson) visits two strangers and leaves with them and does not return. They're moving home and kids here; Bobbie (Jenny Agutter, whom I first saw in a child's play 2), Phyllis (Sally Thomsett) and Peter (Gary Warren) keep their spirits up, interested in the nearby railway. On a daily basis, they faithfully wander with the passengers of trains and boldly and vigilantly avoid the accident and make heroes. Their friendliness makes them friends, including important people who can help them find the secret of their lost father. Dinah Sheridan also plays as a mother / lady. Waterbury, Bernard Cribbins as Albert Perks, William Mervyn as Old Gentleman, Peter Bromilow as Doctor Forrest, Ann Lancaster as Ruth and Gordon Whiting as Russian. It was number 29. The 100 Greatest Family Films and it was number 24 The Greatest British Films. Very good!
