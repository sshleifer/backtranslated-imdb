Faqrscape is really one of those that shows it has it all, great actor, big cast, great writing, set, chemistry, muppets ... it's all and then some except home. This fantastic series seems to be everything except and ending. It seems that TPTB thinks it is a series of consecutive individual sets, if anyone who watches knows that it is a continuous, one epic, love story that has the end that needs to be seen. If you've never watched Farscape and check it on a DVD when the 1st season is released in October .... and the 2nd season is the best! Check out the sci-fi launches to catch up and then start the new season from January to March, when most of the exhibitions go down and look out for sure. If everything goes well, we will end!
