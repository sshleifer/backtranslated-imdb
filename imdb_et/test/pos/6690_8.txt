This movie is brilliant ...... no doubt. I looked at it a while ago after the family members had come into the sci-fi movies (which I don't have), and I thought it was pretty good. But after watching some documentaries in foreign space recently, etc., we looked at it again ... and that's good. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is undoubtedly one of the greatest actors ever and I like Jeff Bridges (Big Lewbowski, blown, Arlington Road). The film revolves around the patient's nursing home, claiming to be from another planet. Yeah, you think ... but what if his story is so plausible that even his psychiatrist will start thinking whether he's telling the truth. <br /> <br /> So the story, along with the bridges, develops through all the emotions associated with Proti (as he is known), his own psychiatric colleagues, his wife and family, his brother and his cosmologist astronomers (who after Prot ' i know quite a lot about getting the data that he can be the truth!) a big movie ... that thinks you ..... <br /> <br /> 8/10 Dave
