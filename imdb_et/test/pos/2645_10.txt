It was such a big movie. This was done with such a beautiful design, such a symmetry. I love how classical music relates to earth, space, and distant classical art. It was so smooth and thought of a masterpiece. I loved the way monoliths didn't change, though primate, earth, and space. I loved how it was a question of "Do you need me / us now"? The film expressed desire, peace, love, curiosity, subtlety, tenderness, courage and innocence. What else could you just ask about the movie? Maybe complete the movie. Every 2001 Evaluator: The Space Odyssey finds the 2010 film, which is a 2001 complementary film. 2010 is more than 2001.
