The film is actually about choices. In the under-emphasized situation where good women were supposed to be obedient and do what was right in the tradition, there were few opportunities for Radha and Sita. However, it was promised that this was not their only option. What is life without desires, Radha asks Ashok. Yes, it is true that life gives us many options, but how much we can take depends on many external factors. If your world is confined to a small Indian household, being a conscientious girl to a quiet but remarkable powerful matriarch who is a 13-year-old obligatory husband to a man who has accepted the promise of tibibati because you are unable to become a child, a man who only wants you to have lie next to him to prove his strength in eliminating his desires. I felt that the ladies had few choices to find solace in each other's business. I think so many women praised Mrs Mehta's work because it gave them the opportunity to think for themselves. Possibility to do what was apparently unacceptable. The lesbian scenes I felt were just turning this point. I think every scene is etched in the movie from the first Taj Mahal to the last mosque. How depressing to be a prisoner of your feelings and desires. Feel that you have to give up humanity to be a conscientious husband just because you are expected. You have to suppress any desire and crave a person's touch. What is the meaning of our existence then. In a scene where Sita cries alone in the room and Radha needs to comfort her, their lips accidentally practice each other and awakens them. Something they've lost both. <br /> <br /> Bravo Mrs Mehta, in an explicit translation of her vision. I especially like the return to a young Radha who is trying to see the ocean. This is the metaphor of freedom. Freedom of choice, freedom to transport to places where we usually do not reach. In these scenes, we have been told gently that her mother has given her a sense of duty, which I assume will live according to the rich Indian traditions. The film is filmed and enhanced beautifully by A.R. Rahman. I have become a terrifying fan of two leading actresses and directors since the movie. I look forward to the future productions by Mrs Deepa.
