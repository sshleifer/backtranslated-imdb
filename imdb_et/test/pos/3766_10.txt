From the "Pharmgie" generation, I thought this movie was fun. It certainly brought Jekyll & Hyde so to say. My husband and I laughed all over. It would be nice to have the movie in my collection. I told my two teenagers about the movie and they'd like to see it. They are not drugs, but they know enough to understand comedy in the movie. It has been as long as I've seen it. I don't remember just a few things. I have to say that the funniest part was when Dr Jekyll collapsed in his lab table and inhaled the straw, when he was snoring, he threw out the invented powdered medicine. The fun thing I've ever seen in the movie.
