Luis Bunuel has always been a filmmaker whose work was unclear to me. My first experience with him was the discreet charm of Bourgeosie, which was often seen as his greatest work, with which I was so frustrated and bored that I finally closed the tape. Similarly, I was not interested in Belle de Jour, which is almost certainly her best-known film and is generally considered one of her many masterpieces. I didn't hate it like I didn't sample, but I didn't like it. Third, I saw L'Age d'Ori. Finally, I was somewhere. Fourth, there is also Los Olvidados. However, neither L'Age d'Or nor Los Olvidados blew me. Big movies, but not masterpieces. <br /> <br /> Nazarin is my fifth Bunuel and I just like it more than the other two. It is the Spanish priest who is currently living in Mexico that refuses to live in a luxury where most of the priests live. He wants to be more like Jesus, leading the most enjoyable life. He is also ready to forgive something and suffer without protest. I'm pretty sure that Bunuel does not recognize this character and sees him as fair in itself. But I only assume that thanks to the director's knowledge, the most famous quotation of which is "God, I am still an atheist," he apparently interviewed this very movie (I get this information from John Baxter's book Bunuel if you are interested). The interviewer who pulled these words out of Bunuel's mouth must be confused about Nazarin. One who believed in religious beliefs, who also knew nothing about Bunuel, can see the priest as heroic. This is especially true when the viewer has his own criticism of organized religion. The priest may be somewhat fair, but it seems to be a good man in principle. When he keeps his violent prostitute in his room to protect him (and probably to save his soul), people begin to know and assume their relationship is sexual. His bosses take the same and punish him. Later, he is still suffering from religious punishment.
