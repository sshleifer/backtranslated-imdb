I thought it was the most interesting film JCVD ​​has been doing for a very long time. I loved her character and the whole thing with the rabbit set a different tone for this film. IMHO, JCDV can really move on. A little bit of a heartache, some obvious respects to other films that have been mixed with some great struggles ... I would like to see more of this style of filmmaking. One of the other posters thought the bar scene was hanging on Desperado. I immediately saw the contact of R. Rodriguez, but I thought it was very smart and made me look at the movie again to look for more subtle tips from other films. JCVD stones !! <br /> <br /> Other things after reading other comments: <br /> <br /> No dungeon fighting music? First of all, I didn't like it, but then I thought it was interesting because it threw me out of balance, giving us something we didn't expect. This seems to be more real. <br /> <br /> I also laugh whenever directors cry like 2-year-olds that their movie was stolen in the studio. Directors are paid a job. The studio is a boss and they want the product they want. Very few drivers have the final final cut of the film. In this case, JCVD's talent and the only reason someone watches this movie. I'm sure he got the movie he was happy with. I have a relative working in a post office who knew a little story. PRESUMABLY, the director worked and gave her a cut movie. Anyone who saw it said it was a disaster ... then JCVD ​​and the studio changed the movie. This thing happens all the time. He also saw the last paragraph (which he claims he did not do) and his "delicate genius" ego was heavily bruised because they hated the piece they delivered. If that driver were wise, he would have had credit for it because it would have been his best.
