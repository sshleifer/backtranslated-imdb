I'm a big fan of Naruto, though I haven't watched every episode or read every manga. <br /> <br /> I really liked the first Naruto movie and the truth that I was a bit nervous that it would not be as good (or packaged) as the first (mainly because in Australia it was just PG instead of PG, which is PG-13 USA or 12 UK). But I was wrong (thankfully)! The animation was better (though some drawings from the markings seemed rushed) and was especially good in the fight. <br /> <br /> Speaking of it, we're talking about fighting scenes! The scenes of animation and action were remarkable and fun! I especially enjoyed the genjutsu battle with the canoe and the struggle against Gaara to fight the shape-changing female warriors! All the characters are here! Naruto, Sakura, Gaara, Kankuro and Shikamaru! If only Temari was in the movie, Shikamaru could dramatically save him from the warrior! And maybe they could have a PASSIONATE KISS! On my summary, it qualifies more than cinema as an extended episode. And that's it! The action is very cinematographic and the quality of animation is especially fancy, especially during the fight! In general, this is an excellent anime movie that is black-it for any Naruto fan! 5/5! 10/10! 50/50! 100/100! Okay, I'll stop!
