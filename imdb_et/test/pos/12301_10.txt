This is probably the most complete film I've seen - acting, adjusting, and heading. It's independent and sort of, so it's not worth saying that it's better or worse than other great movies, but it's a perfect piece of art in itself. <br /> <br /> And it was fun to see how confused the horror fans rose and went out!
