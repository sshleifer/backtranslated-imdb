Okay, I'll tell you that some of the sciences "Doppelganger" (or "Sunrise") are peculiar. Without discovering the whole idea of ​​the planet (because we don't see it on the other side of our sun), it doesn't hold at all - every 101 students in Astronomy know that another Earth, which is the size of the Earth, would cause gravitational disturbances in other planetary movements. Thus, astronomers concluded that Pluto's existence was ultimately and so they regularly found comets and asteroids and months. <br /> <br /> And the idea that the mirror image of the Earth is somehow perfectly parallel to our Earth, only to English-speaking scientists and human colleagues for every person born on our Earth ... that takes things out of the "science" fiction and "Twilight Zone" territory. It may not be a bad thing, but it requires a substantial suspension of critical thinking to receive and enjoy it. But the man, this movie pulled my socks out as a teenager. I was still accustomed to quite joyful, enchanting science fiction when the hero, even "2001", finally ended up having a "surprising" ending. <br /> <br /> But in this case: Thinnes tried to dock with her orbiting mothers' ships so she could return to her Earth just to get her back from the dock's quay (something that didn't turn the polarity around because his "doppelganger" didn't do the same thing. Obviously Thinnes' 'doppelganger' had decided he was happy in his new home.) The Thinnes ship began to go back to the CounterEarth launch site and I was sure he would somehow get the damaged craft to land safely and Try again, armed with new information that would allow him and his supporters to succeed. He was a hero and the hero always won. Instead, Thinnes was unable to hold the caught craft and the subsequent collision of the ship at the launch site was so terrible and devastating that he killed everyone (except the head of the project) and destroyed the project and the existence of Thinnes. The thin could never go home and he died useless, his secrets never appeared. <br /> <br /> Except for the Apeside planet series, I never saw such a sad and falling end, and it is always in my mind - especially the wild crash of the crash scene at the beginning (you knew that the spacecraft was never ever flying again) !) and it was over. <br /> <br /> I would like to see this movie again and see how well it has grown over the years.
