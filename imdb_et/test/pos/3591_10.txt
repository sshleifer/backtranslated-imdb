As a SCUBA diver, I can understand the amazing physical load that a cameraman has to hold to get the shots underwater. This series is much more than that. Talking is perfect with unlikely scenes that limit the scene. The daily struggle for life that takes place from the point of view of the people on our land is desperation. This DVD set has opened my eyes to another planet right here on Earth. I invite everyone to watch this series.
