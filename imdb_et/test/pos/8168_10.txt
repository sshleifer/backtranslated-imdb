I am a sociologist / anthropologist who specializes in the field of symbolic interactivity, and I must say that this film is of high quality in a symbolic context throughout the film. For anyone who has not seen it yet, I suggest that you read Victor E. Frankl's "Finding the Ultimate Meaning of Man". I think you can do some amazing connections. <br /> <br /> In saying this, I would like to say that, despite the fact that the main characters are gay, it is not a story of being gay. This is the story of finding a life and finding meaning, despite the difficulties and challenges, the pain and the fear that is on your roads. This is the story of finding and finding balance and integrity and happiness.
