"Valley Girl" launched Nicolas Cage's career and was in the 80's "Romeo and Juliet". This is a definite example of the 80's teenage classic. Nicolas Cage, Deborah Foreman, and Elizabeth Daily have excellent images in this movie, but it will never exceed "Ridgemont High" as a teenager in the 80s because if it wasn't "Fast Times," the 80s generation of teen flicks would just be big blow head. It has been confirmed.
