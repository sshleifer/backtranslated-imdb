The word "hidden gem" has never been so precise. Bad filmmakers can look for all the next hidden shadows, sometimes things like Weasels come up, which my body is hanging on, but at other times, something like Death Bed will succeed and eventually, it will hopefully not be a bad movie at all, it's just bad The title, and not even the bad title, is humorous, which can throw you away, but somehow the death bed is still in the "bad" category. A strange and empty vibe is a Death Bed real masterpiece with a low budget horror reserved exclusively for those who have the fortune to understand such a blind shadow in vision. <br /> <br /> The Death Bed is inconsistent, yet intriguing, with a sympathetic ghost on the bed with a demon and portrait, who only wants to be able to release someone's terrible fate from the yellow foam. Although not all of this scary, given that it is a killer bed, Death Bed has features that make it a great horror. Dark, desolate vibe, confusion, terrible, fine score and the quality of dreams that this masterpiece almost flaunts. Such quality or vibe usually seems involuntary. Not only deliberate, but what I read, is based on the real dream of a death bed, George Barry, director, a successful dream movie, only the genius was able to perform such a task. <br /> <br /> Old manors make a good-quality horror, as do portraits, not sure what to do with the killer's yellow liquid, a rather strange dream. Nor is it the name of the B-Horror, which I expected with the title and all in mind. Before I saw this gothic pearl, I was waiting for something like a massacre of a class reunion, now this bad movie, once you've seen it, you know what I'm saying. After all the above considerations, I feel that the Bed of Death deserves only eight stars, but as long as it remained so long, we say that the dining room deserves nine.
