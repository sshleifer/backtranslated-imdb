I'm surprised and come across the number of reviewers who didn't get Black Snake Moan. It does not mean black / white relations or old / young relationships, although I think the director Craig Brewer deliberately threw both elements into the snapping of taboos. This does not mean sexual abuse or sexual addiction, although the character of Christina Ricci, Rae, characterizes them. This does not mean the religion of the people in the black community, although religion plays a big role. It's not a love story, though not one, but two happy pairs. And this is definitely not south where "everything is hotter", although it's south and it's undeniably hot; holy smokers, even sign language writers didn't get the point. <br /> <br /> Black Snake Moan is a parable of the Mississippi Delta Blues; who knows those who write them, who plays them, what they play, how they treat them. <br /> <br /> It would be like the filmmakers sat on an empty slate and asked, "Okay, if we were to help people understand what the blues really is, what does it look like?" Then they dream of two characters, of which the woman left to live with her best friend, the other who is fighting and her poorly abused girl sleeps with all the city. Then we throw away from the sparse world that the religion of the people touched a little (they know that Jesus wants his life, and although they respect him, they know that they cannot give it), some violence between men and women, and many and many steaming sexual acts. pictures, including - ready to go over the top? - Black man in a sleeveless underwear with a half-naked white girl imprisoned with a 40 lb disc. Fill it with the authentic delta blues sounds, make it a real blues voter, use music as the main healing element in the plot, hit the blues man at both ends of Son Son House and Voila - you have a modern parable of what Blues is all about. Even the climax of the film is not a conflict of character, but the whole city dances steamy dances for hot, dirty blues. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a bit of a dilemma here. Rae (Ricci) is destroyed by uncontrollable lust and Lazarus (Jackson's) improves due to home religion and persistence (and don't forget the chain). end. Is it an expression of restored, healthy vitality or just the same embarrassing behavior that first destroyed it? Brewer wants it in both ways, but blues are actually about sex and violence, not to mention depression. I think he says that blues gives expression to both sexual and violence without being free. I have doubts. <br /> <br /> Samuel L Jackson does not perform so well for the first time that we forget to look at Samuel L Jackson; man is incredibly good. He even selects some of his stories in the movie and his playing is authentic, dirty and hot. Christina Ricci is not usually good either. In this case, half of her work has been done with a costume that was not there, and her sliding figure, but she is a wonderful combination of cynical lust, rebellion and vulnerability; Bravo for him, he's arrived. I was impressed by the state preacher John Cothran, Jr. I had to check the database to confirm that he was a professional actor and not a true Minister of State. <br /> <br /> Parents need to know what they are when children bring it home. The language is far from the schedule, the first half-hour is full of graphical sex, and women are corrupted in a dozen ways during the film (Lazarus means well and is decent, but honestly, linking the woman's radiator?) Plus, Ricci spends half of the sex-dressed movie; if you have teenage boys, they slide the screen toward the movie. I do not recommend it to children of all ages. Only adults, please. It is unusual but worth the time. And my goodness, is the sound hot.
