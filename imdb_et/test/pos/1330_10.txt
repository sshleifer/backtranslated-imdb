With such pain I knew it would be amazing. However, I was cautious, as I always have. Will it keep the first movie hour? Could they repeat the tension and excitement of the 11 masterpieces of the ocean? We never know because they didn't try. At least not as I expected. Instead, they made a light and a really funny parody. If you want a catchy, logical hunk, don't look at it. If you want to laugh, clever dialogue, peculiar characters, and an absolutely genius scene where Julia Roberts has to bring forth, then you love the ocean 12.
