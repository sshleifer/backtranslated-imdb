This film is one of the best memories I have from childhood. Having always loved Tiger, my mother took a look at it. <br /> <br /> It's absolutely amazing. This is one of those films that gives you a lasting impression. The picture of the tigers running through the snow, where it all sprinkles, is still around 25 years. Must see. I've been looking for a movie for some time without accident. Amazon checking every time and then doesn't show anything, not even listed. If anyone knows the source, contact me or post here.
