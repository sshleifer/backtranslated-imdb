I am a great follower of Indian film, especially Malayalam and Tamil. <br /> <br /> Shame on India for not sending this movie as an official Oscar entry. I've seen this movie and it's clear to me that the Tamil cinema is in its scenario and narrative, which has a better result. The road to all our western countries is more qualitative and very different from the Bollywood, which is all about good looks glamor and promotion. <br /> <br /> To the point that India was thinking when they sent a Oscars movie like "Devdas"? It was really a masochistic move. I think they are trying to punish Oscar judges with boredom when they send Devdas, because the judges last year banged Lagan. <br /> <br /> "Devdas" is simply beloved, outdated and predictable love, destiny and destiny. I'd keep away from it. In any case, the non-sending of Kanathil Muthitali, such as a movie, shows the necessary innovation for the new Indian administration to save those poor administrators who lack intelligence. Now I know why there are so many questions in this country. They are very talented but not properly presented.
