Father Hood <br /> <br /> I understand why many people hate the story of a father who kidnaps his two children and carries them all over America, but I've seen much worse and - when I saw this year back - I didn't think it would be particularly horrible. Patrick Swayze is a troubled father who takes his children to run with him for personal reasons, and Halle Berry is a policeman who is behind him. <br /> <br /> In general, a person is a person to spend a few hours of his life. You may be worse - never hear the movie "Pod People"? <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 Off ***** <br /> <br /> Some PG-13 rated traumatic scenes, adult content, violence and language.
