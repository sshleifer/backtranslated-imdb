There are only a few movies that can be called "black it" and SHEPHERED is one of those movies. In many ways, it was a time before (and you can say that it was a source of inspiration for a number of well-known movies). <br /> <br /> The story is complicated, but it is still strenuous, but often fun thriller and extremely pointless, provoking exploration of humanity. The story takes place in an apocalyptic world where people have to live underground and chaos. C. Thomas Howell is a "Shepherd Dog" who protects people from different religious leaders by killing all inappropriate members of society. The whole idea made me think about our society. This is really a brilliant social comment that is more than I can say about some recent sci-fi / action blockers. MATRIX RELOADED and REVOLUTIONS did not feel that real innovation was taking place, but the dull impact of video games. But SHEPHERD scores are also on the scale ... <br /> <br /> This movie will never let the viewer's soul shut. Peter Hayman proves to be one of the few genius executives. We're talking about a 100% high-quality kung fu fight! It was great. Really good special effect, shoot-out, gloomy-futuristic cyber-punk noir style? the film really has its elements. <br /> <br /> When it comes to SHEPHERD, it is impossible to say how much style it is. The vision of this city is really stunning. He recalls Tim Burton's very memorable vision of Gotham at BATMAN. And these sights have been photographed with Graeme Mears, who can shame Gordon Will and the Hall of Conrad. Even special effects turned out to be amazing. Undoubtedly, the scenes in which the fight is taking place are the guiding principle of all filmmaking. This movie is a ballet of a fantastic visual screen. <br /> <br /> However, it is an interesting story based on strong pain. Functional (especially Rowdy Piper) and plot are as big as perfectly targeted. Unlike the loads of futuristic films made with strong artificial flavor, the characters are believing and dialogue is natural and meaningful. I'm always proud to see a big movie like SHEPHERD. It's a shame that it didn't get a good deal and didn't do anything at the ticket office. This is a rarity you should look for. This movie will impress you and make you feel 10 times cooler.
