Considering Mick Molloy's amazing event because I left myself, I had quite low expectations for Crackerjack. Even the movie posters were nervous to me. In fact, if that weren't the fact that I got free tickets for the preview, I would resist the pressure of Mrs. (who thinks Mick is a hunk - it's a concern) to pay for it. /> <br /> In the first few minutes of the film, I was worried - it starts with one of the tired Micks "angry with irrelevant things", but it was given a clean touch that at least made it a little refreshing. The rest of the scripts were pretty good and very light-hearted - even the typical Mick Molloy (and Judith Lucy) humor was delivered well and although I never had to go out of the harvest, it caused a lot more smiles that I was waiting for (and that was consistent). <br /> <br /> The plot has nothing new - quite predictable, but it moved quickly between one liner and other jokes - I've never felt it placed on any element that is too long or too short; Mick has to work hard to polish his script. There were one or two "late shows" jokes and one or two jokes that only Melbournians got - but there are certainly a lot of common things for a wider audience. <br /> <br /> Something that I found disappointing was that John Clarke was rather unpleasant - he just didn't seem to be working halban, but it didn't diminish the movie too much. <br /> <br /> All over, I enjoyed this Australian comedy and entertaining entertainment during the movie. I left the cinema with a decent-sized smile - a pretty difficult thing that Australian comedy did in my books. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br />
