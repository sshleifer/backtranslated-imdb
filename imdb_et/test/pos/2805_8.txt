This is a very well-made film that shows the lives of international students during their "Erasmus Year" in Barcelona, ​​which is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe and is an ideal place. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​all different languages ​​is great and gives the film an original atmosphere. There are some clichés about countries, but most of them are true! The characters could not better represent their different countries. <br /> <br /> Having experienced "Erasmus" during my semester in Italy, I can say that the film is incredibly authentic. I had a lot of experience that was similar to the characters (except if I didn't put it so often). The film is also quite funny, but it doesn't like all those stupid American college movies. / 10 (I may not be very objective, however)
