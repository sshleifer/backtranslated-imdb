I just looked at Conrack for the first time. Although the last third of the film leaves something undesirable, it is a very touching and heart-warming study of human evolution to overcome its youth and nurture hostile lunches and to link the teacher's creativity to students, regardless of background and difficult circumstances. As a teacher, we see the teacher adjusting to his students and preparing them for all the challenges that life offers, not just the lessons learned in the textbooks, which is a valuable concept that we all need to remember. The Vietnam War is ringing today. Worth a look.
