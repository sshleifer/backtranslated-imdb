Coen Brothers has done it again. Convicted by three periods of depression (George Clooney, John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson) are escaping the Mississippi chain gang and have to look for buried treasures that fund their new life. Along the way, they sing on the radio and become coveted stars and refugees. Big laughs and the soundtrack that is the story of bluegras music. <br /> <br /> Clooney is outstanding as fast speaking, Ulysses Everett McGill quickly appeared. Holly Hunter plays her alienated woman. Turturro and Nelson are flawless stumbles. John Goodman and Charles Durning are also performing. <br /> <br /> Dan Tyminks Gets George Clooney's Song Voice "I'm a Man of Continuous Attack", a song by Soggy Bottom Boys, a bluegrass soundtrack featuring Alison Krauss, Ralph Stanley, White, John Hartford , The Cox Family and Gillian Welch. Rack knock, knee fun for the whole family. You'll be surprised at how fun and funny this film is.
