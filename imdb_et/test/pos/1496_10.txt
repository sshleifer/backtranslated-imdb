Mr Bean was very fun, I loved it, every episode was really funny, Rowan Atkinson was perfect for this role, he's a funny look and his facial expressions were fun! <br /> <br /> The series was so successful that they even made Mr Bean's film in 1997, which was also quite funny! <br /> <br /> This is funny, seeing all the adventures and situations he gets into, this series was definitely a classic and I'm still looking at an episode. <br /> <br /> Mr Bean is worthwhile in my book, fans of comedy fans have to review it.
