Released as KING BOXER in the UK <br /> <br /> This movie was the first kung fu movie that was common in the UK. Many of us were Kurosawa's astonishingly sparse and involved in drama and used oriental film beautifully photographed and illuminated at a somewhat restrained pace, like everything that is an album of very fine photographs that just happened. <br /> <br /> Coming Run Run Shaw and co. with their wide screen "home movie" product values ​​and amazing mature parody duplication and all the rules have changed. The boxer was the first to pass through the door, leaving a clearly marked mark for the others to be planted on firmly kneed footprints. <br /> <br /> Despite hunting plots, pantomime, cheese jump clips, and spaghetti, Western-style snap-steped zooms, this movie was wonderful. Gorgeous without being a rich and the most beautiful choreographer ever to grace the screen. We loved sickness, agony, testosterone. Our martial arts artists found some techniques that were exciting when they were terrible and often stupid. It was so different from the Japanese things we all knew, and it was a lovely acrobatic grace that complimented perfectly the ill-fated violence and the blooded floors. Pleasant. <br /> <br /> The "KIng Lear" scene was at this time a pretty important milestone for "You cruel bastards .. My **** !!" It is now rather less shocking, but still a little intestinal. We didn't notice that the women on the horizon were absolutely one-dimensional. After seeing more movies in the genre, it now looks like a painful thumb, but at a time when it wasn't important, this movie set what would quickly become a kung-fu movie clip. All of them. Look at it and keep in mind that until it split into the western screens, it wasn't a genre to hit. It was unique and awesome. It was the first kung fu movie and it's still the best for me and many others.
