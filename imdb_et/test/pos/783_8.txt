Under the leadership of the British Twist Harold and Maude, Rupert Grint and Julie Walters are top-riding during driving hours. While it is true that Grint has a stony face like the redhead Benjamin Braddock in the first half of the film, it does not stop the peculiar family film - there are things that will fall out of his character's experience, which would cause a shocked shock. The chemistry between Walters and Grint bears the film, although Laura Linney's hard work to create her written stereotype is remarkable. These performances with fun poppies along with artists such as Sufjan Stevens, John Renbourn and Salsa Celtica make this child's popcorn trapped on Saturday afternoon.
