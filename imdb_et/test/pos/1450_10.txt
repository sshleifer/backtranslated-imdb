I am fifteen years old and have seen thirty-three Sinatra movies (not reading TV shows and documentaries) and only two of them have known. "Until the Roll of Clouds" and "The Miracle of Clocks" don't really think, since he first sings the great "Ol 'Man River" and he doesn't have half the bad pictures of the latter, my favorite documents, radio shows, TV shows and movies about Sinatra change practically every day, everything that takes a different meaning in every view, and from time to time seems to be the best he ever did and from time to time worst until the cycle is around again, but there are a couple of things that are incomparable when it comes to "With a Golden Scarf," the man runs this list. Anyone who knows something about Sinatra knows that he thought it was his best he was an Oskar candidate, this was the first serious look at drug addiction etc, etc. Jazz score is unforgettable, Kim Novaki's pleasant look with a ridiculous accent, Eleanor Parker is tedious and too dramatic, turtle like Arnold Stang is fun for the first time, but every time embarrassed and Darren McGavin makes a marvelous s drug dealer, kits are not convincing - at first glance it looks like a peculiar mixed bag that big Otto Preminger brings together with a central charm. Then you come to Sinatra. Like everything else in his life - apart from music - his reports are divided into half. Directors such as Fred Zinnemann, Frank Capra, Billy Wilder, Stanley Kramer, Martin Scorsese, Peter Bogdanovich and Otto Preminger were all agreed that if Sinatra did so much work on her films as she sang, she would have been one of the biggest actors in the world - if not the largest. Humphrey Bogart even said: "This scheme has the most natural talent I've ever seen." It wasn't a bad man who never worked in his life, at the same time he produced a discography that would make him "the greatest singer of the 20th century" and made almost all his scenes in one. <br /> <br /> In direct contradiction with this, there are other reviews and biographies that are sniffing about what one horrible actor was Mr.Sinatra and how many "bad" movies he did. The question can never be satisfied with everyone's satisfaction, because the disputes were among the biggest assets of Sinatra, and both arguments played in some sense in his hand. In any case, Sinatra is excellent in this role. At the end of the 1950s, the reviewer said, "Sinatra may not be the world's largest actor, but it is no longer interesting to watch." Whatever Sinatra does in the movie, it's hard to take her eyes off. This is, of course, the "charisma" I've seen only a few other people - Orson Welles, Richard Burton, Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, or James Cagney. There is no real definition for this and it is often difficult to figure out whether you really enjoy performance or just be fascinated, but this quality is displayed here, which makes the movie. Sinatra is even riveting, real, intense - over decades and thousands of paper doll stars, called quality. Such or not, it is a one-man display with a few characters in the background. She covers all the emotions with a remarkable nuance, sweetly, lonely, with Kim Novak Frank Sinatra (Frank Sinatra!) Against the terrible shock of bullying and bullying "cold turkey". Sinatra was right - this is her best result. There is no question. <br /> <br /> I was eight when Frank Sinatra died. I wasn't around for years on bobby-soxers and '' Anchors Aweigh, '' Ava Gardner and '' From Here to Eternity '' albums on the lamb and '' swing 'lovers', Kennedy, Vegas, ring-ding. Basie and Mia and Reagan and concerts from Madison Square Garden to South Africa on the sandy beach of the White House. I can't say I like Sinatra because I heard him in Paramount or I hear "September of my years" autobiographically - common excuses. And my excuse? When I was eleven, I watched a movie called "On the Town" ...
