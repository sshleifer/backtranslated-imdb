Sui generis. People, I don't want to lie to you; Merhige has one or two hits, but that's what the film (almost apologizes to SUSPECT ZERO). I do not pretend to fully understand it; half of what makes it try to guess what the heck they do on the screen because chiaroscuro. <br /> <br /> Richard Corliss says, "It's like a draconian cult. Real, three Bible reading - creation, birthday, and torture and death of Jesus for Calvary." This is not a bad description, but it seems to be more than seemingly one-to-one religious correspondence. <br /> <br /> Near the surface is an environmental theme - note that there are large pipes to the end (after terrain discomfort) that are no different from those on the construction site. Oh no, he says, to see how people rape their mother's nature. One rarely sees a dead metaphor in action and a lot of hyperbole, but there are five ways to see it. <br /> <br /> And yes, if you want to sync a soundtrack with events with a death metal, it has the cruelties required. But like me and others like me, this is an important feature film that should serve to release the criterion. It has come to fruition with FAUST. <br /> <br /> Ray
