I didn't expect to watch this movie. How surprised I was! This is a great, beautiful, twisted film that gives you a good workout! It's not easy. If you only have a police academy style, no brain movies, that's not for you. The cell is a deep and complex film that has an impact on films like Cube, Lambate of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man, and many new ideas. Wonderful, twisted environment, good acting and convincing story make it one of the best films I've seen for a long time! Be open and you will love it!
