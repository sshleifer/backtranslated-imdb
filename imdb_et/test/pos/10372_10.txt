After the funeral it was a great and the best episode of the season. I was disappointed with the cards on the table, which started so well, but fell down a lot in the last half-year, and I didn't know what to think about after the flood, although I remember finally being confused. After the funeral, as I have said, one of my all-time favorite Poirot episodes, there are five small pigs, sad Cypress and ABC murders. I was afraid they would destroy the story, but instead it is very loyal to the book. Now I say I do not mind changing books, nor do I try to compare movies and TV adjustments to their sources unless the book is a masterpiece and adaptation does not make it fair. That's why I didn't like some Marples like Nemesis and Sleeping Murder, and so far from Poirot Roger Ackroyd's murder on the floods and cards on the table are the only ones who really were disappointed. Everything else ranges from good to prominent, even the last appointment with death, despite the many deviations from the book that I admit is not a favorite, was surprisingly good thanks to its excellent production values, star band performances and outstanding music. . After the funeral, the production values ​​are fantastic. It really has a cinematic feeling, and stunning photography and magnificent landscapes and costumes make this eye a visual party. The music was very confusing and even haunting, and the whole casting made great performances. David Suchet is impeccable as always as Poirot, Geraldine James and Anna Calder Marshall are just as terrible. But for me, Monica Dolan was special to Mrs Gilchrist, she is the best actor / actor of the Poirot episode at Donald Sumpter and Polly Walker. All in all, black must be seen, one of the best Poirot episodes and one of the more loyal. 10/10 Bethany Cox
