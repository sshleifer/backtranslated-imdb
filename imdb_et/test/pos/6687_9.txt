Usually I don't like movies about foreigners, but K-PAX is different. Actors are great in the movie - especially Kevin Spacey played his character breathtakingly! The film will never fall to a lower level - the intercourse is always in the movie and you want to know how it ends, what is Prot ... uses only Robert Porters body as a means of transport. How he sees uv light and how he knows a lot about this astrology. But everyone can do their own and decide what he wants to believe. Very good movie with great Kevin Spacey!
