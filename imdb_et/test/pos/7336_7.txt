... it. I think it was Loving Annabelle right now, because it has the same mature mood and a disciplined subject. We are just watching how the story comes out without the parties or any "moral" problems (or, of course, we are, but have not been fed with the spoon). Of course, there were some difficult facts and choices to make, but it just flowed. Basically it was like any other love story, in any other life, with other sexes. <br /> <br /> I personally found girls with good chemistry and had fun at night. The only thing I really got into the problem would be if I just felt ... preserved. Restored. This does not mean the gender scenes (or the ones that are missing), but given that I felt the film at a more lively time when they had a good time, it was the opposite of the rest of the situation. Lowkey is good, but it has never really been like Loving Annabelle, or touched me so much. <br /> <br /> I said I would recommend it heartily, it is by no means a waste of valuable time, on the contrary ... <br /> <br /> 7/10
