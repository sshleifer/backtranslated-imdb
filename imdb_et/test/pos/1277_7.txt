Next is the little-known British film of 1998, with a budget of 8,000 pounds and a working time of 70 minutes. Looking at it, it is never expected that his director will continue to do so in Hollywood and become one of the most famous and famous leaders of the 21st century? well, everyone has to start somewhere i guess. <br /> <br /> The next chairman, as you probably already know, is the Englishman Christopher Nolan, who would direct the critically acclaimed independent film Memento shortly afterwards; A few years later, he hired Warner Brose to lead the new Batman series, giving him even more recognition and so on and so on. My idea is that everyone has to start somewhere? even if it is not the most amazing debut? and Christopher Nolan introduces himself to the world in 1998 when he watched it. <br /> <br /> When I looked at it, I couldn't make similarities with another director's debut, the avant-garde author David Lynchi Eraserhead. The following is not a surreal psychological horror movie in this sense, but similarities are noticeable; most remarkable, it has been captured from grainy black and white and has an atmosphere that makes it unique. The word is difficult to describe, but it is loosely similar to the smoky atmosphere of the old films of the movie. So it can be said that Next is a modern film noir or neo-noir. Generally, it is a combination of this and a psychological thriller, and the story is the most appropriate for these two genres. <br /> <br /> The main character is anonymous and the title of the movie comes from early, obsessive compulsive qualities he had? randomly selecting people on the street and following them, sometimes even for hours. One of these "pursuit expeditions" reveals that one of the key people has noticed one of the people he is following and facing. It turns out that the "confrontor" is the person who is ready to make friends with his narrator and introduces himself; his name is Cobb and he is a small theft who calls the narrator to follow him in burglary. <br /> <br /> This is where the main character comes from Cobb's world, and he is guilty of crime and violence as he becomes more intimate with Cobb. The following is not so much a character research, but a film that follows the angry relationship between the two main characters and the devastating consequences it has on the narrator. Nolan manages to film the film and emulates the atmosphere well. <br /> <br /> The thriller is the following tension and atmospheric; but if the film in general, it is a little disappointing. If not, it could definitely be called permanent. The whole movie is filmed in a non-chronological and non-linear manner, making the story and film experience unique, to some extent? This style is done so many times that it is almost the usual technique? and the story itself is somewhat unique. <br /> <br /> The following, however, is hardly the end of the film and is disappointing. The story requires more? More action, more intercourse and more excitement? but it goes too far into its blame, and instead focuses on creating a complex story. Here's how to do it, but without other elements, it's a movie noir that doesn't work very well; it has a feeling of emptiness that is not huge but still noticeable. In addition, the film's shocking revelation is at the end? almost mandatory convention movie noirs? is what makes us feel deceived; it is unpredictable and goes somewhere, but given the story, it is disappointing because it basically makes the previous scenes and the whole movie tremendous waste of time. <br /> <br /> But the positive far more negative scales, and finally it turns out to be the wrong, but satisfying film, yes, everyone must start somewhere. Christopher Nolan will do it next and do it in a fine way. Quiet, flat, but good. It's not the most amazing film, and it's not really worth what the director will be for the next decade, but it's still a good movie. After picking up, you'll find a well-made, tight and atmospheric thriller with no noticeable nuances or innovative style, but still able to capture the audience.
