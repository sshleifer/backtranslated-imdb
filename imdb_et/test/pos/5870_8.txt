This is a thoughtful film that provides so-called. The inequality of the upper class and the inequalities, emergencies and benefits for them. Robert Shaw works reliably as his conscientious, right driver, Steven Ledbetter, who helps Lady Franklin (Sarah Miles) get over her mental depression early. However, Steven has many different feelings about this top-class woman. He inevitably falls in love with him, which of course goes beyond the social boundaries that separate them. <br /> <br /> I haven't read anything before and only appreciate the movie as I saw it. I find this to be a very honest story of the reality and conflict of everyday life that we live and what we want or expect. This is a good drama that is worth seeing again.
