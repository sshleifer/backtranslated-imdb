This movie was great. It had everything a real action fan could have. Many people who get hit and / or kidnapped are minimal romance with sex, a hero who can be identified, violence instead of many intervals, a useless plot that only holds one scene and villains who just ask. Bronson seems to be in the lowest tolerance level in his film and shows. Ed Lauter makes a great policeman and worked smoothly as a Bronson plot without stealing his focus. The film does not contain a plot that is so boring or consuming that you watch this movie once and never. Rather, you want to see that Kersey is acting and the story just juice. This is a great thing.
