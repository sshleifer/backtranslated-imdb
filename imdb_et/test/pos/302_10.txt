I decided to extend my review for my favorite movie of all time. Unlike other warfare films that focus on the event, Apocalypse Now takes the viewer as a psychological main trip. Gentle surrealism makes the body uncomfortable, but you can't put your eyes off it. Leaving the heart of the darkness of Joseph Conrad, the apocalypse now slowly falls to his main character, Willard (Martin Sheen), probably in the same way as Kurtz's madness. The creation of this film is known for its coinage season and the unprepared results of Brando (he read his lines of chip cards). There is a documentary called Apocalypse Now: Filmmakers in Apocalypse, which shows how everything went through doing it. Since the helicopter blade has been heard in slow motion and the napalm falls under the trees, the song "The End" can be heard. The next blow is in the Willard bed with a fan, so the helicopter noise coincides with the fan. We are told that he will do special missions for the military, mainly murder. When his next mission is given to him, he is confused. "Loading a murdered person is like a speed ticket in the Indy 500." The man he needs to kill was a respected Colonel who has gone crazy and isolated himself with tribes. Kurtz organizes the terrible deeds these people make and must stop me. Willard, however, is not alone. He is being carried on a boat with several soldiers and they come together in several battles. On the way, they meet Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore "Hoorah". Willard thinks that if Kilgore is crazy, then what could Kurtz be. There are many scenes depicting Willard's sudden insanity: the tiger attack, innocent Vietnamese killing, rainfall, carved dead bodies and the death of his crew. When he reaches the Kurtz compound, the villagers and hippie photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) welcomes him. Instead of Kurtz's murder, Willard will talk to him and his conscience will doubt what he should do. Kurtz, on the other hand, wants to die. He's tired of war and wants to be a soldier. Willard kills him with mechanics, while the people sacrifice the bull with multiple machines. When they realize that their leader has been killed, they killed their new king instead of Willard. Willard rejects the offer and leaves. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is absolutely breathtaking here. Colors are sharp, rare in older films. I can see that it is silenced and admire the beauty of the landscape. <br /> <br /> An impressive ensemble is terrible, everyone plays their parts well. Many criticize Brando for some reason, but I think he is extinguishing his role as a depressed man killed by war. I mean, what instrument did they use in this guitar-like sound as a credit roll? There have been many parodies of this movie, but my favorite quote comes from Marge Simpson explaining to Homer why a character with the same name behaves like an idiot. um, Marlon Brando is now an apocalypse. "Those who have seen the movie know why it's fun.
