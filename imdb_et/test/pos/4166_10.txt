All the characters in this comic were fun. Norman, a Viking caregiver, had some memorable phrases and skull captain, a bad guy, always let Max kill some crazy. Writing is the best. <br /> <br /> I was glued together when it came younger. If they came out of the DVD with all the episodes, I would be forced to buy it. This and Conan Barbar's cartoon are the ones I miss most of my childhood. I think these cartoons are the most illegal of the greatest cartoons. I watched these cartoons on the 13th Channel in Los Angeles. I remember that the owl was always afraid that he was in trouble and that he was chosen. Max didn't believe he was chosen and always gave the owl trouble. Norman was less talkative, but his simplicity was funny. He would say things like "I eat monsters for breakfast" when he fought with them. And when he fought with the zombies, he said, "I eat zombies ... innocent." Classic comedy and action. <br /> <br /> I am voting for inciting Mighty Max.
