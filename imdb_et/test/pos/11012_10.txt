When I first saw this movie with a very impressive atmosphere created by the director. It is also very interesting to see how they represent the near future in 1974. When you see a movie, you see many sets and practices today called freaky and modern. <br /> <br /> The theme of the movie is about the old question "What is real and what is illusion?". If you see "Matrix", you will find many similarities. But two movies are not at all comparable, because "Welt am Draht" is art and "Matrix" is entertainment. If you prefer first. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I lost a copy of this video. <br /> <br />
