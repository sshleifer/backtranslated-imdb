When a saboteur breaks up with a controversial government research laboratory, two small animals have been disassembled in a small community in Washington. One is a dog with unusual intelligence. The other is "Outside eXperimental COmbat Mammal" or "OXCOM". For the reasons that are widespread in the film, oxom hates the dog and tries to kill it. The observers refer to the incidental involvement of Travis Cornell (Corey Haim), his mother Nora (Barbara Williams) and his girlfriend Tracey (Lala Sloatman) with dog and oxcom as representatives of two national security organizations, Lem Johnson (Michael Ironside) and Cliff (Blu Mankuma). <br /> <br /> Many comments have been made that viewers are very different from Dean Koontz's book, which is a movie launch pad. It is true. However, this should not affect your rating. If you want to read the book, read this book. Judge is the film's own, not how accurate it is with the book. Scriptwriter Bill Freed and Damian Lee are as many artists as Koontz (it's not a quality comparison but an allegation that they're all artists). So is the director Jon Hess. Their work as a filmmaker does not mean that the book is followed as a script. They adapt the book as artists to create a unique work of art. It is based on a book. Not the same. You have to get rid of your ideas / expectations when watching a movie because you are experiencing works you are not familiar with even if you have read Koontz's novel. <br /> <br /> So is Watchers a good movie? It's pretty good, not great. Good enough to earn "B" or 8. Hess starts things on the right foot with one of the beautifully filmed explosions I've seen for a while. Unfortunately, he travels a little shortly after listening to a very thick jargonistic exposition. After that, Watchers threatens to become a film of the 1980s when we first meet Travis and Tracey. <br /> <br /> Calling Clich√© is a trend that is constantly under threat. But that's just a fool. More often than not, Hess is able to cross a well-intertwined territory with many interesting twists: Travis and Tracey come from single-parent homes where their genders are turned. Both have a unique and mature relationship with their parents. Although this is a horror film, the main goal is a cute, intelligent dog dog who often knows both the adventure film and the horror, thriller or sci-fi, which are all genres. Hess introduces great characters, some do not enter until the end of the game, but the film is never confusing and no sign feels left behind - all threads are well connected at the end. The structure is also complicated because there are two big villains, the other less obviously deliberate when the film progresses, until the twist, accompanied by brutal violence, makes one antagonist clearer. Soon after, Hess gives us doubts about another antagonist. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake in my eyes is frightened, common with horror movies since the late 1980s - "attack" scenes are taken too dark, too close, too focused, and too few edited. This makes it extremely difficult to say what is happening, which breaks down most of the tension scenes that should be highlighted. It was certainly part of the motivation of Hessian style, and this is a typical reason for this problem to worry that the creature would be humorous and / or fake as scary and intense. In my opinion, the presentation of the audience with cheeky blur is not a satisfactory solution. We only see the creature costume / makeup clearly at the end of the movie. It was pretty well done that better and edited attack scenes would have brought the movie to at least 9. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the degree of correspondence between the novel and the movie, viewers will play a captivating story using smart, tempting characters. Often, this nail and horror scenes are more wild than you might expect, if not exactly gory (though a couple of scenes have a fair amount of blood). Followers tend to be underestimated because the role of the film in adjusting literature is misunderstood - don't give it over or misrepresent it concisely.
