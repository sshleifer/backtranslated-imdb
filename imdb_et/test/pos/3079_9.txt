This movie is wonderful! I can watch it over and over again. Robin's hood is perfectly cast and Marian is beautiful. Personally, I think Marian's German man is the funniest character with Latrine and Sheriff! At the same time space balls are boring and stupid, but it always keeps your interest! This is a great movie and it is never boring. A big role is played and it is inevitably corrupted and makes so much sense and you can look again and again! You love this movie if you only look at it, unless you hate comedy or don't think Robin Hood should be changed. But this old story gets boring and this movie gives it a great taste!
