This version didn't take me as deeply as the later Hollywood version, starring Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger. Although it was beautifully filmed and worked great, the BBC version was more full of dialogue that gave me the information I found exciting. This gave me a detailed overview of the intellectual, theological, and moral considerations that motivated Mr S. Lewis. That's why this Hollywood version was more interesting and stimulating, but not nearly visually stunning or visceral. However, when I did not leave the hut of Kleenex hatched in the theater, I used it at frequent intervals. I enjoyed this movie as much as the Hollywood version and I was grateful for the greater understanding I got.
