Oz is definitely my favorite show all the time! The best word to describe it is "Genius"! writing, actors, story lines. everything about this show is absolutely amazing! <br /> <br /> I just discovered the show and I was immediately addicted to it and I was really surprised that he didn't get the recognition he deserves. It is violent and most of the symbols are not meant to please them, but the exhibition is written in such a great way that you can look at violence and criminals and see them as real. They are the lowest forms of pollution, but still find that you can understand many signs and care about their stories. <br /> <br /> Violence at the exhibition is necessary to be as realistic as possible, but the exhibition does not affect violence, as some people believe. It's really a work of art and I'm sure that who ever gives it will love it as much as I do.
