This is, unfortunately, a little known film ..... I say "unfortunately" because it is located there with the classic American silent screen! <br /> <br /> It is a legend about the "fantasy cart" that rides across the globe, lifting the souls of dead people. The legend says that the last one to die at the New Year's Eve is condemned to the lane for the next year. Dicken belonged to "Christmas Song". <br /> <br /> Double exposure of ghosts (especially when they interact with "living" people) is FULL! <br /> <br /> If you love quiet movies, you have to see it; it "blows you away"! <br /> <br /> Norm Vogel <br /> <br /> Norm Old Film Festival http://www.nvogel.com/film/film.html
