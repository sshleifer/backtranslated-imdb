This show is great fun! I started watching in 2007 and haven't heard it before. After one episode I was hooked. I've never been home to watch it, so my wife bought me a whole set of DVDs. Non stop laughs, do I need to say more? I wish it was still on television because it is definitely worth and much better on television today. <br /> <br /> I want them to take the movie seriously, who can't see it. Only Kevin James's name brings a huge fanbase to every film, the guy is (makes his stomach hurt) funny. <br /> <br /> Just a really good, ground-breaking, credible exhibition. If you have the opportunity to buy it on a DVD, do it, it's worth it.
