In The Falcon and the Snowman, when they showed the complex around Christopher Boyce, the satellite in the background was the actual Grupoliid satellite, now in space. TRW allowed internal shots. TRW promised both internal and external frames for one of the original Star Trek TV series. (This episode is where Spock goes blind when satellite lights are activated to kill aliens). Christopher fled from prison (Lompock) and was America's most sought after. He ran in the bar when the sample was. He said, "Hey, this is me." Needless to say, he was put on hold and transferred to maximum security.
