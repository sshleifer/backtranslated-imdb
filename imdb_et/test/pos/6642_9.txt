I watched this movie a few months ago on a big screen. I didn't know what to expect, and in the first ten minutes I was afraid I might not enjoy this movie. It started very slowly, in silence and almost banality, which was all less exciting, because the sound was pretty bad and the subtitles were sometimes impossible to read. <br /> <br /> But I certainly do not regret continuing to look at it. This is one of the most beautiful Bergman movies I've ever seen, human, ruthless and psychologically convincing. <br /> <br /> Having seen such actors playing so well, their intensity is so big: Liv Ullman's interpretation is unforgettable and Sydow is also great. <br /> <br /> Bergman's movies always have psychological violence and can be the most physical violent of all of them. Tense relationships between husband and wife develop in parallel with their surrounding physical violence ... <br /> <br /> Finally, this sober, violent and powerful film contains a surprisingly striking human depth. Excellent Bergman. <br /> <br />
