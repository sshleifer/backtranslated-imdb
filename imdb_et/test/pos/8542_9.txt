It has been almost 25 years since this movie was seen. I think this movie is always classic in the drama category. Anthony Queen gives one of the most amazing performances. After a few minutes you will smile to tears. This film is a wonderful picture of how humanity changed after World War II. How much of this generation and the impending lost their innocence. It has taken a long time to find this movie called "25th Hour". These types of movies are not moneymakers, but they are definitely a treasure for some. I'm surprised at why this movie is not used in the media more widely so more people can enjoy this picture.
