This is one of the very few films that are so overwhelming that you are very unlikely to watch it more than once or twice in your life (other examples are the documentary Shoah and Come and See by Elem Klimov, the director of Claude Lanzmann covers much the same unbearable territory, but very differently.) <br /> <br /> I think it is as good as seeing the publication is difficult. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this extraordinarily clear Christian symbolism and the promise that Russian partners were active ensured that it was hardly seen in the USSR - and of course the post-Soviet Russia's interest in films of this era is very small. <br /> <br /> Once I saw it at the Russian Film Festival in Glasnost in London (probably 1988) - but apparently this has been shown many times in the UK recently, so there must be at least one subtitled print here. <Br /> <br /> As far as I know, it's never ts released he's on the DVD or video west, so if you haven't seen it, your best chance is likely to join the film community and endlessly joke to find the print and watch it.
