During World War II, America has developed a brand new huge bomber. Lois Lane and Clark Kent are going to cover the story when the plane goes to the first mission. Lois slides on the plane before it takes off. There are also some Japanese saboteurs who have all the intentions to travel to a bomber in Tokyo. Can Lois warn Superman? What do you think? <br /> <br /> A fast moving and colorful comic. Animation is a bit jerky, but much better than what we see today. Color and sound are beautifully restored. Just two problems - sad music score and racism (especially title). This aside is pretty good. 8.
