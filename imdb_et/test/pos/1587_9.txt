Visconti's death in Venice qualifies as one of the most beautiful films. Looking, we recognize that we are in the hands of a visionary gene. The endlessly vigorous death in Venice is definitely; but in another important way, it is an unhappy movie. Thomas Mann writes with contempt and von Aschenbach's literary career and output; in his indispensable way, his layered layer of programmed, self-conscious behavior. When Tadzio appears and obsession emerges, it is obvious that Aschenbach does not have the slightest idea of ​​who he has undergone in his gold-age restrictions and has lived his life carefully. In fact, Tadzio, "lonely", as Mann sometimes calls him, divides it into two. Aschenbach No. 1 absorbs the sight of a beautiful 14-year-old boy, then tries to intellectually treat blood pressure if he were a work of art - a divine work of art. But Aschenbach No. 2 appears as a stalker who takes over, replaces, a rational Aschenbach number. remains far from ideal. Thomas Mann has no mercy in this game. Every self-awareness is too strong and too late; The thrill of sexual flush is too big to resist. The fact that Venice is sick does not mean anything to Aschenbach, except that his game now has bigger stakes. When he finally whispers under his breath, "I love you," he knows that everything is gone and the abyss is waiting. Is it filmed? Perhaps Visconti is creating a visual party that is impossible to look at. But there are mistakes: He and Dirk Bogarde are compassionate about Aschenbach; Mann, not again. Aschenbach's POV dominates the film and we expect them to be identified. But nowhere on the screen are there any people who have been cut off. Bogarde easily switches between under control and ridiculously temperamental, but what is below? Bogard's reactivity has no mooring. Mann writes a character who, with his imagination, makes the dance of seven veils, too aware of the consequences that such freedom calls, but fails, does not want to resist. The Visconti scenario also creates a character that is not in the original - Alfred, a friend of Aschenbach - to dramatize the Manni Art and Artist discussion. These scenes are badly written disasters, and it is hard to see an actor depicting Alfred. Visconti Aschenbach is also a gilded German composer who, in my opinion, works for the film; and Mahler's symphonies replace Aschenbach's novels. Unfortunately, Mahler's great music is poorly recorded and played very badly. So the death of Venice, as Visconti gives us, is not a complete success that could have been, but as a purely visual experience, its power cannot be denied. All film students, especially cinematography, want to watch.
