Anyone who has ever doubted the ability of Ingrid Bergman to play comedy must only look at "St. Mary's watches". OK so he is a nun with TB who is probably in love with Fr. O'Malley, (think about what Luis Bunuel could have done), but he also showed wonderfully entertaining entertainment that made you want to be more often cast in comedies by leaders. In "Cactus Flower" she is a starched dentist (dentist Walter Matthau) who loves her boss but keeps her buttoned. If he is forced to act under his "wife" to get his lover (does not ask), he will let go of the buttons and pop. And he is happy to see. <br /> <br /> The film itself is harder than the usual Broadway hit screen (three acts). It is French farce (it was originally; it was taken by Pierre Barillet and Jean-Pierre Gredy's "Fleur de Cactas") and it hits all the right places. Matthau uses his great hanging impression as a great effect and the newcomer of klutzy's blonde, as he was, called Goldie Hawn almost steals the movie as a dizzying mistress who decides to give up her meal because she feels "woman" is a ball. Hawn had an impression of what he stole, the Academy's award for the best supporting actor.
