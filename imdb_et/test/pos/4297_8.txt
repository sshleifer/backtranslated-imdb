I want more movies about middle-aged people. The intellectual journey and the moral turn of life make it an interesting sight. For women with extra marriages, there seems to be a different case-law than men. Amy Watson's faulty and degrading behavior with his wife seems to be without comment. Turn up roles and you might expect to be condemned to a person. If she found her husband to be bored and judge, she could have told her so, left and was undoubtedly waiting for a big financial solution in the case of divorce. State and London scenes are wonderfully authentic and rich, while in autumn melancholic backgrounds look great. The end is perfect, so it fits the real adult.
