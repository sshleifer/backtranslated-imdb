I was glad to know that at least now this movie has started to value it (just look at these voices). Not a top-notch activity like "Die Hard" or "Lethal Weapon", but still something solid from 7 out of 10: fine script, good chemist and director who knows what he wants (unfortunately, this director was Harlin's last good film "Deep Blue Sea was able to reach the "ocular cyclist" status, but "Cutthroat Island and especially" Driven "are well-earned flops!) I personally think that the way out of the Bureau could have been a" Woman as a Star of Action "theme, give her a chance because Davis gives the parameter a parameter, after all, this film does not focus so much on the "feminine" side, but on the good "action, buddyism (Jackson as a sidekick gives a lot of space, plus his part of the action and about a thousand killer wisecracks!) And on the plot (From Shane Black, "Lethal Weapon" and "The Last Boy Scout" writer, the last one being a movie on so many levels ... theme, smart plot, too good and undervalued!) In general: if no one is yet seen forget to rent it for the next quiet Saturday night!
