I loved the movie "Northfork". I didn't know anything before watching the movie. Therefore, I had no external influence or information that would have led me to see it on the screen. In retrospect, I would recommend watching the movie for interested parties as for some other reason than high quality participants. Don't read anything about plot, story, or movie evaluation. In fact, STOP reading something in my comments further, although I believe they are generic and don't break the movie for you, I don't want the movie's value to reduce you. Find your way in your movie or have its potential reduced. <br /> <br /> In general, I found 3 benign strangers in the Northfolk puzzle. At the opening of the film, they could qualify as refugees of three entertaining mental hospitals, or dreams and hallucinations of the young and sick young boy, or three "sent" to find the "lost angel". <br /> <br The sick and maybe dying boys try to convince three "strangers" to give up the lost angel, become his caregivers (mother and father) and safely take him far from Northfork (at least 1,000 miles). He even says he's a lost angel trying to manipulate them all with his caregiver. Only one in three responds positively to the boy. The other two have no real enthusiasm or passion for its involvement. <br /> <br /> The priest who breastfeeds the sick son shows the depth of care and deep conviction of his faith. He overcomes the destruction and emptiness of Northfork and its people; he is the light of goodness and hope for both Northfork and the film viewer. <br /> <br /> Close to the top of the movie is the boy and the new guardian over the land where the plane is waiting. They want to find the other two strangers on the plane; in fact it is a pilot. The engines start up and the plane exits. <br /> <br /> Who are the three strangers? If only one stranger was interested in helping the boy, why were all three planes? Where's the plane? Did the other two find a "lost angel"? Is there an angel missing and if so, is it? Who are the six men dressed as entrepreneurs? If all this is just a sick boy's fever dreams, how did one of the three strangers come to help one of the men dressed as an operator when he jumped and hit his head (no boy or strangers were men associated with them)? <br /> <br /> One or two sentences written under the heading that tell people what this movie is is a tragic mistake (this is not a spoiler, it's just an ad statement). So if you haven't seen the Northfork movie, the above questions only show some interesting and fun forks on the road when you watch the movie Northfork. If you read the movie plot ad summary before looking at it, then maybe you should look at some of the above questions and look at it again ... I know. <br /> <br /> Terry
