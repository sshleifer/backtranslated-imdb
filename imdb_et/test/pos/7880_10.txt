I liked the movie "JOE". It has really become a cult class in certain age groups. <br /> <br /> The producer of this movie is my personal friend. He's my Stepson's father-in-law. He lives in the west of Manhattan and has a bungalow. Southampton, Long Island. Her brother lives in her bungalow neighborhood. <br /> <br /> At the moment, he's not making any production, but hobbies with HBO movies. <br /> <br /> As a person, Mr. Gil is a true gentleman and I wish he had continued to do business.
