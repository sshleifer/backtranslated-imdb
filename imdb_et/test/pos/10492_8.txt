Of the 600 or other spaghetti, it is the twentieth among Western countries. Can't Believe It Has No Comments! Gemma is great in this. Van Johnson is also good, although his dubbed voice is somewhat murderous, but it is an Italian style of charm. Beautiful photography and some superbly staged activities. All supporting characters are well played. The difficulty of a racist scenario in bad boys is pretty tough even in today's standards, which creates the emotional depth characteristic of Gemmas in some situations. Absolutely FANTASTIC score Luis Bacalov. Check out this great Japanese wide-screen DVD. Spaghetti must be.
