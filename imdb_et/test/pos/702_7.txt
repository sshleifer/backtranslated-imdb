Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford were once banned together, but now Scott's sheriff and young Ford are still taking their weapon. She is hired to get a bank job, but she is late for the city and hired someone else to work. This leads to all kinds of complications, a lot for a movie that is not even 90 minutes long. <br /> <br /> Randy and Glenn got both girls. Claire Trevor plays gold with his usual good-old gold. And Evelyn Keyes is the daughter of Edgar Buchanan, who falls for Ford for a long time without knowing who she is or why she reached the city where Scott is a sheriff. <br /> <br /> It's B West, but unusual and Columbia Pictures was given full technicolor treatment. Desperado celebrated Glenn Ford's first film as a technology color designed for some of the more expensive films in the larger studio. Harry Cohn was certainly not out of it. And certainly not during the war. <br /> <br /> The piece is slightly twisted because both Ford and Scott have been tested for friendship and expediency / commitment. The plot also includes some high-level hypocrites in Randy, the real bans on the film. <br /> <br /> Four leaders are doing a good job and the best supporting results are Guinn Williams as Ford's lovable explosive. The climax includes cattle and hitting the city cabin, and it is one of the best in the western film. <br /> <br /> Four drivers and western fans enjoy it.
