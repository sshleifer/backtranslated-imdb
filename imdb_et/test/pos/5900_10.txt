In 2004, I wrote the following statements on the IMDb bulletin board when the user wondered if the best years of our life were a forgotten film: <br /> <br /> ***** When I watch this movie, it's like opening a time capsule. I think that in many ways "The Best Years of Our Life" is probably one of the most exciting nature studies, and it keeps a very good overview in the US in the mid-1940s after World War II. I believe that the "Coming Home" and "Deer Hunters", published in 1978, were the latest films that were closest to capturing the numerous issues of post-war military personnel. <br /> <br /> What I really impressed was watching the movie as a whole when I was 1980-81. in college and many, if not all, college students praised the movie at the end. <br /> <br /> This movie is still in the pack and I'm very happy to read other users in the other posts who know the movie that will definitely stand the test of time. ***** <br /> <br /> I am very pleased to see that the film is close to the top 100 films by IMDb and AFI. Although it was in the race for what finally became Christmas, this is a great life, supposedly the best years of our lives were very well served by the Oscar victory, including the best pictures. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie again in 2005 and after nearly 60 years, the best years of our lives are still a powerful, beautifully-functioning and well-designed film.
