I don't understand all these bad comments. I believe this movie was one of the best Puppet Master series. Having done a low budget, one can understand why special effects and acting were not remarkable, but they weren't terrible. <br /> <br /> Greg Sestero brought a lot of charisma to Andre Toulon's role. He has many options, and I hope to see him more soon. And while cinema wasn't great and violence and gore was minimal, it was a lot of fun. I am a big fan of Puppet Master and have been waiting for blood and gore in this series of films, but I can say that I was never bored during the Retro Puppet Master viewing. So if you have the opportunity to see this movie, it doesn't automatically consider your time to be dignified. Give her a chance. You may like it.
