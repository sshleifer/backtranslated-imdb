I liked it better than House Party 2 & 3. It was fun and cool at the same time. Chris Stokes, who directed the film, is very humorous in this car training; look for your mother who plays the leading character, John John's grandmother. And you can hear his rap song title "Down to the Last Minute" at the end of the movie as a roll of credit. He's a very funny and really good actor. The young actors who play it (the main trio) and who really are part of the IMx music group did a great job. Before this movie, the R&B group didn't pay much attention. Now I'm a fan. The music number in the house party scene is worth watching the movie. I was pleasantly surprised. I love it.
