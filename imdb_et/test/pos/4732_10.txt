If you value your freedom! <br /> <br /> For the first time, I am interested in the Davidian abyss of the branch after I read the article in the UK magazine The Fortean Times. Wishing to learn more, I rented this documentary and was after that I watched what I saw. This film has attracted interest in this subject and since then I have read several books on this topic. This film must be visible to people who only know facts such as reported in the so-called "mainstream" media. The misconceptions, double talk, and contradictory statements revealed by the officials and politicians in this film change your debate with people who question the actions of governments in this fiasco "nuts" "loonies" and "coke". <br /> <br /> What is frightening that I know of some people who consider themselves to be "intellectual" and "liberal" loving freedom, who is still convinced that the government was doing Wacos correctly and refusing to watch or read about this movie books. They still insist that they are not worth their time, because all propaganda is weapon-loving, Clinton's hatred, religious fanatics, right-wing anarchists. One publication about an organization that consists of many so-called "big minds", which claims to be committed to promoting "cause", "common sense", and "rationalism", condemned a film claiming that it poisoned peoples and strongly recommends that the film be shot down push. They even hinted that Davidians had come. I don't mention its name because I'm a coward. If you are one of those who read it (of course you don't read it), I can only say your shame that you don't open.
