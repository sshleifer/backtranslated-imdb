I actually did that Black Snake Moan was a great movie that was going on in the south. The story follows the name of Lazarus, whose wife throws her to her brother and finds that Rae is abandoned and beaten. Lazarus discovers that Rae is a sex addict and was abused as a child, so she decides to take things into her hands by linking the Rae chain to treat her from her evil. Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci have great chemistry and their performances believe that Lazarus and Rae will get the best friends by looking for their struggles and redemptions. I was also surprised by Sam's ability to play electric guitar and sing. S Epatha Merrkensen is great as Lazarus love interest Angela, Justin Timberlake plays Rae boy Ronnie, who is undervalued in the film, but does his best to get a great result.
