The Australian public and the Australian film industry are often listened to complaining that Aussie films are not enough, or that they are all the same. <br /> <br /> In this case, this movie is not a copy of other Australian films. It's unique - it makes you laugh loud, it makes you cry and makes you feel good. <br /> <br /> Casting this movie is great and the actor is none other. The script and photography (color / light, etc.) are wonderful. But more important is this great movie. I don't want to talk about the plot because I think it's best to see a movie that knows as little as possible. Suffice it to say that this movie likes many audiences. Take your girlfriend, take her mother, take her friends out - great evening. <br /> <br /> 10/10 !!!!
