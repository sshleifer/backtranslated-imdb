In my film Andaz Apna Apna, there are 5 best comedy films in my books that have ever been made in Bollywood, or even Hollywood. <br /> <br /> When the movie appeared, I was 8 years old and I heard it was a flop, but I have never realized why it was a flop ... but let me tell you one thing ... this film would have more money for selling cassettes and DVDs at home, and showing a movie that hit TV movie channels as theaters. This movie has been shown in film channels countless times, and I think even now public and television producers are repeating and repeating the film. I personally have been watching the entire movie 80-100 times and I still love it ..... <br /> <br /> The performance of Aamir khan and Amar and Salman khan in Premina is memorable, but especially liked by Aamir khan as a smart street man .... his dialogues in the movie are fun ... the story is simple and clever how it goes ..... <br /> <br /> Amar and Prem are poor, lazy kids and come from poor tailors and Amari's father is a hairdresser. Then they both get the news that the militia daughter from London will come to India to look for a suitable match ... both Amar and Prem think this is a great way to get a super-rich ... so they both run Raveena Tandoni .. (millionaire daughter) .. .... during their trip, both hate each other and each of them tries to fool you to marry Raveena ..... the comedy scenes are so much fun that you need a glass of water to stop the pain in your stomach, laughing ..... .. and then Raveen's uncle (a million-eyed brother) Teja, who wants to get his father in Raveena ..... because he has broken and his father is a millionaire ... ... his plans include robbing Raveena in Raveen to blackmail his father, for which he hires 2 leaders ..... <br /> <br /> Later we find out that the film has a twist (see the movie) ....... then Shakti Kapoor as a criminal Gogo, who is also incredibly fu nny ...... <br /> <br /> What stood out for me Aamir khan uses his "aaila" perfectly and Salman goes like "OOima" ........ and for Gogo is "Jab Raat Ko Bacha Soak Nahi Haini Ma Bolti Hain Ki Sooja Nahile Gogo Aa Jaega "...... funny ...... <br /> <br /> I especially liked Amir Khan and Salman receiving Teila Raveena and they both go to Luna with" chillar "money in the bag. that the scene is so funny ... <br /> <br /> I recommend to anyone who understands Hindi or Urdu to watch this movie ...... this is one movie I would recommend on DVD and you will never regret it . ......
