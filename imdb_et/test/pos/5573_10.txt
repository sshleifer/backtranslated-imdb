Not because J. Michael Straczynski's Babylon 5 has shown a wonderful art on television that is a story of television. It's just the best thing on TV right now! The characters are pleasant and can be easily held and taken care of. Villians is the type you love to hate and leave you wondering what they are next. And Brian Hensen's puppets are the most innovative. Kudos Rockne S. O'Bannon for the good work done!
