(May contain a spoiler) I find myself disappointed with what this film is about. Although it is certainly not perfect, it is much better than it is given. Actors and photography are excellent. Some musical numbers are great; including title number "Where do I go?", "Easy to be hard" and "Black Boys / White Boys". Although I have not seen the stage music, I think it will make many decisions cloud. It's not the music you see in theaters. Don't try to compare them. Theater music could have been sensational, but it would never have had the same effect on the film, so a plot had to be added. And the end that is added is just amazing. The film was like me, as I was actually looking at something important, unlike most of today's movies that only satisfy one level.
