I saw it for the first time on British television with good music. The elevator scene is a class, especially when it goes down the telephone cab and then hides the floor indicator. The pass through the jump is really impressive and there are many more. In addition to all that was mentioned before, the fight against a man who has bullied a woman with a dog - it just looks so easy. The only drawback is the plot - it mixes with Dead Eye Dan, who then flees but doesn't appear again, even if some gangsters later participate. The scene in which he looks to let the fat inspector joke is funny, but it would have been better for the Dead Eye to be the one who pulls the pull.
