This film reminds me of the much later Rock Hudson movie MAN'S FAVORITE SPORT - a fishing writer who has never been fishing and forced to enter the fishing tournament. In this case, Barbara Stanwyck is a writer like Martha Stewart who can't cook and doesn't have the perfect family described in her articles - she doesn't have a family at all. Well, like Rock, he is maneuvered to play - in this case, creating a great holiday dinner in rural areas during holidays. Because he doesn't have a family, he takes on a veteran and some friends, and desperately tries NOT to "let the cat out of the bag" so that he can't do anything he does. Lovely little comedy and a welcome movie for the annual movie.
