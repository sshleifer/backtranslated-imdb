Pitch Black is a survival story. This is how to survive in hostile, alien worlds even more hostile enemies. The task becomes even more complicated when the closest enemies are within your own surviving group. <br /> <br /> The Pitch Black plot is quite common and has been seen several times in various variations. But what makes this movie brighter than others is well written characters. <br /> <br /> The group is made up of very different people with less interest than others: Jack, secret boy; Fry, a pilot with difficulties with his conscience; Johns, a drug addict with drug addiction; Imam, a holy man who faces the fact that God is sometimes cruel and Riddick, convicted and murderer who learns to appreciate others, not just himself. The film will be played by characters. They are not just paper as in many other films of this genre. You're going to take care of the characters, especially for Riddick, although it looks pretty strange. He should be a bad man. In this film, the line between light and pitch black is very thin. All characters know both. <br /> <br /> Another thing that works in this movie is pain. Rarely do actors fit well. Radha Mitchell fits on Fryle. Cole Hauser brings John the right amount of cruelty and responsibility. But the most impressive work is Vin Diesel. He does a good job like Riddick. In his hand, Riddick is quite creepy, definitely very dangerous and also deep in nature, just as he should be. <br /> <br /> So how do you live in Pitch Black? Keep your friends close and enemies even closer.
