Somehow, this movie created it in the soft place of your heart. Don't ask me how it happened, but I think that the movie "I sponsor something" McMahon, like a tail-breaking explosive, was somewhat related to it. I was disappointed at Slaughter's first departure in 1972. Nothing more than a quick throw with Shaft Mania. How's the sequel away from it? Big Jim Brown seems stronger than killing here than the first one. Perhaps this is due to the fact that one year later he had to do something, rather than having his simple motivation "Be as charm" before. pimp-dad's number one, James Brown. Almost every scene of the godfather is funk funk. Perfect for a movie, for music, wardrobes, vehicles, lingo and hair. I would also like to point out that this film is also a great time film that represents the time of film history, when Jim Brown and Ed McMahon really do grow hair. body number and factor in Ed McMahon and James Brown. You have one flick of the 70's of hell activities, and what is beyond its predecessor is no less. For my money, Slaughter's Big Rip-off can play a ball with any made Blaxploitation film. Even the shaft. You may not agree, but Slaughter's Big Rip-Off has a special feeling. Lack of something original.
