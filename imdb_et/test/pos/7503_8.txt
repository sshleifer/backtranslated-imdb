George C. Scott also gives his best and funest drama in this Paddy Chayefsky scenario. Diana Rigg is an attractive and quite complicated young woman. This film moves between tragedy and chaos at the end of the 1960s in a New York hospital with tremendous consequences. Barnard Hughes is pleasant, as always (also the actor of the larger actor). <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. Best Performance = George C. Scott. Chayesfsky was a big blow when he shot Vanessa Redgrave at the 1978 Oscar Ceremony, but he is a good writer. Truly the majority of the ensemble that works wonders to the smallest role. It won the best script in Oscars and Scott was appointed. He should have won this year instead of PATTON for this year (it was also great). Get it!
