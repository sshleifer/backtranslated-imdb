Hardware Wars is a fun, 12-minute short film parody of the original Star Wars movie, released just a few months after Star Wars in 1977. This film uses household appliances as spacecraft and Star Wars-like actors to send you laughing at the floor with uncontrollable matches. This film has won many awards at film festivals and it was a film that inspired Mel Brooks to write his Star Wars parody "Spaceballs". <br /> <br /> This is my favorite parody film and I recommend it to anyone who is familiar with Star Wars and has a good sense of humor. <br /> <br />
