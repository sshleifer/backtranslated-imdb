Dark and painful look at the dangers of drug addiction, Sinatra is wonderful in this film. Just looking at his crazy twisting and screaming and the destructive rage at the end of the film is enough for everyone to think about heroin testing; maybe they should show this health class to the children instead of the frantic generation that we are forced to endure year after year. <br /> <br /> This is a story of a man who is simply trying to make a new, clean life after being in prison, trying to get rid of his drug habit and his works related to illegal gambling cards that are pulled down, pulled back into the evil of human nature . Her employers, drug dealers, and even her mysterious, insidious - stupid woman - use her. <br /> <br /> Even if you didn't like the movie, it's just worth the soundtrack. It's all heavy, swinging jazz with large drum and brass parts. This, together with its cozy, but somewhat stiffer sound, helps set the mood with stacking, snaking drugs and card dealers who seem to always be like the vultures surrounding Frankie's machine. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to someone - especially if you like movie noir, zoot suits, fedoras or jazz.
