Look at these faces next to the prison entrance. They are not the face of Hollywood extras. Someone in the production was really smart to shoot at Oxford, Mississippi, because you don't get such authenticity from the back of the studio. Extensive narrow dusty roads, frozen ground below, and hardly hanging skeletal trees. No wonder these faces look hard and forgiving; they simply reflect the soil from which they spring. Old man Lucas (Hernandez) fear for his life better, but then he rises from the same hard land. <br /> <br /> The film works because it speaks of a good story that neither preached nor sentimental and even no tension. The old man Lucas is not very pleasant. He is a victim and we know compassion, but he is also naughty and unfriendly. Reasonably, the script refuses to sweeten it. So we are forced to recognize the effects of racism and injustice even less sympathetically. Also, the script wisely avoids racism because it tends to become preaching and less effective. Instead, it is shown how easily prejudice can be blamed on an innocent man and condemned to fearsome death. So, our common instinct is to see justice that the effects of racism are an open, much more effective way. It also makes the sheriff and the lawyer more understandable because they are otherwise part of the Jim Crow system. <br /> <br /> Note how the film does not break segregation. It is doubtful that the old man Lucas would like to mix the whites anyway, and there is no hint that even lawyer Stevens (Brian) wants to cross the line except to see justice. No, there is a possibility of reconciliation in the future, symbolized by a child (Jarman), whose head is not yet "conceptualized". He is not exactly a friend of Lucas, but he has been glimpsed by the fact that he has become a friend after being frozen. The last line of the dialogue also shows his uncle, a lawyer, in place of adjacent contiguous parents (the dinner table is important and easily overlooked). An attorney may not join future civil rights, but the boy may do so. This is the real hopeful side of the film. <br /> <br /> During this short 3-year period (1949-51), a number of racially-themed movies (The Well, No Way Out, Brave's Home, Lost Borders). Even the famously separated MGM came together with this little pearl. Unfortunately, Hollywood's McCarthy cleaning ended the "problem" of movies that might not end at the end of the Cold War. Nonetheless, each of them deserves to catch up, not only because they are good movies, but because they are still appropriate even with 60-year-old and Jim Crow.
