I watched this series after the Velvet tilt, for which I gave the 10/10 class. I had read the comments of its users and I was waiting for a good series or even better if possible. Here I have to emphasize that this series is good, and it has definitely captured me and so it is worth it. But I didn't enjoy it as much as Tambi Velvet, for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1. Less passion, love and related sexual content. In these elements, there was surprisingly little emphasis on what I considered inseparable from the love story. Fingersmith felt that it was a moistened version of the mill. <br /> <br /> 2. Like Velvet Tipping, the story was in three places: start, shocking second and end. The second part should have been the top of the story (just like Tipping the Velvet), but instead it was almost completely skipped, perhaps due to the inability to make shocking but plausible asylum content. The series should have been in three parts with two staplers, focusing more on the second part. <br /> <br /> 3. The weight of what Fingersmiths was, and how it affected their personalities, was almost not given. I found it quite annoying that the series didn't deal with such a central issue properly. <br /> <br /> 4. The end result was much faster than Tambi Velvet. Fingersmith left several interesting land lines open. <br /> <br /> Despite these drawbacks, Fingersmith is a good series and worth 7/10. But it's not classic, like Velvet.
