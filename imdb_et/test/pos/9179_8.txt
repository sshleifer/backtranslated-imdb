I liked this comedy so much. Will Smith does nothing slow. It's always the right target with the biggest script and comedy that keeps you laughing and taking part in the plot. You look at a skilled comedian who plays all his parts well. One believes he is the one he plays. I loved her and Tommy Lee Jones in black men. This comedy determines this movie. Humor is moving fast and Will Smith is as confident as he was in black for men. Quick flawless and well-qualified, who can make the score every time, but deliciously and finely. <br /> <br /> Does Smith seem to do his comedy routinely well. He was so funny. I loved the part where he had an allergic reaction to something he ate, and his face swelled up, and he saw more like Cassius Clay after the fight and he did it himself. Then he saw Benadryl drinking on the bottle, trying to bring his head back to the right size. I laughed so hard. He knows how to laugh at us all.
