In the last couple of days, I am really in the "Female Scorpion" series and I have to take my head because I waited so far? what is too long? before buying the entire box set. "Beast Stable" is the third brilliant effort in the line and the undeniably major trump of this series is how writers are always new and different with every new part. There has never been, before or after, a series of uses that offered so many different stories, settings, themes and film styles. The original was more or less qualified as a so-called "prison" (but already atypical), but it is not possible to classify Parts 2 and 3 as they do not contain any material in the prison walls. And the overall tone and atmosphere change with every new episode. The first film was harsh and sharp, while the second was psychedelic and the third was almost melodramatic. Don't let this last description stop you from busting, as "Beast Stable" still contains more than enough exploitative themes and distracting materials despite the dramatic atmosphere. For example, the opening order is absolutely fantastic. Sasori, who is still divorced from the law, literally cuts the subway to freedom when there is no other option than to interrupt a permanent policeman in his handcuffs. He runs through a city where a broken hand hangs over him, while credit is displayed on the screen, accompanied by a familiar theme song, is just pure and real use of gold! The story continues convincingly in the desperate attempt of our heroine to lead an anonymous life in a big city, but poor things just don't get away from their past or even new torments. Sasori interacts with a prostitute, though without dialogue, and employs sewing material. His own slowed brother (!) Sucks a prostitute, while Sasori is struggling with a local pimping and underground criminal network. He cleverly prevents his body from exploiting, faces the ex-enemy prison, and fiercely opens a prostitute when he gets barbaric abortion. Meanwhile, a police officer with one gun continues to have peace of mind on the streets looking for a return to Sasor. Our versatile director, Shunya Ito, shines all these lines with a powerful healthy and never losing visual touch or brilliant filming style. "Beast Stable" includes some impressive compositions and brilliant camera corners that you can imagine, editing is flawless and external locations are actually frustrating. Those who know a little about Sasor's character are aware that the film lacks a really memorable dialogue, but it is always compensated widely by the charisma and imminent grimace of Meiko Kaj's admiring screen. In addition to the above-mentioned incragous sub plot, there are very few strokes, but the short flashing of extreme violence is terrible and the twisted end is almost too bright for words. In fact, I think the third part can be the biggest (or at least my favorite) so far. My only small and completely irrelevant critical point concerns the ridiculous sounds that one bird produces when Sasori is locked in a cage. This bird sounds like a ventriloquist dummy with abdominal cramps.
