I don't want to admit it, but I didn't find it to be one of Hitchcock's best but still riveting climbers. Hitchock's Same Title from 1934, dr. Ben McKenna (James Stewart)? a man who knows too much - and his wife Jo McKenna (Doris Day) is resting in Morocco with his son Hank (Christopher Oslen) when it comes to a mistaken identity and a caught plot of murder on the web. Aquariusers go to extreme lengths to prevent them from interfering with their plot: rob their beloved Hank. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to find that Doris Day, whom I usually associate with Rock Hudson's comedies, was cast into a film by Hitchcock. When I watched it, I soon realized that it was more of a family film than other Hitchcock works (for example: Psycho) and had the singing power needed to remove "Que Sera Sera", which she did beautifully. He was well-poured and James Stewart had the chemistry that helped the couple believe. <br /> <br /> Compared to the great director's other work, I believe it's not that good, but it's still a very big family thriller / mystery. Also included is the Que Sera Sera bonus, which turned out to be a worrying day for Doris. Well-managed, well-behaved. Fine film.
