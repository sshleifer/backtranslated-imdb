This movie is a fantastic remake of the original with the same title. The movie was cool, despite the fact that I hate new! All the cast was awesome. This is a huge cast and fantastic plot! The main plot is a man poisoned and he has to solve his murder, pure eh ?! Dennis Quaid is a man who is "DOA" (in other words Dead On Arrival). She finds help with her friends, but everyone is now a suspect! Dennis's character has several hours to find out who poisoned him. The film is quite fast and full. You'll see two more stars in Meg Ryan (Angel of Angels, Courage Under Fire) and Daniel Stern (home alone, very bad things, Bushwhacked) in a great and cool remake of the classic movie!
