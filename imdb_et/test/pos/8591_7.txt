A great, thoughtful historical drama - well-played, artificially written, photographed in a way that delivers accurate visual images of the Congo, and more than a few moving moments, especially for those who care about African history and imperialism. however, translating loses a fair amount of valuable content, and because names, acronyms, etc. are difficult to follow. so I would strongly recommend checking a neutral source, such as wiki, to get a familiar story (and subsequent history) before enjoying the movie. If you have a DVD version, there is also some useful historical background. At the end of the movie, there is a point where a character who then talks to an American accent is actually excluded - a simple search for censorship of a lumumba movie or something similar opens up a truly exciting (and possibly disturbing) production of this important film. this film, with little foreign science, helps contextually bring dozens of other Central and East African and / or imperialist films, eg. hotel rwanda, shake hands with the devil, various conrad blindness adjustments and even "ali" when mohammed ali visits kinshasa.
