I gave this exhibition opportunity because of the character of Jale White, not her Urkel, but mainly for Sonic the Hedgehog's voice XD. So, as I said, I gave him the opportunity, and I was very fond of it. I've never cared about Urk's character, so I was happy to see Mr. White in a role that is never so irritating nerd. And his Calvin J. Fraiser (first named Calvin, but came in another episode, all started to call him "J") was very fun and interesting. <br /> <br /> I think my favorite episode was when J got acquainted with a former Cowboys cheerleader with a snobby child. ("You're not talking about my mommy!" "It's an adult conversation, you're staying!") The only beef that I have is that the exhibition has three main characters, but the character of Mr. White seemed always the most more attention has been paid and the other two (who are married) were always modest ... It is not quite good if the story of these two possible pregnant women takes back J. babysit's girlfriend's dog ..... <br /> <br /> Besides, I really want this show to last a little longer. Unfortunately, it seems that Jale White doesn't care about people other than the God-Awful annoying ass nerd known as Urkel .... <br /> <br /> I hope they at least put this DVD box out.
