This movie was very different from the previous movies and I had to think, "Where is Ralph Macchio?" he could have participated in the plot somewhere as an old friend of Myiag, who teaches Julie what he already knows, Myiag can come and add some more! Macchio could have been Julie's love for this movie! Do not forget! <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie seriously because it involved teaching teenage girls how to make Karate, and her feelings are very different from those of Daniel. Julie is much more wild than Daniel was and needs taming, which Myiagi considers to be very difficult; she is a pretty restless girl and a rude, unpleasant brat! We can all learn something or two from Myiagi witticisms!
