British documentary was recently shown by Comedy Centralis in their "Best of ??" time. week and this can also be seen on South Park's second season DVD. I remember that the DVD has a lot of ads with this documentary, most of which are on Matt Stone, Trey Parker, and some other jacuzzi. It was funny when I saw it in advertising, but I was used to seeing it until I saw a real documentary. <br /> <br /> In general, "Goin Down South Park" is a rather funny and interesting look at how South Park's episodes have been made and the series's history goes back when Matt and Trey came up with the idea of ​​college. However, there was something about the tone of the documentary that really felt depressing. It's not as fast paced, a quick fire, and as lively as the actual South Park episode. Instead, it has a slow, dry-wit style that can sometimes be funny, but most of the time you expect something to happen. If you have the opportunity to look at it, go all out, but I don't think you will lose much if you never see it. <br /> <br /> My IMDb Rating: 7/10
