This is a great late night movie! What I mean is that I've really enjoyed my $ 3.00 VHS copy (now I have $ 6.99 DVD Copy!) Many nights just before bed or when I have insomnia. It's just about something that makes it fun to watch repeatedly. It may be fun that Basil Rathbone has "The Secret Weapon", which carries a series of disguises that fool bad guys and Holmes assistant Nigel Bruce (Watson), but not the household (Mary Gordon). It may be a subject of espionage, cracking of code and World War II. It may even be a light touch that the director uses to deal with intimidating situations, Holmes finds himself in the story. Whatever it is, "Secret Weapon" is just a pleasant and enjoyable detective story that will take us back to the time the Nazis searched for the dominance of the world and make it with the Watson and Holmes divorce bonus. Do you agree with the patriotic speeches of this film and the noble "save the world" themes or not (I think they are right!), I think they only add to this refined look of the taste and fun of this fine old adventure film. I value it as a pleasant 83/100 point.
