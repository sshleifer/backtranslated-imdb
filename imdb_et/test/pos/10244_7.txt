I think those who have previously been in one-sided relationships will be able to identify a 50-year-old woman who is still in good health in pink with the leading character of Minako (Yuko Tanaka), as she shows in her daily routine, preparing her routine waking up early in the morning to prepare to deliver his milk delivery, where he has put Megmilki into a bottle around his city to change the empty bottle for full bottles and collect the tax and delivery receipt. And there is always one top stop that needs a long staircase to achieve customer satisfaction. <br /> <br /> And it's peculiar that this stop was stopped by a man with whom he has fallen in love with almost all of his teenage years, and not in the evaluation of the product, but poured under the sink. Going to the same school we see that they are not talking to each other, and they seem so physically, but so far away in their daily lives. There are no eye contact, except for occasional glances and the lack of recognition of each other's existence. We learn that they share a past that probably destroyed all the concepts of being together, where further development of previous generations prevented a clear attraction between the two. Those who have pushed their feelings so long can only ask what he is doing. When I read that Japan's original title means "Reading some books for a while" and it is accurate, I felt that the film had a wonderful finale with this well-photographed bookcase image, which probably indicates that it is not alone after all, and was probably he has fallen back on his crutch to cope with the state of his own and back to the lifestyle he has been used to for 50 years. In addition to diving into two jobs, she has the books that provide a form of escapism and occasionally cook some sweet songs to show the song's commitment on the radio. <br /> <br /> Yuko Tanaka did an emotionally commendable job with a strong woman leaving her destiny and her decision to love someone else, her affection, Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe) was a more interesting character with more facets. Staying with marriage promises, she spends a considerable amount of time on the screen, watching her sick bed woman (played by Akiko Nishina) while juggling with her social welfare department in the municipal council for child affairs. I felt that, as a childless couple, the work gave him the opportunity to take care not of himself, but of the children of other people, restless and neglected people. In the rare moment of rage, we see how he angry with such forward-thinking parents who do not understand and waste their children's lives. The story of Kenji Aoki offers a few questions to make a complaint from his characters and has successfully tried to offer them much more gaze and dimension, such as how Takanashi is a desperate Haiku poet, despite being a member of the Haiku Club, and supportive characters such as Elder Minagawa, where Masao (Koichi Ueda) borrowed some comedic but sad moments when he slowly became senile, while the woman Toshiko (Misako Watanabe) tells us and brings us through the story of a woman's love 50. Even Akiko Nishina's performance, as bedding, was not characteristic. an illuminated state of getting to know his man's past and making unselfish and painful decisions in his hospital country. <br /> <br /> This is what you can expect from a typical Japanese romantic movie, sans young, nubile leaders star-cros sed lovers, but all the other elements like romantic settings, lovers of songs and those that is basically limited but loving behavior. I thought this story was a danger of getting under the robbed track when inadvertent love gets full, but director Akira Ogata was able to control traditional melodramatic moments in such stories, although the story required some obvious plot development in the final act that you can predict, especially if you are already in his 101st novel. <br /> <br /> I didn't think your average love story is the story that Milkwoman was talking about a strong story that has a central theme and, frankly, a recommended romance movie (though it's measured at a pace) when you're in the mood for some bittersweet lovers, reminders and trying to live without regret.
