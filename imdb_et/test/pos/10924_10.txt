First of all, I would like to say that before watching this movie, I considered myself to be an accepting person. Someone who cares about others has appreciated others, found no decision against other people, and this film (in my opinion) has dramatically changed my life or perspective. When I looked at it, I didn't know what it was, I knew it was a forbidden relationship, but then I was helpless and when I started to see what was between these two wonderful portraits, I was in shock, incredible, confused and surprised. The first time I watched it, I was blind. We blinded their love, their closeness, their relationship, their purity as their relationship with people. I looked at it a second time because I finally realized how hypocritical I was, saying to me and others: "Oh, I accept all people and try not to judge them", while appreciating this wonderful and amazingly passionate story, I think my fear because of. The second time I watched this movie, I opened those eyes that were closed for the first time, and really watched, not the type of taboo I heard about my whole life, but just two people in love. And I loved it, I loved the storyline, I loved the hard-core yet strong individuals, I loved the sharing of feelings, and I loved the strong ties I created. It's really eye-opening, a beautifully made movie that sometimes made me cry, and I hope people who read it and intend to watch a movie remember that everyone deserves love, no matter what shape or form it is presented to. ..
