Well until 2002, I still have something to catch up. And looking at a modest year, Best In Show appeared. Not a big story. Small activity. Just a cavalry of amazing characters. A special reference to Fred Willard and Jim Piddock as a messy pair of television messengers. Well done. It is worth the effort. <br /> <br /> Ron (View 24Mar2001)
