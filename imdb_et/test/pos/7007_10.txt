After the first 10 seconds of Pitch's black I was hooked. I was in the movie, thinking it was just another cheesy sci-fi movie. Instead, I found it very fun at my seat, I thought you were making a movie. The film transcends your basic special effects. The actors are amazing, Radah Mitchell (high art, love and other ..) as Fry is really happy to watch the screen while Vin Diesel as Riddeck is so exciting that you die to hear him again. The appearance of the film is breath, the contrast of blue, yellow and orange due to three different suns is amazing. This is followed by all the darkness. I would really like to be the lover of ALIEN films or Radha Mitchell (which is why I went to see it) to watch this movie. I'm sure you will finally look at the blind in a whole new way.
