Missing the plane, I don't think I've ever laughed so much in my life. <br /> <br /> I love football like mad, but I tend to be almost any kind of football when hating about a movie they tend to be unrealistic. It wasn't like that. <br /> <br /> I watched it once, it was over 2 years ago and it was great. Anyone I know loved it. I remember geography, an angle of about 45 degrees, and "shoes" (a player who was so named because he once went to work in a new shoe). Brilliant, that's what's going on in the park football. <br /> <br /> Sure 10/10. If anyone in the television industry reads it, bearing in mind all that you repeat on English TV, please understand it again (and Muppet, if you are). Also, someone knows whether it was shown in BBC or ITV. I think it was ITV, so ask if they are going to show it again. They should do.
