In today's world of advertising and teenage horrors and sensationalism, it is very rare to see a movie and nothing about it. Movies such as Psycho and Blair Witch, at the same time big (both with superb designs), are offended by the fact that we all know about the best scenes and at least the plot before we see them. With Mute Witness, a rare cure, I stumbled upon this film and watched it, scared in the middle of the night. I was intimidated by the intimidating Russian atmosphere, the claustrophobic situation of the nervous subject and the silence, and the fact that the characters (amusing, always leading to the pleasures) could end for any purpose. Because it is a low budget and a rare film, let's look at it without expectations. Fay Ripley also plays a rare role in film, watching and getting excited, frightened and excited in totally unexpected ways.
