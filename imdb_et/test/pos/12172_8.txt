First of all, I come from a munich, where this film is and believe, or not, such as Erkan and Stefan, including the foolish fracture! I know their comedy shows from the beginning, and my main fear was that the movie is just a collection of the already known jokes, but that's not! Jokes develop through the story and make their own sense. But if you don't like Erkan und Stefan, the hands of this movie. All Others - Worth a Look!
