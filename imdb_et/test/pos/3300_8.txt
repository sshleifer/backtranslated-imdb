I just saw this wonderfully filmed film that strikes a high-eyebrow NYC or an American city in the mid-century. Colors, cars, clothes and women's movement. It reflects <br /> <br /> cozy attitudes towards male-female relationships in the business world. <br /> <br /> In some ways things have changed and in others they haven't changed at all. Women still want what men are today, but they now have all kinds of laws and powers of equality to get them. In my opinion, beautiful women are still men who are trying to achieve their goals! The laws that we now have against harassment and <br /> <br /> have passed away from uncomfortable women who wanted equal opportunities to compete with more beautiful women who could get positions <br /> <br /> based on your appearance and display ! Real competition is not between men and women, but between women and women! I liked the look and feel of the film, but the world hasn't changed as much as real
