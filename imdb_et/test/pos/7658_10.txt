Latcho Drom is a cinematographic study of Roma music from several countries. It's touching, sad and joyful. Most segments seem to be completely unstable, sleep arthritis. The music that spans the sensual flamenco music of the Spanish Roma to the music of the Central European Gypsies is subtle. If you love gypsy music, you will find Latcho Dromi absolutely beautiful. <br /> <br />
