Recognized surreal Bunuel is a Nazarine apparently assault on the Catholic Church and its loss of value. This is not a visual film and I think it would have played better in the production. Bunuel takes us through this man, Nazarene, who lives like Christ. a real follower, that is, in poverty and without caring for the property, and what the next day brings. Some may call it parallel to the story of Christ, but the follower and practitioner of every word, life should be like Christ. But in essence, Bunuel also asks for the selfishness and sin of man, and how goodness can save us all. This is a bold statement that can inspire or remember a movie for some. Truth, it is said that Nazarene is also selfish because he gives it without or in return. His selfishness is his foolishness, and the two women who follow him represent the sides of the coin, with the same face on both sides. Many people in this movie represent the sides of the coin, both of which are the same. But at the end of the film, this movie is not exactly memorable, and one of the film's own doctrine can attack many ethical perforations and effusions. Not a top-notch Bunuel, but a "surreal" dream that, at the stages of Bunuel, where the film's message is framed and worthy of note, shows you the ability of Director Bunuel.
