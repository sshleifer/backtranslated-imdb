I've always been impressed when the director (and its directors / screenwriters) take part in the classic text - and makes it alive. Of course, Shakespeare's text can give you goosebumps even when they are taken for granted, but see where the production, where true ingenuity makes even better words - that the context or nuances that aren't in the production is just frightening. There are many worrying things about the game. This is a racist game about racism - and it is still there. I have never accepted the parable of Jessica's father for no acceptable reason. I have never accepted the position of the sacred self-consciousness of Christians. But there is an excellent text editor to help us understand the times and policies in which the story is set and graciously, much of Jessica's being cut. </p> <p> <p> </p> Cut sections. But I noticed only one line that was cut at the moment I heard it - and it was replaced by a view that said it all. This economy and sensible editing have given us a thrilling movie - not just a feature film. <br /> <br /> And finally, there is an idea why Antonio is so loyal and generous that unwanted / independent Bassanio - you can almost feel that Antonio's pulse is going to run when he catches a glimpse of Bassanos passing through a gondola or visiting. But it's just as small - no more. I was spellbound. <br /> <br /> There were many other highlighted topics. I felt that the arguments put forward during the trial were heartbreaking. And the defendants' trials are fun. <br /> <br /> Add all this glorious cinematography and costumes that have resonated with time, and you'll understand why I can't wait to see it again. And again.
