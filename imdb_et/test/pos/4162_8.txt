Emanuele Crialese did a fantastic job with one of the films behind her for years. It was Respiro (see comments and summary here in IMDb). <br /> <br /> Now that he has the excellent young talents he had shown for the first time on the screen, he takes the audience into a dark space. Literally in dangerous waters. The theme is migration. In this case, from Italy to New World (movie name). The big thing that called it to the American "The Golden Door". <br /> <br /> A story about a family that leaves everything and risks to the rest - it's a dream of their lives. <br /> <br /> I don't want to ruin the story, which tells the story, so I do a little work on Crialese and all of his team did it great. <br /> <br /> First of all, stick to what he knows: direct sound as much as possible. That means the whole movie. Textures, pain, the nuances of reality have always been mixed with smells, heat or cold, sweat and blood, life and death, alive and in real life. <br /> <br /> Bending metal and wood, exhausting sounds of wind-drowning drone and large engines and horns are one of the points that make this film engaging. <br /> <br /> Cinema is a French couturier. The symbolism of light is present in the first (again, almost the first of the Respiros) images and passes through the film with intimacy and terrible despair. Glowing tones and very bad and bad images of people suffering from a narrow and dirty boat they hope are amazing. <br /> <br /> Light is used sparingly to detect almost any kind of darkness. The beauty of every stroke and every scene is enhanced by the costumes of the era and the perfectly chosen physical qualities of the actors. <br /> <br /> Again, as he usually does, Vincenzo Amato is definitely on his own. He plays the father of two sons (the same actors who were fifteen and twelve and now are nineteen and sixteen) with all the power he always transmits to his very complex characters. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Gainsbourg is so. I think he has never achieved the perfection achieved in Cement Garden and his first film "L'Effront√©e". <br /> <br /> Maybe he seems a bit uncomfortable in his role. <br /> <br /> Locations and kits are tough and compelling, almost playing your character. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most remarkable character played by the younger son of Filippo Pucillo. The contrast here with its first role has been completed. Then he was overloaded with a boy who was as relentless as he was. Now his character is all expressive. And that's it: no words. His eyes speak of the supremacy of the whole story. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's one of those movies that can't be well received in countries. It is absolutely Italian in everything. It is so Italian that most of the time language is one of many dialects that are much older than Italy itself. In the US, this film may be too much for Americans because of this topic. But anyone who remembers the story of their families when they arrived in the country will see the movies with awe. <br /> <br /> And again, the minimalism that goes hand in hand with the Criales ideas is coming to an end in the water of the scene. Only this time it goes from underwater photography to air. <br /> <br /> To sum up, this filmmaker has one great and very well-talked story that only this year (2006) has been awarded 6 prizes and is nominated for a Golden Lion. Not a small act!
