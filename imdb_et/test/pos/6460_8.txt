The reason why this film is not better known to me and more appreciated seems to be due to this topic. Because of this controversial topic, this film never became a big outlet and still remains unknown. Not that this topic is more controversial now. <br /> <br /> It's basically a movie about a black man with a friendly white man. Friendship does not seem to be forced or unrealistic, but how it depicts in this film makes it all very real. We see that these different nations are in contact with each other, as if it were perfectly normal. Unfortunately, these days, of course, were not considered normal. Seeing a black man talking to a white girl and just being familiar with her as a friend, she must have seen some proportions of the audience in 1957. <br /> <br /> You understand why Sidney Poitier has always been and still is so busy with Hollywood society and the black community in general. Of course, this is one of the reasons why he also won the Oscar in 2002. In his films, he often fights against discrimination and prejudice, of course, as the best examples. . A true role model that has certainly inspired many African-American actors to this day. But he was also a great actor. Yes, he's still alive, but he's been completely free from the movie, since his last credited role has been since 2001. <br /> <br /> This film was the debut of Martin Ritt's director and he hadn't given too much movie to spend on his film. The studios were probably also somewhat reluctant to the concept and / or because it was Ritti's first film. Or maybe it was just because MGM was no longer so big and left their best days behind them. From the 50s onwards, the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was that it didn't make too big and cheap movies, while at the beginning of previous years it was really one of the biggest studios with many stars and acclaimed directors. who made many award-winning classic films. Luckily, their reputation starts to change again, and whenever the MGM logo appears in the movie, the movie is no longer expected to be less. <br /> <br /> Anyway, even with your limited budget and limited resources, you managed to pull this movie out. The film is very simple, with just a few signs and a simplified plot. However, you can capture the story with your own story and themes without ever having to preach or do anything about it. This also makes the film effective for its objects. <br /> <br /> Really a movie that deserves to be seen. <br /> <br /> 8/10
