I loved this example. Never understood why it was called Bug Juice. I had to be around 13 when he came out. I remember that they ran it during the summer on the 4th channel during the holidays, the running clock and the recorded clock in Pugwall summer, or something like that. I remember sitting there and I wish I was in the summer camp - ha ha. All this kids seemed so fun, it was all "discovering who you are" and "growing up". First kisses and all these things. I remember there was a really nice guy in it, I think he was the main reason I grew up in the morning. They should have more teen doctors so-so, I thought it was great!
