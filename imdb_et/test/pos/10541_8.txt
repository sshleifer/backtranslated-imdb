I know what you're saying, "Oh man, Pinochio is not scary!" but this movie goes far beyond manic pinochio. Behind her is the story of her mother and her daughter, who is strangely connected with her doll Pinnochio, who seems to be talking to her. The only strange thing is that no one else can hear it. Ultimately, it is a shocking revelation that, like me, I shock you. Look out. Try it.
