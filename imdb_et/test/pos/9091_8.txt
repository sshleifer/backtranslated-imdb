When I first looked at Flatliners, I was surprised. It had all the necessary qualities of the film: it was great, the plot was great, and in the case of thrillers it was always a "thrill". <br /> <br /> Keifer Sutherland offered great results as a team man leader, depicting a scientist who believes he can find answers to life and death by killing himself and then returning to life, essentially "stealing" the secrets of death. Kevin Bacon offers great results as a morally decent partner for Keifer, while Julia Roberts offers her most convincing role. William Baldwin depicts a student who appears in class and apparently in a relationship. And with Oliver Platt's second outstanding performance, the voice of the group and the most innocent people is voiced. for a movie genre and one that has set a standard for measuring other thrillers for me. <br /> <br /> 8/10
