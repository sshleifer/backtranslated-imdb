Finally, I finished the copy of Kannathil Muthamittal through Netflix and spent an amazing drama watching New Yera Eve. It started with Shyama (powerful Nandita Das), who married Sri Lanka's backwaters Dhileepan and then war over their romance. Shyama must flee to India and be in the refugee camp when the child gives birth. Several years later, we see Amudhat, a playful, beloved child (P. S. Keerthana), who is expensive (or burdensome) for teachers, parents, and schoolmates to solve a problem like Maria. On her birthday, her parents, Thiru (Madhavan) and Indra (Simran), say she is not their biological child. It tilts its confident love to the full world, and it constantly lives because of the reason why she left her mother of birth. Later, the adopters took several calls to Sri Lanka to try to find their mother to give birth. Dirty civil war breaks into the country and the trio is inevitably confused. But it also leads them to meet a new Shyama who is finally in front of Amudha and asked why he gave up his daughter. <br /> <br /> A story about a child who has to grab the fact that he has given up at birth, his obsessive ride to his birth mother, unconditional love adoptive parents, demons to steer the birth mother, normal Chennai and terror horrors devastated by Sri Lanka - Mani Ratnam made a masterful film that mixed many ingredients into the saga, which is the mixing of the soul. AR Rahman's music complements the beautiful and magical moments of the film. The film has excellent performances by Madhavan, Nandita Das, Simran and the role of absolute stunner Amudha - abandoned - made by a child artist P. S. Keerthana. This performance won his national prize. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is a visual poetry - each frame is beautifully designed and captured with astonishment. I am interested in the connection between Mani Ratnam's terrorism, love and obsession. I think his research on these topics is absolutely outstanding. Mahadevan's character was quite unique - his passion and idealism didn't make him selfish, but he was well suited to how much he cared for a little girl. His one lining was fun. The mother played by Simran was also quite multi-dimensional - she was idealistic, loved by her adopted daughter, but also by her biological children. The shock, anger and obsession of the child Amudha were excellent by P. S. Keerthana. His widespread accusing eyes mostly spoke. In fact, the mysterious characters were Nandita Das and her husband. Maybe Mani deliberately made them mysterious, so as not to give us open ideas why they were as they were - a riddle about why a terrorist gets what he gets. He also kept the trial - it was another conflict in which he did not take any sides, but only reported the human tragedy. <br /> <br /> Kannathil Muthamitt has a visual poetry and soul-disruptive drama - I rarely cry out for movies, but it kept me wet and with a little heart. It's a beautiful movie - a treasure and a keeper when you find a copy; Ask to borrow or steal one today and watch the movie!
