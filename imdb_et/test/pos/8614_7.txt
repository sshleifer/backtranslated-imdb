As chosen during the Quinzaine des réalisateurs, this year Catherine Breillas is excited about her autobiographical film, where her leading actor Anne Parillaud (La Femme NIKITA, Luc Besson) embodies the director of the "Intimate Scenes" movie perfectly <br /> <br /> This is a comedy of acting practices. Making? Movie Genre? Pornography or Exhibition? Sex Is Comedy is a postmodern film whose script is based on film on film. Like the admirable story of a minimalist scene of love, the film is built in a constant spirit of form and spirit, in which Breillat continues to break and analyze taboos. With a certain meaning of visual codes and formula, Catherine Breillat applies clinical analysis of her sexuality as an independent problem outside of society to communicate through the door of the heart. Work, Nénette et Boni, Claire Denis, The Angels Dream, Eric Zonca) is an actor and actor Roxanne Mesquida (Fat girl, Catherine Breill, Marie from Angels Bay, Manuel Prada), actors. he thinks he explains the interview. Breillat follows a man in front of her, a bright man. Then Breilla shoots a shame and sexual distortion, but also high hopes, an ecstasy that disturbs ecstasy, a sense of nudity, a struggle toward exhibiting to play to be one. Finally, the director is expected to lead the participants to give their feelings, body and soul. So organized, faced with the problem of "who I am", the Breillat actors put inorganic viability into their ongoing work. But what is an incredible form of exorcism, Breillat puts a lot of polls for the actor. At the same time, the great suffering is that the actors are those who seek this loving transport as part of their eternal work. <br /> <br /> The art of Breillat is a scientist on how to make a dialogue aimed at removing the boundaries of an intimate scene. Join make-up, erection and syndicate prosthesis does not mean that Jan Steen's and Rembrandt's images and scenes could be in anecdotes and every day characters in the imaging device. Though the moral categories disappear in the background of Sex Is Comedy, Breillat succeeds in exposing the loving imitation ability of actors to the amazing and dramatic landscape of humanity.
