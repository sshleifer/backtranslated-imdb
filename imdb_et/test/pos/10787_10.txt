Alright, for the first time, when I saw that Talk Radio was only $ 2.00 in a video store, I believe it or not, and I looked at it and I thought it might be about Howard Sterni because I watched it about thirty seconds, it just didn't see it again. Then I went to another store about a month later and found "Talk Radio" on the DVD for just $ 5.00. So I see it staged by Oliver Stone and I took it up. So after the movie ended I was speechless. I've never seen such a movie. Here's the main plot, I'll tell you what I was thinking about. <br /> <br /> This is about Dallas radio radio receiver Barry Champlain, a Jewish radio channel who talks about what other people bring and interupts and takes everything seriously. Now the network wants to live its exhibition everywhere in the US. So Barry's exhibition gets many interesting phone calls like Chet (neo-natzi), Kent (rock n role stunned child), John (rapist) and others. Now some callers call the same actor. But still I think it fits well. <br /> <br /> Now, what I love about this movie is the dark corners of the radio station and the paranoid atmosphere. In the dark music background is also very good. It also has a setback in the film, how it started with the radio, what I think they did good. <br /> <br /> But the big thing about the movie ends. I was surprised at this and it makes you feel a bit paranoid about the callers' air and everything is wonderful. It also tells you how to tell the right people to a big city like Dallas. One of Oliver Stone's underrated / weaker films is mentioned, but I think it is the best in my opinion. <br /> <br /> But I will definitely get this movie if you like movies with paranoia-sensitive movies that have evil music in the dark. I'm still watching this movie many times when I'm bored because I look at it tonight. Yes, if you want to know the movie, look at it at night when the lights are off. I may seem crazy, but it makes the movie better! <br /> <br /> Another thing I forgot to mention is that the reason I don't think the film was so well done can be from my point of view, because the title. Talk radio. It doesn't sound very complicated or something, it's normal. Better title like the book "Talked To Death" or perhaps "The Abusive Radio Host" or something memorable and not the usual "Talk Radio". Or maybe thanks to universal pictures? Oliver Stone usually didn't do Universal, which I don't believe. Paramount could have been a good company. I don't know anything about this movie, but I love it. <br /> <br /> "Sticks and stones can break bones, but words can cause permanent damage."
