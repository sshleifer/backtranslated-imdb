One might think that a film based on the life of the Japanese author Yukio Mishima would be a scary, if not impossible, task. However, Paul Schrader has really made the film "about" Mishima, which is so wonderful and complicated. Although this is not a grammatical biography, Schrader & his co-founder Leonard Scharder (his brother) have taken several incidents of his life, including his admiration and craftsmanship, which can best be described in the form of random tables that are visual and stunning. Mishima's homosexuality is almost non-existent due to the legal threats of his widow, but nevertheless the film is still terrible and one of the best films I saw in 1985. I also have to mention Philip Glas's important contribution to the score, which adds extra texture to the film and is better than Scorsese Kundun. Also remarkable is John Bailey's fine-grained beautiful colorful cinema and Eiko Ishioka's great product development and costumes that made Coppola Dracula a memorable costume for which he received a well-earned Oscar. Hopefully this movie will soon be available on DVD.
