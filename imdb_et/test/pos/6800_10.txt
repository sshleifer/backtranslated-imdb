In my opinion, National Velvet is one of the best classics of all time. It has Mickey Rooney (Mi Taylor) and Elizabeth Taylor as (Velvet Brown). <br /> <br /> Velvet wins during a race called (Pie). She loves it right now. With the help of ex jockey, they train at Grand National. After Jockey, who was supposed to compete with Pie, retreats at the last moment, Velvet convinces him. <br /> <br /> It was a well-assembled film. Fine storyline and top notch act. The inner game between Elizabeth and Mickey was magical. This is a wonderful family picture, expertly led by Clarence Brown. Photography is stunning. It's a movie you enjoy for years. <br /> <br /> This picture is what made Elizabeth Taylor's household name. Both Mickey and Elizabeth stayed close to the movie. They send postcards to each other after all these years. <br /> <br /> One Side Note. Elizabeth loved the "Pie" horse so much that the studio gave it to her.
