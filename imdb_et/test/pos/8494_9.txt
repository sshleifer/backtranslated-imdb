Taylor Hackford wanted to make this movie for 15 years and finally found the role of Jamie Foxx. Foxx is astonishing at Ray Charles. Foxx interviewed him several times with Charles and two of them played the piano together (Foxx had a piano lesson and actually played the piano in all his scenes). I didn't see Charles living in his later years, so it was great to have the prospect of how his career evolved. I hope Foxx becomes the best actor for the Oscar because he definitely deserves it. Music is also incredible - it really shows the breadth of Charles music in the country, in the blues and everything. The film also tells the story of Ray Charles's life, which many women with whom he is used to the drug and its consequences.
