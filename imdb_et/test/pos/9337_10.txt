The video opens with a scene of a horror film in which a man makes a proposal to his girlfriend. He'll tell him he's "different." When the full moon rises, he wakes up with a werewolf. Then he follows in the woods and immediately before the attacks we went into the home theater. Michael and his girlfriend are in the theater. She is more afraid to look so they leave. When they leave the theater, he starts to tempt him. ("It's almost at night, something bad in the dark ...") Michael sings and dances with his girlfriend down the street. This scene shows Michael's skill with the camera. He has never acted "consciously" of his presence, as many other artists do. When they get past the graveyard, the graves begin to open ... When they arrive at the alley, they come in contact with the Undead horde. Then we see the horror of Michael's girl. Who wouldn't have seen terribly when their date was a zombie? Yeah, he'll be one Undead. (Very bright and shiny.) Then he and his companions zombies start as the most famous dance choreographer of any music video. I told you it would end. <br /> <br /> It's my favorite music video all the time! You don't want to miss it! I will give it a 10/10. (Yes, I know you see the curtains behind the sound stage, and the werewolf looks like a cheese according to today's standards.)
