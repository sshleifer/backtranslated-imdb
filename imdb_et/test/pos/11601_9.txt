It is very tough to portray Tagore's novel along cinematic lines. And if you forget the hidden production of 1967, its first time a chokher bali is made on a large scale. All in all, the kits showed fantastically correct touches to make a successful period of drama.Prasenj, so accustomed to doing crass commercials, did a good job. I saw the Bengal version and found that Aishwariya's voice was duplicated, making his dialogue a little poor. Although the director did a good job of describing each symbol finely, but there was very little meaningful plot, probably the story itself. It is stronger to make Tagore's stories in movies because only the visual parts seem to have come true.
