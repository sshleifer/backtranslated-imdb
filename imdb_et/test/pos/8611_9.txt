Filming movies. Shows intense and strange relationships that can develop between managers and their participants; manipulation and mind games; the egotism of performers. As in any workplace, sexuality issues are difficult, but here is the nth degree because they are filming the sex world. <br /> <br /> Absolutely fantastic performances by Gregoire Colin as a fragile, wannabe macho male and - ultimately - Anne Parillaud is the director's self-image. The image of his laughing and, finally, the banana eating that he finally wanted from his dolls is pure joy.
