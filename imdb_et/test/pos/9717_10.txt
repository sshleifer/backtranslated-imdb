Unfortunately, every person I ask about this series has ever heard of it. I remember it in my early childhood (I wasn't quite ten when he came out). Something about how the "stone soup" story of a bigger story weaved, gets me every time. And then the storyteller explains why he has no story to tell, and that will be the story itself. I've always been a fan of Jim Henson, and that's just one of the reasons I add it. , The Last Unicorn, Willow and MirrorMask. These are all the DVDs I share with my brothers who are 6, 5 and 4 years old.
