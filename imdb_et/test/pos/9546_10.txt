I'll stay ahead. I needed something to keep me tension, anxiety (what if it wasn't that good?) And a constant lack of information. I needed something to make me a little peaceful, something that went, of course, except of course the Matrix. That was the thing. <br /> <br /> I found it informative (like part of Keanu's neck ...) and some of it was funny. I punished Carrie-Anne as much as she said there was only one bathroom and all those guys. I found only one problem. Considering that 95% of the people were actually men, they promised their mouth wildly and there was language. It's not as bad as Shawshank's Redemption cussing runs, but that one scene was Keanu describing a bad day, connect the ears when you're little. It was fun and it was just what I needed. What all Matrix fans have in their nuts must keep them silent. They're talking about tiny lakes and someone almost gives it away, but it tries to catch up on time (shoot!). It gives you almost any spoiler, but it's nice if you're a Matrix Head like me. <br /> <br /> There are no spoons.
