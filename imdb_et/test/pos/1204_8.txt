For the first time I saw this movie four years old. I remember it with love and all that. 13 years later I am now 17 years old and decided to watch it about a month ago, because I am going to school in the 1960s. I didn't know what to expect because it had been the last 13 years after that, but I had it completely. The actors were amazing, the music was so fun and now I find myself on every song. Treat Williams is great, as Berger, the "leader" of the hippie group, who always or otherwise (except of course) gets what he wants. John Savage is actually very convincing as Claude, the Oklahoma driver who falls in love with Sheila (Beverly D'Angelo). D'Angelo is beautiful as a prima and a true rich girl who eventually rebels to her upbringing and joins the hippie. Other hippies are played by Annie Golden, Don Dacus and Dorsey Wright. Annie Golden is just as adorable as Jeannie, a girl who is still a child and innocent. Don Dacus and Dorsey Wright are good as Woof and Hud, the other two group members and Cheryl Barnes, who plays Hud's bride, have an amazing voice. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have with this movie is that the relationship between Claude and Sheila is not very convincing. They are hardly ever shown together, and when they are, they fight (remember lean watering?). It seems that their relationship is very weak and at the end of the movie we should believe they are in love with madness only on the basis of those few meetings. I also see that many people who write comments here are disturbing this movie's rating. Personally, I would raise the rating to PG-13 just because drug use is ... but I remember in 1979, PG-13 doesn't exist. I don't think nudity is bad at all, it is not sexual in any way (in fact, there is actually no sex in this movie), and it is only to show the child the innocence that the group maintains. In most European countries, nudity is not considered bad and I do not understand why it is here in the US. Anyway, I give this film a high rating and I am glad it was back because in today's madly "politically correct" world they didn't even think about doing it and even if they did, it would be a very "dehydrated" version, and I'm sure you will not get the full effect. Finally, this is a very underrated movie that is definitely worth it.
