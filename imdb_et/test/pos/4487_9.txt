In the Sci-Fi TZ marathon on January 31, 1999, this episode was the last one that was inspired in the 20th century in my time zone (East). It was the New Year's Eve and when the clown starts singing, "We're here because we're here because we're here because we're here ..." I realized it was TZ's smart nod of New Year's Eve because this setup is also the voice of old Lang Syne. Coincidence? We never know. <br /> <br /> I love this story for small touches: the ballerina tear, the clown's worship and the end of the blow-end head. This and the Art Carney Santa TZ are the only ones that are at Christmas. <br /> <br /> My Five Best Episodes After Five Characters ...: 1. Hunt 2. The After Hours 3. The Hitchhiker 4. Lonely 5.
