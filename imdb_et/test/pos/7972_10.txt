"Hell to Pay" lets itself revive itself as a classic Western revolution ... it succeeds as a Western genre film that the whole family saw and not unlike decades of movies. Good guys are good and bad guys are really bad! . Bo Svenson, Stella Stevens, Lee Majors, Andrew Prine (excellent in this movie) Tim Thomerson and James Drury are all great and fun to see them again. James Drury really looks like this, maybe even better times than "The Virginian". In a sense, "hell to pay" reminds of those films in the 60s, where the actors you know from so many exhibitions have a look. If you are of a certain age, Buck Taylor, Peter Brown and Denny Miller and William Smith will give the "wow" factor because we rarely see this icon. "Hell to Pay" offers legends on screen with newer names in Hollywood. The most noteworthy is "beginners" by choosing Rachel Kimsey (Rebekah), whom I have recently seen "Young and Restless", and Kevin Kazakoff, who plays Kirby, an eels who fly in the war, who want to live and live or step in to "do the right thing" . William Gregory Lee is a great opportunity, Kirby's crazy and feminine brother. Katie Keane plays Rachel, Rebecca's sister, a woman who did what was necessary to survive, but gave up her pride in the process. In a small but memorable role, Jeff Davis plays Mean Joe, a former Confederate with a rather nasty midline. I think we will see more of these great players in the future. "Hell To Pay" is a fun movie with a great story? grab the popcorn, we are "West!"
