I saw it last night at the 7th annual NYC home theater festival - a rather turbulent place that silenced this sweet and touching two-woman movie. <br /> <br /> The two - parent-parent relationships blind, the other, twenty-one who helps him with the help - are smooth and easy to see. <br /> <br /> There are no cars, no explosions or special special effects - just a difficult but rewarding task for people to help and help each other. <br /> <br /> See if it's possible!
