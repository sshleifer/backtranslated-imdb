First of all, I must say that this movie is less violent than the Da Vinci code. you are confident that you have a problem with religion and science, but it is not trying to make a big statement about it. it's basically a thriller that moves from one scene to another very well. especially the scene (which includes fire) I found very well done. Second, the changes from the book to the movie. although after developing the film I had complained about changing some of the stars and removing others, I have to admit that I was wrong. it was refreshing that the film did not follow the book exactly as it was done in Da Vinci. if you are a book purse, some of them may still disturb you. But BIG TWIST is still there, so don't worry about it. Finally, I am pleased that they have removed some foolish sub-lines and did not even try to suggest the possibilities of Langdon and Vittoria. <br /> <br /> Performances are really good, but nothing ordinary. this is good for such a movie. <br /> <br /> give it 9/10, mainly because it gives what it promises, entertainment, pure entertainment
