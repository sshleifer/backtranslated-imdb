My introduction to Shakespeare's lifelong love. My brother was 5 and I wasn't 7 when WTTW Chicago passed the Kings era. It became a family ritual for viewing, including rumors. In the fall, my father bought us a downtown treatment - a rare treatment for pomegranates; and my mother put on the stove. Wonderful acting from actors whose names didn't mean anything to me (although I will never forget young Sean Connery as Hotspur), but now! And they published the scripts on paper so that we could track and think the language. I managed to remember most of Richard III. So glad to see it appear on the DVD! Highly recommended for all ages and levels with Shakespeare or English history.
