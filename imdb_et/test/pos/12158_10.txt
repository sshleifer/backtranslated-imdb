Have you ever had an angel of death like MIMSY FARMER Barbet Schroeder's 1960s heroin opus? A variety of Jean Seberg with a hypodermic. Pink Floyd score. Despite some minor weaknesses - the classic that Erich Segal / Noel Black destroyed shamelessly to JENNIFER ON MIN MIND (1971), although Tippy Walker, who plays the same character, is very dirty. What's more, it is a terrible, huge 60's drug film and just an important document of that time. A lot of cult films join the cult film. <br /> <br /> No American movie when I remember mapping the same territory. MIMSY is an amazing archetype that makes it mythical. Not with a weak heart. Great sex scenes too.
