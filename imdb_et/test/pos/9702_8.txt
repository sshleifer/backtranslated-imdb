My sister, friend, and I went to watch this movie for my birthday on September 24th. We had all seen the first "Jackass" movie a while ago and we all enjoyed it. I was really waiting for Two. <br /> <br /> We were not disappointed. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end I was laughing hysterically. However, similar parts are shocking and entertaining and are certainly not for those who have weak stomachs. It is obscene, but it is also a groundbreaking American cinema ... well, maybe it's a bit too much of a praise for a movie where men want to stick to their sculptures, but it is groundbreaking because it shows us that we like us it or not, the things that no other "decent" American film published throughout the country did not dare to show us. <br /> <br /> There was only one scene that I felt unnecessarily obscene and related to the horse - I'm not talking. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I almost gagged, and I came near the devil (a physical reaction to look at the pelvis and the eyeball, not sadness). In my humble opinion, "Jackass: Number Two" is a "06 movie. <br /> <br /> Does this make me a jackass? Maybe. But if that is the case, I could take less care.
