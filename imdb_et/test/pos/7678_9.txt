It is a shame that the Gershwin family and the Goldwyn Estate have been pulled out of watching this great movie, not seeing some of the most amazing actors and performances ever packed in a single movie chain. <br /> <br /> It is also true that Sidney Poitier's and Dorothy Dandridge's singing companies were dubbed for this film and used as one of the reasons why Gershwin never wants to re-publish this movie. br /> <br /> Despite the film's mistakes and the creative differences between Gershins and Goldwyn, this film has some of the most outstanding, ever-dedicated shows. Particularly worthy of praise is Sammy Davis, Jr. and Pearl Bailey. <br /> <br /> This film was a swan song from a large independent producer Samuel Golwyn. It was also ironic, Gershwin's greatest shame. Eventually it has disappeared into the wonderful black actors who appeared in it. Because we can't see them any more.
