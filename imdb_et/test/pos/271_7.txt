The third item in the "Stepford" franchise, but apparently the three television twilight queues are amazingly hidden and tricky, while the transformation of the 70's originals and Nicole Kidman's relocation is well known and very popular. I haven't seen the beginning of the 80's "Revenge of Stepford's Spouses" or "The Stepford Husbands" in the mid-1990s, but this "Stepford Children" is a pretty charming and very fun little movie. It's basically the same film as the original; Obviously less mysterious but much cheesier and incredibly 80's n. The main difference here, as the title suggests, is that not only the liberated women, but also the rebels and punk teenage descendants in the city, undergo a typical and highly effective "Stepford treatment" licensed by the local Men's Union. For some reason, the scenario of Stepford's attempt to detain the film until the film is delayed, although no one should watch the original before taking the original, and probably everyone who recognizes it. Harding's family is all packed and ready to move from the harsh city of New York to the small and peaceful community of Stepford. Especially Father Steven rejoices for his new life because he already lived in Stepford and always wanted to go back after the first woman whom his new wife Laura and Mary and David young knew very little died in mysterious circumstances. The city is almost too perfect, with painful neighbors and model students, and especially today's teenagers with great difficulty in adapting. Their efforts to modernize the site and imprison Stanford's local youth are confronted with outstanding citizens, especially the Men's Association, and put a lot of stress on family relationships. David meets and loves the last "normal" girl at school in Lois, but when she even turns into a domestic dummy overnight, she can persuade her skeptical mother to look into the blind Stanford secret. The first hour of "The Stanford Children" is slow and fairly tame, but the final is the trick and cheese, as VHS covers promises and as the 80's triller really should be. The modus operandi behind Stanford's secrets is illustrated in more detail, and I think horror fans and lovers of original films appreciate it. At least I did. The general plot is still not a lot of sense, and the script is full of irrational aspects, but it is still an interesting formula and certainly one that creates a temporary and fearful atmosphere. Good performances are much higher than average. Particularly delightful and unpleasant members of the men's association represent credible signs and even teenagers Tammy Lauren and Randall Batinkoff are impressive performances. Recommended without hesitation!
