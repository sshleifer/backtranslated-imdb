I would like to know if "The Outsiders" will ever be published on DVD in the future? And is music (title) available on CD? <br /> <br /> There was only one series of 13 episodes in this drama that should have gone through at least three or even four lines. <Br /> <br /> The young German actress also featured in the German TV series "Black Forest Clinic", which broadcasted here in England with an English-language dialogue with lips. <br /> <br /> I look forward to hearing from the TV industry about the above questions, thank you in advance.
