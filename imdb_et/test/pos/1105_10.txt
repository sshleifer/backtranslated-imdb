I saw this movie at the 3rd Adelaide International Film Festival at the Palace Cinemas and took it fully in five minutes. Thanks to the goodness of the film that ignores all the garbage we often see in Australian films that seem to turn around a) race b) sex and c) class er ... i dare say .... fun good cinema. Producer, shy, lightly eccentric captain Alex Frayne, introduced his film, made with his companions near the city and spent a large part of his childhood. Apparently, he spent most of last year driving a world film, mainly in Europe. The world that the film creates is brilliant and artistic, especially in strange and amazing editing style, in Gothic characters and in surreal time and place that draws viewers into their horrible world. <br /> <br /> The manufacturer returned a Q + A follow-up. Someone asked him what his inspiration was - he replied in "South Australia". Hear it! The other asked him what meant alex life. He replied that he led the old Ute that he had breakfast at the same restaurant in the same restaurant, where he had eaten well in the last eight years! and he plays a piano that helps him think. She does not drink cheese and plays the cricket once a week. Then the Q and A sessions ended abruptly because of the screening of the next film - so my thoughts are that they have to extend after the film for the next festival.
