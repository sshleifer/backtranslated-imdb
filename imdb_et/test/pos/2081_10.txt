Took this movie on TCM A.M. It was amazing. <br /> <br /> Starting slow, but maliciously .... Scott is a shady character who robs women. In this case, there are two women from South California inheritance. <br /> <br /> The 1940s beach and neighborhood sets are original and intriguing. The title may have been more creative, but the theme of human nature and blind shadows have been intriguingly touched, almost in the Hitchcock version. <br /> <br /> Scott reminded me of the Uncle Charley character in the shadow of doubt, one of Hitch's well-known favorite films. Audience is studying, we really don't know what lies on the dark side of the human mind. This film is a displaced pearl and worth buying. 10/10.
