I'm totally in love with "Great Way" when I first saw it! Reason # 1 is because I love ADORE and am a GENE KELLY huge fan. He was such a wonderful dancer, actor and choreographer. Not to mention his very beautiful appearance and his sensual personality. I love his role in this movie. He was such a gentleman. This movie showed his wonderful talent to show. I also liked Marie MacDonald. It was my first time I saw or felt something about it, and this wonderful film made me a fan of it. In fact, the whole part of this movie was enjoyable and great. Humor, the humor between "Everette Hanover Smythe" and father, Mr Morgan; The humor of Mrs Morgan's courtroom and especially the immediate confirmation and concern of Grandma Morgan about "LEO GOGARTY". And the GENE number "FIDO AND ME" is divine. The GENE and MARIE dance numbers are also very nice. I recommend that someone see this movie. It will remain forever in your heart. Or at least it is for me. And you'll love again at GENE. I appreciate it with my # 2 favorite GENE KELLY MOVIE and I've seen and owned quite a few of his films. They are part of my daily life! So trust me when I tell you you love this movie! Watch it and enjoy it !!
