Death in Venice is a film I have to see every ten years. It's always different because I'm always in a different life. <br /> <br /> The film deals with art, beauty, longing, death. Some scenes are painfully slow, others are just annoying to watch, especially if you have known them before. But I wouldn't want to leave a single frame. Music is repetitive, Mahler's fifth main theme, Adagietto, is used over and over again. But I wouldn't want to leave any comments. When the last picture disappears, the last note dies, I am left numb and exhausted. <br /> <br /> This movie is a cinematic monument. Like most of the really good movies, Saturday evening, the crowd should stay away from it. And it's just the best movie ever.
