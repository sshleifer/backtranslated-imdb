This is the promise of the trailer I saw and with which I rented Hitch. Indeed, a serious film viewer can't wait much further than this title, but surprisingly, Smith, Mendes, James and Valletta were able to reach the theater performance that could be metaphorically summarized at the end of the film on their rap-dance routine. : Their characters formed an effective combination that could laugh faster with this Sunday afternoon DVD because your date is not a 60-member film fan, thin, French-Swedish directors. <br /> <br /> PS: Scores are all real, especially the "Cocktail Girl" routine!
