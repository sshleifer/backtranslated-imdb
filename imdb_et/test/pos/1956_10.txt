I really have no complaints about this movie, except for the body-disturbing scenes. I fell on it when the TV was around one night. The action was actually amazing, I didn't expect it to be better than it appeared! I thought Keanu (who sees SAME since 1986, a very good thing, hehe) was really * great * and Crispin played his character perfectly! This movie is a hidden pearl! This is the awakening of fresh reality to the 80s compared to other teenage films made by the brat package (although I also like such fashionable ones). All in all, I'll give her thumbs!
