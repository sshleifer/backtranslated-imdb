"Man of the Year" tells Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) of a political comedian (such as Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert) who has his own TV show. At his show he talks about all things, but his main focus is on political matters, of which he is very concerned. One day, an audience fan raises the idea that Dobbs should drive to the US President. After this episode, millions of people appeared on the web to create different petitions and express their views on why Dobbs would be a great candidate for the US President. A few weeks later, Dobbs decides to lead the president and the low, and see, win the election. Everything seems to be going as planned until a woman appears in the name of Eleanor Green (Laura Linney) and starts arguing about her position. Funny but serious political thriller? <br /> <br /> The man somebody walking in this movie, waiting to see useless comedy, is definitely disappointed. I always wonder how some people are film distributors when I see their marketing campaigns mislead. "Man of the Year" is a good example of bad and misleading marketing, because everything from poster to trailer until web advertising makes this movie comedy and seems. I would honestly say that about 1/3 of the movie is funny, the rest plays as a political thriller that makes good arguments and allows the audience to think. I wonder if marketing was done for the purpose, because this film deals with quite serious problems between the comedy routine. br /> <br /> I really liked the "Person of the Year", although I was expecting comedy instead of a serious movie. One of the many things I give to this film credit is that the film makes a decent job between comedy and drama, although at first it seems a little uncomfortable. I really think that after you realize that film is a more political thriller than the comedy you're happy with. Some may not because they believe they see comedy and do not understand what this film is trying to say, but to those people who can blame marketers for not advertising this film. <br /> <br /> "Man of the Year" talks about many things and seems to have a very strong opinion. As Tom Dobbs says, he talks about things to say and what is not covering their candy. I also think that the whole political sub-block, even though most critics have probably lost the movie due to marketing, was very good. The idea of ​​computer-based voting has been moved over the last few years, and all the problems in this film are a problem that will certainly be solved by this problem. Voting on the control of large companies is also discussed. <br /> <br /> As far as action is concerned, I think that all those involved have done a good job. At the same time, Robin Williams was able to play funny but serious when playing Tom Dobbs. Some say that Williams is a comedian over time, but I still think he's funny and he's a good serious actor. This is probably one of the few times that we see that he goes seriously and funny back and forth, and I think it works well. It's also nice to see Lewise Black star card in a decent movie. Again, I like Black when he appears in "The Daily Show" and still rises to most of the movies he's had, was terrible. It was a good film for him because I think his political views fit the story that Director Barry Levinson was trying to convey. Laura Linney is a great addition to the pain and proves once again that she is a very good actor, and finally, Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum are doing as well as always with the roles given to them. <br /> <br /> "The Man of the Year" was written and directed by Barry Levinson, the man who brought us such films as "Rain Man", "Good Morning Vietnam" and "Wag the Dog". Levinson writes and manages the film. As I said, I know that many critics do not like the whole political thriller of the film, but I thought it would work well. It was really nice to watch a mainstream movie that allowed me to think and laugh at the same time. Barry Levinson did a good job with this film. <br /> <br /> Finally, don't go to this movie while waiting for the movie that the ads sell to you. It is ridiculous, but at the same time it plays more of a political drama. It's not that stupid or stupid if the marketing campaign leads you to believe. I really liked the fact that this movie, which this movie is not a typical Hollywood movie. At the same time she tried to be a comedy and a serious drama and worked at least for me. I like the fact that the film really didn't give the problem it dealt with, nor the typical end of Hollywood. I tried to call the end, but it was surprising that it didn't end up as I thought, which made me happy. This is a movie that makes you laugh, but then in a few minutes let you think and think about what will happen next. I think it's a good movie that bad marketing is damaging.
