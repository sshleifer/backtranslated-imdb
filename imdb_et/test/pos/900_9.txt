Gen-Y Cops ... because I heard the release of the movie, I wanted to see it because I loved Gen-X Cops. I was a little disappointed that A) Nicholas Tse did not return and B) was too much. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this sequel because it may not be the first movie, but it's good in its own way. <br /> <br /> Stephen Fung returns with ultrasonic ladies who are a persistent girl. (NOTE: Where's Haze?) And Sam Lee goes mad to the alien (this time he's doing a mohawk and speaks a lot of English !!!!). The real star of the movie is the newcomer Edison Chen. He makes an excellent substitute for Nicholas Tse as ... Edison. I also liked Paul Rudd's agent Curtis's presentation ... he seems to be tough like nails, a smart FBI agent you would hate ... but soon you want his character. <br /> <br /> Fighting scenes are much better at this ... though there are very few, but they are big, by Jacky Chan's stuntman Nicky Li. <br /> <br /> Find a Ron Smoorenburg companion. cage fighter who fights with Match. Smoorenburg is also a double stunt for Rudd. <br /> <br /> If you liked GEN-X COPS ... love GEN-Y COPS !!!
