My wife and I loved this movie. Intelligent dialogue, big characters, smart land construction. The pace of this movie is non-stop. Some munches couldn't even access the kitchen. We've never seen Corey Feldman funny. Taylor Nichols plays good Fed ... my wife loves her on this "Married Man" HBO display. The band was all strong. The end result was delightful to us. That's why we give this movie "Permanent O".
