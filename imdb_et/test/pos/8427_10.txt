I finally found persuasion what I like! In such a version, Anne does not see the girl's event, but she is a very thin, aging, beautiful woman as described in the book. Captain Wentworth does not look like he is 50 years old, nor does he see him forever, but as he has described in the book, he is not as old as Anne and is pretty beautiful. And they play their parts with such conviction and realism ... that's what works. They were plausible. They created real characters and it was like the characters of the book. If you haven't seen this version, I invite you to find it, order it, or order it from the bookstore or library, if necessary. It's worth the price and is worth the wait. <br /> <br /> I looked at the 1995 version and the 2007 version and the two towers. Why it is not higher is not beyond my understanding. The book expresses the tenderness of these relationships and this film makes the book alive.
