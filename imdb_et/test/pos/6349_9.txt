You can get rich experience while watching this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a seemingly simple story of a talented student, Yiu Kwok, who later becomes a teacher of classical Chinese poetry. She is married to two sons and things at home seem normal. She also loves her wife after 20 years of marriage and her sons alternate (older) and frustrate (younger). <br /> <br /> His passion for poetry turns him into a class for older students. The student, Choi Lam, draws her pictures in her class during her class, one of her flowers coming from her mouth. He tease him more with his intelligence than his sexuality, although it is also an element. Of course, he is not immune to his attention, although he tries to keep the boundary between the teacher and the student for some time. <br /> <br /> The reason he finally fails is difficult. First, there is a real depth for the communication between him and Choi Lam. It is clear that he really likes him and that is mutual. Secondly, her marriage is a long-standing problem that occurs when both her and her wife's old friend get sick. The consequences of a woman's involvement with this friend, both past and present, are almost too sad. <br /> <br /> There's nothing trivial about this movie. All the characters have a vivid inner life and an easily recognizable history. Two leaders, Jacky Cheung and Anita Mui, are outstanding, as is Karena Lam as a student of Choi Lam, and Shaun Tam as the eldest son of On Yin. <br /> <br /> Recommended without reservation.
