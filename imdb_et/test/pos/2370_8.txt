This is a film that needs to be taken in context. It should not be seen until you have seen the first two films, but people who see such a movie are likely to have a box set or at least know someone who does it. And you should not wait for Blade Runner; the budget for movies is not so distant, and it's a more interesting journey. where it is illegal. Sho Aikawa repeats a similar role from Dead or Alive 2 and Riki Takeuchi is an anti-maternity police detective. Takashi Miike does not give you all the reasons for a plate, but it can be assumed that the law of reproduction established by giving people a pill is there for the population, for prolonging life and so on. Interestingly, the film is mainly Cantonese, while Sho and Riki (who play their parts, as always, excellently) speak Japanese and some speak English. People have criticized English as a wood, but I did not find any problems with it. The other person also found that the whole topic of homosexuality in the film was offensive; said Takashi Miike was homosexual. He may very well be (and not all artists must be left), but I do not see this film as an insult to homosexuals. He simply calls back the ancient Greek philosophies when homo- or bisexuality was more common. The film includes proportional activities and exciting moments similar to DoA 2, although this film is more of a martial arts and is done in a very good Hong Kong style. The film's cinematic art is very nice for the eyes, with symmetric shots, good color control to give the air a contaminated look, and it's nice to see that there are so rare long shots in Hollywood these days. Basically, this movie is a lot of fun: good sense of humor, exciting action and some very beautiful moments. It is a series of excellent finishes. You could criticize it because it's a little cheesy, but isn't it a charm?
