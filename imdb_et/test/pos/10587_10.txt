I had been waiting for this movie for so long and finally yesterday. All in all, I'm glad I finally did. Humor is fun on the wall. The plot is so incredibly believable that it must have at least some truth. If something emerged in this movie, it is definitely a cafe. I've been there, every boy is. You're dumping. You'll find out that your ex is frustrated with some of the guys you are sure of. Now, every time you see something in the next few days, you'll just get terrible thoughts in all the wrong regions. He screws everything and everyone knows it. I can see that the man stops and fucks his wallet all day and looks back and laughs that I was there.
