Sleeper Cell is what 24 should have been. 24 is a comic. (I look at 24, but I feel cheated on every stupid episode, all four or five seasons so far. Who can follow if they're all the same. Then ...) Sleeper Cell is really well done and much better. Unfortunately, they blew at the end of the second season. I can think of half a dozen right ends that would be over my head, which would have worked better for the obvious goals of the writer and not as viable. Shame on the writers to destroy what was really the completion of a good series.
