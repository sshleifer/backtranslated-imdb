I was delighted to see this short film at the Miami Film Festival last Saturday and let me just say I was surprised. It was the only movie that was all about the program I loved. It is beautifully photographed, compiled, edited, behaved and written. After screening, I saw the manager at the party and asked him what he was doing next. He said he was working on a short-term finance. He described me some scenes. It sounded like the first movie that opens up the industries. If you have the opportunity to see it for a short time, I suggest you take it. Hats for crossing.
