This movie blew me away - I've only seen two episodes, never seen the first movie, but I went to the front screen where Johnny Knoxville himself introduced the film, saying, â€œWe'll turn our sense of moral judgment into one and a half hours. He was right. As a film, it would probably be a 2 because it has a baseline, not a random structure and a very low production value. But this is not the case. Everything in our theater is laughing and watching the whole way - not only some of the tricks were creative (see trailer if you need to know, but they hid some of the best (or worst depending on how you want to watch it), but some of the things they did surprise These guys are doing some things that don't do it in your newspaper review (and probably can't even be published here), involving a lot of seat belts, but almost 3/4 of the tricks are fantastically hysterical (even if they are morally condemned to be reasonable, but you remember the Knoxville statement) and if you have the right way of thinking, this movie is hysterical. Only about 20 minutes of this movie could have been shown on TV, so keep yourself alert about what you're getting - some things are nasty, but instead, Because someone who thought Jackass was a TV show was a jumping fashion that had just a few jokes ad sketches and a lot of unnecessary pain, for the fun of this movie, I have realized that the lack of boundaries is the best environment for boys to work for them. It's a lot of fun and should be a great comedy solution until the Borat movie comes out. With this movie, you might think you know what you get, but these guys are a few steps ahead of you - I guarantee you will be surprised by Scheme 3. So enjoy it and don't worry: you don't want to do almost any of your stuff at home.
