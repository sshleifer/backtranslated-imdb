"Fame" had been one of my favorite films for years! This is not only an 80-year-old musical movie "from this" NYC high school, but LEGENDARY- people no longer refer to high school for lecture art, but to "celebrity school! <br /> <br /> The characters are real, they are not "Hollywood" and their stories are real. The film follows the four-year school year, starting with a student with a powerful monologue in Auditions and ending with a grand exhibition. <br /> <br /> Some will probably find that Broadway is better, but that's my opinion that you should definitely see this movie and have your own views. Everyone who enjoys watching a movie and wishing to "classics" is definitely one of them. This is an example of one of those films that were really great, with the actors we loved in those two hours, and never seen them again ... they're classic "Fame students". <br /> <br /> The road FAME lives forever.
