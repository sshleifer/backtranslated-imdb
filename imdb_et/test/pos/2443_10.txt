Yes, a great cultural tradition. The great atmosphere, top script and good results make this A-class candidate a DVD release. <br /> <br /> This is a historic round of Australian TV history, and during this unforgettable groovy period, the voice of Doug Parkinson's gravel and phlegm, which carries the 70s of Australia's entire cathode ray box as an amazingly long camera, unveils open-road religion in all its antiodod respect . It is a reminder of the second and not too distant time, and it has a gorgeous underground tape that is capable of submerging all its raw freedom and sharpness from beginning to end. Come on ABC! Get the program and release this cool 70s cult child for everyone to enjoy - or enjoy again when you are lucky that the dream has lived.
