Of course, it is not surprising that in a film whose main topics are death, nostalgia and loss of innocence, older viewers are more appreciated than younger. However, the film is crafted and complete, which everyone can enjoy. This pace is stable and persistent, the characters are full and interesting, natural relationships and relationships that show no need for tears to show emotions, fear to show fear, punish to show controversy or violence. Of course, the story of Joyce gives the film a ready-made structure that is perfect as a polished diamond, but the small changes Huston does, like adding a poem, fit well. It's really impressive, fine and overwhelming beauty.
