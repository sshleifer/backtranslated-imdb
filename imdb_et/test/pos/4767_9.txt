It is now clear that the real golden time of the American film was from the mid-1960s until the release of Star Wars. Before that, there was too much Hays Code-constrained priest. With Star Wars, the green light comes on for the majority of children and mores, which continues to this day. SEVEN-UPS is really said to include a couple of hackneyed lines of dialogue - "We can do it in a simple way, or we can do it a hard way" is one - but I'm fucking if I can't find anything wrong yet. (Actually, this line may not be hidden even at the time of making this movie.) SEVEN-UPS demonstrates everything that was right with the best films of the golden age: lack of dialogue, realistic acting, real places (New York City dirty in winter has never seen better / worse), Propulsive narratives and yes, the best car ever filmed. Bill Hickman is the leader Scheider is a fugitive (you know him from Bullitt) and the chase structure is quite similar to McQueen, but I prefer the Scheider's face intensity, the temple, the terrible close-ups of the schoolchildren, and the breakable conclusion. (This VW bug is going around 2 mph always bothering me Bullitt chasing.) Stylish, screechy score Don Ellis sets the perfect mood. SEVEN UPS: Gloomy, gloomy, action-oriented, adult. This is a movie you can't do today; is not a "trick" for kiddies or reluctant endings. Thank you, Philip D'Anton, Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco: as long as the police films are reviewed, SEVEN-UPS and its 1970s brothers (eg FRENCH CONNECTION) set the standard.
