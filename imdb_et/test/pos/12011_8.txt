I think that this film has become an important part of the most terrible part of the East German regime - to imprison the people that the regime called its fascist defensive wall. It is a document of despair and courage that must not be missed. However, I would like to comment on the actual location of this escape. It did not happen in Berlin or its surroundings, as some respondents thought, and it was not directly related to the Berlin Wall. The escape ball was flown over the Iron Curtain, which not only shared Germany, but shared the whole of Europe at that time. The balloon went from PÃ¶ssneck, 170 miles southwest of Berlin in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and flew 14 miles to Naila in Bavaria and freedom in West Germany. The opening of the Iron Curtain in Hungary in 1989 preceded the fall of the Berlin Wall later that year. Although balloon flight created an entertaining cinema, it should remain a remembrance for those who lost their lives, trying to escape in East Berlin, other parts of the VDR or other Soviet-controlled countries.
