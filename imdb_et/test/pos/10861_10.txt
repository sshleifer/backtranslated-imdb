I am glad that I first read Sarah Waters' novel because I had my own pictures with the letters on my head. But the people cast to this production were not disappointed - after I got used to Rachael Stirling like Nan, I think Nina Gold did a good job in the casting department. (Is Keeley Hawes Delicious?!) <br /> <br /> The BBC has done this again: it's a great production of a great book and they've done it in style. If you can get it (VHS, DVD), be sure to get an 181 minute version (uncensored). It's a wonderful journey, though sometimes a bit rocky, so you won't regret it.
