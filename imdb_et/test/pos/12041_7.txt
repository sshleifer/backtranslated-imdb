Darr was a Super Hit movie that many nations loved. It talks about Shahrukh Khan's innocent obsession with a leader who loves Sunny Deoli. Frankly, it was an entertaining film, but if you look carefully, it is not too realistic. Shahrukh Khan calls the manager and tells him he loves him too. She knows in college that she loves her and gives her some nice surprises like her beautiful photos. Unfortunately, he does not want him to love him too much, rather than luring him. I personally know the 100 people someone worships and these people enjoy it because they play for a long time. Yash Chopra gives us a good entertainment film that is widely appreciated by Shah Rukh Khani. Sunny Deol is expected to be the main actor, but Darr belongs to Shah Rukh Khan, who gives an excellent result. Shah rukh Khan is literally a villain of a movie, but I would be happy when she got her, because she loves her so hard. Sunny Deol gives a decent result, but he wins all these boys independently and lives brutally for the attack. Driver Chawla is cute as a pretty good result. The best are some good songs, including Tu just samne.
