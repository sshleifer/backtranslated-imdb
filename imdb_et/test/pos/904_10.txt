Genius or madness? It depends on the interpretation of your movie. I responded to this at the level of the "police parody" of self-consciousness, and I sincerely hope that it was an intention, because I don't see anyone who would take it seriously! :-D Paul Rudd seems to be chewing the landscape and really getting into the spirit of things! Should this film mark Rudd's departure from the core of the comedy genre? Some mad attempts to invent him as a hard-boiled actor? I think not! <br /> <br /> What is cheesy, almost uncomfortable, with low budget FX and surprisingly surprising activities, then all this caused me the old TV show "Sledge Hammer"! HILARIOUS !!! :-) <br /> <br /> Of course I can completely misinterpret the film. If this was actually a "straight" action movie, it was definitely an amusing mistake !! <br /> <br /> Look alot of alcohol and some companions !!! ;-)
