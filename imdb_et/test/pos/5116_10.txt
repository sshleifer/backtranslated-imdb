I love Ernest going to jail. This is one of my 3 best favorite movies. Others were Ernest Scared Stupid and Ernest Goes Camp. In this movie, Ernest (Jim Varney) works as a bank guard but he wants to be a bank secretary. Soon he will be given a jury duty, but soon will be in trouble if the evil murderer Felix Nash (also Varney) strikes him and turns him off! Soon, Ernest will be in jail and forced to act like Nash or else Nash will kill Charlotte's love interest. When they take Ernest to the electric chair, I thought he was Nash, he would be so shocked that he would break out and go down and save Charlotte from the evil Nash! Perfect fun scenes and comics by Ernest Goes Jail is a movie that makes you so laugh! It still makes me! Jim Varney was such a fantastic actor! He did a good job with both good and bad players! Varney was like his Toy Story Co star Tom Hanks. No matter what role they played, their roles were memorabilia and this is one thing Varney remembers forever! REST IN PEACE. Jim Varney 1949-2000. Thank you for bringing Ernest and other fantastic signs to life! 10 out of 10!
