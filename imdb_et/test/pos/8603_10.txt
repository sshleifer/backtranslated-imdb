Black Rain is a great movie, but watch out for up to $ 300 DVDs. I have a DVD and it's terrible. Very small, non-anamorphic image that needs to be cleaned up to the resolution. Allowed sound. It is a primitive DVD that has * been * re-announced *. VHS is a big step forward from DVD! And the laser disc is by far the best picture of all of them - subtitles with black, sharp, large picture, simple but very good soundtrack. Buy VHS and avoid unnecessary prices that these scammers are demanding!
