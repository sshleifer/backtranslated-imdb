Joline (Heather Graham) married Carl (Luke Wilson) and about fifty days later, Carl is very depressed and leaves her and hopes to "clear the mist" in her life. Joline stands for her commitment to the end of her life and decides to look for Carl of Texas. He is very much supported by his brother Jay (Casey Affleck), who meets with him at the Mexican border. There, Joline meets Carl with a mess and realizes she can't change her decision, while Jay knows Carmen (Patricia Velasquez) and is getting to know her and finally "life goes on". This movie is very unpredictable, with a very different story. I believe this is an independent production. In some parts it is a bit slow and boring, but there are certain dialogues that make this movie valuable. I liked it and my voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Rebelds At√© o Fim" ("Rebels to End") <br /> <br />
