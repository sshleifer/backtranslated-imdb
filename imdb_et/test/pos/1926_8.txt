"Ideas are dangerous." Comment of one interviewee. <br /> <br /> DVD Rating: B + / 4 of 5/8 of 10 / Worth the Time. <br /> <br /> A great story for adults or teen boats, but not for kids. None of the foolish things of violent crime that Hollywood is so often mistaken for "quality work". And it can be used as a coach film about what the right boat preparation is all about, before "driving seven seas". The film starts somewhat slowly to work out the story because most of the documentaries do, but because it pulls the viewer into hurt, the emotions begin to percolate with their head! Emotions include anger, sadness and unbelief. Time: at the end of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> It's not surprising that the solo rides around the world. Surprisingly, the viewers don't wait. This is not your average group of boys in a sailing competition! Each boat was different according to race rules. Every solo sailor had different qualities allowed in the competition rules. Among them were well-known sailors and some of them were not so well-known. One was considered a mysterious person because no one knew their ability at all. Every boat was allowed to leave as long as everything was going on for a certain time. And that was, of course, before modern electronics, which allowed boaters to communicate on the shores because of notorious storms and the like. <br /> <br /> Actual video and audio recordings are mixed with family members and other involved interviews. The mood of the interviewees has always passed despite the past years. <br /> <br /> The main character, Don, is the center of attention and how his journey is related to those who not only wanted him but because of the circumstances of his creation he won HAD. He had to win. The story was what this fact made for his life when he spent the decade alone on the Atlantic. <br /> <br /> DON'T watch the "special features" section of the DVD when the movie is ready. The whole saga is not fully understood when looking at bonus things. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you've watched everything on a DVD, you'll probably shake your head and shout, "wow." And remember that this is the reason why the story has survived over the last 40 years. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: DO NOT check the "special features" section of DVD after the end of the movie. One sailor who went back to England after moving around the world decided to fly, no, he went to another spin and the film recorded his wife's opinion on that decision. The opposite story comes up when another sailor wants the board to have two on board so that he can take his wife and their photos show a very warm joining between them. An interview with a former paratrooper who had actually sailed in front of a friend of the Atlantic before traveling on a solo was incredibly funny when he described that he did not even know how to ride and who thought that the bad things that had happened to him were "normal". Too many people think that sailing on the high seas can be a romantic adventure without an accident. Don't you be one!
