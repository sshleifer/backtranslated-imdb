This movie was different. He took a kind of typical thriller story and got a more interesting, in-depth look to see the individual character struggle with faith. Of course, it helped Andrew McCarthy's main performance to be quite excellent. Other performances were also quite interesting, though not as consistent. The end result was a little let down, but there were many good moments. The filmmakers tried something else here - they didn't just go to the obvious cold colors and intimidation. It's a dark film (not for everyone), but if you want to be entertaining and not talk, try it.
