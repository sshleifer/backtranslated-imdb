It's a movie that can give you a nightmare, but it's a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Hardware wars are the only good attacks on Star Wars, other films like Spaceballs have failed. This is the only good scam movie I've ever seen, it doesn't hang from Star Wars, it makes it fun and that's what spoofs should be.
