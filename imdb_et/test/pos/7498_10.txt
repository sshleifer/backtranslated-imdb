For those who are not familiar with Paddy Chayefsky, this is a very good introduction. Although Chayefsky is dealing with the reality of several myths of things, including medicine, this work is surprisingly prophetic about how the drug goes today, two decades after the film was made and over ten years after his death. In addition, the film also has "some perceptions of Chayefsky's life in general". The 20th century can be the first and last century of the United States in world history. If it turns out that the contribution of the United States art was the film's dimension, this is the best example of this art.
