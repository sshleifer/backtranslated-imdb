I hate movies about sports. I think the pre-made Hollywood sports film is a bit difficult to swallow for me, because it follows the most unique ideas every year, which I am trying to say that there is not much creativity in this genre. Use the exhibition "A"? "Game Plan" if you want to prove it. So, not to mention, I was hesitant to watch this documentary because of the theme of sport, but at the same time I couldn't wait because I love to surf documentaries like "Step to Liquid" and "Billabong Odyssey". I took a step, came into the unknown, and frankly I was not happy at first. I didn't like the direction, the people, or the style that the film involved in introducing these young sportsmen. At my first look, I thought that history could not be completely saved, so I thought Stacy Peralta split the equipped film with the faux actors who had been working since the late 1970s. The music was intense, well suited. Peralta had recorded this generation for fun, but the visions were nothing but stimulating. Elongated scenes, based on amazing music, simply supported attention and too long. I wanted to get to know the pioneers, not just to watch them in an empty pool in ten minutes. I wanted a combination of who these children were, where they went during the rising of celebrities and where they are now. It seemed like I was looking at the high score of the birth of our people that the settlers were just driving their boats all day. I wanted to know behind myths behind myths. <br /> <br /> Then, thinking I had another negative rating under my belt, I watched the movie again with a commentary from Peralta. Her passion, her voice, people's knowledge, and what she had to do to get this movie, got me "wow". It suddenly turned into a movie I wanted to see. Peralta tells us more about where these kids are today, what they're doing, and how hard it was to put them in a camera. He didn't see many of them in 20 years, so hearing these challenges brought the human element back to the surface. He was sincere; he was compassionate, but he showed so much commitment to this project. Although I disagree with everything he decided to do (i.e., Sean Penni's confusion is not PUNK ROCK), he revived this movie for me. Because of this comment, I rated this movie much higher than originally thought. <br /> <br /> Jay Adams. Tony Alva. Jeff Ho. Peggy Oki. Wentzle Ruml. These are just a few of the names that need to be mentioned and constantly praised when skateboarding continues the fast growing trend now. Although Tony Hawk's name sells products, these boys are the lightweight sidewalks that defined the whole sport. Of course, others probably did it in the Stone Age, but these guys did it with style, grace and moved to the next level. It was a hobby for them, but it also drew them in the direction that I believe none of them were ready. "Dogtown and Z-Boys" is the story of evolution, being in the right place at the right time, living in a generation without a television to keep us planted and friendship. Over the years, we have seen so many stories that show the progress of humanity, and that is definitely the story to add to it. I can't say I loved this movie or myself, but it should be a normal viewing for anyone who learns or wants to experience skateboarding track growth. It was sad, it was emotional, and these guys are not multi-millionaires again? they are people who have passion, and you rarely see it in a documentary. <br /> <br /> Generally, I can't watch this movie again, but I recommend it to friends and family from time to time. I think the fall of this movie was filming for me? Attempts to be a style avant-garde that eventually pulled away from characters and events. As mentioned above, there were some elements that drew too much, which kept us a little time to find out where these men were. Peralta probably had a passion for this sport, against the people, but he seemed to be uneven at times. The music was intense and worked great with the film. Sean Penn, though he was sound with his voice, wasn't necessary at all. They could spend the money elsewhere. In the case of a positive image, the audio commentary saves everything that a normal film lacked. Peralta's voice in Penn's brings a stronger human element to the scene, while he tells us better stories about people, places and events. Watch this movie, but don't wait for it to blow. Listen to the audio commentary; I think you will be impressed. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** Â½ *****
