Great work. Wonderful actors dissolve as brave and courageous characters. All unforgettable parts in more intriguing and busy activities. Casting is perfect. Both letters are for example: Armand Asante, Bernhardt, Kier, Denier. But also for new faces. I was very impressed by the young actress who is playing the gang of the boy - Mustafa. You trust each gang of Turkey. Michael Barral and all the followers of the white authorities are very convincing. I admire the music winning the main theme "Children wax" .This audio track is a charming blend of Turkish, hard rock and Udo Kier's moves? At the same time, the children of the wax talk about a story that focuses on racial conflicts. Intolerance and cruelty of skinheads and Turks.
