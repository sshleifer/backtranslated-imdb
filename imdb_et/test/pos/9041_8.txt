No film can ever justify the use of English for Faulkner. but they did a good job here. Lucas Beauchamp is exactly as I saw him in the book, like Chick. What the film didn't really do was how Beauchamp didn't like the negro people because he was just as stubborn. Not that it is a bad thing, but from my book, which was his attitude to the world (but I got the feeling that it was the racism of the white society that started it and it went over to the negro society until it became his attitude towards everyone) <br The best part of the movie is that you see Yoknapatawpha County (actually Oxford, Mississippi) exactly as Faulkner wrote about it (the film was made when Faulkner was alive and writing). It doesn't look so different today. Because of this, watching a movie is worth it because it is filmed in the backyard of Faulkner. Faulkner fans must be true.
