This particular film was what I wanted to see in theaters, but never to that. When I finally rented it in the summer of 2001, I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought the DVD shortly afterwards. Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake did a great job with the scenario and are great to listen to the audio commentary on the DVD. They did a great job of creating the characters you really care about. I really felt the whirl of emotions watching this movie, including sadness, anxiety and joy. The film also does an excellent job of showing the importance of the family (the rarity of today's film), which reflects the director Bonnie Hunt on the comments made on the DVD. David Duchovny showed me here that Fox Mulder has a life that gives some pretty scenes with a great performance. I suggest you watch this movie. I'm really grateful to the creators of this movie. They have given me a great movie to watch, which I recommend to all my friends. I have seen many films over the years and it is very rare that after watching the film I feel such satisfaction. I look at it over and over again for years. Back to me reminds me that there are still movers who know how to sincerely like their movie to the audience. Thanks!
