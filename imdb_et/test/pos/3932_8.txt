I saw a hidden preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast! After enjoying the top of BOOGEYMAN (Horrible! 3/10) and Amityville remake (so-so 6/10), I enjoyed this much more! As you can see on the trailer, there was one knock that I believed the whole city could be forgotten, but it's a cheerful movie of popcorn, so I agree with what it is. <br /> <br /> My only big complaint was whether I expected Paris Hilton to touch the wax or to go close and like "it's hot", but they didn't do it (how would they get it ???). <br /> <br /> 2 girls, although Paris sees his lingerie well! I am surprised that they did not put the third "hot token victim" of the film on some useless nudity that is normal for this type of flick! I do not read any spoiler of a death or plot, but I say that both of them can make good Paris and Eliza! The characters have developed properly and are somewhat pleasing (not like Cabin Fever, where you wanted to die), and the movie has a decent pace, though nothing happens in the first 30 minutes like most horror movies. br /> <br /> I give it 8/10 because it gave good fears and gore and I had low expectations in it. When you go with your friends, like cheerful horror movies, you have a good time. <br /> <br /> Noah
