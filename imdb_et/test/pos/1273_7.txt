If Christopher Nolan was Memento before the next, all of the following mistakes would have been corrected. Mementos built the Nolan switches on time. We can say when it was past, if it is now, etc. But Nolan tried it a little and it just doesn't work. Although he had a small budget and couldn't use the color (which is one way Memento worked), it was just too difficult to distinguish the time. The DVD has a feature that allows you to play scenes in chronological order. I wanted to see my review after that so hopefully it would make sense, but of course it didn't work. <br /> <br /> You can't blame Nolan for not coming up with original ideas. The young man, Bill (Jeremy Theobald), is bored so he decides to follow random people on the street. She finds one, Cobb (Alex Haw), who is very interested in her. Soon Bill will make friends with Cobb and go with him when he breaks into the houses and robs them. Then the bright young blonde (Lucy Russell) enters and the film gets tougher. <br /> <br /> The next ending is one of the most shocking end I've seen. Of course, the fighting club had an amazing end, but the way the Next ended was amazing. I felt that someone would have blown me off and gave me a clench. Nolan has a thing to do for good (maybe not, I might think Insomnia is away from the mile) and can really create a big story. The following may not be the easiest to watch or watch, but it is such a finely designed, original story that has a shocking end that you probably want to watch all 70 minutes again. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> R and R violence.
