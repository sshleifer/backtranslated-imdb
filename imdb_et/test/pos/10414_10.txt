This exhibition must be my favorite 80s horror TV show. Like exhibitions by Darkside, including the same creators, this exhibition is a rare gem. If you agree with me, please sign the petition I started to get a word for the monsters and get it out on the DVD. Here's the address of the statement: www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html Some of my favorite episodes should be Glim glim and Rain Dance. I loved the opening intro with the monster. It made me out! One thing I have to add to DVD creators would be an organ sound that would be heard just before the commercial break. I do not know if any of you remember this part, but this is one of the main things to remember. I mean, come on! The World War has already appeared on the TV in the TV series, so I say monsters and also Tales from the Darkside, and on Friday the 13th series should also be released! We fans have to talk about our thoughts! We need this fantastic show on DVD so PLEASE download word !!!
