This is typically a rapidly developing entertainment film from the early 1930s. If you have a leading James Cagney, these "pre-code" movies are even better: just look at fun things. Usually, when the movies are dated, it's negative, but not so 1930-1934. Yes, for slang and attitudes, dress, hairstyles, etc., they are dated, but it's a lot of fun. These films have an edge in front of them that is almost always fun to watch. <br /> <br /> They also have a crown that is appealing and exciting. You see people - like the juvenile offenders in this movie and their funny parents - that you don't see it in any period, but at the beginning of the 30s. At the beginning of this film, the children go to the judge and you sit and laugh at those crazy characters that appear in court on behalf of your children, one after the other. Yes, we get the stereotypical father of emotional Italy; Jewish father; Anglo-Saxon mother and some other mothers who are all in dramatic form claim to be a good boy. Even if things are predictable in some cases, you won't mind because everything here is so fun to watch. <br /> <br /> It also teaches that children were beaten, stealing, robbing, looting, lying - 75 years ago - hey, this is a human condition. This film tells the theory that "people were more modest in older times." No, people have always been rotten or good. The degree was helped by their environment, parents, financial situation and other things. Here we have a number of "Dead End" children who finish their reform school. <br /> <br /> A ridiculous and stupidly liberal story is for children who act as angels immediately when they show it at the reform school; it is not the slightest punishment for a person to die and set up a fire (explanation: he was thoughtless and deserves. So much for true justice and reform). and "Patsy" captures a man who has never been questioned by the police because he is a good man! Notice the subtle religious excavation, where the only man who has seen the prayer is the evil "guard". It is no accident, not an accident. This kind of negative affair has been going on since the Hays code was conserved in the late 60s and was seen, as you hear, in the early 30s. <br /> <br /> Dudley By the way, the trenches are outstanding in the role of Mr. Thomson's "bad guy". Especially his voice was very effective and he could have imagined him playing one of these similarly vicious roles as the head of the institutions in adapting Charles Dickens' film. Cagney played his usual role, sweetheart, who gets a nice girl, Dorothy Griffith, played by Madge Blake. Frankie Darro was also the boys' leader Jimmy Smith. Only the look of Darro's face made his character credible. One thing he was the real star of the movie, but I'm still going with Cagney. The rest of the reform school children were not too credible and they were really ethnic stereotypes, but everyone was nice to watch. we saw how bad these children were and witnessed good and bad and stereotypical parents in court after the arrest of children. These scenes are pure 1930s Dead End Kids stuff. They always showed that the children are bad news at the beginning of the movie, but by the time the story was over, they all saw that they were acting more like Wally and Beaver Cleaver - hardly hard "criminals". It is very far removed, but it works, entertaining. <br /> <br /> In general, Cagney is a movie and an early 30s typical, but very fun movie. Almost all of them appreciate the value of entertainment for at least eight stars.
