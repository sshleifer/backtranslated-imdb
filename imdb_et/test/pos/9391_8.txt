"Death Bed: The Food That Eats" is a very strange horror film that you really need to believe. There is an old four-floor bed that just loves people to eat and it does it anytime it can lie to someone There's a long dead artist who has been imprisoned behind one of his paintings, who gives a story over the voices. Gorgeous Barry's first and only film offers some truly surreal moments, such as a bed that absorbs its victims into the mysterious yellow foam and the sea of ​​liquid. The atmosphere is dreaming and there is only a little gore, unfortunately the assumption is quite silly and the actor is amateurish. As a fan of unusual cinema, I enjoyed it with a little budget. option.8 out of 10.
