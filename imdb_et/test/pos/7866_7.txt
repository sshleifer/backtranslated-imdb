Another well-done moral ambiguity, where the anti-hero is difficult to decide who to root. <br /> <br /> If anything else, "The Beguiled" did not silence anyone who said that there are no good actors in the movies at least in 1971. In this film, there were four great parts for the actors and everything was well cast and well done. <br /> <br /> Pamelyn Ferdin did a good job for Amy and continues to play Wanda in June. It had to be the first time an adult male office star shared a twelve-year-old girl's extended kiss with the camera, wondering if there were many contradictions at that time. It was probably Polanski's favorite scene. Considering the fate of the Amy turtle "Randolph", it is not surprising that Ferdin grew into an animal rights activist. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page was also great, playing a sophisticated character with just the right security system. Interestingly, he died only three days after Elizabeth Hartman committed suicide (throwing himself through the fifth floor window) because they had worked together "You're a big boy now". <br /> <br /> Hartman (who looks like he could be Blair Brown's sister) was great as Edwina and he should have got an Oscar (no other show was even close to this year), but given what Now we know about him, not knowing how much his report was studied and how much it came from. Edwina shows such a raw pain that is hard to look at. Like Marilyn Monroe's incredible "The Misfits" performance, the viewer will probably see all his own demon he plays. <br /> <br /> Finally, Jo Ann Harris is an amazingly perfect flirty Carol. For my money, Harris was the sexiest actor of the 1970s, combining sensuality with intelligence and humor. He was the best reason to watch "Most Wanted" TV channels and the only reason to watch "Wild Wild West Revisited". It is hard to believe that anyone who can bring everything that was on the screen never became a big star.
