I grew up in Baltimore, so I was in contact with John Waters movies because I was too young to watch them. And if you know that John Waters is limited to Hairspray or Cry-Baby or other family-friendly movies, you must prepare yourself for pink Flamingo. <br /> <br /> An explicit sex act, incest, old lady who doesn't eat anything but eggs, and unusual deeds with chickens are just some of this movie. The movie ends with Divine, Waters' 300 pounds. eating a cross-sectional star in the dog's stools. <br /> <br /> The assumption is about two families: one pair of inbred trailer trash bin containing the divine and Edith Massey egg lady; and the other is a rich, swinging couple. Both families compete for the title of "Filthiest Man in Life". Enjoy John Waters' best movie, but see it only if you're an open minded person with a strong stomach because some of the scenes in this movie will give you a great look.
