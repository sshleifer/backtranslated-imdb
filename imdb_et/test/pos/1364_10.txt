Believe me when I say this show is just fun. The main story is Kintaro Oe, who travels from city to city, part-time jobs, women and everything she can learn about life. Kintaro must be one of the simplest signs ever made. She takes everything extreme and laughs every time. From her constant endless endeavor to life, to the small things she instantly strikes on life or death. <br /> <br /> One of the funniest things about this show is simply Kintaro's constant expressions and reactions. He spends a lot of time in various super deformed modes like Dragon Half or Trigun. At other times in less than 0.1 seconds, his face sees not only serious but also manga-fighter's life or death expressions such as a weight lift that tries to push a new record. This is fun. <br /> <br /> If that's not enough, writing is great and English can't be better. Kintaro's English VA is just perfect and starts to move around when he doesn't even say anything. One thing to mention is, without a doubt, the Ecchi series. It defines the word practically. If you are an adult anime fan who can laugh at movies like American Pie, you love it. <br /> <br /> - Rirath_com
