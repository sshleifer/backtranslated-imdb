One of the best films I watched ... A good script, an original plot man who has been haunted by JFK's murder when he was assigned to protect him from cold on November 1963. Thirty years later, another social enemy wants to murder the current president. The secret agent loses his partner along the way, to the crazy forces that are scheming, lying, and murdering someone on his way to the road. <br /> <br /> The film comes with a remarkable memorable result and restrained, but meaningful romance between Russo and Eastwood .... which shows how hard a romantic life is in such work. Malchovich is great, confident that many other candidates could have played the role he played, but how many could have acted in such an approach and intellect what he showed in the film? <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I thought it was a great movie ... every time it is on TV, I have to watch it ... and I own it on a DVD! I'm a big Eastwood fan, it just increased his already fabulous career and Malchovich's best role so far! <br /> <br />
