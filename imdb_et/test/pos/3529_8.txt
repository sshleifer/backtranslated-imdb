One of the many horrors of horrors that appeared in the early eighties, and fortunately this is one of the best. Yes, it has a cheesy plot, but I was pleasantly surprised by this movie because I thought it was really good and fun, though the killer might have been a little more scary than he just looked like a fat butterfly. br /> First of all, we have a local sheriff or whatever it is hell who warns them not to go to these mountains because they are very dangerous. But when the teenagers arrive, it doesn't seem dangerous at all, I still do well. It's a shame that we don't get such movies anymore, and when we do, it's usually a boring terrible movie. <br /> <br /> This movie depends more on tension and fright than gore, because the gore factor in this movie is really low, which I was not happy with, but not because it is still a great movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, you have to look for a long and hard time to find this movie and if you find it, you like it and see that it ends with the final girl and the killer, that's not what you would expect.
