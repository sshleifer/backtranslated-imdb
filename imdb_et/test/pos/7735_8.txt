Paul Mazursky Tempest - An interesting, strange, and strange movie about the midst of a living crisis. She is accompanied by her daughter (Molly Ringwald) and salon singer (Susan Sarandon). A beautiful 25-year movie on DVD, but without extras - not even a theater trailer. The times of great terrain and sharp dialogue make this 2 and a half hour movie an interesting trip. Good drama mixed with comedy and tension and close. This latest DVD edition is worth renting. B +
