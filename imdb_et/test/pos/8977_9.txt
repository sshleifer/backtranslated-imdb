After abandoning Aaron Sorkin's writing and production, I abandoned "The West Wing". It was not just the same. Imagine my excitement in seeing the movie he wrote again. It's been a long time - American President, some good men. His script was a mixture of beautiful humor and tragedy. He made an incredible story and made me cry at the same time. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks was an incredible time for Texas Congressman, whose voters wanted only lower taxes and keep their weapons. Not hard work, so he had a lot of time to fool - and he did it. His office staff saw him as being in Playboy Manor. As he said, "You can teach them to write, but you cannot teach them to grow." Despite their sexist attitude that fits directly into the Texas Congress, they were fiercely loyal, especially his aide Amy Adams (Junebug & Former Hooters Girl). <br /> <br /> Now, add a rich Texas society that wants something that Julia Roberts played perfectly in Afghanistan; and a pain-in-boss's-ass CIA agent, perfectly made by Philip Seymour Hoffman, and you are worth watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Outstanding writing and superb behavior and the necessary story to tell. What more do you want in the movies?
