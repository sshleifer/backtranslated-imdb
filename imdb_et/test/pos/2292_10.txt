I agree with the above, it's so funny that I understand it all, but my friends just don't get it. Go to Japan and see another movie after staying there. When I met my girlfriend at the father's home in Kanagawa. I swear I felt like Jack. scared, but by the end of the day it was all good, so I'll give it to 10 10. <br /> <br /> I watched it at least 30 times, taking it with a plane to fly to Japan next month. One thing that is real is the scenes of ball games. I think I'm back there. It's black if you have an interest in Japanese and baseball. Too bad they do not follow. Does anyone know where the scene of the temple was filmed and the argument on the pavement with the roof? we need to know that I can win the Japanese ex-wife argument. thanks
