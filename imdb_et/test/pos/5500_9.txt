"In the Fire of Fire" is one of those Hollywood films that show up quite a bit on television, but even though I've seen it a couple of times, I usually go through the whole thing. Why? - This is good! Clint Eastwood is nice, as usual, and his character is more interesting and accurate than usual. The person, secret service agent Frank Horrigan, is haunted by the fact that he was in a detail that was unable to defend President Kennedy in Dallas, and now he is forced to match his professional assassin who publicly declares that he is killing the president. But the film does not make him depressed, polished and obsessed. She is charming and friendly and is realistic as a person who is experienced in life and comfortable in her skin. He is even quite convincing when he flirts with a rather younger representative, played by Rene Russo. The killer, played by John Malkovich at his best, is the brain, deliberate and enjoys playing high on life and death. He even goes by the name of another president's assassin, John Booth. <br /> <br /> The movie is consistently enjoyable and it provides all the goods - intercourse, action, romance and drama - all in the right amount. It's a fun movie that's really helped by its big actors!
