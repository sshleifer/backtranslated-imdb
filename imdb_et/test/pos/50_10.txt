Fantastically written, acted and produced! The beloved vision of this shiny, talented lottery - each of them - gives such high performance. This film heavily warmed my toes! Great storytelling! <br /> <br /> This is a great movie for the Black History month. Perfect representation of recent history and very real characters who were amazed at the incredible pain - with dignity and faith for a better future. It's so easy to see how these different adults all influenced this baby and contributed to the fruitful imagination that would eventually boost her adult talent. Next time you are in the Hearing Center, remember; show or he may be a writer-in-the-making!
