The movie was very good when it came out, I went to the Cooley High and Cooley Upper Center, around 1968 I was home to a queen and grew up and lived in the Cabrini Green area, I felt a lot of people in the movie, it was nice to see friends in the movie that lived in this area, and had the opportunity to be a star, perhaps a lifetime experience, I had a good time to grow north and the harsh times I can associate with Cooley High are no longer standing, but man like me and others still remember the fun we've been experiencing in Cooley High, a lot of history around this northern region.
