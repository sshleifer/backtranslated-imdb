*** Includes spoiler *** <br /> <br /> Cute movie starring Brad Renfro and always a wonderful Joseph Mazzello. I like Joseph Mazzello, all of the films I've seen so far, I have loved them all for different reasons and Cure is no different. Brad Renfro is doing the movie well. Cure is a drama / age movie for the sick child and his friend. The basic idea is: Dexter (Joseph Mazzello) is AIDS. He becomes a friend to a neighboring country (Brad Renfro), but Erik's mother is very narrow, poorly informed and somewhat thick with Dexter's disease. He thinks AIDS is contagious like ordinary cold, so he doesn't want his son to go near Dexter. <br /> <br /> After several attempts to make your treatment a success, the boys will go to New Orleans to find a cure after reading this leaflet. After the Playboy newspaper hit, Dexter's health will soon go south and, among his health inspectors, the boy with Erik is still enough to make two breaths to pretend to breathe. Unfortunately, bad Dexter dies because of his illness, leaving the poor Erik behind to think about why he couldn't cure. Throughout the film, he joins Dexter with his mother more than his own. <br /> <br /> This is a very affectionate movie to watch and is not absolutely perfect (movies rarely), but you don't care less about it than you are in the movie. July for fans of Joseph Mazzello, one of his best performances. Very good recommended movie - if you find a copy :)
