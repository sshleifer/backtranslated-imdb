Viva Variety was a unique hybrid program that was both a parody of the programs represented and a tribute to it. <br /> <br /> This was the most direct model of the classic favorite of The 1970s, The Sonny & Cher Show, where Thomas Lennon and Kerri Kenney played a split show biz couple who were somehow forced to host the program, a couple of women hugging a persistent obstacle to male and "offensive humor" to a couple, plus a figure of comedy bits and performances of what is described as "specialty" action! <br /> <br /> "Hybrid" was a combination of facts and fantasy. Of course, there was no "Mr and Mrs. Laupine" and the announcer of the program, Johnny Bluejeans, was equally fancy. But all the actions that were done were certainly real and some were even fun! But there were some deeds that would probably have been better suited to the old Chuck Barris' Gong show. <br /> <br /> The exhibition itself was indeed an expanded scheme of "SCTV" (which ended in the MTV series "Country") and some suggested that it would have been better than five minutes in a mix of programs like a stand alone series . But "Viva Variety" should definitely get higher marks for original concepts, and although it was often more fun than funny, it was definitely useful, especially when they travel to Las Vegas and even brought out glutzers. It is unlikely that we will see anything like this on television.
