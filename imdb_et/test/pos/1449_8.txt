I've never been so surprised at the movie that was old. Only "Sierra Madre's Treasure" keeps it well, efficiently. Like someone who has seen heroin addiction for the first time, I was shocked by the realism of this film. Frank Sinatra's performance is completely uncompromising, realistic, and heartbreaking. The direction of Otto Preminger is ideal for the film, with long shots and a very mobile camera. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak's performance is good, as is Eleanor Parker. In fact, the entire supportive mold works very well, with underrated performances that match the style of this film. Documentary style is part of what updates this movie. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 8.0 out of 10
