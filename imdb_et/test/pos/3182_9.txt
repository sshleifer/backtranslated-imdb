It was such a large line for the Black at that time. We loved it so much. This was the only example of black middle-class families, t.v. at that time. Please release it on DVD. I know a lot ... a lot of people who are still talking. When it gets free, I'm sure many black young people will find it enlightening and interesting. The exhibition covered many topics of racism, racial discrimination, teenage pregnancy, brotherly rivalry, single parents, peer pressure, and more. The show came to a halt, and remained silent for the fans and wondered why it was taken off the air. Since then, we have seen only a few actors and actors. Please release it on DVD ASAP.
