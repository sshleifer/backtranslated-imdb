Always one year after the Soviet resignation from Afghanistan, the topic was fresh, directed by the director and the audience. Most cast is back from wars and soldiers. The Soviet army did little co-operation during filming, which is strange. <br /> <br /> Afghan intervention was a bloody and pointless war in which even generals had forgotten the causes of bloodshed. This film shows the tension and cruelty of military life, the emotional atrophy experienced by troops, and the pain of a small nation crushed by wars and civil war. <br /> <br /> The lack of powerful scenes. The first is materials made of steel coffins that are loaded for transport to the USSR. The soles go to work, while the officer quietly removes destinations: Moscow, Rostov, Donetsk, Balti. <br /> <br /> An earlier comment describes the latest scenario that Mrs. Bandura is illogical. It is perfectly logical and in the spirit of the film: the only human relationship Bandura maintained with the Afghan family, which he killed in an attack by mistake. By losing his only buffer against the futility of war, Bandura returns his child (and his weapon) to his fate. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the latest scene: MI's flock. 28s rise over the mountains as a pilot's voice: "Uhodim! Uhodim rebyata! (We are leaving! Boys, we leave!) In the tone of sincere relief. <br /> <br /> Afhanskii Izlom is a great movie - cruelly honest and as uneven as they are comes.
