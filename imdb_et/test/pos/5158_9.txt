Roy Anderson's movie "You, Life" consists of fifty strange sketches, pictures and vignettes set in a Swedish city. Some characters are only on the screen for a few seconds, while others appear in many scenes, sometimes seen in the background, while the other story appears. Many scenes are derived from the dreams, nightmares and fantasies of strange but incredible characters living in this world. This is an exciting approach: each scene could be enjoyed in isolation, but together they contain a vigorous portrait of what one must have. <br /> <br /> In the first half hour, "You, Life" is brilliantly funny. Much of humor focuses on brass band members whose music practice encourages neighbors in their apartment building. However, the comic highlight is a dinner party that is terribly frightening. After this fun introduction, the film's mood will darken considerably. The dream of a dinner party becomes bleak when an unhappy main character is brought to court for his life, confusing and absurd for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> In the following scenes, the characters will become increasingly clear. These are a world where people cannot communicate with each other, where they talk about dreams, nightmares and fantasies are widespread, but where no one can be comforting, even when others come to help them. The undisturbed woman who does not love anyone abides and the young girl, whose love for rock guitarist Micke is, is archetypal. <br /> <br /> The world of you, Life, is also disappointed with selfishness. An elderly professor is called to take the heat of a huge banquet to answer his phone call by a hesitant son of money; thief steals a ruthless executive in a purse; The arrogant and impatient businessman offends the Muslim hairdresser and gets his fire. At the most striking moment of the film, one church writes a long list of sins of the church when its fellow members are confused at a forced time. <br /> <br /> But for all the dark moments of this movie, compassion "tomorrow is the second day" indicates the ability of people to live, despite many suffering. The soundtrack offered by Benny Anderson (fame of ABBA) seems at first glance unfair, but becomes more and more meaningful as the film realizes its human capacity to survive. <br /> <br /> 'You, alive' is an extraordinary visual style. The same washed, light green colors are repeated, and there is a shadow in the shade; it makes the characters extremely bad and creates the feeling that human life is being studied. Almost every scene is captured with a static camera frame, as if they were photographs that are revived. Few cases where the camera is moving are extraordinary; The contrast between the life and movement of large banquets is an amazing contrast to the death of the wardrobe scene. In the most intense moments of longing and despair, do characters carry the viewer directly to the camera? they know they are being researched and have a few moments to cast their hearts on us, the viewers. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful human film.
