It may be a stretch that says it's a hard hard Carlin fan, but the material that is written and made to be in Bad Bad for Ya is another of the finest materials of the late era. In the 1970s, Carlin bounces back from despair (and some self-destructive actions) that are worth living, losing to a special, firmly structured but loose and playful - or as much as an "old f ***" can and is constantly , endlessly, funny. And funny when you remember what some of us were doing when he first looked back or "sick". The material, even if it sometimes sounds like shades of the past (ie all children in the school and camp, such as a sick children's segment), is always fresh and full of the truth that it thinks. while (here goes) funny bone tearing. <br /> <br /> Subject to death (how long to wait for the name to be deleted from the book? six weeks unless the computer planner), aspects of communication, looking down from the sky, the patches of God (of course), kids and just cumbersome gestures that cover hats in religion and when people really have "rights" make up a large part of the special, focusing on the assumption that what is bad for you, simple and simple, is BS. Totally, a complete BS, as we learn (or if you have actually learned it, is like a child waiting in the corner of the street a week after the parent did not fall off quite casually), keeps the country together. Carlin may not be angry, though, even if disdain seems to be rising the most, even though the terrible teeth of children come. This is skepticism, which is because everything is not "good". <br /> <br /> What it is is: Carlin is a dirty, witty, cautious stand-up comedy given by Yoda to Jedi everywhere, a little hope of crystal-clear wisdom in a world where it's pretty damn hard to get. At least, we get classic GC - outrageous lines and bits of a man's 13th (or 14th) comedy, including an eyebrow raising observation for people who play Mozart's music at birth!
