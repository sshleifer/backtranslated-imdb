This is a great documentary story I never heard before. The first solo, non-stop sailing around the world took place between 1968 and 1969, accompanied by a handful of competitors. This is a really exciting story about man and nature and man vs. The story focuses on the tragic figure of this story, Donald Crowhurst. The film combines elegantly with interviews with the films that the sailors themselves photographed on their boats. The story is very embarrassing and sad when we learn the details behind Donald Crowhurst's history. This is one of the best documentaries of recent years. It has a real human emotion because men face the almost impossible tasks of navigating their own world.
