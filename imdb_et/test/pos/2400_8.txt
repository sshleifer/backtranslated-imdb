From the beginning to the end, this film has great performances, an excellent soundtrack with original music Douglas Brown and an amazing scenario full of surprises. <br /> <br /> It's full of new and not new faces. The film is presented by promising talents, especially for Craig Morris, who plays the main character Eddie Monroe. Morris, who also wrote the script, shows quiet power with strong emotional performance as he creates a credible feature on the screen. Pauli Vario, who plays really warm, playing Paul Vario, was so convinced that he was hungry when he lovingly made his Italian sauce. <br /> <br /> Big new faces, great new music and a great new story - what more could you ask. This movie is highly recommended!
