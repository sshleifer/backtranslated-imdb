"Oppenheimer", along with Sam Waterston's title role and David Suchet, as Evard Teller, is an example of docudramas for his best. Well-written, well-acted actors with plausible resemblance to their historical characters are very informative and very fun. The designs and costumes confirm the US lesson during World War II, and drawing and dialogue make the viewer feel like he is really excited about the Los Alamos and Manhattan project. The only downside is that it is British production and some participants lack the ability to influence a convincing American accent. (Today's Skills Australian and Irish Actresses Accepting Foreign Language Dialects are Amazing.) The story is fully in line with Richard Rhodes' final nuclear bomb development history. Unfortunately, the mini-series was only shown a few times in the early 1980s on PBS, and it probably disappeared into oblivion. <br /> <br /> "Oppenheimer" compares the newer "Fat Man & Little Boy's feature film with Paul Newman, like Leslie Groves (a chronically overweight and quite domestic general, would have been profoundly attracted), and Dwight Schultz (the customer of A-Team) as Oppenheimer. The Mini Series is the Oppenheimer about 4 times longer than the Newman feature, but takes advantage of all the extra time for its advantage.
