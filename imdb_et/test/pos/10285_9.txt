In this intense and characteristic romantic tragicomedy, we are given an overview of four successive Parisian spiritual lives. In the middle is Vinz Casselli's idea of ​​Max. Remarkable Romeo, he falls from head to head for a beautiful alien Lisa (Bellucci). Encouraging his best friend, Lucien (Écoffey, in undervalued but effective performance), he wins his heart and they live happily ever after ... it's up to the schematic, neurotic and obsessive Alice (versatile Romane Bohringer) very involved in the other three lives and in love. <br /> <br /> The rich plot is thickened with curious chronological confusion, and the film appears as a complex mosaic of Paris-picture-postcard eye-candy. at its heart. The use of color will not go unnoticed, especially in the Add-on Apartment (probably captured by the title of the movie), where red and yellow will trigger a passion and a craving for fire. <br /> <br /> Audience can be related to Max: he really carries his heart on his sleeve and constantly punishes for and against irony. In one memorable scene, our fateful lovers (leaving the choreographed misunderstood) are narrowly missed by the occasional competition that would definitely reunite them. Regardless of each other, they travel to the same destination: in the subway, in the taxi, practically tête-à-tête. At the same time, the fate seems to them and the audience is fascinated by the temptation. <br /> <br /> The performances of this movie are really l'Appartementi. I still don't understand why Vincent Cassell is not a big star outside of France. It has existence and diversity. Monica Bellucci (at the time of writing Casselli's actual husband) has recently found fame in the Anglofon film industry, but perhaps for the wrong reasons - true, she is divinely beautiful, but behind it is a talented actor who can dominate the scene in the classic "leader-lady" style many British and American actors reject a too simple "fine" approach. <br /> <br /> All movies watch it! I doubt you're disappointed. It is thrilling, satisfying, amusing, sad, proud, and a lesson in artistic filmmaking.
