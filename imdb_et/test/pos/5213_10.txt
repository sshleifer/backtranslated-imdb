The only reason I decided to watch this movie is the deep action of Alyson Haywood, Bad Money, 99, Gary Cole (Dave), Cry Wolf. '05, who is a great war hero and has all sorts of ways to make money and never seems to talk to LIES. Alyson and Dave are trying to restore the old home and restore its comfortable living conditions. The relationship becomes cumbersome and Alyson decides to find out what's going on and the plot becomes very mysterious. If you're a great fan of Karen Sill, it's your movie. I just want Karen to appear more in movies, I miss her great talents.
