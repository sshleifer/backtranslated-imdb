If Family Guy insults you or you just don't get humor, this song will unfortunately show you and the masses of the most religious, boring, and politically correct people in America. Put your morals aside and enjoy this exhibition. FG is a fun mind-opener for today's society. Who said that this exhibition is for a young immature audience is very wrong. All the references to old films and politics 10-80 years ago I couldn't imagine this young immature boy being funny. Family Guy is definitely a mature open-minded audience who is not afraid to criticize American society. Hats for Seth and the whole team who could show it.
