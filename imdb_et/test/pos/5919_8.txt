This film restores Lindbergh's historic airplane across the Atlantic, while touching on the episodes of its aviation career. Stewart was about 20 years old to play a young man, but his fine performance, especially in the order of solo flights, makes it small. Waxman's brisk result is a big plus. In spite of the long working hours, Wilder can do it quite exciting and can keep the drama even though the result is known. The year 1957 was for Wilder: besides, he wrote "Love in the afternoon" and "Prosecutor's Office". And his two were "Some like this hot" and "Apartment". What's up!
