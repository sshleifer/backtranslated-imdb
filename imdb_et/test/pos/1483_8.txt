Never in my family was anyone (who didn't say who is for personal reasons) who thinks that Mr. Bean is always so stupid as he makes a comedy page. Imagine how I felt at that time. At times it is shocked. <br /> <br /> There are more reasons why I love Mr Beani. Being one of those earlier local TVs in this country, where I first looked, this is just one of those things that had stuck with my head. It was even once my friends and I talked about a few selected episodes and we just laughed together. <br /> <br /> It is always silly, funny and fun, no matter what Rowan Atkinson does when Mr Bean does every episode. Although this may have shown some repetitions lately, he was never able to bring back my childhood memories. In fact, I can dare say that this is the first exhibition to introduce me to exhibitions coming out of the UK when I grew up. <br /> <br /> Comedy Series ... definitely really bad, as the British can say.
