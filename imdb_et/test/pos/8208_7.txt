I got this movie according to a friend's suggestion. I think computers are generally very fast - that's why the 1995 identity theft cannot see the film invisible. I had bad echoes about it, but at last I was not so disappointed: the story, though classic, is kind of interesting and must really be back on the days when it appeared in theaters. I was delighted to be surprised to think that, contrary to what we usually see, computer activities are somehow realistic because they use Windows 3.x and conventional computers. Storytelling is median and does not disturb the viewer. The end is usually American. Actress performance worldwide OK, Sandra Bullock usually disturbs me with her "oh god, why me" way to behave, but this time she seems to have controlled her. I recommend this movie.
