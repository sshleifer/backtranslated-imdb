This movie "haunts me" because I saw it when I was about 8 years old. I didn't know what it was called, so I'm so glad to finally follow it. I remember being pretty scared because I was just in the Cornwall tin mine when I looked at it so it could all imagine. Luckily I didn't see the ghosts of dead children, but I found this movie really worrying and scary when I was a lot younger. I've never forgotten it, though I couldn't find it anywhere. It seems to me that the Children's Film Fund films are generally good, but they are no longer showing them. I also remember programs like "The Green Of Green Knowe" at the same time in the BBC - the same dissatisfaction in their own way.
