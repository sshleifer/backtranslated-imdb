Every episode I saw as an innocent child was stupid. There were some funny dolls called "The Mitts" who always discussed childhood things. They played this song before the "The Mitts" part of the exhibition, which goes like this: "Let's join our fingers ..." There was a Groucho Marx doll who spoke jokes. Before the meeting, this man sang "Hot Fudge! Right On!" There was a green doll with teeth named Seymore. We would always see more of Seymore. He broke jokes and sang every episode. Every episode was always moral. One episode, a man sang "Liars are losers!" Another episode he sang about sharing and caring. Seymore told me that these two little girls "Sharon and Karen." Hot Fudge Holey Moley has the man who does strange things and played strange music.
