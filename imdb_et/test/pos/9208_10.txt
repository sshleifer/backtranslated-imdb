I would like to cancel my dissatisfaction with NBC Cancelling in Las Vegas. The exhibition had been a top brand in the past fifty years. Adding Tom Sellecks was great. He brought an exhibition for a really fresh addition. What is NBC now? Flat reality and night games show. I mean, come to the old and tired law and order? Jack McCoy is not even a DA to make the show interesting. Gee Keeping Quality Program Like Deal or No Deal or ED? ER should be taken to pasture. NBC is now worse than it was on Pre Seinfeld Cheers. With cable and the Internet, NBC cannot allow flat faces on its face. I remember when the killing on the street ended as he did. At least they had the final two-hour series. Hey CBS listening? Please pick up Vegas, this is a great show.
