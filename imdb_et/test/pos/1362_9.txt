I liked it a bit, but I have friends who hated it. There is no sex, but in any episode there is nudity - what is good. Keitar also has a toilet layout that is studied at least in half episodes. (Toilets are much more advanced in Japan.) Hmm, I mean, why did I appreciate it so high ...? Surely it is not that I like naked comic girls. In some ways, Keitaro Oe (the main character) is analogous to Johnny Bravo, except instead of being a horrible, heroic muscle jock, Keitaro is a hyperactive nerd. Or you might think of him as Japan's response to Leisure Suit Larry. It is easier to take it when you look at it with subtitles, not duplicated, but it grows to you when you give it a chance. He's Goldenboy. <br /> <br /> The formula is the same for each episode. The boy meets the girl, the boy tries to win the girl's heart, despite being a dork pervert, the boy somehow succeeds with all the odds. Typically, a girl does not understand that she likes Keitaro before being beaten to cellulose and / or pulls out a nice stunt for a few weeks, such as designing a modern operating system or racing against a gasoline-powered motorcycle using her bike. br /> <br /> Episode # 1 contains rich software. I think the animation of her breasts puts a big bribe in the budget because she is the only woman with such an animation. She also dresses completely unprofessionally. Most people who appreciate it would probably never get the first episode. <br /> <br /> Episode 2 is a rich, young daughter who likes to tease. She is only 16 years old, but she is an adult in Japan (and in some US states I add). His father is also a brutal type of yakuzza, known for killing his sons interested in boys. <br /> <br /> Girl # 3 is the sweet innocent daughter of the macaroni shop owner, mixed with a bad boy. After the intervention of Keitaro for girls and kissing a boy, there is almost no ecchi in this episode - a sharp drop from the previous two. Nevertheless, the Keitaro and the evil boy really do each other. <br /> <br /> Episode # 4 has Keitaro, who is trying to impress the impressive swim training. Keitaro seems to be more "direct" to her intentions than any other girl ... and she's just back ... <br /> <br /> Girl # 5 is a biker babe. He is probably the 6-most (though not super-strong, like girl # 1) and "racem" of sexuality and vulgarity. This particular episode is easily uppermost in terms of reality (absence). Keitaro should have broken his body bone at least twice during the biker babe, but I think manufacturers and writers said, "It's just a comic! We can do something!" This expiration of realism makes it a fan of fans. <br /> <br /> Finally, episode # 6 introduces new girls (it works in animation) and previous 5 girls will help Keitar when he tries to cope with the limitations of time and resources to get the OAV out on time. For Ecchi, it is also very tame, but there is a lot of humor. All 5 extremely beautiful girls have ended up from the previous team to the hunting of Keitaro, who slips unnoticed, seemingly intent on raping him. Yeah, that -ALMOST- is happening in real life. Someone went through Ukyo Tachibana (Samurai Shodown area) with Steve Urkel (family area affairs) ... <br /> <br /> All in all, there is no medium for this. You hate it or love it. If you're new to anime, you probably don't want to start it. While you are able to stop signs like Happosai (Ranma 1/2) or Johnny Bravo ... or you like comedies that are more inclined towards stupidity, but have very sexual hints, you should give it off.
