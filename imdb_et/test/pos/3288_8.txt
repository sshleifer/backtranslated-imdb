The stimulating electronics quiz Brian Foster (Lost of the Lost by Wesley Eure TV) creates a computer-based watch, called C.H.O.M.P.S. (acronym for dog home protection system) for his superior Ralph Norton (nice played by Conrad Baain), whose home security is slippery. A competing company hires a couple of incident criminals to get their looting hands C.H.O.M.P.S. said the task is easier said than done. Directed by Don Chaffey, an endo-lush story connects endlessly at a fast pace, keeps it quietly silly and light all the time and strikes the wolf with a striking shock. Moreover, the game put it infectiously: adorable Valerie Bertinelli Brian's sweet betting Casey Norton, Chuck McCann as klutzy crook Brooks, Red Buttons as McCann's equal worship partner Bracken, Jim Backus as bad CEO Mr. Gibbs, Hermoine Baddeley as A nice old offer of Mrs. Foster and the exploitation of the 60's AIP is a common Larry bishop like Smarmy, a double suit by Ken Sharp. Best of all, the title pooch is a cozy pleasure: C.H.O.M.P.S. Jumps with amazing agility through gardens, walls and windows, fills extraordinary forces, runs faster than deer, and even does some fun martial arts. The sub-block on a terrifying neighborhood, called Monster, provides a few extra stomach laughs (Monster has expressed a non-credited man with a deep, growing voice). Stylish animated opening sequences, Charles F. Wheeler's shiny cinematography and Hoyt Curtin's funky, pulsating disco score are also solid. Cute little baby flick.
