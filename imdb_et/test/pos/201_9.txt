A true masterpiece of Soviet cinematography. It is a shame for the Soviet Union that Samoylov was never given the chance to play in western films - but then again he probably won't find himself there. "Letyat Zhuravli" is unforgettable. It was one of the few movies I was crying for ... <br /> <br /> Besides top level Samoylov, Batalov and Mercury, it was a great job for the director and operator. a movie all the time classic. Remember to remember the scenes of piano music and suggestions in the heavy German bombing or the rotating sky of Boris's death over his head and his latest visions blurred in these skies. Very simple ways - but great technology added emotional weight ... Mind you, 20 years before "Star Wars", 41 years before "Titanic" and Soviet budget.
