My sisters and my cousin (female) forced me to see this chick movie. This is not a movie I would like to see, but it wasn't that bad. I wouldn't want to see this movie, but after I watched it, I couldn't say it was bad, just not my movie. It was very accurate in what the woman actually talks and does in certain situations. Like a man, I was not too much fun with jokes, but a man who was definitely women. They were tied to the film and yes, it was funny to see on the big screen. "OH EM GEE I'll do it for HAHA" I've never seen or cared for the original. If you are a girl, it must be, but maybe the girls would say that this film would suck, probably. I can't see the 13-year-old, "Wow, I remember it threw when I was 30." <br /> <br /> No man could collect it, but I can't say it was terrible, so honey.
