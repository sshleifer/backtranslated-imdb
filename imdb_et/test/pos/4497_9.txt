I have not read the novel from which the film is based. So I can't comment on what's missing or when changes are made. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, I had a great experience in viewing KITE RUNNER. I find that when I see movies from other cultures than us here in the US, I learn how other nations live and exist. <br /> <br /> The participants in this movie come from Afghanistan and other countries in the region. In the first role, there are 3 small children near the epic film, they were wonderful. <br /> <br /> Scenes that were allegedly in Kabul were shot in different parts of China, I assume that this area is similar to the actual places in the book. <br /> <br /> Mark Foster directed and made FINDING NEVRRLAND, he has created the same magic here. <br /> <br /> All aspects of production are the first. <br /> <br /> I found this better movie than those nominated and won by Oscare. <br /> <br /> The movie is titled, very clear. This is the right PG-13 rating. SPOILER ALERT --- Children's rape scene is very well handled. <br /> <br /> However, I can't give it a 4-star general plot and a story we've seen many times. less it is very worth watching a movie .. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** 1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)
