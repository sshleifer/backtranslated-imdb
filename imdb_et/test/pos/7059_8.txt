Camp North Star and the extraordinaire of the Camp North Star adviser, Tripper Harrison (Bill Murray) would definitely want to end the decades-long loss of rival Camp Camp Mohawk, a type of ivy species where only rich children can participate. Meanwhile, we look at how Tripper tries to love his love by flirting with the female female counselor, Roxanne (Kate Lynch), when the other teenage counselors are paired and fall head. The film arrives at the camping competition, when the contestants attack in competing athletic competitions, where Tripper realizes the year after his death. The film also shows a growing relationship with Tripper and quietly lonely, puppy-dog-eyed Rudy (Chris Makepeace's "Vamp" fame), whose father is often out of time. Rudy does not seem to fit with other children at his age and seems to spend most of his time running in the morning with Tripper or taking his peanuts in Blackjack. The film usually includes hi-jinxi, a counselor for male teenager camps, who cut and drag around. <br /> <br /> You have hottie advisers, a total of nerd Spaz (Jack Blum) with your taped glasses and a bad acne with a nose. Hardware "(Matt Craven), who likes to drag things, fat guy Fink (Keith Knight), who often fills his face, among other things in the movie. There's a basketball game where poor Spaz can barely bounce against Camp Mohawk, but shoot less accurately as bad Fink tossing undersized, knee-shaped balls that run over the backplate, there is a camp fire connection (with Tripper's terrifying scary story about a hooked killer) and boys fleeing beautiful ladies. <br /> <br /> Yes , I know this is desperate when he tries to push every laugh out and occasionally lets him feel sentimental (like sad Makepeace and Murray), but as much as this recent look, I found myself out. it does not help to love it. It is a summer camp movie that you just want to attract. I can't explain or sufficiently strengthen the overwhelming joy that floods cause when I see and the size of Murray's hand on the covers of the alarm clock, which begin to pronounce the summer camp movie hard. His intercom jokes are especially fun. But let's not be honest, a series of comic book descriptions that Murray died infinitely ... that there is nothing wrong. The film could not survive without him? It's hard to even think of this movie without Murray's cord. It's a happier time, and I think the nostalgia of this summer camp experience is pretty good, why are we still communicating warmly with "meatballs". And poor Morty (Harvey Atkin), a camp leader who wants things so badly, and Camp Camp Mohawk, is a constant source of Tripper and Gang entertainment because they often play gags. she sleeps in bed! A big enthusiastic majority who seems to be as much as us.
