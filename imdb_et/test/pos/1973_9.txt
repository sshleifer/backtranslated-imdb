I loved this movie, but then I'm a big Cronenberg fan again. If you haven't seen David Cronenberg's movie, it's not a good place to start. Scanners, Aircraft, Rabid would be a place to start and then work with a video dome before checking it. This is definitely one of his best and takes one step beyond the interactive game phenomena. </p> <p> </p> <p> In this game, players connect the biologically engineered cushion of the cushion through the inserted plug and get into the game. through the nervous system. It is very difficult to tell you more, without giving away the story and the plot, but it is enough to say that this is a game that you will not forget. It's full of Cronenberg's narrow body work, dark predictive landscapes, where everything is populated with great pain, including Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law, and Willem Dafoe, who are taking a situation that is very serious. These people do what they can to find out the game and then win. Like his other films, there is no imagination or part where you sit, but like a car accident, you don't see it. If you liked any of the above films, go out and get it all.
