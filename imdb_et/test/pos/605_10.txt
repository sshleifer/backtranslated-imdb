In many ways, the perfect film. The "Incredible Journey" and the story of Horatio Alger come together with a positive spin on a topic that is usually depressing existentialism. Basically, the story of the muppets is the final song of the movie: "Life is like a movie, write your end, believe, pretend." They create their own reality, with all the epic story: the ultimate goal, which is necessarily the obstacle-laden journey; a growing group of like-minded individuals for marriage; a nasty amount of wools who are not all redeemed; and a big budget for Hollywood, which ends because they all get. <br /> <br /> Only Jim Henson could pull it out. He walks between sentimentality and philosophy without becoming too long or too heavy. Of course, it seems strange that such weight is invested in the main dolls of films, but eventually they may be the dolls to make those points. The film's atmosphere allows you to enjoy Hollywood's dream, a "happy" ending, unnecessary bars and blasting on a hat. Typically, these aspects are inherent to the quality of the film, but in itself a depreciating way of delivering this story changes the guilty view. One of the few movies that can really be called "suitable for all ages". <br /> <br /> Other muppet-related movies (including "The Empire Strikes Back"), although tasty, do not touch the simple grace of this movie. Take, for example, the musical number "Hope that Something Better Comes Along", the duets of Kermit and Rowley. He was having fun in his vaudevillian horse, but he made very critical points about the motivations behind the choice of life. Brilliant.
