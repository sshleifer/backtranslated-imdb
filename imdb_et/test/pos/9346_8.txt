Thriller remains the biggest pop music ad to get a plot, a great vision and a top-notch song to film around. Michael Jackson was at the top of the trees at that time (and did not change in such a plastic surgery mode that it would be important). Here he is in good shape - the song is terrible, he drives the zombies dancing like no other. <br /> <br /> Ola Ray plays a girl who looks at disbelief when her cute boy (Jackson, natch) turns into a werewolf! The opening line "It is close to midnight" then arrives at pulsating rhythms around him with other tombs and night creatures around the graveyard. <br /> <br /> All this crowning glory is this fruity voice. high horror star Vincent Price speaks in the middle of the record. Terrible.
