This is a good movie, I wouldn't go into any detail because other user comments take care of it. But I disagree with the statement that this is Eastwood's best work. It is not just a highly protected position based on the volume of strong films he has directed and played. I would like to point out that I am interested in the fact that two actors who played in this film, Pattye Mattick and Peggy Drier, never appeared again in another film or television, despite good performances. Has my curiosity been thinking of what happened to these two actors?
