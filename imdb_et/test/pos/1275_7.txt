This is definitely the most intimate and thoughtful piece of Nolan. Not to say that Memento or Insomnia is bad, but they were certainly more of Hollywood standards ... while Next is more of an indie flick. The story is very brilliant and very well developed. In general ... see if your fan of any of Nolan's work, I'm sure you'll appreciate it.
