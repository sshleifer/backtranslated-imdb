John Denver was good to see, though he went several years ago. I found this movie to be a very affectionate and great movie to sit on a fire in the cold winter night, recalling what is Christmas. The scenes from Georgetown (Colorado) were great and made it go right there. When I sat here on my hill, which I saw in California, I loved this story and plot. I hope everyone who sees this somewhat older movie will enjoy it as much as my mother and I did. Merry Christmas! Great movie for the whole family. Enoy and tell others about it. Thank you for your memories. We have to make more of these movies from Hollywood.
