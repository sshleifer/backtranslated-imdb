Closer he gets ... is an artificial documentary about the death of a dead person. This allows you to glimpse into the family's private property, which is related to your life's endeavor with time. Parents tend to support the work of their children, in which case the documentary went beyond and beyond. He was ready to share his death experience with his son as an act of love. This is a work of art that is most relevant, and is the knitting of the serious, peaceful and light sides of this family. The story is what can make you laugh, but also cry, because it concerns issues that we all have to face. I recommend this documentary to those who are not afraid of crying, and are ready to deal with the issue of mortality most humanly. This film is about you.
