Forever strong is one of the sports movies you can actually watch. It reminded me a lot to remember Titans because it contained comedy, sadness and just awesome. I saw it in pre-screening and all my friends loved it and just put it on their top 2 sports films. Acting is great in the movie. Although it is similar to remembering Titans, there is something very unique about this movie. I think it's definitely worth Oskar and gets lots of prizes. Everyone should definitely watch this movie and it's worth $ 10. I have to see it again when it comes out because it was so good. I can't say there is one bad thing in the movie.
