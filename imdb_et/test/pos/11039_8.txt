This short was the first short description given by Paramount Famous Studios, and it was one of the many made by the studio where Popeye received the enemy, most often Japan. While the Warner Brothers, Disney and, to a lesser extent, other studios made short German foils, most of the efforts of Famous Studios focused on Japan. Given the links between the Pearl Harbor and Popeye navy, it is quite understandable. This is an average short. Red, white and blue and spinach for the UK are older. But it's still worth it. Recommended.
