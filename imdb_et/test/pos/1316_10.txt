"Mishima: The Four Chapters of Life" is a visually stunning product that deals with complex problems that are easily recognizable. It is based on the life of a controversial Japanese writer Yukio Mishima who committed suicide in the 1970s. It is not really a biological - at least not a traditional concept - but the study of Mishima's iconoclastic creation. The film can be presented in abstract terms in an unabashed, totally interesting way. Paul Schrader commends Mishima without deconstructing him or his work. It doesn't solve the riddle, but it does understand you. Additional bonus: As we see Mishima's rage tradition in a morally free modern society, Schrader gives us an excellent demonstration of the dichotomy between the meaning and the performance of the film. The art of John Bailey is excellent. The greatness of Philip Glass's work is perfect for the project. "Mishima" is the best movie I've ever seen.
