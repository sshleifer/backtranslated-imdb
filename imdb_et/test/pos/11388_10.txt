This image will only grow over time. Better than any of the 97 best image candidates and recognizes recurring views. I've seen it three times, so I know. Anderson was compared to some big American directors (Altman, Scorcese, Tarantino) and may have such effects, but there are some shortcuts to this shortlist. <br /> <br /> Last Note: Julianne Moore's "Amber Waves" resonate in memory long after the other 90's film characters have faded. The best result of the year - in any of the four categories.
