I watched this movie with great expectations but a little disappointed. Though I like this movie and this story has come up, it didn't find it moving and I think the end is coming to an end. who is a traffic manager. The location is a nice Korean village. <br /> <br /> This film is in some ways realistic, because there is an element of tragedy, but it is not melodic. But I was not finally led by a film that depicts a man whom a woman loves so much, but does not even give her the opportunity to step into her life. I think she's a sweet, noble loser. > <br /> Generally - good but prefer before sunset and after sunset (or it is before sunset and after sunrise)
