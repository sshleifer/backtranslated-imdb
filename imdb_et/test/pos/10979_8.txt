You saw the movie last night knowing something about it (nothing else seemed interesting and I had a Buffalo connection with this movie - UB grad). It was a very enjoyable movie. I liked the pace (it rises after a slow start) and the story. Well written plot and good character development and relationships. We recommend it to anyone who loves to see interesting stories. I later talked about this movie with a few beers - most discussions do not last for more than a few minutes.
