A well-made melodrama that speaks of Sally, a circus tombo-dancer, featured by performer McGargle (playing toilet squares), top hat, small mustache, square pants and juggler, handkerchief and runner carnival con games like the three cards Monte and the old Shell The game. McGargle has raised Sally, who worships her as his "real father", because Sally's mother (her father, judge when she married a "circus man") died and left Sally orphaned. Sally is witty and loyal to McGargle, no matter what he gets - but McGargle seems to be innocent to keep them in the circus, not with his family. When they arrive in a carnival town with their rich grandparents, McGargle uses the opportunity to "explore" the real family of Sally and think he can restore them. But Grandfather's judge takes Sally right now, because he doesn't like the "show girl" - the stern, narrow-minded man, he's a real job, man! At the same time, Sally is busy with a nice and rich young man, the son of his son, who helped his grandfather in his wealth. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie where here and there a couple of laughs and a sort of odd editing style (I don't know how to describe it when it shows long frames, then jumps back a few seconds or the angle changes unexpectedly ). Carol Dempster, who plays Sally, is happy here - pretty cute and comic. TUALETT. Fields, even without his obedience, are very funny - just as he moves and his fun, comic reaction (like a small dog, who has been viewed in one funny scene), we see him briefly on this issue. I love those pairs of beans shown here in the old-fashioned circus and carnival. The print printed on this DVD is very nice in appearance, tinted with a light sepia tone, and its piano point is really great, which Philip Carli performed on the original chipboard.
