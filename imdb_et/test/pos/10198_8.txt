Scientist Carl Lehman (well played by David McIlwraith) bounces on a dreadful chemical explosion. He has moved his brain into the body of an almost indestructible metal hat suit by his evil colleagues led by evil obsessive associates Alex Whyte (Richard Cox's totally unpleasant image). Lehman begins all sorts of killing. It is up to the nasty mercenary Hunter (the adorable adoration of divine Pam Grier) to stop him. Director Jean-Claude Lord, who previously visited the undervalued psychological thriller "Visiting Times", is entering into major action scenes with a significant veil, and keeps the pace at all times, thus ensuring that it pulls the size pleasantly comfy / horror games. Maure Chaykin can easily compete with great praise as a nasty burt of Burt, who is one of the most tasteful sequences of the film, a cruel attack on Laurman's pregnant wife Lauren (the triumphant victory of lovely Teri Austin). Stan Winston's amazing makeup f / x and the exciting results of Paul Zaza add even more fun to the general.
