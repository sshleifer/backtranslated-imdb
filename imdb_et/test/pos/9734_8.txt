Six-shooter, Tunnel Sergeant, Dr Death, Pinhead, Cyclops, and Blade help young Andre Toulon take Sutek's one-time revenge in the best order that this series has seen. <br /> <br /> Retro Puppet Master has many sets, high quality action and some fun dolls in the atmosphere. What he lacked is an interesting plot with a good pace. <br /> <br /> Best quote: Dr Death: "Don't you know, my friends? Sulfur smell, look at the smoke ..." <br /> <br /> It's just the best seen Dave DeCoteau movie. Actors do more than reliable work: Jack Donner as "Azfel" turns to an inspired performance and the young Toulon makes the dolls well. Oh, and the ring needle is cool. <br /> <br /> The John Massar score is a nice symphonic contest about Richard Band's original puppeteers' stories, keeping the movie playful and awful. The Full Moon score is rare when you add something to the movie, and that does it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Dave Allen didn't look like Band and Co. and beyond, so that all puppet activities are done with rods and strings. There is no stopping movement like the famous and funny scene in the original where Pinhead is looking for his head. And, of course, as with the full-time ticket prices for this entire period, RPM was shot in Bucharest in and around Castel Studios, so most of the bits were given to the Romanians: listening to their "Paris" accents was a bit annoying. It is probably one of the top 10 Full Moon movies. This is certainly the most inventive result of Puppet Master.
