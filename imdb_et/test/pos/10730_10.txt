Certainly, when I saw this movie in HBO, I was a bit uneven in imitating the plot, but it got my attention when I see Dustin Hoffman. Frankly, I was not surprised to see the old movies, but in the long run it changes my position. When you see this confusing film, I got the experience to sit back again, noticing that my tears suddenly roll off my cheek and then after that, let me get rid of what I just recognize. Kramer vs Kramer was indeed one of the best classical drama films I've seen for a long time, that even I myself couldn't imagine how it touched me. The story was strongly emotional, but not with such saturation. The characters were not unrealistic for these roles; they have features that make viewers look like they are in a movie like Meryl Streep's role, she was a mother who honestly admits her past mistakes, but then she's sure she's raising her emotional motives to get what she's wants an honest and checkered battle. Dustin Hoffman was too prominent, I can't even understand how this guy could play serious hard roles and suddenly jumped to another role that was completely different, and then filled it well. Even though I've seen movies a lot of times when I sit back and go home to watch movies and buy time for it, Kramer and Kramer get a glimpse of my experience.
