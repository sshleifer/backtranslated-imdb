We all know what Chan-wook Park can do. If you haven't seen Oldboy (or compassion for it on the trilogy) then you have lost some of the best films of this century. But I'm not here to talk about them. I'm here to talk about thirst. <br /> <br /> This movie is not what you would expect. Yes, it is a vampire movie, but at the same time it is a very complicated story about romance priest and young girl. I can't get to the synopsis (this can be read above), but tell you what this movie offers. Chan-wook Park is a master of cinematography and this film is no exception. With some very surreal scenes, supported by intense lighting, it determines the mood in almost every scene. The film begins a bit slowly, but I felt that it was necessary for relationships with characters. When things start moving, it almost never lets credit roll. "January" is mostly a love story, but not the same as what you think. The relationship between characters is very intense but at the same time almost disturbing. Chan-wook Park is not a stranger, as we know, and this film is about as much a taboo as an old man. The final scene is the most powerful and perhaps one of the best conclusions in the film I've seen. This is an exciting (and, of course, different) vampire world and romance is far from cute or boring. This film is sharp, selfless and beautiful in all the wrong ways. Obviously this is not for everyone, but there are chances of reading this review that you are already interested in. Look at this. Don't be afraid
