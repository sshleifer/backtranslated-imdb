I saw this movie at the Locarno Film Festival in the Italian section of Switzerland. <br /> <br /> Aishwarya Rai is good looking. <br /> <br /> I appreciate this movie 7/10 for its beautiful moments. <br /> <br /> * Front Spoilers * <br /> <br /> There are really nice moments in this movie, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> Although my general feeling is that it is too long (over 2 hours and 40 minutes) and contains too many dialogs. And almost no dancing. <br /> <br /> It is clear that a Bollywood film like Lagaan or Devdas is a fairly different film compared to Chokher Bali.
