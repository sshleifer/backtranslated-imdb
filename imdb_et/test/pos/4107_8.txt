It was one of my favorites as a child. My family had a soundtrack for 8-ball tapes !! We took years (until I was in my 20s) to get a movie from my movie (my father recorded it on HBO or something). Every summer when we go to the beach (my mother, brother, sister and me), we are on the beach and sing all the songs of this movie !!! LOVE YOU !!!
