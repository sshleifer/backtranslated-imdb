Any review I have read so far seems to be undecided. Shakespeare wrote for accent and pronunciation just as he did for other games in the north. The Scottish accent changes the language's emphasis and rhythm and deeply influences what is being said and how it is taken. So, listen again and mark the difference. The game is well done and the rhythm of words is so much better than that offered by polite, well-expressed English-speaking people. I am reminded of the time that a teacher at Leicester school unknowingly asked me at the age of 14 to read Walter Scott's piece written in the border tone. I come from the border and when I read it, it read all the difference.
