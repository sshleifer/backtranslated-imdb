The last few days are the best gay movie in the homosexual genre. Most movies lead to spooky stories, one night stand and don't forget the notorious baseball teams? In the last few days, there is actually a male affection in the dark, and a rather graphic material that made me wonder whether the film belonged to Blockbuster or badpuppy.com. Movies The emotional journey is what puts it over the genre. Until this movie was seen, I saw such intense passion and love and the torture it could bring. I think if people cry during the movies, they should be beaten, but I found myself in several scenes because of the realistic nature of the world we live in. I recommend that every gay man see this movie and if you have a boy, thank him.
