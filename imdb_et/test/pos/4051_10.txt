In the mid / late 80s, the OAV-anime "Bubblegum Crisis" (which I think it is a military slang term for technical equipment) made its debut video, inspired by "Blade Runner", "The Terminator" and maybe even "Robocop" with a small dash of Batman / Bruce Wayne - Iron Man / Tony Stark and Charlie's Angel girl power thrown into a good measure. The long, general story of 8 episodes was that in the 21st century in Tokyo, Japan, in 2032-2033, living machines called Boomers were working manually and sometimes causing problems. Special, SWAT, like the law enforcement branch, developed the police (AD police in a short time), was created to handle generations, but was mostly ineffective, calling the millionaire scientist Sylia Stingray, the daughter of a boomer scientist. Powerful military control equipment (hard suits) that women have to wear to fight boomers and fight generational evil corporation, GENOM. This group is known as Knight Sabers and, in addition to the ring leader Sylia, was the rag-tag band Priss Asagiri of the rebellious women, fighting stone and roller with a passion for motorcycles and rogue, City Yamazaki, aerobics teacher with money and a tendency to blow his eyes. boys and Nene Romanova, ADP's young officer and computer expert (first long line). Meanwhile, GENOM, Quincy, is a long and nice old man who owns a company, his younger assistant Brian J. Mason (killed in episode 3) and a tedious boomer man named Largo. Other characters were Leon McNichol and Daley Wong, two AD Police Detective (Leon appeared spin-off / prequel anime, "AD Police Files", which I heard was very dark), their bald, overweight boss Chief Todo, Sylia's younger brother Mackey and a funny little mechanic known as Dr. Ravenina, who apparently helps Sylia in the care of suits. In addition to the general story of VS GENOM by the Knight Sabers & AD police, there was another story involving a city friend who was apparently a big daughter of a crime family, a tedious Largo who was trying to attack GENOM, and a different story of the Priss-deliberate-vengeance. Oh, and I mentioned there were clues that Sylia himself could have been a boomer? <br /> <br /> Well, it was a great clock, full of chaos and chaos, and even some very nice pop songs, but it wasn't without its drawbacks, some of which were unfortunately due to the fact that the series was interrupted after episode 8 when it was originally designed for 13 episodes. So some of the story, such as the Largo Scheme (or Schemes), the City's Bad Friend and the Sylia Family, was never solved. Another problem with the series was that Priss was the most popular character at the moment, so much of the series was focused on him, and unfortunately most of the Prissile-oriented episodes focused mainly on Priss, who himself was looking for the secondary character of justice / revenge for some who had never appeared before, but was his friend, but rarely went out to Knight Sabers, who always struggled with him and for some reason took care of his well-being (while being honest, he went to save the City in episode 7 and his boy killed by the boom and ADP was investigating wrong). This meant that we couldn't really focus on Sylia's more interesting backtrack or even Nene's and City's everyday antics. The city had two episodes oriented around him, touching his friend's mafia family, while Nene was able to grab the last episode for himself, which showed that his eternal good joy was a truly good spirit, not contempt. Nene was also able to use his computer skills quite a bit, or sometimes he was just a loving bull that put his screen time and character on a couple of bad cities, often pulled by his own background. greed and his tendency to eat boys to get his attention. Don't get me wrong, I like it and I love its general concept, but it made me a little. This is also one of those runners who are "the worst English language dubbing" of all time, which means better Japanese. Some voices were fine (some were really suited to their characters), but others were just flat and passionate or really superfluous for Priss. Well, the Tokyo 2040 comes along and pretty much throws everything out of the window. A few years ago, the story here is that after the earthquakes Tokyo Tokyo was destroyed, the GENOM boomers built the city as a great old paradise, except for those who still have a tendency to fly a handle that forces AD to form a police force. Knight Sabers was formed. So the general story is the same, but the characters 'background patterns and the characters' looks and attitudes have changed a lot. <br /> <br /> 1) Originally Sylial's short purple black hair and brown eyes, usually dressed like a stern, were the right business person and were far from others. 2040 Sylia has more supermodels, is more provocative and white hair and blue eyes, which seem to change color depending on the light (blue to purple, silver and eyes occasionally purple or gray) and Sylia 2040 is also a more emotionally unstable woman who flies out of the handle if he is not in the public and perhaps even retains more secrets than before. Sylia does not take so many risks on the battlefield, because she is more of a mobile well, but she makes a battle as she sees it. <br /> <br /> 2) Priss was originally a short woman who had an afro and a very bad mood, always choosing the struggles with the people who insulted her, always biting more than she was chewing, etc. 2040 Priss, however, has gone to Clint Eastwood alone. - Very cold, very stoic and emotionally distant (more like the original Sylia you could say) so that he is not really attached to anyone. Her hair is also weak and catlike (great healing) and she is covered with skin like "Trinity" "Matrix" (though much less annoying than before, unfortunately the writers eventually wrote her when revealing her reasons) hates ADP). <br /> <br /> 3) Originally, the City had her big hair for her, but now her hair is shorter, browner and more than 90 years old. 2040 The city also has an office boy who is lucky because of sexual harassment. Because 2040 writers would apologize for the ways they were treated by OAV writers, they devoted the first 6 episodes to the City, writing it as a new city for the girl, but decided to meet Knight Sabers and win with them the place she finally does. <br /> <br /> 4) Originally a short red hair girl who was often a ridiculous victim and ate a lot of candy, Nene is now a short blonde hair girl who likes to tempt and take pot shots with ADP Detective Leon McNichol (revenge on her playing with her in OAV?) and other characters, even her replacement sister City and Mackey, Sylia's "brother" to whom she has become sad. Cockey and arrogant, he still eats a lot of candy and is a hacker, but he's finally emptied and grows beyond his comic release status. <br /> <br /> 5) Nigel Kirkland is a new character, a long stoic, a harshly beautiful man with long black hair (he looks like Adrian Paul on Highlander television), replaces Dr. Raven from the old series and is now a man gives sylia costume maitenance. Nigel is also a lover of Sylia, but you don't know about her behavior. He is a kind of father / big brother / mentor figure for Mackey. <br /> <br /> 6) Leon and Daley are back, but of course differently. The original Leon was a tall beautiful boy who was built as a baseball player who had slipped back into brown hair, blue eyes, black leather jacket, tight jeans and always accompanied by a revolver that could magically pack more than a calf if needed. although he was not a bad man, he was a kind of jerk, but he mostly served as a comic because he tried to continue Priss romanticly (exactly what he saw was a mystery), but sometimes he and Daley served as point managers of important landmarks. The original Daley was also a relatively muscular red head dressed in pink / purple costumes because he was an amazingly homosexual character who was always Leon when he didn't provide important information. In 2040 Leon is no longer a real boy, but your typical harsh tough guy with black hair, brown eyes, high and sporty big muscles, brown leather jacket and blue docks (he looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger a bit or maybe pumped up Colin Farrell or Hugh Jackman) and he's still wearing a revolver, BIG, but it's not as powerful as before. Although in 2040 Leon still has a bit of an attitude (especially when approaching Priss), he is almost as much a jerk as he was in the old series, but he has a bad mood and Nene and Daley easily bother him (He drinks too much coffee). Oh, and Leon is still in for Prince, but this time he's much more lucky. Meanwhile, Daley is now taller (but not as long as Leon) a pretty handsome boyfriend with red flipped glasses, white suit, green eyes and light brown hair, and he's wearing a big machine (he looks like James Marsden's X-Men movies) ); Daley is a lot smarter and more confident in 2040 than OAV, and although it is not entirely clear, his homosexual tendencies have almost disappeared, saving from the moment that seems to be jealous when he hears from Leon who asked 7 about Brian J. Mason (what does "J" stand for?) Is back and so is Quincy, but Mason is much more of a main villain here, with Quincy as a companion because he is no longer a terrifying indicator of fear, but a vegetarian food that has batteries and wires. Mason's sport now slipped back into brown hair instead of black hair, as it was in OAV (he looks like the OAV Leon suit) and he's a lot of Alan Rickman's villain school. <br /> <br /> 8) Although Perverse in the first series, Mackey is no longer perverse in 2040. There are, of course, many different things about Mackey in 2040, but they are not revealed here. <br /> <br /> 9) Sylia is now a companion, Alfred-the-butler, named Henderson, who is worried about her and her gang. <br /> <br /> 10) In the original series, generations were similar to replications of "Blade Runner". , which are armed with their thoughts, feelings and ambitions, but in 2040 they are mostly fool-monsters-rabage. Mostly they are just big robots who do everything they have programmed (hard work, fight, cleaning, etc.) and they have such a tendency to "rogue", which means we are trying to develop and become a monster in the process. <br /> <br /> What remains the same is the theme of humanity's VS technology (do the machines have souls?). Unfortunately, this series, although it is well animated and well written, only works for 26 episodes, so it moves faster than it could be, especially those who are accustomed to more than one season of our most enjoyable characters, and unfortunately it ends with unresolved story bits rocks (which I am not discussing here. What this exhibition saves and does is what the characters, colored cast screws, ranging from stoic individuals, psycho-women, crazy men of genocide, rough-neck policemen, sardonic intellectuals, wise old clever and loved innocent, much more diverse than before and much more to play, they are enough to want this show longer.> <br /> It's not good, but it's a good time, as well as English dub (by ADV) is pretty good , though not with some flat stains, but definitely better than the original on the original.
