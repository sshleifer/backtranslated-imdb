It was a great time for me to watch Femina Ridens back in the morning, somewhat hungry. For most movies, it's pretty much two-handed, showing crazy doctor Philipe Leroy's games and strange relationships and stunning with Dagmar Lassander. I saw him earlier on a couple of Fulci films that die of terrible death, but here he is a young hip and beautiful. The film is quite predictable and certainly easy to exploit, but it is fun because of all its wonderful color layer feel. Designed in design, music, lighting and cinema, the classic sixties Italian style, a surreal feast for eyes and ears, and although the general thread of the plot is not too difficult to predict, there are more than enough unusual events and memorable strange sights and sounds to keep things interesting. Both drivers are pretty good, and it repeats that Dagmar Lassander is really good. Stelvo Cipriani's music is also gnarly, perfect for pictures. Director Pierro Schivazappa is quite crisp here, but not perfect. While it is very appealing, there is little substance here and the elements of exploitation are as easy as possible. I think it gives it a kind of charm and innocence, but I can't think that the topic could have done more to hit, the more danger that sorta thing, especially since it's quite easy to figure out what will happen. I suspect that for stronger fans of exploitation it is definitely pointless and certainly not for people who want sex or much nudity. It's a more light, fun pop art thing, lovable, but insignificant, like a jacuzzi. Recommended mainly for 60's, Dagmar Lassander or sweet shapes.
