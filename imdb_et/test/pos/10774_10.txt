This movie is perfectly reasonable. It can be thought provocative, funny, tragic and cinematographic yet claustrophobic. <br /> <br /> Though the setbacks are unnecessary, the pacy movie, potty grip and performances are all excellent, especially Alec Baldwin, and the amazing Eric Bogosian as the film's hero Barry Champlain.
