Every Saturday morning at 11:00 I watched the superstars. All the biggest events took place at this show at that time. The Challenge, which gave Sunday mornings, was also decent, but all the great things happened at this show. The wrestlers did all the interviews on the platform next to the crowd living with Mean Gene, or speak independently in front of the screen against the background that promoted them. The races were usually squashes, but sometimes the average tournament saw 2 midfields. There was also an interview, which usually caused violence, thus creating hatred. These segments were Pipers Pit, Body Shop, Flower Shop, Snake Pit, Brother Love Show, Funeral Parlor and The Barber Shop. I don't remember any titles that would change the hand of this exhibition. This usually happened in the main event of paid views and Saturday nights.
