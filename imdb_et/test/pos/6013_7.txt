* Location of Al Capone <br /> <br /> * Who shot JFK? <br /> <br /> * Cynthia Gibb releases some of Gypsy's remake on the TV <br /> <br /> are some of the great unsolved mysteries of the 20th century. How else can I say that, except, I thought he was terribly terrible. Mannequin manners, bad reactive behavior (ie talking empty, stoic foam when he talks with a star) and the voice of a song that most of the voice coaches would judge "mediocre". But he is stunningly proud and it wasn't that it was a Roma character? Does he seem to cut the mustard in the talent department? <br /> <br /> The rest ... Bette is awesome. Whether he plays himself or plays Mama Rose, it works in both ways and I thought Rosalind Russell was as exciting as the gypsum in the original. Peter Riegart as "Herbie" is the perfect underrated foil for Bette's upper mother, and she's a medium-temperature mash between Midler's hot cup and Gibb's frost. Riegart is right about the cheese. <br /> <br /> One last holler responsible for decades of Cher jokes: Bob Mackie. The dragging queens would kill the beautiful and glamor shown here. Everything is coming up with sequins and bugle beads! <br /> <br />
