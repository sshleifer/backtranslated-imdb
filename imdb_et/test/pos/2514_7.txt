A funny title hides this stubbornly outdated example of Hollywood entertainment, this film proves the many successful elements of a highly successful hodgepodge: a period piece, a romantic drama, a criminal film, and a political thriller. Interestingly, Fox, its protagonists, has done it? Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck? both were usually associated with other studios; Their screen chemistry here is sensitive and eventually led to marriage in a couple of years. Although a bit too young, Taylor is a terrifying hero (President McKinley's personalized sea to expose the culprits behind many banks' organized clean-up); not surprisingly, he has not previously pursued it (smoothly led by Brian Donlevy and Victor McLaglen) that he falls on a hero (of course Stanwyck) who is in his composition? Although the truth has been said, there is no singing far from the actor's forte! Similarly, he must show Stanwyck's attentiveness besides McLaglen, besides having to value his flip. By the way, the former practical joker reminded me a lot of Charley Chase DESERT SONS (1933), which also led William A. Seiter. Later, Taylor is in two ways involved in involving Stanwyck in the upcoming feed and trying to leave his president when he lives with the girl? but jealous rival disturbs his plans. The robbery went awry, we find Donlevy dead and the other two prisoners; Taylor's hopes for McKinley's intervention? Having learned in the meantime in a difficult-to-understand and obviously striking person? is seemingly split when the president hates himself murdered (big plot, although the eleventh hour mid-term result seems viable)! To get back to the styles of the movie, even if the vaudeville sequences are a matter of taste, romantic triangle slows things down, and it falls somewhat from the trimmer's point of view; Participants who are already boldly supported by John Carradine (who just disappears after one scene!), Douglas Fowley, Sig Rumann and two American Presidents Sidney Blackmer (effervescent Theodore Roosevelt) and Frank Conroy (McKinley).
