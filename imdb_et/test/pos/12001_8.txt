The stories of the Leopold and Loeb cases can find this movie fun. Participants include Robert Culp, Stephen Caffrey and Garrison Hershberger as college students. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is his usual guy pretending to be cheated by pre-school students. Caffrey ("Longtime Companion", "Buried Alive") is great and should do more of these threatening roles. Basically, the doubling of the spouses of their demanding parents who expect more than academic perfection will only be funded by the best schools if they meet. There is a great scene where Culp strikes Caffrey over coal after he gets low grade, threatens to break his trusts and Caffrey later says to his friend: "I hate him, I want him dead" ... << / /> < br /> Not all in Beverly Hills well. This is always a great topic. I believe that this film was released in 1990 immediately after the death of Menendez. If you look at "Menedez, killing in Beverly Hills" and then comparing it to this movie, you may find interesting parallels.
