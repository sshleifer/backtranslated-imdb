Documentary films where the sons and daughters try to understand the parent and in the process of their lives are not so rare. There are also no rare results that reflect a lack of talent, a failure of self-awareness, a plethora of narcissism, and perhaps an uncomfortable public retribution for countless past illnesses, real and fantastic aspirations. An unusual, fair and engaging portrait of an exciting parent is unusual and "My Architect: The Boy's Journey" is a rare achievement. <br /> <br /> Louis Kahn emigrated to this country as a child, his face irreparably and crushed by the accident. He and his parents settled in Philadelphia, where a talented youngster loved art and music. Soon he became a building and decided that his architectural abilities would correspond only to the architect's career. <br /> <br /> Kahn became an architect, but as this movie shows, it took a long time before he got the attention of his leaders. field. One architect argues that he was "the victim of a yellow bracelet", the anti-Semitism that, along with biased women, was a long-standing aspect of the American architecture profession. <br /> <br /> When he came to notice He saw clearly, precisely as a confident, diligent prophet, crying out insecure demands that his vision and only his vision materialize. This stiffness was the reason why he made great plans for many buildings, but built only a few. An interview with an obsolete gentleman who triggered Kahn in Philadelphia due to his unacceptable dream of a transformed city center where people left their car to the perimeter and went to town to have fun. <br /> <br /> Kahn was a born teacher and some extensive archive materials show him with pupils, his voice is stable, passionate, respectful and intense. Many architects interviewed architect, writer and project honcho Nathaniel Kahn. son. Some are world famous - I. M. Pei, Robert A.M. Stone, Moshe Safdie, Frank Gehry and still active nonagenarian Philip Johnson. Their comments give a beautiful picture of this idealistic, but ultimately financially unsuccessful, designer of buildings, blending modern centuries castles, castles and grand buildings with contemporary design. Kahn's buildings have been shown to be the most impressive in Salk Research Laboratories in La Jolla, CA. In her style, I have a neo-romantic air that has died too much empty space that repels rather than human interaction. <br /> <br /> But Kahn's son was more than a story of his father, an architect. Louis Kahn had three families for years: a woman with whom he had a daughter and two long-term relationships, one of which produced a daughter, the other a son. Kahn often visited his son's mother at home, but at the end of the evening-mother and son, Kahn returned to his home. Obviously Nathaniel wanted to know this unusual set of relationships, but she doesn't seem to be in love with what a little boy definitely was a strange thing. <br /> <br /> When Nathaniel was a young boy, Louis Kahn died of a massive heart attack in the men's room in New York's Pennsylvania station after returning from India, where he had set aside one huge project, another that had never been built. At that point, his Philadelphia company had at least $ 500,000 in debt and had lived in a trip to a federal bankruptcy trustee. <br /> <br /> Kahn left several monumental structures, of which the government of Bangladesh is clearly the largest. The tearful local architect abandons Kahn for creating a building where democracy can (and hopefully) flourish. <br /> <br /> Modern architect Moshe Safdie thinks Kahn has had something to do with a deadly heart attack. a train station with its constant globetrot. I disagree: it is unfortunately ironic that Kahn should die in an apparently replacement of an American architectural gemstone, an old Pennsylvania station that has been destroyed to make a sterile substitution that has no character and no memory of the citizen. Many young emotional moments have been filmed during Young Kahn's journey, including his sister and mother, but they are genuine and moving, not stomach and staged. Architect historians always explore Kahn. His son found that he remembered him as a faulty but very iconic and ultimately private person. <br /> <br /> 9/10
