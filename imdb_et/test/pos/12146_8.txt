"Classes tous risques" is one of the best "gangsters" movies noirs France has ever produced. Perfect cast: Lino Ventura, young Jean-Paul Belmondo (who made the "soutffle", Godard affair the same year, Marcel Dalio and brilliant sponsor, José Giovanni's brilliant script that also wrote "le trou" in the Becker masterpiece the same year! What a year for him !, Wonderful black and white cinematography from Ghislain Cloquet. Leading Claude Sautet over Jean-Pierre Melville. Since the latest films with metaphysical claims of the gangster film, sometimes lasting more than two hours, lead Claude Sautet's flesh and blood men, and the presence of two children adds extraordinary moments to the Melville, which Melville has never been able to create. And Sautet avoids sabotage, excessive sentimentality: the last time Ventura sees her children, comes to the subway (subway) with a meager emotion. <br /> <br /> Ventura represents gangster Predicted when movie starts. He thinks he can rely on his former acquaintances, but they are all cowards. ), who live in rotting microcosm, are ready to inform us, we are far from the simple behavior of Jean Seberg Godard "opus" -. <br /> <br /> Clot is marveling at the picture: the scene on the beach at night, when two children see their mother's death after shooting with customs, is absolutely outrageous. <br /> <br /> Good use of voice commands, which Sautet uses only when it is needed, so the last lines make the end even stronger than when we have taken scenes. <br /> <br /> Claude Sautet had found a good niche and followed the "class tous risques" rules quite well with his follow-up "l'arme à gauche" (1965), which included Ven Tura again and used the desert and the ship. If he had continued in that vein, France would have had Howard Hawks. In his later works, only "Max et les ferrailleurs" (1971) showed something shining in the first half of the sixties. He received "les choses de la vie" from the director of cinema de qualité, who was focused on a gentle citizen in works such as "Cesar et Rosalie" (1972) "Vincent François, Paul et les autres" (1974) or "Mado" ( 1976)
