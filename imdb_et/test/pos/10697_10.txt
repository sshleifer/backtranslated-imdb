This movie is the biggest ninja movie I think has ever been made, and if you haven't seen it, it's worth watching. I would appreciate this movie as if you would like to see more if you look at http://uk.geocities.com/ninja3thedomination The opening order in which the evil ninja kills everyone on his way is great because his character is the best. Then she must have a young woman who finds her dying. He then retaliates the police officers who killed him, which means there is more killing and action. But only a ninja can destroy a ninja, so he and his boy, who is one of his goals, will help Yamadi (Sho Koshu) to free the evil ninja spirit and destroy it.
