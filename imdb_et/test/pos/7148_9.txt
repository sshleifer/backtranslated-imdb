It's a great movie ... it's funny, dark, poignant, thoughtful, innocently naughty and generally entertaining. I don't know that I've seen similar ... "Rapture" or perhaps Todd Solondz's "comedies" at night or even the last movie "Teeth" ... but these are all bitter, nasty little gems. "Franklins", despite the darkness of the edges, succeed in getting a deeply sincere and pure heart. <br /> <br /> The story is similar to John Waters' "Low Down Dirty Shame", only this movie is different from it is actually a story and something to say outside Waters minor "Sex is not dirty (smoker, nudge -nudge) "message. A conservative, repressed family becomes drastic as a result of a car accident, and suddenly it is no longer so conservative ... in fact they are actually really happy, probably the only people in their city (or perhaps the whole world)) who is. Talking about why this is, would be a film violation; Simply put, everyone should see it, though of course only those people who have already sold what the movie's spooky, hopeful philosophy ever is. <br /> <br /> The actor is great - this is the side that is realistic to hold the procedure too hard ... Teresa Willis gives a very memorable and courageous presentation as a tiny mother who appears as a butterfly when she is released. He and Robertson Dean deserve praises for their unreasonably sincere representations (not to mention frequent and extensive nudity and sexual scenes); they change, which could have been a funny joke that involves "deviant sex practice" for a credible and loving moment. Aviva as a daughter is extraordinary and someone to look at, perfectly capturing the attitudes, nervousness and speech of her age girls. Vince Pavia, as "himbo", who has a secret, is good looking and functional, although his story and how everyone responds to it is more profitable than his actual action. Mari Blackwell, the mother of Franklin's controversial best friend, is perfectly cold, confusing and even compassionate in the role that could have been transferred. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is fantastic, all bright colors and wide -open locales ... it would seem that it could have shot Hi-def ... if so, the line is very thin, it looks very like a movie . There are many talked about and many philosophical things that will be a little preaching (moreso, I imagine a viewer who disagrees with film policy), but this movie says a lot of things that need to be said. If only people are not afraid to listen and think. The arguments are intelligent and well thought out, in particular by refusing to demonize religious or non-religious parties. <br /> <br /> The end is on an ambiguous side, which I found somewhat disappointed somehow ... I think it would have worked better if the author (like Jay Floyd, since he has brought, written and directed) output, some sort of solution, but then again, it is probably not the case when people with different faiths are struck with each other. At the same time, it was a moving, memorable final picture that stuck me - success. Meanwhile, I'm very glad that Mr. Floyd got this movie and is waiting to share it with as many people as possible. Look at it.
