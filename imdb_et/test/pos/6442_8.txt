For years I have had a distant memory of watching a movie, I looked at the network to find it somewhere and could not find it anywhere, so I thought it was gone. <br /> <br /> UNTIL ... my gran showed me a box that he sent out to Daily Mail and though my skin is not right, but my big surprise was The Water Babies! I wasn't excited for a long time! His big film with a light heart, the songs are not memorable when I was a child when he came out, I would be more stuck in my mind. Unfortunately, it was just a movie that I looked at my granny 10 years ago when I was a little spud. And watching it now, the animation is terrible! and the reproducible voices they make for the sound of movies are completely off! But who cares if your child never thinks about these things, even if they run a boy is about 10 years old and sounds like a boy in the middle of puberty. <br /> <br /> A great classic children's movie!
