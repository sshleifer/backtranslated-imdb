It was rare to see "Checking Out". I have touched on these symbols, laughed at the wonderful script, and was deeply deepened by the true emotions that this ensemble cast and especially by Peter Falk. In fact, one of his scenes in the kitchen of his apartment with his children, where he speaks of his own life, his deep love for his wife and his decisions about his life is so deeply real that it is the highest best of the award-winning Academy results. He is the perfect actor who made himself in this movie. The scriptwriter offers literary knowledge, an era, gifts for dialogue and fun situations that smiled aloud at the theater. I highly recommend "Checking Out" to anyone who wants to enjoy high-quality narration perfectly.
