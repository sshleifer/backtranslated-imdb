Thing must be one of the great movies of all time. Of course, breaking the special effects during this release was impressive, in 1982 I just blew my mind, I would never have seen anything like that! Though the effect itself made the film more frightening, it was the story itself, the music score, the Clartophobic atmosphere in Anarchy, and the communication and tensions between the members of the research center that made it a classic. <br /> <br /> Movies don't get better! In the scene where the chopper drives behind this husky, you assume that some of the stations were bored with some steam. However, if you see that they continue to track down on the US, you think the Norwegians are suffering from some sort of advanced or extreme cabin fever. But this is offset by the imminent open music score that sets the pace! You just know that nothing is right! Here is the mystery until the "thing" appears. <br /> <br /> But the mystery returns as it becomes a kind of sci-fi style of Agatha Christie's "who dunn" (ie ten little Indians) because members don't know which one is really alien. Doubt continues and continues between them as one when they finally fall out or appear abroad. The distraction of the distribution team is absorbed when the film progresses to the final display. <br /> <br /> After 20 years of advances in computer graphics and film production, Thing's special effects do not carry the same weight as in 1982, but not only that it keeps it well, with great lighting.
