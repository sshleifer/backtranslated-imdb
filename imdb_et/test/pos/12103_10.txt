Like many other commentators here, I waited for a taste of music that would satisfy my curiosity - and I got more than I asked. I heard and saw a powerful, fine, sometimes haunting, sometimes touching, lyrical, sentimental (truthfully) and absolutely stunning mix of music and musicians. I was reminded of many forms of Indian music (East India), but at the same time it was very different. <br /> <br /> From the first journey of Baba Zula to Kurdish singer Aynur (what a voice) to the Siyasiyabendi jam session (or "Jugalbandhi" as we call it in India), I enjoyed every minute in the small Turkish bar Selim Seslar (Big fan now :)) and I wanted it not to end. /> <br /> One of the best music comments I've ever seen and heard. <br /> <br /> I want a soundtrack CD and hope to find it on the web soon and also for the old and latest Baba Zula albums. <br /> <br /> A day later, music is still etched in the brain and I don't want it to go away. Turkey and especially Istanbul are now so beautiful and exciting places - and I am going to keep up today to go inside. <br /> <br /> Faith Akin is a pearl.
