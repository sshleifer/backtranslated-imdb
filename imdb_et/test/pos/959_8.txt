Well, this may be a child's film ... maybe, but I won't let my kids look at 9 !, so the one who says it's a boyfriend hmm?!, This is a teenage movie, I agree. but there is a boy back to the movie who can be very good, so good that no one supports the truth or lies. ... I think they write a lesson in the reader what it is ... '' the truth has never passed ''.
