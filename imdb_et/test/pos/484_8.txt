I really like this "Mikado." Manufacturers added some tips to make it more fun for a modern audience - for example, "As a few days may happen" ("a small list" of songs) has been completely updated and some lines are adequately playable. Freedoms were also taken with the law. Costumes are not Japanese, but English 1920s (although some Tittipudlian girls wear 20s inspired kimono). This production is well-choreographed with some of the 1920s dance styles, and there are some extra dancers and bellhops that keep your eyes (as well as the ears) entertained during the songs. If you're a Gilbert & Sullivan purist, these changes can disturb you, but I think they're fine - and I love costumes! <br /> <br /> Felicity Palmer (Katisha) is completely fun; all of his scenes make me ridiculously ridiculous (one of my favorite tunes is when he first enters the door - his dance bells annoy him with his frost, so he slips at the top of his voice, "STOP IT!"). All the other main characters are doing a good job. I especially like Mark Richardson like Pish-Tush (it's toupee!) And Lesley Garrett like Yum-Yum. <br /> <br /> You have to keep in mind that this is filming and setting your expectations. The provision does not change, although filmmakers used some 1930s film techniques to add interest. If this production is one back, the stage makeup for the camera is not changed for close-ups. The lines of the target line are often visible and seem to have eyeliner, lipstick and redness everywhere. I've seen such a thing before the feature film, and it's a little jarring in the beginning. However, I hope you get used to it and enjoy the "The Mikado" what it is worth - a classic in-depth pleasure!
