I think this movie has got it all. This is very cool music that I can never get out of my head. It has cool characters. It's really funny (you know what kind of character you're going to get in and you can tell funny parts every day for three weeks). Despite the bad behavior, the bad cgi and the bad story (going to the police) after the robot, it's really cool. His one of the films that you and your family can watch, come together, eat a pizza, laugh like crazy and watch two more times. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny parts as Kurt was trying to get Edison's attention and gave him a finger and then threw a ball gun at him so they could play the ball. That part I said I remember, remember? - My cousin, who saw it, and showed them what happened. There was also a really funny part when Edision got into the room and Kurt was there (just before the fight) and Kurt talked about his "strange dream" and how he was "Superman". I loved this part even though I've seen it for some time so I don't remember that part. All the actors said were funny, as Kurt says, "I worship you, like God!" robot. <br /> <br /> Although there were some bad things, it was a very good movie. Man, I can't stop laughing. I wish I had this movie. );
