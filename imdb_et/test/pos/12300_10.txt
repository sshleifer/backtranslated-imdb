I first saw this movie in Austria when it first came out and I was attracted by it. It is a passionate and deeply moving work that every filmmaker should experience. What a shame it was never released in DVD format. Perhaps one of those days that will be improved because it would be a disgrace if one of the best films ever made is forgotten for every movie house. <br /> <br /> Why is it that "B" movies like "American Wedding" and "Eurotrip" receive widescreen and full-screen publications, and often special publications with multiple comments and extras, while great works of art like "The Dead" are all but forgotten?
