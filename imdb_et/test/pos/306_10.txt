Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) has been sent to a classified mission to Cambodia during the Vietnam War to murder Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) because he has gone completely mad and no longer takes orders. And since Kurtz is one of the most handsome men in the armed forces, Captain Willard has a hard time understanding how Colonel Kurtz can go to the deep end as he is, killing without clearance and war into his hands. What could this great man suppress from above? Through Willard's long journey into the jungle to find his target, he tries to understand some success why. But what does he decide to do when he finds him? <br /> <br /> All the movies that can start with The Doors' End are a great movie in my book, especially if it can bring the mood and the images shown by the song. Apocalypse Now it does it completely. I do not think of anything better to set it up, the Vietnam War and the madness in the minds of the bidders that it created. AN is a dark and brutal story of a long journey through the Vietnamese furry jungle, whose final destination is murder. Because of the use of music and scores alone, we are thrown into the dark world of mystery, violence and madness. The perfect example of how to bring the mood through music alone is the movie here. The overall big casting, except Laurence Fishburne, of which Sheen and Brando give us more than enough action skills to spread bread at the request of our film. I just don't like Fishburne because I discovered he was from Cowboy Curtis's PeeWee playhouse, my contempt and hatred for this person have grown ten times. I understand this fraud, but I just don't care. We've got him sick of Gary Oldman. Brando is great as Colonel Kurtz and I can't think of another actor who could have played a good man who has gone crazy and kept such a screen. Sheen is also fun to watch as Willard and we can identify her in a survey of her mission and war in general. My favorite movie in the movie must be Robert Duvall's Colonel Kilgore. Before that movie, I never depicted a Duvallian cowboy, but to be honest, it is still a favorite of my parts. She just nailed her character, one of the best movies, like the gung-ho Air Cavalry Commander who loves to surf. Maybe a little up, but still brilliant. I also love the smell of napalm in the morning. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple and it doesn't take too much brain power to find out what's going on. Willard's mission is to kill Kurtz, simple and simple. But this is the journey of the film, which is really the heart and the terrible situation of war itself. In the Redux version, we are forced to sit through an expanded French plantation and a Playboy bunny scene that really doesn't add anything to the whole movie except it makes it a longer journey. I don't feel they take anything away, it's just a question of whether you want to watch a three-and-a-half hour movie or an original. Through this journey, the film proves that war is extremely insignificant and irrelevant to the Americans and its enormous influence on the soldiers who fought in it ... in fact, it is the whole point. In addition, the public did not support the forces, and it could very well help to create a character like Kurtz. <br /> <br /> A great war movie lover, it's with Plato and The Deer Hunter, all classic. Sometimes I try to compare movies from the same genre to each other, but in my past, it is in my reviews, because I had to go back to what I said. All three have their own strengths and they add their twists to the Vietnam War .... so to say that one is better than the other is pretty pointless ... even after the last view AN thinks it's better. Finally, Apocalypse Now is a true classic version that has been given and is worthy of this status. As another reviewer has said before, AN is one of the most ambitious films.
