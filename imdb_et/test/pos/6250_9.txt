I love this movie! When I saw this movie on television when I was a kid, he frightened me of hell. Probably because Mannequins also give me a slip. Jocelyn Jones (Molly) is a great actor. She uses her facial expressions, especially her eyes, playing scared.Chuck Connors is great because Mr.Slausen.I was happy to play him with such a different roll. Other participants in this movie are also great! Tanya Roberts (Becky) and Robin Sherwood (Eileen) are great actors and I hope to see them in future movies, especially Jocelyn Jones! <br /> <br /> So if you love scary movies, but you're tired of seeing the same old thing, check out this movie!
