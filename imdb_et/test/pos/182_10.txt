In his recent review, I referred to a young actress under the leadership of Katerina if she had to be Veronica. I was so involved with the character and the action I think I was not associated with. Anyway, he and the film are great. As I said, the use of cinematography and director editing is worthy of Eisenstein and his operator. Production design is the upper limit. It is necessary to place learners in the foreground, center and background in any mass scene. Stunning, memorable camera movement and end with an emotional punch that leaves Hollywood movies far behind. Gee! Heroic self-sacrifice instead of falling into a rainbow. Thank you again, John Hart
