The film by the famous Czech director and co-writer, Petr Jarchovský, is remarkable in its peculiarities, but with disturbing and disturbing details. The subject and title of Robert Graves' poems he deals with is a woman who has several men and some unpleasant relatives in her life, trying to survive and protect her two children, 15-year-old Lucina (Michaela Mrvikova) and a little blonde asthma in Cuba (Adam Misik). The poem has a lot of evidence, but the subject - it gets a little lost. <br /> <br /> Marcela (Anna Geislerová), Beauty and Jarda (Roman Luknár) have all lost now in the floods of 2002, and they have nothing to seem like, but the good sex they revenge in their tiny apartment that Lucina and Cuba in front of the TV must keep their ears against noise. Hrebejek enjoys this kind of explanation and skates with embarrassment or shock. That's why there is no exact explanation, but the financial despair has led Jarda to steal stolen cars in a large garage next to his apartment table. His auto-thief cohort is led by Volvo's positioning Benes (Josef Abrham), who has left the keys when he visited the great possessions he owns. Benes is a super-nice man, but not stupid. His Volvo is tracking wired satellites in such cases, and directs the police directly to Jarda's garage and he and his cohort are in jail. <br /> <br /> "A good angel is running out of trouble," he says. But in fact it is a frase of Benesit Marcela when she meets the police station. She introduces her to sushi and how to drink wine and capture her with Tuscany's picture book, where she, although born in Prague, is a beautiful villa and lived most of her life. He is here to demand a house in Prague, now occupied by a couple who has an old and weak mother whom he promises to stay. Benes every gesture is benevolent, although he doesn't stop Jarda from going to jail. <br /> <br /> In these circumstances, Marcela, together with Lucina and Cuba, must withdraw from their mother, Zdena, charity (Jana Brejchova) and Zdena's current husband, the frightening diabetic Richard Hrstka (Jiri Schmitzer), much less gently for the children who start the cardinal sin of the consumption of cookies in their diets proves to be a great uncle of hell. Jiri Schmitzer steals the film here and will never let it go. Even in the last scene, he is an indicator of an imminent threat. It is surprising that the reluctant Richard does not abuse one or both children. He urges Marcela to go out and, if Benes offers him under his wing, they become Richard and become an unchanged ally. Unlikely - maybe unlikely. Why should Benes like him? But what is Benes' whole story? For some things, the film provides too much information and for others it is not enough. It is clear that "good angel", Benes, is unmistakably kind - and polished, a good-looking older man whose ways fit his Italian upbringing. It is only at the end when he attacks the military on the property of Prague, he proves that he is not the one who does not want to lie or go over. <br /> <br /> You also have to deal with Jarda's religious fanatic mother, Sdena (Jana Brejchova), and have a look at her communication with Zdena and Richard. But he's just another wild card that doesn't raise the deck. <br /> <br /> The poem has been put on the music in the Czech language and is sung by the accordion-vocalist Raduza, first in a tiny scene, then more widely, directed by Jarda and the car lord. If you restore the author of Hrebejk, you can enjoy this sequence; otherwise it tends to feel free. Also included are a number of Glen Hansard / Marketa Irglova songs from the Oscar Award-winning Irish "One Time", including the latest theme song "Falling". They feel more than they would otherwise be because they would feel "once" - even though this film was first introduced. <br /> <br /> Hrebejk people arrest; even the small Cobal has the moments and rich charm of his Shakespeare child; but the director and his writer are unable to resist the temptation to fall and expand. The temptation of real estate in Benes can be helpful if you show that it has a tough side. But such a complex demonstration was not necessary. Action is good and admiration and peculiarity is wonderful, but the main themes of love, gender and money disappear in the shuffle and Marcela conflicts and how it solves them will never be clear. It is good that the subject and the Graves poem is not a resolution and it is true that Marcelal is still hot with Jarda when she has visited Prague again after Benes and her children moving to Tuscany. But there are still too many questions about what to do about unpleasant Richard or Jarda's disgusting mother-in-law (Emilia Vásáryová). How suddenly do we learn that Koba receives letters from India allegedly from his father who is in prison? When was it born? Interesting details that are quickly pasted. It seems like a world where you don't see trees in the forest.
