"Tambi Velvet" is one of today's television productions that show that some television can be as good or even better (as it is) than what you see in a local theater. <br /> <br /> If you want to read the plot, read it and if you want other details to go to the next paragraph. It's an unforgettable young girl named Nan, who works as a na√Øve oyster girl until she discovers her repressed homosexuality when she falls in love with a successful woman named Kitty, who dresses up as a male artist.

Action, writing, and leadership are extremely strong and full of reality, class, and originality. I loved the movie and the novel. Part III of the movie is a lot different in the film than in the novel, because the novel in Section III is very much written but not the screen material. I'm brave and I say I love this movie a lot more. <br /> <br /> This breathtaking historical brilliant combines drama, comedy, eroticism and romance with lively perfection in a way that is both deeply moving and spiritually uplifting. For every mature and open-minded adult who has ever felt the love and lively joy of life, pain and power, it is perfect. Revolutionary production; Absolute Must-It!
