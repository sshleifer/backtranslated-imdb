There is something that one character (an aging film director who pretends to be dead) says he can sum up the whole movie: "In Italy, it's dead who rule". True! It is a country without the future, in the hands of old and imprisoned men. And the secret portrait of the Bellocchio state, which drew attention to the seemingly pointless story of a leader who has to live for married couples, says a lot about what doesn't work here. However, foreigners may leave this point because it is not clearly expressed. I understand that the Australian or Canadian people who watch it can get bored and wonder if it makes sense - well, there is meaning, but it's only clear to people who live here today and keep their eyes open ... like Bellocchio. Surely this is not one of his best films and it is not as powerful as Buongiorno, notte, but it is worth the Italians living in Italy.
