To remove a caper such as Rifif (such as Score and its opines), you must have steel nerves. It probably requires it and tells you. Jules Dassin is the captain. <br /> <br /> I was all over the seat. It deserves to be better known, although it was not at the time of its publication in 1954, provided that the director was on the black day's hypocritical Hollywood list. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who doesn't see this joy. <br /> <br /> I can't give it enough stars.
