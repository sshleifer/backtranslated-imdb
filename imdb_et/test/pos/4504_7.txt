Can the film be too faithful to this book? Judging by the time-saving adaptation of Khaled Hussein's huge salesman in 2003, the answer is ironically "yes". Like many, I lost a book, an impressive first effort by an Afghan-American writer / doctor. So, apparently, director was Marc Forster ("Stranger Than Fiction") and screenwriter David Benioff ("Troy"), who pay close attention to the most important details of the story during the 127-minute movie. However, the seamless tapestries of the cordial events in the Hossein novel are often episodic and trimmed, because Forster and Benioff are sincerely trying to remain within the scope of the story for a fairly limited time. Some of the challenges are how Hossein carefully used symbolic actions to provide a literary, then-now-symmetry, which is essentially a triple story, a technique that can meet somewhat against the screen. <br /> <br /> But filmmakers are doing the most important things right, giving the viewer an intimate look at the hidden culture that has been transmitted through CNN's news so far, ensuring authenticity when characters are spoken in the Afghan language Persian dialect and embracing emotional complex narrative confusion . The first part of the film was set in 1978 in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion and the possible takeover of the Taliban. The focus is on the relationship between Amir, the son of the wealthy businessman Baba and the devoted son of Hassan, his father. Through their mutual love associated with killing a dragon, they are both thick as thieves until a tragic event is separated. She can't find the courage of her father so naturally that Amir is guilty because she has not rescued Hassan from the trivial acts of the local bullies. Forster makes the ethnic tensions between Hazara and Pashtun in Afghanistan particularly sensitive. <br /> <br /> After the 1979 invasion by Soviet troops, Amir and Baba fled to the US, where the story rises nine years later in Fremont, California, a suburb of Afghan emigrants. Baba has been reduced to work at a gas station and works in a flea market. Amir meets a local Afghan girl and marries. This is the least interesting passage of the film, because Benioff's treatment gives a short stroke to side effects like Amir's wife Soraya and most critically, Amir is depicted as an indispensable young man who has his own self-esteem. The last part blinks for 12 years, when Amir called back to the Taliban dictated to Afghanistan after his first book was released to rescue Hassan's son from the Taliban to reconcile his coward years earlier. The story in this respect is a real break and fear, because the shocking revelations and old acquaintances return to Amir on their journey. <br /> <br /> British actor from Egyptian legacy to Khalid Abdalla (leading hijacker) "United 93") is a central role for Amir as an adult, as he has to pass on the constant stigma and diminished self-worth. Other professional actors are better - Shaun Toub (Tony Stark's rescuer Yinsen in the current "Iron Man") as Baba's business partner Rahim Khan, who has the key to truth; Atossa Leoni quietly acts like Soraya; and best of all, Iranian actress Homayoun Ershadi, who brings Babe with pride and dignity. Three young non-professionals were recruited from the Kabul school system to play the main role of children, and everything is pretty good. Zekeria Ebrahimi is the challenge for the toughest part as the young Amir and Ali Danish Bakhtyari are amazing as Hassan's almost catatonic son, Sohrab. But it is sad, six-faced Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada, who breaks your heart as a young Hassan, especially in the devastating pomegranate scene. It is fair to say that her performance is equivalent to the classic classic "Vicorio de Sica" by the young "Bicycle Thieves" by Enzo Staiola. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects are well done, especially Roberto Schaefer's pure cinematography (convincing West China), Afghan substitutes), Alberto Iglesias reminder score and even CGI effects that show kites flying kites. The 2008 DVD has a strong set of extras that begin with an understandable comment on Forster, Hossein and Benioff, although some of their dialogue seems to be quite forced. Including two feature films - the first is the 14-minute "Kite Runner Words", which focuses on Hossein's relationship to story and novel development, and the second is a 25-minute "Kite Runner Pics" ", reviewing the more traditional scenes of production. trailer, some previews and Hossein PSA on how to help Afghans in their present time.
