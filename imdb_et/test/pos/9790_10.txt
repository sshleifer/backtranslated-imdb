Bobby and Mikey are two little boys moving over with their divorced mother to start a new life. Soon after the family settles down, their mother, the "king", will come to a malicious stepfather, especially Bobby. So Bobby decides to "fly away" his birthday gift. <br /> <br /> This movie was hard to watch, especially with abuse scenes. It was hard to see an innocent, playful little boy abused and become a terrified scared and distressed young man. Action is great. <br /> <br /> I screamed throughout the last half of the movie. There were also funny scenes, such as Monster Brew and a dog with pop bottles. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend children to watch this. It was a movie that was painful to look at and still flew.
