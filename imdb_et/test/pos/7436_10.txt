It's not really hard to understand this movie! I looked at it without hope and the unknown story of the game. I was completely blown away. <br /> <br /> Initially, I was wondering how most of the characters have some super powers, but it's called "the ultimate fantasy ...". I also thought about Cloud's past, but it was easy enough to search. Under no circumstances did these issues violate the enjoyment of the film. On the contrary; it shows that I had to think about the story constantly after seeing the film. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most beautiful movies my eyes have ever seen. Music fully supports the movie. The characters are incredible. <br /> <br /> I want more!
