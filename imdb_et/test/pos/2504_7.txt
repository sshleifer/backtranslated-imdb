Apart from being filmed mainly in Rockport MA, a beautiful city where my mother rented a small shop and spent a lot of pleasant summer as a child, it's a fun and cute little movie. I have to admit that I had no desire to actually see this movie, although I have a romantic comedy weakspot (I don't know why). The trailers I saw were not attractive, the cast did not look so interesting and I had no idea what the plot would be like. Finally, I found it to be an interesting meditation about relationships and family. I enjoyed myself thoroughly and I have to admit that I thought this film was one of the most remarkable gems of last year. I'm disappointed that so few people seemed to have enjoyed the very "human" that this movie showed to the viewer. <br /> <br /> I have read a lot of bad comments on this movie and have to admit some level of shocking cynicism. As a graduate student, I find myself quite cynical, but it was a beautiful little film that deserves much better than it was.
