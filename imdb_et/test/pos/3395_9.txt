Having been following this with my mother (who got it for Christmas), I was glad to find something other than the usual thing I usually look at. All the stories were detailed and you feel a strong emotion from the beginning on each character. Every story follows perfectly, making you feel completely different from all the characters. The cast is amazing, my personal favorites are James Read and Lesley-Anne Down, like George Hazard and Madeline Fabray / LaMotte / Main. The whole thing is deep and wonderful, making a very compulsive look, I recommend it to almost everyone.
