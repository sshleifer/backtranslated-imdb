I liked Carmen thoroughly, better than the original sin (Angelina Jolie & Antonio Bandaras), which has some thematic similarities and which I also enjoyed. I felt that acting here was stronger (Paz Vega showed a wider range, more fire, and Sbaraglia was also great). Generally speaking, their actions were sharper, more plausible (less dreaming than the original sin and both participants had less "celebrity status" and "real face" to depend on making the film. Vega would surely be sizzles as expected. <br /> <br /> Director Vincente Aranda has also built a detailed world (again better than the original sin) that allows you to feel the abundance of archaic Spain and the daily routine - for example, people who unload goods on the street, street candles are replaced by employees, all in the background. <br /> <br / > Although I deeply sympathize with the recent idea of ​​redeeming our femme fatals (like Brian de Palma Femme Fatale), Carmen is a poisonous, modern key to the classic double-reward tradition and is a delight to look at. The price of Hollywood.
