I agree with the posters before the characters were exceptionally strong and credible, and all the actors were their first. I especially loved David Boreanaz, stretching it so that, unlike what he was playing, he once again proved his amazing gift for comedy. The first part of the movie was light and funny, the blackmail part was a bit surreal, but interesting - and it was downhill. <br /> <br /> I find it frustrating that there are at least two out of three girls. (Keira and Lisa) are freed from blackmail and treachery, again from the traces of their psyche. I know the movie changed the darker end of the game - and I'm not saying I killed the murderer. But I definitely had to see the two so that they could get their results in some way, and I was left with a calm down. (This is why I gave it only nine) <br /> <br /> But definitely an interesting movie.
