One of my duties is that when things are slow, I can watch a movie in our theater on the ground floor (I work in a small 2-screen theater) crying in the room and keeping an eye on the concession base. I've probably seen Italian work 20 times and I'm still not tired. The atmosphere reminds me of the ocean, although it is not so good. Mark Wahlberg is ok, Charlize Theron invites men, but Seth Green is in this movie AWESOME. I thought Edward Norton did a great job with the dirtbag, although many people do not agree. I also liked Mos Def as an explosive expert who is afraid of dogs. I recommend this movie very well and look at it whenever I can!
