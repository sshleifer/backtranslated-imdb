I saw this movie at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival and director Aku Louhimies introduced his film and was available after Q&A. For some reason, this movie is called "Frozen Land in English", so I don't know how the distributors froze from evil. This is a very good movie. It's not enough for me to knock this top class, but I talked to some viewers who thought it was a great movie. Louhimies said that back in Finland, people loved this movie or hated it and said that many theaters were there. I am sure some are against violence, swearing, drug and alcohol abuse and sexual comfort. This is a very clever story about how these different lives are woven because it is the result of slipping. This movie is very interesting and strong. I would appreciate it from 7.0 out of 10 possible and I would see it again and recommend it carefully.
