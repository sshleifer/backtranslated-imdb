This is one of the best films I've seen for years. I took a new time and place. It would be like there with Ray through many experiments and triumphs. Jamie Foxx changed himself to Ray. During the movie he was Ray. Kerry Washington, Sharon Robinson and Regina King were great. The film was well cast and staged, the music was fantastic. <br /> <br /> I've seen the movie four (4) times with different people and the last time was as enjoyable as the first time. I buy a DVD as soon as it is released. This is a film that will be reviewed over and over for years. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your excellent experience.
