I read the book before watching the movie and the film is one of the best adjustments. Very true and faithful to the book. Sean Penn and Sarandon are amazing. Robbins is a talented filmmaker and I would like to add more to his repetition. He made the film very strange and deliberately slow to add depth. Particularly brilliant filmmaking was the reflection of the victims that appeared on the glass of the executive space immediately.
