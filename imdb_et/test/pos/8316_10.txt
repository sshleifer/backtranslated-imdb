SPOILER WARNING <br /> <br /> I got this dino-documentarie on DVD during Christmas 2004. I was longing to see it and was in no way disappointed. The result is memorable (my <br /> <br /> favorites were "Sauropod" theme song and "Winters Coming" song. The effects were dazzling, you could almost believe they were there. You actually learn something; Stegosaurs may have been able to T-Rexes MIGHT has killed her plates with blood before killing eggs, I know there are many people who thought it was based on too much speculation, but there are always some questions we just think. we know that some dinosaurs traveled in herds, we know that Diplodocus swallowed stones to polish their stomach vegetation. Despite this "speculation", the series went very well, so well that it created a follow-up, prequel and several special offers If you are a dino fan then this is for you, making Jurassic Park small and distrustful.
