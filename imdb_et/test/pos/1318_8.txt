The only pure life is that which ends with the signature in the blood. <br /> <br /> So Mishima says, anyway, a young protected boy who will be the author of celebrities. The life of Japan's most famous literary voices is spoken from three perspectives, his life just before he and his four members of the private army were taken over by the Japanese military base and ritual suicides (shown in color), setbacks (black and white) and scenes from his novels (shown in some dreamy Technicolor image located in somewhere between the traditional Noh Theater and "Ozzi Wizard".) These stories are often spoken at the same time, but they are changed to strengthen, slow the combination of Mishima's life with his fiction until the end (or the beginning) if he, like an ancient samurai, admires him so much, she is in the balance between a pen and a sword (if her words and deeds are the same, and she is full and "pure".) Paul Schrader wrote a "Taxi Driver" screen game and directed "Cat People" (a strange erotic horror film that left me as a boy for strange things) impressions) and in Mishima he is closest to making a really great movie. <br /> <br /> What's interesting about seeing a poet, a homosexual, a shy, and uncomfortable low-body man who surpassed his tuberculosis to get WW2 (which he seems to be ashamed of forever) to become a body, a samurai obsessed, a-sexual, media, while writing rich novels, stories and short stories. <br /> <br /> The short and sweet version is to say that Mishimal does not have a father and it is masculine, beauty, sex and self-destructive, in some tragic attempts to feel anything bigger than himself that he was always lost. Looking at her along with her suicide cadets, you see her happy, giving her great paternal speech, giving orders and lovingly controlling ... to talk to you, to the point where the pen and the sword meet? Of course, it ignores the nuance of a craft story that makes its transformation so natural and remarkable. <br /> <br /> Although the story, sometimes exciting, is not the greatest success of films. Filmmaking, performances, editing, music (Philip Glass) and designs are really what it deserves to be mentioned, and more than a traditional bio-image. <br /> <br /> One day I pick up Mishima's book, it seems that he has an ear for prose and ideas, but now I'm happy with the peace. <br /> <br /> Those interested in Japanese literature and post-war culture should check. Fans of combinations of factual and fictional inventions should also enjoy.
