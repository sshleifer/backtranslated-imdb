Evil Professor Moriarty is trying to gain control of both SHERLOCK HOLMES and SECRET WEAPON, which could fight against the Nazis. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce return to the screen like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's beloved detective and Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, in this fun little mystery. Universal Studios does not waste money on fancy product values ​​or on a sensible script, knowing that its two stars would be all the attractions that the audience would need. Indeed, Rathbone, like the brain ego, and Bruce, like the bow, seem to be the changing characters they create, keeping their faces straight when they deal with the most complete nonsense. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hoey makes his first appearance as an inspector inspired by the Scottish yard in Lestrade; Bruce joined these two good hearted but pedantic associates to save intellectually better Holmes's life twice. Lionel Atwill, an unhappy master who deserves more recognition for his recognition, does a good job like Moriarty, making a godly enemy a Holmes steel-worthy enemy, releasing scenes where he gets torture and pain. William Post Jr. and Kaaren Verne play a Swiss scientist and a girlfriend who is at the heart of the mystery, but they are not given much to do. Sweet Mary Gordon makes a symbolic look for Holmes' homeowner, Mrs. Hudson. <br /> <br /> Rathbone spices out his classic Holmes interpretation when he appears in the story three times during the story, revealing to the viewer that this great ghost was an actress close to the heart. <br /> <br /> This movie - based very loosely on Sir Arthur's short stories "The Dancing Men" and "The Empty House". followed by SHERLOCK HOLMES AND TERROR'S VOICE (1942) and preceded by SHERLOCK HOLMES WASHINGTON (1943).
