I loved this movie the first time I saw it. It gives a detail of what the news industry leaders do to get the story out of the air: namely, Jane Craig, who rushed to Kenny to finish editing it, and then Joan Cusack tries to get it and William Hurt, who says Jane makes it incredible violation of ethics, falsifies his tears during his rape interview, a mistake made by Aaron. Another big point is when Tom uses Jane for his benefits and then turns around and sleeps with Jennifer. The script is brilliant and management is almost as good. All three major players were great when portraying their characters, especially Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks, who is the most funny of the film. William Hurt is also very good. It deserved at least three Oscars, the best actor (holly hunter), the best supporting actor (Albert Brooks) and the best picture. I liked the last parts of the movie, where they show them reunion 7 years later. <br /> <br /> 8/10
