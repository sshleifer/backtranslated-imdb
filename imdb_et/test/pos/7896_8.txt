Wealthy businessman Bill Compton (played by Dennis Patrick) accidentally kills his daughter's hippie boyfriend. In panic, he comes down to the bar and meets Joe Curran (played by Peter Boyle): loud mouth, angry, bigot, bitter about how his beloved country has changed. Inadvertently, Bill Joe lets him know he just killed the hippie. And that's just the beginning. "Joe" is a classic film of unlikely friendship. Relationship between two men, one from a white-collar background, the other from a blue collar background. Bill & Joel is one thing in common, they are ashamed of how the world is crazy. Dennis Patrick & Peter Boyle have both provided very realistic images of their characters. Director John G. Avidsen, with this "pre-Rocky" effort, directs this low-cost pearl to the finest film with a $ 100 million budget. The script is loaded with excellent character and very gentle, realistic dialogue. Despite its strengths, this film has weaknesses. The script sleeps about 3/4 of the way, but it wakes up at the right time. This film also includes 24-year-old Susan Sarandon, like Bill's daughter Melissa, with her hipster Frank very early and endless performance, which Patrick Mc Dermott showed very gently. It could be just grateful that he was killed at the beginning of the movie. Despite its few shortcomings, it is one of the 70's forgotten movies that shouldn't be. Although "Joe" is very dated to today's standards, Dennis Patrick & Peter Boyle's chemistry is nowadays quite appropriate, and it's the glue that keeps the whole movie together.
