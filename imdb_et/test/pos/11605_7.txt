I agree with what mallicka.b said. The film is portrayed in a way that seems to be a peculiar content to the original misery. Emotions are not transmitted correctly. I think many non-so good performances contributed to mediocrity. In my opinion, Tabu would have been a much better choice than Aishwarya Rai. In some of his scenes, he sees a little strange, which is not ultimately what the film should represent. I also noticed that some of my scenes were somewhat overwhelming. I'm a bitter critic of Aishwarya Rai :) Can't help it; sorry for that. "Raincoat" was a good movie from Rituparno Ghosh. And I saw Choker Bali seeing Raincoat; I wasn't impressed at all.
