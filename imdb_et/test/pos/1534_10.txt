Even the trailer of this movie makes me cry like the first time I saw this movie. Not for people who are intensely disturbed by intense material! Undoubtedly, Alan Rickman and Madelaine Stowe were the best performers. This terrible story of a society that has the ability to rob and torture its citizens for every reason, whether they are anarchists or children's book writers, cool you down to the bone. I saw it coming out for the first time, and I remember every shot. It still scares me today. This is happening now. <br /> <br /> Obviously, IMDb requires ten lines to meet movie review criteria. IMDb Could GET A GRIP! Some of us are slightly shorter in writing their opinions.
