I accidentally happened to Cinemax when I was able to surf. I have to admit that what attracted me was Christopher Walken. And the device was what I would like, so I started watching it. At first I was expecting a serious drama film and it seemed for a while ... until I started to strangle here and there and before I knew it, I smiled so hard through the movie. I really like how subtle and light it is, but it still has a big impact on the audience. The plot is very simple, and it's not too hard to be funny, as many Hollywood comedies are, but ran almost to the floor. Must see a nice evening rest or in any case in such a case.
