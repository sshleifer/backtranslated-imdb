Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) was a great parody of Mel Brooks. He has appointed Robin Hood's legacy and a couple of films that deal with the mythical honor of the English folklore. Cary Elwes stands for Robin Hood. He is looking for some good men to join him in his attempt to destroy Nottingham's evil sheriff (Roger Rees) and defeat Maid Maria's right hand. Robin must also deal with Prince John (Richard Lewis). Tracey Ullman celebrates Prince John's personal witch Latrine, who has eyes on the Sheriff. <br /> <br /> Will Robin find his joyful men? How far does the Prince go to throw his weight in his father's absence? Why does Sheriff hate Robin so much? To find out you need to look at ROBIN HOOD: MEN'S CONTROLS! See the fun-filled Dom De Luise camouflage who plays the Duke of Jersey. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
