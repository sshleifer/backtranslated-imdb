Of course, he has his exciting moments, it plays like an art house, a live-action Fantasy, but it also has moments of deep beauty and humor. Omnibus movies are always a problem, but I am always very interested in them. I now value the segments individually. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Roeg - "Un ballo in maschera" - This segment can very well spoil a movie for some people because it is absolutely a bunch. It's hard to follow, mostly because he's trying to hackneyed. Photography is unfinished. The best thing about this lesbian homoerotica is that it is not enough. This segment made me continue. 2/10. <br /> <br /> Charles Sturridge - "La virgine degli angeli" - an unclear segment, but it is hardly important. The film has the best cinema cinema, mainly because it is in black and white. The segment is dreamy and beautiful. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Jean-Luc Godard - "Armies" - I decided to shock this much annoyance for Godard and Altman segments. With Godard I was much more impressed than I thought it would be. I can't claim to have seen all that many of his films have done because he did so much that almost no one has seen it, but deciding what I've seen can be his best work since the 60s. This is the funniest segment of this movie and the most artistic. Bravo, Jean-Luc! 9/10 Julien Temple - "Rigoletto" - a very funny segment, it is also quite predictable. Nonetheless, this story is about a man and a spouse who cheat each other at the same resort, with superbly filmed long, sophisticated tracing frames that depend precisely on timed choreography. It also has a great self-interest in jokes about its own omnibus movies. The last scene is very weak. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Bruce Beresford - "Die tote Stadt" - this short segment includes too many lovers in Russia. It's beautiful, some beautiful pigeons that fly around the city. It's easy, but nice. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Robert Altman - "Les Bor√©ades" - is not one of the best segments, unfortunately, it is rather a short video of a music video than a concept. This includes the inhabitants of the crazy shelter who participate in the theater. Music and pictures work well, so at least I can give it a good music video. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Franc Roddam - "Liebestod" - somewhat regrettable for the Beresford segment, this segment is very similar. As you might expect from your wording, it hit me a lot more. It's about a young man and his girlfriend who goes to Las Vegas on a fatalistic journey. 8/10 <br /> <br /> Ken Russell - "Nessun dorma" - perhaps the most visually eye-catching segment, it plays fantasy more than in reality. This is a beautiful story about a fallen angel. 8/10 <br /> <br /> Derek Jarman - "Depuis le jour" - I've heard a lot about Jarman, and it's the first filmmaker I've ever seen about him. Hopefully I will see more in the future. It's also a music video, but it's better than the Altman segment. This mainly concerns an older woman who remembers her younger days. Editing and using different film stocks to represent time and emotion is very beautiful. Bill Bryden - "I pagliacci" - a sad clown, perhaps one of the most famous arias (especially the memorable Seinfeld episode), it works for every segment and finals. It's simple and effective. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Generally, I give it a solid 7/10. It's not nearly as bad as you've heard.
