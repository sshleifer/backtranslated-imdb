First of all, I would like to say that I am just an amateur by commenting on a film and that English is not my mother tongue, but I felt a strong sense of compelling me to write such a movie; possible to thank and congratulate Jay Cox, cast and team for such brilliant production. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I was watching for the first time the last few days. <br /> <br /> At first I thought it might be similar to the movie "Priest", which I really liked when I showed you had come out of the closet. But the "priest", perhaps due to its restrictive Catholic ideological perceptions, did not give the needs of my spectators the end of deep sorrow. and some others, such as the principles of Mormon); present a delicate and joyful story, bringing it to a happy and emotional end, and at the same time creating a sense of God's blessing and hope. Great movie is really! <br /> <br /> In some way, "Late Days" made me feel like L.A. as the city of angels. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who loves amazingly beautiful gay love stories!
