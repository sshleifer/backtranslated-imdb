I was totally surprised how good this movie really is, because when I first saw it, I was just amused! However, I must say that I am still very disappointed that Donald O'Connor was not given a bigger and better role! He was a huge talent. <br /> <br /> Among all the major cast members is great chemistry, and Matthau has never been funny. <br /> <br /> I am very glad that this picture has been taken because we see the Lemmon and Matthau teams last; in a vehicle that puts their talent to great use. Brent Spiner proves that Star Trek's next "Data" of Geeration is not the only good character he can play. <br /> <br /> The story is really quite simple, but comedy and characters work really well and I laughed at the whole movie and I recommend it very much.
