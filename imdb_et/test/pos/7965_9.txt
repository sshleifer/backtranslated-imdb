I was very happy and at the same time quite surprised by other positive comments that are not Korean below. This film is amazingly hearthaking, and shows a very "sad but warm" view of life that is typical of the Korean nation. I thought other foreigners wouldn't understand this delicate feeling and this quiet movie as boring, but I was wrong. The attractiveness of this film to foreigners may also be difficult to avoid. (Even without a subtitle ...) <br /> <br /> I would like to mention some points that others have left. Of course, this film represents love between a man and a woman. But this topic is beyond that. In fact, it's time, the value of memory and death. This film does not focus on the love relationship between two people. As some noted, they can't kiss, they don't hug each other, even without holding hands. Thus, the film itself is not ready (either positively or negatively). Rather than being haunted by Jungwon (the leading actor), his impending death. He's running out of time, he can't hold it, leaving a couple behind, including Dad and, of course, Darim (forest). So the problem is how he can face death and leave something valuable in his short life, not how he can love Darim. There are many movies about patients with incurable illness, such as Love Story. But what makes this movie outstanding is how Jungwon is doing his death. She's a loser, but she tried to do her best when she was alive. He doesn't tell anyone about him about his death. He hides something in his mind, but without rage, hatred, revenge. He just tried to do it when he was alive. This limited communication and obedience to fate is a typical way of thinking in Korea and a point that most Western countries do not understand or at best understand. surprising, his debut). Some say it is influenced by Japanese director Ozu Yasujiro, who led the Tokyo story. Indeed, I remember reading in a magazine that the director himself admitted that he was influenced by Ozu. I can't analyze my style compared to Ozu, but they have some in common and some don't. Low angle and static camera, especially reminding us of Ozu style. On the subject, it seems again that this Korean director has a somewhat warmer and more promising vision. <br /> <br /> This is briefly illustrated with Jungwon's last photo. I think it's very well done and really heartbeat. In fact, the director had the idea of ​​a movie when he participated in the funeral of a very famous Korean folk song that had died of mysterious suicide. They say they saw the singer's photo at the funeral and thought about the death and memory of the movie. (And maybe I hope the remnants will stay ...) <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to anyone who is deeply interested in both art and Korean culture. In my opinion, this film can compete with other films such as the Tokyo story and sort of American beauty. It is as big as a language barrier. The DVD version will come out on the market in February, so it may be a little help for foreigners with English subtitles.
