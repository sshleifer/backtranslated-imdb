There was a French movie mood and I saw it in Blockbuster. What a little pearl it turned out to be! I'm not sure how I managed all these years with Gregor Derangere, but he's fantastic. Such innocence and arm! I love his face and the way he moves. Isabelle Adjani was cheerful - reminded me of Nicole Kidman's Moulin Rouge's top performance. She looks like 20 years ago ... truly remarkable. Gerard Depardieu hasn't nearly stuck, but his action continues to be astonishing. He's perfect in this movie. Obviously I buy it, I enjoyed it so much. If you want to see another great French movie, rent a Joyeux Noel. Stunning.
