It's one of my favorite films EVER ... I've seen it about a million times and never miss a chance to watch it again. In fact, I love it so much that I really wanted to look at the resort where it was filmed on my upcoming vacation ... does anyone know its name? If so, please send me !!! I was watching this movie the first time it was first released, and I was about Nikki's age and for a long time beating my dad to get me somewhere because of course I assumed that the same thing would happen to me! It's just such an amazing device and such a lovely puppy-love story. This is a sure DVD collector needs!
