Please let me know of all the versions of the Vibe or Gone to Earth video that people are aware of. I love Mary Webb's books with all my heart and I would be very grateful if I have information about VHS or DVD. <br /> <br /> I read a valuable bane and ride that is a favorite of Mary Webb. Many times she has collected other novels. I was lucky to have found his "Joy Springs" poetry and essays, but I've never seen a valuable version of the bane that was in the Masterpiece Theater, or the full version of Gone to Earth, although there was a classic incarnation of the American film The Wild Heart. which was originally filmed on the ground of Gone. <br /> <br /> If someone can help me to get copies of both or both movies (full versions), I would be very grateful!
