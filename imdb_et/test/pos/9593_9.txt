I think this television was filmed for the first time in the week that Manchester Utd played in the Champions League finals (1999), running a lot of football-related items this week, and that was an absolute challenge. <br /> <br /> It played on all the clich√©s that have been cut out during the FA Cup every season, that is, happy sources, happy clothes / mascots, the name on the cup etc. and turned out to be funny. <br /> <br /> Surprised that it has never been repeated before other big football matches have been repeated, even if the World Championship is starting. Some previous posts for non-football fans have said they still love it, but the football fan finds it fun.
