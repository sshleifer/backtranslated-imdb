Rififs, directed by Jules Dassin, is in line with Melville's crime images (especially Bob le Flameur and Le Cercle Rouge) that are fully focused on the story and character and make sure the word is not spoken and was before his time. Ionically, it still has some kind of professionalism among its characters, a kind of respect (if not itself, others, a kind of duty) that occupies well after World War II in France. Its actors wear faces about the signs that say "we know what these men are," and the story goes up there. Perhaps this is because I have a weak spot on the scene, especially where we see only nuts and bolts (error, the actual physical side), how they are pulled out of them. <br /> <br /> One of the problems with how the real hero is filmed in today's movies is that it is all very fast (ie Snatch) or in a way we've seen too many times before. Dassin, like Melville years later, decided to create a practically spiritual film, accompanied by sound effects. The tension that accumulates in this scene may not be on Melville 'Rouge), but on its own level, it will gain its size and momentum, and as important as it used to be. For example, there are some hidden close-ups, because the safe is cracked, which marks some of the best things I saw from France at that time. Plus, the film has a new wave of touching the film, which in the end makes it a bit more modern, that the story works so well and differently. It changes completely to the character points and keeps the excitement. Over the last ten to fifteen minutes, the surprise is right; As in the case of another classical hysterical image, the asphalt jungle is not even the last stop, but how much it goes over by calling a humanism to greed. <br /> <br /> You almost wonder about the whole camera that rides on the trees at high speed, with the car it just does. Dassin has a very fun and intuitive film of his genre with a small musical number.
