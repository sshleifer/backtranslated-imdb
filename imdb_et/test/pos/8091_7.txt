Charlie Chaplin's great comedy. I've seen Chaplin's four big films (Gold Rush, City Lights, Modern Times and The Great Dictator) and I think it's four of the most funny. This film had more smiles to me than almost ever I've ever seen. From a very open disclaimer ("Any resemblance between the Great Dictator and the Hairdresser owner is purely coincidental"), this film is a ridiculous minute with a blend of great shock and verbal humor. At the same time, Chaplin succeeds in depicting the evils of totalitarian persecution. Maybe a little brief about the end and duration of the topic, but easily for me out of 10 out of ten.
