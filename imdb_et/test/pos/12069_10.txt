The war at home is so good that it is my new favorite show. We and my neighbors Carly and April look at it every Sunday together and laugh at how it is alive. I love how everything is so sarcastic and so concerned and they live every little question. If someone does something stupid, it never lives and that's how the family is. The Father is always with all three children who are concerned with every little thing. I love how parents do not know how to deal with children. It's a real family life, and the fact that parents are so overwhelmed and have no idea how to solve their teenage problems puts the exhibition up. The war in the home is so cruel and so true to the world that it has become a milestone. It's not a happy day or a Brady bunch, it's a real life.
