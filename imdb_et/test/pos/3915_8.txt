I saw it on the opening night and enjoyed it. I would probably have enjoyed it more than I had been with my father. My father saw the original (unfortunately I haven't seen it yet) and talked through the whole thing. He said the film was sucked and that it was stupid. The thing is, he didn't realize that the creators created a little horror with the film. Each horror film always shows a certain character. If they weren't in the movie, it might not really like too much. Trademark characters are: <br /> <br /> "The Lead Character": Carly (Elisha Cuthbert) "Head Character": Wade (Jared Padalecki) "Lead Character's Sibling / (Jerky Reform) Jerk": Nick (Chad Michael Murray ): "Shameful Sluttish Character": Paige (Paris Hilton) "Seekers who are just beautiful": Dalton (Jon Abrahams) & Blake (Robert Ri'chard) <br /> With these characters makes it easy to predict, who dies and who lives. You probably know who with what I just wrote. The film can be predictable (in fact, I had a pretty good idea to die just by looking at the trailer), but it was still enjoyable. It may sound silly (why is the abandoned camp site in the middle of a sugar mill that was not at first?), But it's very easy to see. Comedy and gore were the ideal amounts for the starving film visitors they didn't get, they didn't get me wrong (less than Final Destination 2), but it works very well. as hot as the fire grew, but the temperature can still burn the wax.
