You saw it in Sundance one of the first years I went to the festival - blew me out ... <br /> <br /> It went too fast and I've never found it. I thought it would appear somewhere in compilation, but it's still not a joy. My memory is blurry in detail - I just remember that I'm surprised over and over again, and on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> Anyone reading it has wires? Online, DVD, flawless copy of VHS - I'd try it for you ... <br /> <br /> Over the years, I've probably seen more than 200 short films (lived in Aspen where they have an incredible short festival in April. This is definitely my favorite and I hope to see it again! <br /> <br /> Thank you very much to everyone who showed it :)
