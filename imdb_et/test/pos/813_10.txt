It must be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The idea of ​​a typical family that leaves everything behind in the desert. If the mother and father lose their jobs there, not to mention that their bath has green mucus. They decide that moving to Oregon is the best in their family. If everything goes wrong there. An interesting set of characters complicates this movie. Including the young Molly Ringwald, this movie I would definitely recommend.
