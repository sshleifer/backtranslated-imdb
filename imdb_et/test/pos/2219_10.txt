this film explores whether it creates a completely new genre with perfect imperfection - fun, truth, fun, talent and the circumstances that create MAGIC. <br /> <br /> From the creative musical numbers to the cuff comedy that includes actors in their best possible way, if I hadn't knew better, I would have thought that a script has been developed here. <br /> <br /> What You Get: A powerful wind will meet with God-held conversations, meet something fresh and new and wonderful that it will become your unit. <br /> <br /> Peters and fell so that they give the star power and reel you immediately. the rest is also phenomenal. there are no small parts ....... only small actors, and all the people involved here should be kicked, taken out for dinner and considered for the Oscar. <br /> <br /> Well done!
