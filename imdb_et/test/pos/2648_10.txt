This move is absolutely one of the greatest films of its own or some other genre. Kubrick is not only the greatest director of all time, but all his filmography should be put in a time capsule and never be forgotten. 2001: Space Odyssey is a journey that is different from what I've seen on the screen. Kubrick is one of the few directors who can bring you in and keep you engaged from beginning to end, even if there is no extended dialogue or plot development. In 2001, visual images are able to present a picture of the future that is both sublime and terrible. 10 out of 10, no doubt. It's not much better for my money than in 2001: A Space Oddysey .... now, sequel, 2010 ... this is another story.
