Yes! Eventually, they became perfect. What a great idea, a refreshing epic generation X, whether they know it or not. After the disasters like Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD and our hero Blockbuster screws, decided to Lloyd Kaufman just go to it, stop distributors from catering and let Tromal be all this Troma. Lloyd would make this one of the most unpleasant, extreme and fun for Troma. This time, Lloyd shakespeare's love story turns it out, tromatizes it and adds that the long, lost, entertaining value was always missing. The value of entertainment, such as Lemmy Kilmister (narrator), Debbie Rochon (cook), Joe Fleishaker (fat boy) and of course brutal injuries and toilet humor. Tromeo and Juliet are the very weak story of the Troma universe and the final edition of the crown jewel. <br /> <br /> Years ago, NJ's business partners, the Monty Que and Cap Capulet film companies, launched Silky Films, which would produce supposedly delicious soft films. Monty sees Capi as a friend, but Cap can't pull the poor mammals out of their company. On paper and books, Monty seems to have given her life a job for free. Fast In The mid-90s In Manhattan, we have two families who are very dissatisfied with each other because they are just looking for a reason for taking part or preferably life. Monty has a son, Tromeo, a nephew, Benny, they and his friend Murray Martini, who are just a little excited about the killings, are fighting bleeding, except for Monty, he's too caring. As in the original, there is a confusing situation that leads to the fall of Tromeo Capi's daughter, whom she never met or never knew. Unfortunately, Cap is a sadistic pervert who, unlike Trome's father, has something for a bottle, and this would naturally lead to his father's little chenshaw-melon being physically and emotionally abused and frustrated and kept in the Plexiglas cage out and forth, depending on how the mood is the error Cap is inside. Cap forces her vegetarian girl to marry the billionaire butcher London Arbuckle, who makes almost everyone uneasy, with or without the smell of raisin. Because of all these inconveniences, young lovers believe that eloping is the best decision, but how is this effect great? It may not go a little bit to the original, but I think it will end up, just won't happen, you will never see it. <br /> <br /> "One Leo is completely dreaming compared to Tromeo and Julia, but when it is steeped, excessive, big budget, Hollywood, it is what you have programmed to do, anyway, go to that, but if you're in the mood for something a little more colorful, something that really strikes, and doesn't follow the "normal" movie pattern, and if you have a rather unusual sense of humor, you just might not angry this movie. using the whole explosive with so much sense of humor as any young John Waters, with some bad actions, Tromeo and Juliet scare a terrible score that includes legendary Motorhead and not to mention James Gun's much contribution that really brought it together. For greater pride in Gunn, see Lollilove and Lloyd Kaufman for greater excellence, see his next vision of Terror Firmer. Tromeo and Juliet are jaw-dropping invaluable exploitation of the 90s brought to us by one and only King of B-films. Thank you, Lloyd. 10/10
