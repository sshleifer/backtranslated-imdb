This is really a great movie. Love and humor, it forces the audience to engage with the characters and take part in their journey. Michael Parness managed to collect big top players, a little wonder for the first movie. No doubt they moved to help him tell this beautiful story. David Krumoltz carries the film with his undervalued intensity and honesty. Natasha Lyonne is unpredictable, irritating, and even more lovely than Grace. Also the great times of Karen Black (big vision on her again), like Grace's crazy but compassionate mother. There is cutting everywhere that allows us to laugh when we are in pain. Operation is impeccable, editing is tight, the direction is inspired, and music creates the right mood for the background. Given the madness of today's Hollywood Blockbuster, full of big budgets, big names, car accidents and special effects, Max & Grace is a refreshing departure. Give yourself petting and watch this movie.
