* MINOR SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Need more proof that Tsai Ming-liang is one of the most original and provocative filmmakers working everywhere today? Watch this movie. <br /> <br /> By working on the small variations of this topic, which pass through most of his work, HOLE is a study of alienation and loneliness - in this case between a man and a woman on the upper / lower floors of the neighbors - and how different the structures of people in the modern wall (real or psychological) away from each other. Here, a woman (a neighbor on the ground floor) tries to tolerate her apartment being flooded with a surprise leak from the top floor. The plumber tries to find the source of the problem, then disappears after the large opening of the floor. Already isolated and desperate (both characters are one of the few people in the housing project who have not fled before the mysterious, almost apocalyptic epidemic). The two holes connecting the apartments will first function again in the series of long incidents, but will soon become an important part of almost mythical proportions. <br /> <br /> Tsai's sense of humor and the feeling of the film's history appear a little more than usual - when a woman's casual dreams that turn around her upper neighbor are visualized as musical numbers (for Grace Chang's music) that explode on the screen with short sensuality, surreal romance and with humor. quite like the big screen PENNIES FROM HEAVEN. And with all the exhibits and alienation here, the end of the 90s, Tsai is a funny, absurd tension in the late 90s, and gives this film a very attractive strageness. The final scene is extraordinary. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Tsai, in a typical way, refers to most of the usual expectations or perceptions that Westerners bring to Asian cinema, which is a peculiar, randomly revealed directness, focusing on both absurd tendencies in the human mind and the most absolute people. Almost everything from his characters, the background or most of the cultural signals (which amplify the isolation of the characters), is given by THE HOLE - and his other films rather insecure, insecure to demystify, making it more desorbent, but also always exciting and understandable.
