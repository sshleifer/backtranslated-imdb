Is this a good movie? It's hard to say - but in 1953 it was an extremely effective film for many people, suspicious, frightening, and amazingly touching when the "old gentleman" meets at the end of the film with his unhappy death. Yes, what lies in Maze is a surprise and fun for many people. But the basic idea (ontogenesis of phylogeny) was very real at the time of writing and it really is the basis. Not that it would naturally lead to what we see in the film. <br /> <br /> But for the very small budget, one of the biggest product developers, and the person for whom the term "production designer" was invented, creates a very frightening mood that was strangely convincing. Sometimes the movie is very funny, but it has moments.
