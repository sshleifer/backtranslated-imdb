I couldn't watch this movie, though it was far from my bedtime. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with Hitchcock are deserved - this is what really works with you. It walks in a wonderful line between real, direct distance and dark, distancing humor. Like many Hitch heroes, our eye-catching silent witness is innocently caught up in something really terrible - and we're going to drive with him, turning right and feeling his fear, turning around when he is <br /> <br /> Filmmakers are working on it much taken care of. Immediately from the opening frames they participate and try to identify what is real and what is production; who is trustworthy and who is a monster. The turn of the plot and the turn are unpredictable. The thrill is created with a carefully selected combination of camera work, images, music, but the easiest way to get the EYES characters, which will send you raw fear. <br /> <br /> Warning: There is also a terrible gore and nudity. Horror scenes are made in an emotional way that makes them much more frightening and annoying than any teenage pictures. <br /> <br /> And for teenagers this is ONLY. Characters are peculiar and know real people because one thing - a couple (including a heroine) can even find love as I did. There is no error while watching a movie for adults. I mean, Alec Guinness is brief on it and you know he doesn't need work! <br /> <br /> Put it on the VCR at night if you can't sleep. . . and don't want to.
