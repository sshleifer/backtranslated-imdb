The Second World War resulted in the death of almost Soviet cinema. In the early 1950s, film production was almost completely stopped (only nine feature films appeared in 1951), and the work of all filmmakers was monitored and often censored. After Joseph Stalin's death in 1953, filmmakers were given greater artistic freedom with their pictures, although many were reluctant to challenge the heroic, optimistic and propagandistic war that had prevailed in previous years. Only in 1957, director Mikhail Kalatozov and writer Viktor Rozov became bold enough to produce what is widely regarded as the first post-Stalinist Soviet masterpiece, "Letyat zhuravli / Cranes are flying," one of the best war drawings I've seen in any country or time. Not only did the film glorify its artistic shine in the Soviet Union, but international recognition followed, and Kalatozov's film was honored at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival with the Palm d'Or. <br /> <br /> 'Cranes are flying' is both a reviving visual feast and a cruel and humanistic warfare. Unlike many Soviet-themed films from that time, the archetypal figure of the traditional war-time hero was less constrained and more concerned with the negligence, brutality, and indeed the inevitability of the conflict. Love, as a cinematic concept, is too often an ideal as a concept that somehow conquers everything and endures endless difficulties, but reality is still much less romantic. The film has two wars, Veronica (Tatyana Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksei Batalov), separated from the Second World War (known as the Great Patriotic War in 1941-1945), promised to marry after the war, but the tragedy denies some of their desires. Veronika agrees with Boris's cousin, Mark (Aleksandr Shvorin), a beautiful but indecent youth, because of the torture and the uncertainty of expectation. The film may end with a parade of devastating Soviet powers and patriotic flags, but the optimism of this sequence is largely hampered by our young female protagonist, who is breathtaking through the festive crowd. > <br /> Perhaps the most distinctive feature of "The Cranes are Flying" is Sergei Urusevski's inspired and dynamic hand-held cinematography, which realistically and overwhelmingly captures war with chaos and confusion, not necessarily on a firearm and cluster track. dead comrades {in fact, only one of the sequences of the film joins Boris on the eastern front}, but from the perspective of the family and friends who are behind. In a particularly impressive, somewhat quoted, long shot, the camera follows Veronika when he eagerly looks for Boris's outgoing recruiters and their families. The hand-held camera follows the girl smoothly, pulls through the crowd beside her - grabs the goodbye of her sons and spouses for the benefit of her loved ones before the crowd swings unexpectedly when Veronika disappears into the past. Army Tanks, a breathtaking movement that offers scope and speed for a dramatic episode. During the war, Urusevsky acquired his film-making experience as a military operator and apparently fell in love with the possibilities of storing hand-held pictures: "The camera," he once proclaimed, "can express what an actor cannot imagine: his inner cognitions.
