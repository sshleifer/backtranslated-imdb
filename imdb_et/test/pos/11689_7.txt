Wow. At first I thought who was writing these things! How difficult it is to choose a man who offers you and your children wealth, respect and security, not a man who offers you only oppression, abuse, degradation and poverty. But our choices aren't always as clear cut as to think. Indeed, the rich gentlemen were all the women they wanted and still ... pulling his wife, his sexual desire against him was almost overwhelming. What to do, what to do? As an observer, you became so confused and wrong as he was. Anyway, what I really came to on this site was admiration for my Engishi voice, I thought it was actually an Irish singer voice in the movie. Looking at her, I find she is Glen Hansard, whom I had never heard before. What to find. I'm so grateful. Oh, what a voice! What a day! Thank you BIFF!
