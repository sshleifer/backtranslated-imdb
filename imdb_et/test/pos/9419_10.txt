A shining Sherlock Holmes adventure that celebrates the brilliant Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. In spite of many other players who play perfectly with Holmes and Watson and do it perfectly - Rathbone and Bruce are always the two best. <br /> <br /> Holmes takes Professor Tobell from Switzerland to London. The Tobacco Nazis. He has a bomb vision that could win the Second World War. His bombing is divided into four parts, each in hidden books. Tobell agrees to give his bomb to the British government. On his arrival night, Tobell goes to his girlfriend's home. He has drawn some men when Tobell should disappear, the lady had to give the drawings to Holmes. His home is attacked by him, but the policeman stops and the attacker runs away. Tobell is happy that the British government is using its bombing bomb, but refuses to give it, Tobell wants to take care of it. The bombshell is divided into four parts, each of which is completely useless without another. He gives one part of this bomb to one of his scientist friends. Then Holmes' biggest fear happens, Tobell is lost. Holmes visits a young lady, Tobell at night when she was attacked. She tells her about the drawings. The drawings are stolen. He says that only one man came to Tobell's departure to fix the bulb. The man he describes is Professor Moriarty. He works for the Nazis. Holmes is made in the form of drawings. But he finds the desk he used and using science manages to see what Tobell looked at while looking at the pillow. He sees this code. He sees this as the name of four scientists. The first three he works, but he can't work the fourth. The three scientists he has developed have been murdered and a bomb attack has taken place. Holmes can't develop a fourth researcher, but he can't get Moriarty either. Hidden as a sailor, Holmes manages to get to Moriarty's office. Moriarty immediately sees it as Holmes, puts it in the box and puts it in the sea. But Watson and Lestrade demand that they look for a box and find Holmes. It is now clear that Moriarty is at all. Holmes manages to develop a fourth code, Frederick Hoffner. Holmes immediately goes to his house and gets Hoffner and the fourth important part of security. Holmes now needs Moriart for Nazi work. He pretends to be Hoffner. Moriarty develops the fourth code and gets two men to get a round and Hoffner. They will take him back and he will face Moriart. In the meantime, Tobell is not good, he is tortured and tortured to get the name of the fourth researcher. Moriarty has done this with Holmes, she has got her, and her death must be long for Holmes. The idea is to put him in his hospital, place the needle in the vein and see that he dies of blood loss, drop by drop. Watson runs and saves the day. Moriarty goes away, but Holmes was just careless to leave Moriarty trapped. Moriarty falls sixty feet. <br /> <br /> So, Moriarty died. He makes his final exit in the movie "Woman in Green", but in the "green" he is definitely dead, suicide, he jumps off his roof. It was Moriarty's second of three performances in the Rathbone series, another actor who played her every time. His first appearance in Sherlock Holmes adventures was played by George Zucco, his second in the film he played at Lionell Atwill, and Henry Daniels plays for his final trip to The Woman in Green. Universal was at war when Holmes won over the Nazis. "The Terror Voice" was the first, then this movie and then "Sherlock Holmes in Washington". Then it was back to Victorianish times, with a firm relationship with Edward and Georgia (George Fifth and Sixth). This film was closely related to Sherlock Holmes' story "The Dancing Men", which can be found on Sherlock Holmes's return. The big film, though obvious propaganda, was a great Holmes outing.
