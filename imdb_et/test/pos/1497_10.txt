STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) is in this world, but not this world . His mind simply does not seem to understand the way the average person does it, and his life is therefore one long-term disaster, becoming one of the most persistent and distant situations he has to solve. he doesn't seem to mix with anyone and he rarely talks. But he will never give up, and despite the simpler tasks that are a constant struggle for him, he always uses his methods of interest to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> Sorry, the state of modern British humor, with all the focus of sexuality and general vulgarity, will be forgiven for forgetting that at one time Mr Beani was made. There's nothing inappropriate, just good, clean U-Class humor in the 50s of Tommy Cooper and the like. And I find it as funny as funny now in the early 20's, as I did when I was a young boy in the early 90's. <br /> <br /> Although I can now look at it a little deeper and there must be more than one eye for that character. There must be a reason why he does the things he does, and things seem to him to be wrong. As others have pointed out, he seems to have some type of autism. In fact, I am so convinced that I really think it was a professional psychologist to analyze him, I think Mr Bean could be the first famous, fictional character who is diagnosed with something with Asperger's syndrome. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a really fun British humor at the best time before everything becomes sexual and vulgar, it would be highly recommended. Shows that Little Britain is working because it is well understood but it's really as vulgar as the rest. Shows such an exhibition that we were once more restrained and more civilized, and hopefully we might soon put out this type of humor soon. *****
