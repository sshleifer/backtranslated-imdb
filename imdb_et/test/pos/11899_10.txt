Finally, I see El Padrino's movie, which I see as an incredible film, and many activities Damian Chapa is a good director, but I have to admit that I love his acting at best. <br /> <br /> Behind the scenes, I saw that some women, the shoe, did it, they have to go back to school and learn how to change it. <br /> <br /> El Padrino is a pure 10-epic film. Why don't most people who put together movies who don't know what the plot is? I'm so happy to see that someone I know I am a real big actor is also a big director. <br /> <br /> I am one of those people who love to see artists. <br /> <br /> BS
