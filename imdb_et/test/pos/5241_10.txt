What a bit of a mistake in dirty dialogues and / or archetypal testimonials that exactly represent how people spoke, lived and were before World War II, not to mention the years in which The Big Trail depicts the film. <br /> <br /> The film took my breath when I first saw it for years. Reading the tables here helped me understand why it stayed in the post office and why filmmakers got Wayne's benefit in B Western for another ten years. Wayne was, in my opinion, better "Big Trail" and Bs years than most of his star turns after 1939 Ford's incredible cavalry trilogy, "True Grit" and "Shootist" are Big Time exceptions. <br /> <br /> What shame theaters left this boat in 1930. If this film had hit, we could have been more movies with more realism and less hockey. In my opinion, this is not just one of the best Western countries that have ever been filmed with precise dialogue and the realization of their exact character, but one of the best images that in any way represent a passage to the film. <br /> <br /> It's still taking my breath away. Especially the type of dialogs and exact characteristics that simply no longer exist. Some denote the homogenization of our culture surface, which actually hides the biggest cultural breakdown ("our like people and people like them") and political divisions (corporatists vs. basic streets) in US history, but for me, "The Big Trail" is a time when we the differences between the surfaces were more obvious, but under them most people wanted to develop people's failures and most people wanted to build a great culture and a great nation. <br /> <br /> "The Big Trail" is an epic melting pot in the direction of an American dream. Do this on the road I have ever seen.
