In America, once a year, Saturday cartoons would give new cartoons, usually in America. Almost school time began. <br /> <br /> I think it was supposed to be a school that would be better tolerated on Saturdays. <br /> <br /> One Friday night before the premiere of the new Saturday morning comics, the movie came. <br /> <br /> "At Earth's Core" I had no idea who Cushing and McClure were. It is clear that they were not from the same country, so I could not understand why they traveled together. <br /> <br /> I remember the mechanism of a fire breathing monster in your mouth. <br /> <br /> What connects this movie to me is opening the molten metal and then we are waiting for the band to play as we see in the factory. <br /> <br /> How do you finish this movie? Music again and two deliverable policemen because the drill is behind them. <br /> <br /> For whatever reason, I remember watching this movie more than Friday night when I made a new picture that came the next morning. <Br /> <br /> It was definitely in the late 1970s. <br /> <br /> I think Jurassic Park mania, cicra '93, before I watch this movie again. <br /> <br /> Yes, people in costumes. Again, the breath came again. <br /> <br /> Still the end of the two police. <br /> <br /> Finally, it would be another decade before I send a DVD to the movie. <br /> <br /> Now I just look at the start and the introduction. <br /> <br /> Oh, I love a lot of movie. Of all these sci fi Jules Verne, HG Wells, ERB movies, this is my fave. <br /> <br /> What I am now observing is that one of the cops is going to get around too early, then he returns, then he and the other policeman are synchronized when they turn in again to get behind the drill to watch. <br /> <br /> Maybe this film is the best of Saturday morning show, which is why I enjoy so much.
