It was Eisenstein's first completed project for over ten years. The film takes place in the 13th century during the German invasion (German knights - I think). Published in 1938, very parallel to Russia's approach to World War II and Germany's progress towards Eastern Europe. There are some incredible scenes, the most remarkable battles near the end of the movie, and it's shocking when kids are thrown out of the fire, but it's not easy to see. The film drags and is not as brilliant as "Potemkin" or "Ivan the Terrible". Sometimes Eisenstein clips better. His brilliance, however, is there and his "must see" for Eisenstein fans and film historians. Russian propaganda their best.
