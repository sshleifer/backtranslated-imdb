In short, if you want to watch Burt Reynolds' best movies, you need to add it. If you don't like Burt, you can still like it. If you love Burt, it can change your favorite movie all the time! Being from Atlanta, it hits home, but it's also nice to see a policeman / action / drama that takes place outside of NY City, Chicago, Miami, or LA. The movie is funny at points where there is a good plot and good presentations of great supportive pain (every character is real and bad guys are not so one-sided that they are really well thought out) Nice offbeat romance on the 2nd half and he has some good old fashion shootouts and fistfights (no CGI thanks to God REAL ACTION!) <br /> <br /> When Clint Eastwood made the best impression of Burt Reynolds' "Anyone, but Open" & "Any Way Do" then Burt answered his best Clint type of flick, and that's great!
