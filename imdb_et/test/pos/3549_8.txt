I'm an opera song, opera is full of sex, blood and death. It may help to know that the opera libretto is really an evaluation of this movie - my mileage is very different from Tug-3. I am a lover of classical music and I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> I loved Ken Russell's "Nessun Dorma" segment and I would like to see him produce Turandot because the opera should be a real multimedia experience, but then I loved Lisztomania. I love * Turandot * and libretto knowing so well, why can't I find the segment traverse that Tug-3 did. <br /> <br /> The Buck Henry / Rigoletto segment is probably the most suitable average viewer - they are probably familiar with songs and a classic bedroom. I like bedrooms, so stupidity didn't bother me. <br /> <br /> The "Liebestod" segment is so prominent that I recommend people only look at that part. "Depuis la Jour" was beautifully spiritual for me. And Caruso's recording "Vesti la Giubba" (aka I Pagliacci) with John Hurt when the clown was great. But people who just want naked women may feel that there are too many music and not enough bare muscles and sex.
