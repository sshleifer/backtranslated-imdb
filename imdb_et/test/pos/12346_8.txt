The famous and mysterious extraordinary Raymar, a deadly telinetic psychic vampire, dies suddenly in odd situations. A nice girl school student Julie Wells (a warm and sympathetic lovely Meg Tilly performance) desperately wants to accept nurses (succeeded by Leslie Speight, Robin Evani and Eudabeth Daily's utterly perfect perfection) so she agrees to spend the night in a horrible mausoleum with Rayman's body is embedded as part of the initiation ritual. Of course, Raymar still has his extraordinary powers, so it's a very long and harrowing evening of pure anti-nervous terror for the poor Julie. <br /> <br /> Director / Co-Screenwriter Tom McLoughlin (who later provided us with a language-in-cheek "Friday 13th Part VI: Jason Lives") ignores graphical gore for the creation of a bone and a terrifying atmosphere, but fails to pull out that particular game because the first hour is too slow, conversational and uneven to be absent or suspicious. However, I found, however, that this foolish fear is strange and interesting. Big poofy hair, wolf music editing sequence, poorly timed wrong scars (including everywhere in the shoulder aggregate), a scene in the sparkling arcade of video games, kids joyfully smoked in the pot and a fun foolish male slang ("nerdle brain!" Hal Trussell's beautiful, polished cinematography (especially I dug the smoothly sliding Steadicam tracking images), Bob Summer's spooky but funky hum'n'shiver synthesizer score, and Tom Burman's ghoulish ghoulish makeup f / x all up to sniffing. "Batman" fame Adam West just takes up space in no other secondary part, Mausoleum makes an impressive and uneasy main position, with a large finale of heaps of rotten bodies that open from their coffins and float around, qualify as a wonderfully horrible shock set. Of course, this baby is definitely not unfairly failed pearl, but it still offers p go pleasantly stupid and bring the cheese to fun.
