The fact that reviewers have a very negative impact on the exhibition is an interesting fact in itself. If you don't like it, don't look at it. <br /> <br /> Some reviewers claim that you have to be stupid, dim or plain old. Au contraire, my friends. I do not claim that all competitors are intelligent. There are smart, and they are dark. But I argue that they probably have a higher average IQ than the average reviewer on this website. That's right, I said that. There is much to say about the science of sedentary girls. Sorry, but please take all the sticks out of your asses and understand why you hate these men, that they are threatening you. <br /> <br /> Those who are not social scientists, and more specifically, science mating, are obviously yearning for the ship. <br /> <br /> One thing is clear: clubs are not the only places to meet girls. Personally, I think that useful women do not even go to clubs, so they do not hurt people, as we see at the show. But what are the men like ???? In addition to those whose games smell, they are male performances. These are men who meet women in the most difficult situations. These are men who have their own sexuality. These men don't ask their girlfriends to break them, and these men don't say "OK, let's just be friends." <br /> <br /> Don't know ???? In fact, these are the guys you are afraid of when you take your long-term girlfriend to the club. We are all. These guys know what women like. (again, only those with a "game") <br /> <br /> And even those who are bad ... they are laughing! <br /> <br /> If you have come to the club and interact with people around you, you should find this exhibition in an entertaining place. <br /> <br /> Look, I'm sorry for the hate of this show. My best guess is that it exacerbates the insecurity of men who have had bad experiences in clubs, or threatens men who believe that women are beautiful, self-sufficient creatures who just want a nice man to buy their attention. <br /> <br /> I personally like this show. This is pure entertainment and best of all, REAL. This is a very understandable last state of sexual psychology. The gender role has never been so different, and this exhibition gives a very real overview of it. <br /> <br /> I think this shows that there is something positive about this show. <br /> <br /> It shows appeals to a certain target market, and if you're outside, I think you shouldn't show it. We can say it about another show, could we? <br /> <br /> Grow up, <br /> <br /> ApolloHelios
