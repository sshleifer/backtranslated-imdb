I've seen this movie many times and found it very convincing and sad. The absence of real emotions from most characters is very disturbing. They seem empty, hopelessly. The story is based on a real event. <br /> <br /> A boyfriend murders a teenage girl for no apparent reason - apparently he knew it easily. Then he prides himself on his friends and he doesn't believe he looks at them to see his body - many times. No one knows the murder. Keanu Reeves and Crispen Glover - Crispen Glovers are characterized by severe anxiety. <br /> <br /> The Keanu character Matt seems to be the only one with the right and wrong feeling. This is Keanu's best - flawless performance and highly believable - anyone who thinks this guy can't act should watch this movie. Matt's little brother is almost the most annoying film. Only twelve and no compassion or love factor in his life. It is very sad to think that such children are there. It makes you really grateful for what you have. 9/10
