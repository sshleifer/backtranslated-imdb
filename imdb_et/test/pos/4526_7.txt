"Murder Over New York" is a fun entry to the Charlie Chan series, but when you pay attention, many of the holes in the plot reveal the eye to the eye. When traveling to New York for the annual police convention, Chan (Sidney Toler) will meet Hugh Drake (Frederick Worlock), a former Scottish yard investigator, on the same flight. Now that military intelligence is used, Drake monitors Paul Narvo and his Hindu servant, suspected of sabotage operations around the world. Drake believes that by turning to Narva's hard-to-understand woman, she can determine the location of a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> When Drake died dead in the Metropolitan Aircraft Corporation President George Kirby's library, Charlie says he was killed by the recently discovered poisonous gas called "tetrogen" through a glass pellet that releases the poison when it breaks. Calling Kirby to bring all his dinner guests together, Chan and police inspector Vance (Donald MacBride) question the attendees, because one of them may be a killer. Among them are Herbert Fenton (Melville Cooper), Oxford student Drake, actor June Preston (Joan Valerie), unknown to Drake, but asked to participate, Ralph Percy (Kane Richmond), chief designer at Kirby aircraft company, and Keith Jeffrey (John Sutton, a Kirby Stock Broker. Kirby butler Boggs (Leyland Hodgson) is also a suspect, especially after number # 2 Son Jimmy (Victor Sen Yung) evaporating him opens a chapelram, the contents of which are of concern to Boggsi himself. <br /> <br /> Other wise-planted characters. Mrs Narvo rises to Patricia West (Marjorie Weaver) and, contrary to Drake, she can bring her to Narva, is actually her former husband and catastrophic marriage. He is associated with David Elliott (Robert Lowery), the director of the chemical research industry and thus suspected of having tetrogenic corners. <br /> <br /> As with many Chani movies, racial comments must be made in the process. It offers two outstanding features. When Kirby's black servant comes in for questioning, he says he doesn't know anything about the Drake murder that he's completely "dark". Chan's response: "The condition seems contagious". <br /> <br /> Later, after inspector Vance's order rounding up all prices in New York, Jimmy Chan commented on their arrival together: "They all start to resemble me." In fact, the scene features one comic relief element because Shemp Howard embodies Hindu mystic "The Great Rashid", but the police have actually discovered it as an artist by Shorty McCoy. <br /> <br /> Before the end of the movie, two more victims fall on smart Narvo - his confederate Ramullah and the aircraft magician Kirby. To detect the killer, Chan, along with Elliott, organizes a new test run after he discovered a poisoned capsule planted by a mechanic. Before he can release his deadly poison, Brit Fenton tries to catch the falling capsule in the middle of the air, revealing that he knew about the plant. Chan says Fenton is not Narva. Actual Narvo discovers himself when he offers poisonous water to nervous Fenton, wanting to keep Narva secret. But Chan was smart enough to be cautious of such an attempt, and opens up a real murderer - Narva - now a stock broker in the shadow of Jeffrey, having undergone a reconstruction after a car accident. <br /> <br /> Now holes for the plot. First of all, investigating the murder of Hugh Drake, the police kept the fingerprints found in the library unresponsive to any dinner guests. But Jeffrey / Narvo was there for a dinner party. It was already established that Drake had one guest in the book area, chemist Elliott. If the fingerprints really did not belong to Narvo, their making was meaningless. <br /> <br /> Also, when Narva provides Fenton with poisonous water, how did he think he would get away with it all? But even better, if the world saboteur, like Narvo, took time and needs himself as a New York Stock Exchange agent, it just doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> For smaller fans, there are a couple of points to note. In Film # 2, Son Jimmy is a college student studying chemistry when he gets help from "Pop" for solving the case. In the previous Chani movie - "Charlie Chan in the Wax Museum" - was a Jimmy lawyer. <br /> <br /> The poison formula was later rewritten by Chani, this time with Monogram Roland Winters. Chan's role in "New Orleans Docks". With this story, poison gas is released like broken radio tubes to demand its victims.
