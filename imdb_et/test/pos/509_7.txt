I hope that the summary line will not irritate you so much (this is a little respect for the Chappelle Show / Charlie Murphy, but also for the Daywalker character). But I try to put all the things I liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything I didn't like in the second paragraph, so it's easier to read! Let's start with the good things! Quote "Strong Blood Violence" (used by evaluation committees to describe the content of the film is not well suited to it. It's not a movie for children! Character (Wesley Snipes is phenomenal) and crazy enough story that keeps / justifies scenes! interesting and intelligent. The overall story is too thin.It is enough, as I have written above, to keep the scenes together, but there may be more, and as Blade deserves more (imo). Some signs are signed ... This is so !: o)
