I grew up with Abbott and Costello films, A. because my father grew up with them, and both of our family names are abbott, so we owe deo some respect, I didn't know that this movie and others would get this movie. It was really classic, it was a funny reason why abbott and costello were always the same characters, but it was so funny, now that I like jack and beanstalk, is that while the love story is totally boring and one song prints singing, omg , awefull, but i like the angle that they love, the story, the couple has to marry because one kingdom has run out, they meet in jail and fall in love when they both pretend not to be royal and they end up being a couple, so happy ending i I don't think it was the original version, if it were, it would have had to cut it out, but I think it was original and I love it. But watching it sucks, lol, even when the movie really starts with giant + abbott and costello, it's so funny. when the giant kicks the door, and the jack yells "OPEN DOOR, OPEN DOOR", which is really funny. And once the joke where the jack starts prince, prince and all those dogs jump. kinda cheezy but really original. I want them to have tried it at least, though I got that africa screaming and beanstalk, and I don't like the reason for the quality when I had it on tape, it was bad quality as well as I think. the start is slightly funny in the middle is really very funny and the end is not funny but i'm 19 years old and when a 52 year old film makes me hard laugh, it tends to, this movie is really funny. I love my style. chapters also suck. also the part where the jack climbs, and they all sing a song about the oil dip plug and that it is killed, it's pretty funny
