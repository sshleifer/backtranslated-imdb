For 30 years or longer I got this movie on TV. Many aspects of the film seemed to be visible even for many years after its completion. <br /> <br /> The little-known story of C Virgil Georghiu is remarkable, almost reminiscent of a Tolstoy-like story of a human being with a cosmic scheme that he cannot understand. Compare this film with the more modern works known as the "Schindler List" by Spelberg, and you will begin to realize that the trauma of World War II must be seen in the canvas of greater racism outside the simple Nazi Arabic and Jewish concepts. This film concerns the Hungarians, who do not like the Romanians, the Russians do not like the Russians and so on ... even touching the Jewish interviewees with their Christian Romanian friends, while under stress. <br /> <br /> You haven't read the book, it's hard to see how much the director and scriptwriter have changed. For example, it is interesting to study the position of Romanian peasants in the United States with a view to emigrating, to earn money only for returning to Romania and investing income there. In my opinion, Johann Moritz's character was probably one of the best roles played by Anthony Quinn in his charter with "La Strada", "Zorba the Greek" and "Barabbas". <br /> <br /> The best and most memorable sequel to the film is Anthony Quinn and Virna Lisi trying to smile. A father who suffered from his wife's rape, because of her rape, is in itself a story, but the director can show reconciliation with a simple gesture - carrying a child without making melodramatic films. <br /> <br /> Today, after the death of Princess Diana, we often mark an unknown paparazzi. The final order is the accusation of paparazzi and unknown media (director Verneuil also makes a similar remark during the trial when a cameraman is ready to beat Moritz). <br /> <br /> Communication between the Church and the State was so beautifully put together in the laconic statement of the Orthodox priest: "I pray to God that He will guide those who have the right to use them well." <br /> <br /> Some short shots, such as the Secretary Secretary's statements while listening to the petition, said so little in the frame. The direction was so impressive that editing takes the seat back. Finally, what hit me the most was the rich texture of colors offered by cameraman Andreas Winding - from genial credit sequences to the end. I recalled that he was the second favorite French film operator called "Ramparts of Clay", directed by Jean-Louis Bertucelli. I haven't seen this color for a long time, except for David Leane's epic. <br /> <br /> There were errors: I want Virna Lisi to be more specific. I never understood the character of Serge Reggia - the only intellectual movie. In the western part of Sergio Leone there is a square at the end of the railway station. Finally, the film was essentially built around a story of love that unfortunately takes the seat back. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie impresses more than one department. The story is important today when it was done.
