Flesh Doll (Niku daruma and Psycho: Snuff Reels) It was on my wish list for some time and then I finally got a copy of eBay. It has never been on DVD and what I got from eBay was a very good quality DVD-R, which I am quite happy with. The movie I believe is torture porn is the most extreme example of porn. The woman reacts to the advertisement of the porn film and goes to the place where it was filmed with the producer. Porn is definitely real when annoying Japanese pixelation tries to hide hardcore shots without much success. When a porn movie is filmed and the actor is ready to leave, he gets over the head with a baseball bat and takes back the space and slowly breaks down, and in one of the most disgusting scenes, he screws it open in the wound on his chest. This is after both legs are cut off, his hands and some other beauties. This film goes beyond the long-shot series of guinea pigs, in fact they are not even in the movie close to a realistic, though cheap, gore effect. It's really one of the best fake snuff I've ever seen, if not the best. Now I have to warn you that if you are not in this matter, you should stay far. This movie is very strong and it is very sick, erotic, with real sex. And I mean a very sick way. But wherever you come down to this material, this movie will bring you home and I would definitely recommend that you look for it. After reading the movie, I waited for something very strong, but it went beyond that bunch.
