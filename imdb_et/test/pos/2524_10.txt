The story takes place on the streets of Sao Paoulo, Brazil, where a young son named Pixote grows alone without his parents. Pixote has remained anxious and without a shift to the children with other adolescents on the street. Behind the closed doors are terrible things within the groups of workers and children. And there is one last launcher that will take the place, the last incident that makes Pixote and his friends decide to break and escape. From there, it starts a journey that is busy with strong friendships, divorced friendships, love and hatred, criminal activities and just talking on the beach, something like you and me sometimes. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is perfect in so many ways, because it touches you on so many levels, it did it to me. The document-like style used to portray Pixote and its surroundings seems more realistic, and actors who are actually street children and have lived in a similar life seem to be more natural in human conditions. It also has a social comment on child abuse, but I think it makes the film so big that pressure is a story, not a political one. The last scene that I find to be the best in the movie will hit me as something I've never seen before. So full of emotions and so unpleasant makes this movie a true, plausible, unbearable, unforgettable story. A real heartbreaking masterpiece that is so underrated! <br /> <br /> My voice: 10/10
