This is a beautiful, yet simple movie about one man who tries to find the answer, the answer he may not need, but has restructured his whole life. It's cheerful, it's fun, it's glorious, it's embarrassing, it's delicate and dynamic, I say it's a genius. <br /> <br /> I have read Jonathan Safran Foer's book Everything is Illuminated (mainly because I heard Elijah Wood starring in the film's adaptation), and I was just characters. I laughed out loud more than once. And every time someone talks about what it is, I hear the same reluctant response, almost like a big long word: "This is a fun changer who is from the Nazis." But this story is so philosophical; it goes deeper into it. This conversation round and "case." It really gets one thought. Suddenly, this story goes from simple search to internal metamorphosis, and I find myself a little different from things. <br /> <br /> I would recommend reading it before, if at all, because the book was many stupid, even perverse stories that were not in the film, mainly the history of the Jonathan family, which was not necessary for the film. <br /> <br /> The little trivia I heard is that Wood's current girlfriend is in this flick as a stepping stone in a band that Alex is about to make when Jonathan goes from train to Ukraine. <br /> <br /> You spend half of the movie trying to find out exactly what it is and what Jonathan is, because his character is so recaptured as the turtle shell. <br /> <br /> is great and, in my opinion, one of Elijah Wood's best films.
