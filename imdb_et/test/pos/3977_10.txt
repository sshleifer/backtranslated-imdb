Contrary to what many may believe, this film is a "system" type of film and attitude. This is a great image of a "system" and how ridiculous it really is. The funny parts of the movie are actually funny because they tell the truth about the world around the world. Anyone who thinks this film is unrealistic simply denies the obvious truth of life. And that is to learn what you enjoy. That should be the college. <br /> <br /> I think the comment must contain at least 10 lines. I think I have given my opinion on this. So I'm writing a few new lines just like a filler. I hope you have entertainment during this time. I encourage you to watch the movie. It's worth your time as long as you follow it and immerse yourself in the movie.
