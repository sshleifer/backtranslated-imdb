A lovely woman, Norma Shearer (like Katherine's "Kitty" Brown), is waiting for her husband Rod La Rocque (like Bob Brown) with his hand and foot. March Shearer recommends breakfast in bed in the morning and dress her up for Sunday's golf challenge and wants to join Mr La Rocque for the day, noting how rarely two are seen. But La Rocque puts it down by saying that his presence is damaging his game. Then Shearer suddenly expects the real cause of his spouse's frequent absences? her beautiful blonde mistress! <br /> <br /> Three years later, Shearer is a glamorous and flirtatious divorce. In Paris in the summer, she has created a friendship with a rich, senior Marie Dressler (like Mrs Boucci's Bouccica). Mrs Dressler invites Shearer to her Long Island home, interact with friends and ask for a favor. Dressler is concerned that her grandchild is in a relationship with reputation, with a man of the earth. He wants young Sally Eilers (like Dionne) to get married to Raymond Hackett (like Bruce). Being aware of Shearer's flirtatious conquests, Dressler asks him to lure an unwanted man away from Yesterday. Shearer is stunned to find that man is La Rocque, his former husband. <br /> <br /> Shearer and Dressler make this a cute and fun game. They are in top form, giving enthusiasm and professionalism with guaranteed and popular performances. The story is stupid and predictable; Still, in a way that helps humorous situations. And the end is pretty smart. In fact, the cartoon "Let's be gay" can be older than Shearer's large and serious "The Divorc√©e" that appeared at the same time. The cast is evenly well. La Rocque is better than his film with Lilian Gish; but his role is not at all pleasant. Gilbert Emery (like Towney) and Tyrell Davis (like Wallace) are funny supporters. <br /> <br /> Those who do not know Norma Shearer may not realize that she will appear on the opening scenes as her husband. This is Shearer as "Kitty" before his relocation. Watch Shearer's close-ups with a light and natural make-up to be happy to look at a beautiful woman. <br /> <br /> ******* Let's Go Gay (1930) Robert Z.
