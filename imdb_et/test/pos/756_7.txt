You love or hate movies like this thriller inside a lonely shelter, far from a lonely countryside. It is not so much a horror show, but an example of scary images and a wackozoid mental patient. "Scream" is the best term to use as an obviously popular classic that was observed for some strange and evil behavior. Note the "judge" who is going to put the ax behind the doctor! Brr-r-r-r !!! Nothing else can be described here except for the bloody tasty goodness, but if you get the chance, remember the familiar old saying of the hag lady: "Get out! Go out! And never come back!". Don't you want to see you in the basement?
