I had to call my mother (WASP) to ask her. Was it very bad in New York in the 40s? Surprise, he didn't remember. So I told her to see the movie. Arthur Miller, not the screen game, but NOVEL for the change, was 30 years old when he wrote it in 1945. It is a painful image of anti-Semitism. Yet it is strange that the cruel story is the basis for human relationships (Finkelstein, Jew, Newman, non-Jew). Action is competent and cinematography is very good. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can make this theater big is that it is >> aaagh << controversial. I give it ten to ten. Maybe a little high, but it's worth it.
