I've seen this movie a few times and every time I watch it, it becomes quirkier and more fun. Perhaps the lack of it in the research that went into Nicolas Cage's "punk-persona" or just cheesiness, because it was such a typical eighties movie ... but it is a lovely love story that has extremely funny, unique characters. I think it's there "Fast Times" and "Weird Science" (with twenties twenties colors)!
