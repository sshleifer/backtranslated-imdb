I don't understand why this movie is so low. It deserves more! Of course, this is completely ridiculous, but that was exactly what it should have been. Don't expect cinematic transcendence from a film about beauty contestants busy on the Caribbean island! What you should expect is a huge number of obviously all relevant sci-fi, fantasy and block movies in the history of movies and even references to other spoofers. Everything is completely exaggerated and sometimes completely unnecessary, but that is what makes this movie stand out. If you like parodies and enjoy saying, Leslie Nielsen or Mike Myers, then you love it. I certainly did!
