Since I first played it in 1998, GoldenEye has been one of my favorite video games. Actually, I recently bought N64 cleanly so I can own it and play it more often! The game is pretty nearly perfect: in one player mode, there is a fantastic job that puts you in Bond's shoes with different mission goals, convincing weapons and excellent level design. Although the artificial intelligence of enemies is quite common in today's standards, it only adds to GoldenEye's complaint. The fraudulent method (filling levels in strict time) was also innovative in the release of the title, and even now I haven't cracked some of them! <br /> <br /> The game comes with a superb Multiplayer mode for up to four players and although not as successful as Combat Simulator in the "Perfect Dark" game, it is still incredibly satisfying for your opponents to blast with the RC-P90 fire! ;-)
