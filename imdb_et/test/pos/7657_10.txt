This is not a "direct cinema" because it is actually the opposite. Another filmmaker, Gatliff's Roma trilogy, which is Mich√®le Ray-Gavras's French work, is a masterpiece of the film, not a pure documentary, in some way a fiction. Instead, Gatlif has chosen different locations on the route from India to Spain, regardless of where the Roma have a strong presence, and with the help of the art director, he has directed a number of musical numbers that tell us how gypsies live, sing, dance, fight and survive. There may be strong opposition in the film to those who doubt the hypothesis that the Roma tribe is of Indian origin, mostly to challenges for those who see a direct connection with the Hebrews (so in some ways it is not surprising that they were persecuted by the Nazis.) But any anthropological argument it is a great beauty, strong colors and great singing and dancing.
