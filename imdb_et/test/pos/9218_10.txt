It was the first movie I saw in the theater. I was 7 years old and so far it is one of my favorite films. It is pure fragrant cheese. Multimedia was marketed to young girls by selling dolls with soft bodies and large plastic heads, one for each rainbow color, its own special animals, "sprites" and even a talking rainbow. The period is characterized by every exhibition of how hope, community, and magic can "make everything better". <br /> <br /> The film is about spring when all the lights and colors return to the world, but this time it's not our sweet hero. The corrupted princess prints to overcome the universe soul athlete (and an indirect life giver) that happens to be a giant diamond, with unique goals despite reality, and now Rainbow and his newly found friends Orin, Onyx, and Chris must save the universe. As I said earlier, it is cheese, but it's cute, and it's exactly the same as all the other cartoons of that time period, such as CareBear movies, Strawberry Shortcake, Rose Petal and Smurfs. All movies designed to sell dolls to children. And it works. :)
