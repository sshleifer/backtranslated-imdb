This BBC version of Agatha Christie's book shows the pitfalls to follow the book too closely. Christie's books tend to move gently, sometimes even at a leisurely pace, and "Evans" is what it certainly does. It also has a strong school of red herring to confuse the plot. This version is extremely loyal to the book, resulting in a very slow and involved story. As a fan of Christie, I gave her 7 stars, but it takes 3 hours to go through a relatively action-free story. I appreciate some of the tightening of the plots that the BBC made much more for its later Christie productions. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this movie is a joyful joy, highlighted by Francesca Annis. his role and playing James Warwick very well.
