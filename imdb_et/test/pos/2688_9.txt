I think that the problem of this exhibition, which does not respect respect, really deserves to come after Seinfeld, after ELR and after friends. These three sitcoms were the stars of their time. <br /> <br /> KOQ came to the TV at the end of this special time. <br /> <br /> But don't let it convince you. <br /> <br /> King Queens is as good as if not better than two of the three. <br /> <br /> Seinfeld all started and was a timeless classic. I never laughed as hard as Seinfeld. But KOQs are really close. <br /> <br /> With a smile, KOQs should only be evaluated for Seinfeld. The ELR must be second, because the character creation and interaction are more pleasant. <br /> <br /> In both cases, KOQs are the top ten in the last 20 years. <br /> <br /> The only other sitcom worth mentioning now is the two and a half men who really don't hold the remaining four candles but have everything we have.
