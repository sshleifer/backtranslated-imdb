I first saw it on demand. Or on TV. I'm not quite sure. But this must be my favorite movie of all time! I mean, this film has blood, gore, laughs and chills through the movie. I recently ordered "Monster Man" from Amazon and I've been watching "Monster Man" because I got it. Trust me, you love this movie. <br /> <br /> P.S. The comment on the DVD is funny. They also said something about "Monster Man 2" during the comments. We hope they make "Monster Man 2"! If you have the opportunity to rent a movie or buy it. You absolutely love it! This is the best film that appeared in 2003. <br /> <br /> 10/10
