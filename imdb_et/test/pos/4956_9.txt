OK, yes, it is bad, yes its a full fluff, yes, it makes a dobbin when the other looks like an Oscar winner, but look at it like I was 13 years old, special effects were 90% of the movies pretty much unnecessary. Be the day when the movies needed a story. OK, so even the story is a bit annoyed .. but wow I got this movie as a child in the 80s. delicious stone, bad special effects, but the planes fight the air and had one vision of sound art. See also the worst things are the silver lining. hates the impact of the computer (if such a movie is), this is the perfect choice
