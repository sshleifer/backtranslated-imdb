If you are even interested in wars, you should watch this movie. This is a great historical story. No flashing saber, no cavalry, no carnage - just a story of a regrettable group of Union soldiers stumbling into the farm of the Confederate wife and her son and taking as much as their master's conscience allows. This amount moves up and down when events that affect the sense of his humanity are in contradiction with his conscience towards his men and his cause. Ultimately, he reaches a compromise that would be difficult for any of us to put. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the historic treatment of the Kentucky War, a slave country that tried to remain neutral, but eventually decided to remain in the Union under mysterious political circumstances involving the detention of certain legislators. About half of the Kentucky soldiers fought for both sides, but there have never been many treatments for what he lived there. This film makes a great contribution to the "look and feel" of time and place.
