I didn't know what to expect from this very popular (and fun) Swedish comedy and satire team because they released their first feature film. Wider Satire? Well, we get four modern, exceptionally memorable stories of family pain, generation gaps and paternity. But this is fortunately a drama and a drama! Epic is in scope because each episode comes from carefully selected geographic parts in Sweden. But every story can seriously carry the whole movie if it is separately expanded. <br /> <br /> It's dark, twisted, harrowing, but tremendously fun and amazingly executed. Script, action, and cinematography are absolute world-class because they seem to flash for three hours! It has four mastery and just one of the best films of peoples in cinema history. This is Sweden's answer to "Short cut" or "Magnolia" if you want, and instantly with the parameters! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 Ozjeppe
