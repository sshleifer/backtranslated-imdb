Ok, I'm a huge Trac fan so its just being in the movie will automatically do it by 8.5+ rating. But even after he was, I thought it was a good movie especially for the HBO movie. But I'm afraid if you take Trac out of the movie, it's just ok. But man can't do it and he's a wonderful actor. He just gets better and better.
