Michael Kehoe has made a great impression, especially given that it is only his second beginning as a writer, director and director. In general, "first timers" lack vision and direction when the main production takes place, but "Dominion" proves that Mr. Kehoe is going to Hollywood! Among the beautiful landscapes Dominion is dominated by experienced cast members (especially Thomerson and James) who communicate with the extreme vision of Kehoe with extraordinary clarity. Few movies can interfere with the real action / adventure of the sloher / horror genre, but Dominion achieved it completely. This film definitely qualifies as one of the best in both categories. If you are looking for quick action with more than a temporary relationship, look no further. I look forward to Kehoe's future projects with great enthusiasm. Well done!!!
