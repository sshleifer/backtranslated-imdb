"The Story of Two Sisters" must be one of the oldest films I've seen recently. Finally, there is no real supernatural element, regardless of what is expected in the film. The story seems to be about two sisters who, after returning to their father's home after a certain type of absence (which later appeared to have been in a psychiatric facility), are forced to deal not only with a seemingly schizophrenic and potentially biopolar stranger who jokes with the younger girls when the mood strikes and says happily. they have prepared a special dinner at other times, but some presence is still unexplained. Later it turned out that the younger sister was dead and only her older sister, who could not save her, existed, and her husband, who was tough enough to die. Many of the peculiarities of the strange family in the film are not evident, but it certainly leaves the observer with a horrible feeling and nervous confusion. Definitely not easy viewing; Check it out if you really want to think about what you've seen. This is the hell of the riddle.
