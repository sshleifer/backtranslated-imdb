I saw this movie as part of Sitges' Midnite Madness. The 18th-century England plot covers Arthur Blake's life from his first training, as an apprentice's grave, to his final confession before his execution. As for Arthur and his partner, who are experiencing various unpleasant signs and odd situations. with lots of fog-laden cemeteries, dirty tavern scenes and a great set / costume design. don't get me wrong, have some nervous moments and gore, but the tone is very comedic, driven by the situations that the characters themselves find themselves and their dialogue. The closest comparison with the scenes between two leaders (Larry Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan) is only fools and horses, two roniids and Morecambe and wisdom in classic English comedies. is strong and very familiar faces casting on Ron Perlman and Angus Scrimm raise the film on many other topics in Sitges. and leaves a smile on the face.
