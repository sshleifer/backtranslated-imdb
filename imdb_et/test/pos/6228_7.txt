A group of friends break in the middle of the middle (one was flat tire, another Jeep mysterious not going). One of them takes the tire to an empty service station and it is the last one to see him. When the rest of the foursome go in search of their friend, they meet with nice Mr Slaussen, who offers help fixing the Jeep and offers cool drinks and shelter in his equally begun, private house that happens to be busy with a very realistic looking mannequins. She goes with one bunch to work with the car and leave 3 girls in the house. Before he goes, he warns them that they will not leave and go behind the house; He warns them about "Davy", his brother, who is lurking and not all there. Of course, one of them decides to work on the phone and will never see it again. Is that Slaussen? Is it Davy? Mannequins? The tourist trap has the usual horror requirements (jiggly big boobed girl, two good shoes for girls, curiosity that gives people a better result and never works!), But it's different from the rest of the 70s genre that ends. I started to feel Slaussen's forgiveness (Chuck Conners is a terrible, horrible, outrageous force) at the movie station and you see almost Molly's character the same. It's a pearl if you find it; I had cut off this cable when I was younger and walked through the used video store. Also, fans of Tanya Roberts need not be disappointed. The best part of the film was for me with soup (and crackers !!). <br /> <br /> I gave it to 7 because some of the movie was and is still hard to explain.
