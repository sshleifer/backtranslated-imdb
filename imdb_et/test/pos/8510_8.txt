I'm sick and tired of people complaining to never say that the Thunderball remake is never weak. Yes, the effect of this film is unmistakable, but the huge and almost universal inferiority of the films that have been reproduced is reserved for such thoughtless and unintentional films such as Psycho's 1998 transformation. While it is true that the theme of the twelfth (and last of Connery) Bond film release is one of the worst in the series, the film is still alone, despite many other weaknesses. In addition, even a weak title song has blended into the movie's closing dialog quite nicely. <br /> <br /> Of course, Sean Connery was aged when this movie was filmed (at least James Bond standards), but there is plenty of evidence in the narrative that makes it clear to filmmakers. James Bond is retiring before his assignment, having spent most of his time teaching, not doing, and M is even demanding that he pay more attention to his health, diet and training, and more training and not. Besides, this is James Bond, remember? This man should be some kind of super person and all his fans get all disturbed because he has some gray hairs. When this man retires at the end of the film, he sends a poor "little Fawcet" (Rowan Atkinson's funeral bunch) to tell Bond that without him he is worried about the safety of the free world and all of your people. does not get over that he is no longer a young man. Come on, Sean Connery could play James Bond as well as ever, or at least better than anyone else. <br /> <br /> Most of the film deals with a thorough plan to steal nuclear missiles and hold the world hostage (as Dr. Evil would say, "Oh hell, just do what we always do?"), so there's not much new there, but this is one of Bond's films, which was better in one liner. Is there a fun scene where Bond is required to urine? "If you could just fill this beaker for me?" "From here?" There are a lot of good linings, but the sexual innuend to Mr Bond is particularly common in this contribution. But it happens later that he throws this urine sample on the face of a villain, making him yell as if his face was burned. Not a very good experiment for the comic, especially after this man was hit by Bond's ass with some super-spring device that can cut off a lot. And of course, Kim Basinger's stars in this movie are one of the best Bond girls in the series. <br /> <br /> It's no secret that you never ever say that you are never bad and one of the things dated is the worst of special effects? except for flying missiles that were obviously fake but still impressive in 1982. The contact lenses painted at the beginning of the film were completely effective, and the laser clock was one of the worst of the film, the other only those fucking sharks. Apparently, Fatima Blush put some sort of device on his dive tank that attracted sharks (they were given strange controls), a scene that probably inspired the classic line, "I have one simple application. And that means sharks are attached to the FRICKIN laser beams!" , of course, there are exploding hotel rooms that appeared again in the Simpson episode, followed by another mandatory and overly random lining from James. <br /> <br /> The domination of the video game created by Largo is a crazy movie, especially memorable The scene and the film also have what is probably the best series behind the motorcycle (far better than the ridiculous Tomorrow Never Dies). However, despite the many strengths, the weaknesses of the film are made clearer by the audience at the end of the movie, largely due to the underwater extreme conclusion more visible parts that have been borrowed from Thunderball and have been worse rebuilt) Believe that Largo discovered important information for Bond when he left him in a living tower (Dr. Evil's shine, again, I will leave him without actually seeing his death and just assuming everything went into plan. What? What should be expected to be a fast paced action film, should never happen in a quiet underwater atmosphere. All in all, never has ever said that James Bond's scale is very big, and Connery's face at the end of the movie (as well as the two closing lines) he wanted at a time when he could still return to Bond. It is clear that it is no longer very likely that we can only hope.
