eXistenZ connects the director David Cronenberg with the traditional love of blood and gore and the confusing aspects of explosive heads associated with David Lynch's film. And it actually works effectively. I do not want to try to give any bare bones of the plot summary here because it only creates more confusion. All you need to know is that the movie is a virtual reality computer game that is so incredibly lifelike that it is hard to tell the difference between reality and virtual reality. The film seems almost to end up giving up its scary technology, but then throws it in the last line of the last dialogue. <br /> <br /> There is also a very serious sexual image based on "bio-ports behind the main characters, as well as some very courageous Jude laws. He manages to come naive and stupid and boring, and any other annoying habit you care about. Jason Jennifer Leigh is a lot better and everyone else can be called a supportive character, including Willem Dafoe's functional as unspectacularis as a crazy mechanic of money. In general, eXistenZ is a very effective sci-fi movie about what technology can offer and the potential consequences it will have.
