I was at sea in Camp Pendleton when D.I. came out (1st Maritime Department, 11th Marine Regiment, 3rd Battalion, I-Battery). I still remember that it stood with other marines to see the movie "Star" in Oceanside, California. <br /> <br /> We weren't expecting the film to be everything we experienced in the boot camp, but we were all pleasantly surprised at how well the film was made. The idea of ​​using a real navy in the film was a great idea (I believe they were all true drill drivers). As good as an actor like Jack Webb, he couldn't just "call" like a real Marine Drill Instructor. <br /> <br /> All of us smiled when the mother of the "problem" recruiting came to the camp to talk to the captain. Not a million years would have happened, but it is Hollywood, and we won't let this episode keep the movie going. <br /> <br /> Over the summer, I went to Camp MCBB Camp in San Diego. In 1956, there were practically no restrictions on what DI could do for you. The Ribbon Creek event on Parris Island had not yet affected the bootlaager, at least not the MCRD - San Diego. <br /> <br /> I agree with what many other reviewers, Sgt. Moore's "stiffness" around her girlfriend. I believe it was just Webb's way of acting, and although they could delete that part of the movie, it didn't really damage production. <br /> <br /> One small note, the "non-credited" sign "Pvt. Rodriguez" was played by one of my drill drivers, Sgt. Peter J. O'Neill. Sgt. O'Neill told us that one day he wanted to be an actor. We smiled at it secretly, but he surprised us all. He was a great drill manager, and I thought he did well in his bit section. He also really enjoyed knives. He often showed us his skills at this boot camp this summer. I've often wondered if he's still alive.
