David "Debonair Captain" Niven plays Big Boss (IVAN), who prefers to regret Richard Jordan (PINKY), forcing an unhappy ex-con to take advantage of his ill-discovered new position in the bank. Elke Sommer (Miss PELHAM) offers the most effective female interest that Pinkie cannot easily resist. <br /> <br /> They seem to have been unable to decide on the name of this movie. it makes sense ??? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this turns out to be Niven's latest roles. <br /> <br /> Generally, this movie is fun and worth watching if you manage to catch one of them on your rare or late night TV shows. <br /> <br />
