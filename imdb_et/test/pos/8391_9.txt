Although I agree with the drvn below that Mary McCormack slides out the milk bag on the TV, the rest of the performance is fantastic! Phil Hartman was a great professor, teaching celebrities and splits. Foley is a nut, but good. You never know what self-expressing humor he is next. As for the game, it's fun, full of funny torture and great for every beginner who might even be interested in the game. Too bad it no longer exists :( I just checked the schedule until August and it doesn't seem to be planned in the future. Bad Bravo! You deserve to beat!
