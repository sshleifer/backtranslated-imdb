I watched this series on television in 1990 and loved it (I was nine years old). I bought the first DVD box about six months ago and got a couple of days ago (thanks to my dear husband). Gosh ... With all the head thoughts it was hard to sleep, what happened to Madeline and George, and so on. Slave questions and civil war have always been of interest to me (25-year-old Finn). read the slaves of the Edward Ball family to those who want to look at the past and try to understand what really happened. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if I want to see heaven and hell so many people here have said it isn't really that good.
