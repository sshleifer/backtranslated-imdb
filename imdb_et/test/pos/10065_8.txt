If this film had been made in the 50s or 60s, both critics and fans would have liked it. I myself enjoyed the movie from start to finish. It is not a timeless piece and has not become very outdated over the years, but it is still enjoyable to look at. What about Mrs Ritchie's movie? Not the best on the planet - but it adds to the film's unique comedy aspirations and introduces the feeling of Madonna's (often underestimated) comic timing. Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a convicted offender, accused of a crime she did not do. Griffin Dunne plays the unfortunate future groom / doll who will be sent from prison to a bus station with many unfortunate events, thus creating a plot. (And there is * one, people!) Give the movie a hit. You may be pleasantly surprised at how funny it really is.
