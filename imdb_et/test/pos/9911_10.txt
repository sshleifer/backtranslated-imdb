It may not be the most exciting or amazing episode they've made, but I think it will be the most original episodes of Star Trek and Sci-Fi. Most of the retro Sci-Fi series ideas, especially when using Star Trek, are repeatedly reused, and on the other hand it is mostly a one-time triumph. This is one of the episodes that most impressed me. <br /> <br /> Another thing I like about this episode is how it has achieved such and exit and enchanting story with such a little special effect. Now, without criticizing the episode, I have to admit that the effects are very dated, but then what are you waiting for in the 1967 TV show? But still, in this episode, the creature (Horta) is basically just a carpet with some colored rubbers. However, you forget about it in about 1 minute and start thinking about it if it should be. Also, the caves don't look exactly like a stone, but you'll forget again in a few minutes. This episode is a lively proof of how good performance and good story can ignore visual effects. In this episode, Spock's second series is related and one of my favorites. So, to put it simply, Leonard Nimoy is definitely a scene here, and his acting is great. Not that Kirk or Bones will not get their share of the episode, but Spock is the most intriguing in this episode. I like the fact that the episode is not related to one particular character, but develops into a trio of foreign problem. It's also nice to see an episode that doesn't just happen in business. <br /> <br /> Like most Star Trek episodes, this episode tells us that we have an open mind. I'm not breaking the story, but evolving around what seems to be a typical monster story at first. It has killed several people and therefore they must be killed. But is it really all this? I can assure you that the explanation is not disappointing. It is still my favorite Star Trek TOS episode and I will give it a 10/10.
