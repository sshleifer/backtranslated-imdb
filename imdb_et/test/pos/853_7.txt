Jungle is rather an adventure than a fiction film. The only sci-fi part is wool mammals living today. <br /> <br /> Elephants attack parts of India in the village and these attacks are also killing people. The expedition is sent for investigation and one of its members, the American hunter, accuses these elephants of frightening intimidation of the Mammoths, which presuppose that they are extinct. No one will believe her first, but they will do when the Mammoths come to an end. The earthquake stops them. <br /> <br /> Jungle was beaten in India and has lots of nice landscapes and good Indian music, including some songs that keep the movie well. Mammoths are actually real elephants with fur and long carts. <br /> <br /> Rod Cameron, Cesar Romero (The Lost Continent) and Marie Windsor (Moon's Cat) are cast. /> <br /> Jungle is worth seeing, just for landscapes and music. Very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
