I'm glad Cage changed her name from Coppoll and got her part of it. Light hearts, deep thinking is not necessary, but a lovely piece of contrasts that attract - though his parents are still hippies .... - captures the early 80s - the valley and the other half of the funk. You can see the beginning of Cage's talent.
