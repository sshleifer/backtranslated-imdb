I found this exhibition at random and was surprised that someone I know has never heard of it. It was by far one of the best examples I have seen in six, if not years, and I can't wait to get more episodes out. Sleeper Cell is the psychological fight of a secret agent in a terrorist attack who must constantly make difficult decisions to maintain his cover while maintaining his true cause. This is a very well done exhibition. It keeps you interested in the first episode until the end, and while it is slowly progressing, it is fast enough to make you feel on the edge. Quite realistic and humane, it concerns important topics and every episode presents an interesting question to think about. This exhibition is not 24 or any police officer on TV and does not try to be anything. It is genuine and unique. It is an exhibition of a person, his difficult choices and a struggle in life, where a simple mistake can cost him everything. <br /> <br /> I gave this exhibition 10 great styles, good progress, excellent cinematography, great music and realistic characters, each with a story.
