Karen Carpenter Story has a smart little scene where both carpenters are in the recording studio and Richard makes a decisive decision that Karen will sing to the studio owner. <br /> <br /> Richard chooses the key to Karen to sing, so Karen sings above his natural range. You can see the owner's face in a glimpse; he thinks he can't really sing. Richard quickly understands his mistake and tries again in some other way. The next thing you hear is Karen's amazing, beautiful voice and the owner makes an invaluable double image. Nice done! For some reason, I've never forgotten this scene. <br /> <br /> Karen Carpenter Story crowns the meteoric rise of carpentry and Karen's struggle to overcome anorexia. Many things are glossed over. This is not a documentary and the film left many questions to me. Very little has been mentioned about Karen's solo activity (CD only appeared a few years ago. If you buy, you don't know why they were waiting. This is some of Karen's best work. Songs are not as timeless as working with her brother. Richard, but it was in my mind I have heard you said that you can listen to a cheap, time-consuming little radio in the middle of the third world, it seems to be more static than anything else. But when Carpenter's song arrives on the radio, you think you listened to the $ 1000 Hi-Fidelity device. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie!
