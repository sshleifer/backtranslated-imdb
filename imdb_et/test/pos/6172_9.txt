I've been committed to IMDB visitor for a couple of years. This is a film that finally forced me to write. <br /> <br /> I accidentally hit this movie (opening credits came up in the past when I turned the TV one morning). I enjoyed the movie thoroughly for a number of reasons, all covered by other reviewers - the mood, the forgotten history of Czech pilots, the subtle charm of supporters, the fatalism of headlines, and the first personal view of battle scenes. <br /> <br /> But the "Dark Blue World" element that really stood out was the lack of dramatic effects, especially in the fight (and that's good!). While the pilots were not in a musical score, no worrying husband / girlfriend had any manipulative strikes, every little air force maneuver did not create tiny patriotic joy and the spectators were not asked to swallow the incredible James Bond-esque pilot heroes. Instead, the audience is allowed to feel the melancholy, fear, and isolation of those individual pilots who try to stand up during the battle. As the comrades have been kicked off, we have saved tears of plagues and a typical (but pleasing to the public) revenge-based hero. Instead, other pilots, unfortunately and silently, are watching the fate of their co-pilots - in reality, they still need to focus on their own safety and goals right now. We experience a pilot's breathing and roaring of the engines only briefly, as we, the audience, know our friend's spiral quietly until his death. And then we have to jump back to combat mode and focus on survival. <br /> <br /> Too often, Hollywood has spoon-fed emotions that we should feel and where there is no room for the imagination of the viewer. "Dark Blue World" retains the enthusiastic and inclusive spell that allows us to invest in film and fill gaps and spaces using our thoughts and feelings. <br /> <br /> A great movie that deserves to be viewed.
