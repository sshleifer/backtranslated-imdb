It's a real achievement that three very different filmmakers filmed the story could be so insightful about gay and bi-sexual relationships and their struggles! <br /> <br /> "Half-days" refers to the discomfort of adolescents and the mutual attractiveness of the older man and the younger. A story about experience and vulnerability! "Dorothy's friend" is a common dilemma that many gay and bi-sexual people are experiencing at some point in their lives: an intense attraction for someone who is heterosexual. Sensitively studied, this story really left me feeling moved! <br /> <br /> "Disco Years" shows another version of an invincible situation: engaging with someone who is not only confused about your sexual orientation, but is also scared that they come across something other than straight! A very impressive story for those who have experienced fraud in a sexually confused and frightened person! <br /> <br /> Although these three stories will remind everyone who has empathy with others, they will psychologically empower those who consider themselves gay, bi-sexual, or searching. Every story is exaggerated in its unique way!
