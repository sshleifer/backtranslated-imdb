In addition to the clouds, there is a strange film I have ever seen. Not for this cultural law, gore or even your ideas, but because of the elements that make this cinema a masterpiece. Beside the clouds, Michelangelo Antonioni, one of Italy's most famous directors, led. However, if you gave this film to a quick look, then I passively understand that it is one of those melodramatic and often meaningless romances. This film deserves great attention to cover its entire cheese. According to the cheese I don't mean a slice, but the whole cheddel! Music seems to originate from some Italian porn, story and dialogue as they are pretty Japanese soap and metaphors are so obvious that you want to hit yourself. <br /> <br /> But when you get it all, you've been dealing with an existential work of art. Cheese nourishes subtle filming and perfectly points to what needs to be known. The basic piece is from four chapters that are not interconnected, and from all love. What we learn is that no matter what happens or what is said, people cannot communicate with each other. Instead, they can communicate with each other. I think that is why dialogue and plot are so exciting, because conversations are too irrational due to causal relationship and lack of human reaction too melodramatically. <br /> <br /> I left to think about this movie; maybe there is one big melodrama of life. We appreciate our feelings for others as real and meaningful. I hate it because I have a reason. But what hates to think? Maybe they think my hate is stupid and arbitrary. In other words, melodramatic. <br /> <br /> So melodrama is actually an existential function. Dirty romance is just a human interaction that is placed under a magnifying glass that allows us to see who we are and what we do. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, I recommend it to everyone!
