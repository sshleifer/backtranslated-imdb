Despite its very low budget, Sorte Nula is the most successful Portuguese film of 2004. And I have to say that this is a well-deserved success. What I love about "Sorte Nula" is the most complicated detail that Fernando Fragata went to care about what's going on and what's going on. It is very detailed and perfectly developed for a seemingly simple love-lost bad thriller. Even more enjoyable and ironic is that the characters are in the same situation, none of them knows the whole story and is left to their own assumptions, making Sorte Nula the rest of the place. This is definitely not the movie you want to walk around for a break in the bathroom, because there's no doubt something important. I feel that one of the main features of a film should be the environment it forms. At the same time, it is horrible but fun. I read somebody who cites this movie, saying, "... it was like watching Hitchcock ..." and I could no longer agree! I love movies where you have to pay attention to ALL to fully understand what is going on. 9/10
