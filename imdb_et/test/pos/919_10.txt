I use IMDB very much. Reading other people's comments about movies I've seen or not. I thought it was time to write a few words about the film that changed my life and how I watch the movie. I think I've seen it from the 94th autumn at least a dozen times when I first saw it in the theater. <br /> <br /> I feel that Kieslowski is the best of all times. And I think it's best. It was his last. I was a very sad day when I knew he was dead because I was sure we lost the opportunity to get something more from him. <br /> <br /> RED is the best Kieslowski + trintignand & Jacobi + operator, Sobocinski. If you haven't seen it, SEE! If you have, just come back to it !! <br /> <br /> Red: Just a masterpiece. please forgive my poor english! reader
