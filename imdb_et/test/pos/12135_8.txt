So you think you've ever seen a mafia movie! Here is one that nobody heard. It's a low budget, fast B movie made in Jersey's tails. The mob-movie fans were little for us - sex, violence, curse and wise men like "gafones". Although violence dominated the film, I found myself laughing at some of the familiar scenes I've seen in Soprano and Goodfell. Look for the 1977 version of the Badabing Girls movie at the beginning. <br /> <br /> All of our favorite mobster stereotypes were here. And like realism, "fugettaboutit"! Joe Pesci was great, depicting classical wisdom as we saw him so many times over the years. It was probably his first shot, and it was a pearl. Pesci fans should go to the video store to watch this flick. You have to look at it carefully because it goes by different names. My copy called it "Family Assistant". Here it is known as the "Collector of Death". But what is under the name should be called - A Winner.
