This is a movie they used to do, entertaining, heart-warming, worrying, authentic, convincing presentations without people without nose, boob jobs, eye jobs, in other words, real people. Shauna Macdonald plays a female love interest and she is so real that you want to give her at least a go. Imagine that this is a real girl in the movie, regardless of the following? Hollywood hates her because her freshness is a sharp attack on every Tinseltown's false headline. This story is as fun as Sandy Mackendrick's classic "Whiskey Galore", where the gnomic humor of the inhabitants of the remote Scottish islands hurts intruders' claims from outside and occasionally enjoys a nerve-drama (actual intervals between these times are often quite short). Director Stephen Whittaker has a rare skill to draw it right, and it is shocking to find out that he died before the movie was released, but only 56 years old, which was obviously a significant damage to the screen. Ulrich Thomsen plays a very good German missile scientist who, at the end of the 1930s, went to Scarp on the island of Harri to build a small rocket carrying parcels between the islands. There he falls in love with the tempting Macdonald shot, and he is fond of affection. Some are adorned with beautiful colorful local characters and the film is a pure joy. Of course, there is a danger of a war with Hitler, and we know that Hitler executed 1,000 missile scientists who refused to build military weapons, which is shocking statistics. Tragic love is never far away, but lips must remain sealed for an overview of what is happening at the end. This movie is a great example of the kind of movies people in Britain should do. But are they properly released? Is there a nation whose taste is so spoiled by reality TV shows, where disgusting discord has become a national hero, does such a film still exist? After all, a relative is not sex, no wounds or close-ups, no drugs, no meaningful celebrities who would like to be watched, and so do not know if there is anything to interest the public who has become so decadent and exhausted that only the most extreme feelings can briefly mitigate the tedium of their futile existence. Anyone who is looking for an antidote to today's UK freedom can be refused in this refreshing and honest movie.
