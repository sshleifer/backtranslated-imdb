This is a great advancement for the award-winning Lonesome Dove mini-miners in the 1980s. This sequel is perhaps better than the original. It is definitely family friendly. The language is weaker. There's a lot of violence and one particular scene with the Cherokee Jack is particularly tough. In general, it's a great movie. Action is great. William Peterson is fantastic. Such a great dramatic actor with quick mind and comic timing. Jon Voight completes Tommy Lee Jones' shoes as a captain. Ricky Shroder gives a young boy with a wonderful heart who grew up without his family. Highly recommended.
