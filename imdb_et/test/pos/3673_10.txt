I absolutely adore this movie! I had never heard of it when I saw it in a video store. I saw Kathy Bates was in this, so I thought it was worth something, you know? I looked at it for the first time just by shaking my head. . . Ah? Then it was the last scene and I found myself hurting so hard with a smile. I clicked on the "play movie" and watched the whole thing again. This is undoubtedly the most passionate film I've ever seen. But the more I look at it, the more I love it. It's absurd and crazy and cute and expensive. Kathy Bates is impeccable, but the rest is fabulous. What pairs of characters are all! The dwarf is too funny for words. And Julie Andrews and Barry Manilow are hysterical. It's just a funny, fabulous movie. I can see it again. Whoever looks at it for the first time, leave it to the end. It's worth it!
