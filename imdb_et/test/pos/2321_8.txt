Down Periscope is not a "great movie". But then there are very few pictures again. So if your search for entertainment instead of great wisdom is a "big movie", without the capitals. No sharp sexism or graphic violence will allow this light comedy to attack under the antique brand. They have to perform their tasks so that the general will get its extra letter. They have to take the entire United States Navy together with their nuclear submarines. But they are underdogs and this is comedy so you can guess the result. But you root them underdogs and this makes it a very fun movie. Watch and enjoy ******** (eight stars that are)
