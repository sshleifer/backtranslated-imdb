About Leslie Carba's excellent book about Fleishers, the entire Fleischer animation unit in Florida speaks of the resurrection and their subsequent Paramount. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bug goes to town without destroying the animation pioneers' credit with Paramount, although it's often said so, and it was a favorite version of Paramount's story. According to Carba, a large studio wanted more than anything to get to the animation studio of their fingers and to simplify the famous captives. Mr. Bug gave them an excuse to do just that. - The sad closure of an innovative chapter based on the American big quiz. <br /> <br /> I also wanted to comment that the movie debuted on December 4, 1941, not on December 7th. enough to do a trick with the national mood that undermines the success of the film. But the other part of this worrying little movie legend is that he was killed, how lucky to be in theaters at the same time. Dumbo (published October 23, 1941) continued to make very busy holidays. I haven't studied the box numbers, but I would say that Dumbo's simultaneous presence in theaters probably affected Mr Bug. The film period was always high during this period, and the successful films had been strong in the theater for several months. - Something that they usually do in short-term, fast DVD days cannot be imagined.
