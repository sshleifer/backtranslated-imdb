Yes, I looked at this little series with my mother and father as a child. It was one of the few mini-series my 9-year-old really followed. I remember that it was very well done and may not necessarily feel the typical crap mini-series. It was more or less the original concept that really attracted your attention. I would recommend this minisation to anyone who is a fan of history and plot twists. While most of the twists of this movie are either outlined or predictable, it is still time to be. I haven't checked if you can get it through netflix. I can not imagine. They should play it on the history channel or something.
