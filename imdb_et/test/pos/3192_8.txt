I first saw love in Limbos five years ago, who played free TV, and since then it has been a movie I always remember as one of the films you see and affect forever. <br /> <br /> For an Australian movie, history, submissive, has a long history of desperate comedies from loved losers, and Love in Limbo is an example. Although Russel Crowe is the only name in this actor (although he is nowadays all the needs of the film), the rest of the Aussie is good - he still steals the exhibition as a loser, virgin, virgin loser. The general assumption is like the American Pie. A group of friends who want to lay down and become men. As you think, the whole movie focuses on it (with the sub-lining of the mother of the wire and the various other incidents) and is full of humorous situations that inevitably push it to the sweet end. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy American Pie, don't expect it to be the same - but wait for the same conventions. Love in Limbo is not a romantic comedy, but it is definitely your laugh, fist-pumping moments when a good boy wins, and a situation where every man, Australia or otherwise, may be involved. /> See if you liked it: American Pie, Almost Famous. Strengths: Good Aussie cast, easy to associate, good pervi value. Weaknesses: predictable at points. My rating: 8 out of 10
