When you sit down to see this "Cannon Cannon" movie, you will feel it is great. The reason? The film begins with the exciting result of the observed composer Elmer Bernstein, who gave us such memorable themes as "The Great Escape and the Great Seven". Indeed, if you read the open credits that are cast, nobody else is George Peppard like Captain Rod Douglas. Besides, if you see actress John Russel playing General John J. Pershing, you know you're a heroic saga. The story is taken from the Mexican Revolutionary Magazines and involves the US border dispute with Mexican bandits crossing the Rio Grande in the early 1900s. Major rebels include General Cordova (Raf Vallone). His Mexican revolutionary army is attacked by Pershing, killing his men and stealing valuable artillery. Since the United States Army cannot legally enter Mexico, Captain Douglas is sent to a suicide mission without orders and without Pershing. His mission is to bring cannons, destroy the rebel fortress and bring Cordova alive back. Douglas enters Mexico and attacks an almost unbearable fortress, picking the toughest, hardest, most experienced, most foolish people. There is dramatic action and lots of explosive excitement. If somebody asks for criticism, I would say you would choose the difficulty. Vallone and John Larch are not very dangerous. Not so with Peppard's men. Pete Duel and Don Gordon (who's great). ****
