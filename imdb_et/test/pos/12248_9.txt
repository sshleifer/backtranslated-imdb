I didn't like "very good as it goes" very much, but I'm a big fan of William Hurt and Holly Hunter's work, so I decided to watch this movie. And for me, Albert Brooks's excellent work was more surprising. Here in Spain, he is little known and only on the west coast of Woody Allen's 2nd version. He played a big role, but Hunter and Hurt were also good, especially Hurt, with a rather unusual role. Hunter played a role that reminds me of a bit of "Kord Around" (Lasse Hallstrom, 1991). <br /> <br /> Finally, the rest is great. Robert Prosky, one of those familiar faces of American cinema, a former bond girl Lois Chiles, is, in my opinion, the role that is always perfect for Joan Cusack in his early years; and a short appereance specifically for Jack Nicholson. Maybe he has no good scene, but it is still Jack Nicholson ... Best movie James L.Broox, great story (well solved) and excellent assignment to one of the best films of the 80s
