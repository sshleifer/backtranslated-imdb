I'm terrible and outraged that the network has canceled the Talk Show with Spike Feresten! <br /> <br /> What's wrong with Fox's television network, canceling Talk Show Spike with Feresten and replacing it with Wanda Sikes? Wanda At Large was abolished for short-sighted people because the audience grew tired of her nasty insults that would make the audience shine, and Wanda Sykes, who pulled out her trademark, which is honest mud slings, is not humor, it's disgusting and reluctant . Apparently, Wanda Sikes has been rewarded by Fox Television Network because it has collected a significant appearance from President Baraki Obama himself. There is no doubt that Wanda's recent sick mood in front of the President of the United States is not funny, and the audience's laughter was just to patronize and ask Barak Obama. <br /> <br /> Spike Feresten talks with a real sense of humor and has never intentionally or honestly offended any guest or performer. Spike's well-rounded personality is always cheerful, beating life and having fun. And her Filed Pieces for the first two seasons with AFTRA actress Mary Mae Atwill, like the 21st century Mae West, were completely hysterical with Spike Feresten's sketches: Judge Joe Brown, Trade Spouses and last season's James Kyson Lee episode where Spike talks to Eric over the Internet. <br /> <br /> Despite the network's budget constraints on complex fields and the second season's WGA strike, Spike Feresten did not give up his sense of humor or honesty. The Talk Show with Spike Feresten always had a new talent, and his comedy for stoners Nanny 911 and the idiot for Paparazzi were considered top-notch and with great product value. On a professional level, Spike Feresten was the best producer and Set Producer, Brett Webster, with his fabulous production team, was one of the best production teams I've worked for in my AFTRA career. It would be really stupid and sad to shake off with Talk Show Spike Feresten. Unfortunately, this success could have been achieved by Comedy Central or some other network, and financially speaking, which would become a valuable loss of revenue for FOX television. <br /> <br /> Fox Television's audience, Talk Show supporters, Spike Feresten, late in the evening cast and team members, we ask the network to maintain Talk Show Spike Feresten Franchise and give the team another chance to become a successful Fox Show.
