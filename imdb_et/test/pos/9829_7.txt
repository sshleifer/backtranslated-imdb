The late Sydney Pollack has grown into a love story of human nature, pain, passion and betrayal. Police Sergeant Dutch Van Den Broeck (Harrison Ford) has been destroyed when he learns that his beloved husband has been killed during an air strike, he is even more annoying to learn his attitude to the wife of the famous congressman Kay Chandler (Kristen Scott Thomas). He arranges to meet and see if he knew or did not feel that he had no idea. They begin to face each other in a friendly way, that their mutual pain and stress begin to emerge in intense relationships (which can be understood as the healing of both of them). Memories of the dead and the pressure of the corresponding jobs can separate them and cause more harm than good or can they get out of the past, but you have to look at the random corners and find.
