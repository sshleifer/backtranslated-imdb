We see that the man moves out of the city "back" and changes dramatically - his family asks questions, but he gets crazy. <br /> <br /> A strange, brilliant movie from Israel. Wonderful places, great actors, a film that masks the "thriller" but which is more a case study of the madness of leadership. <br /> <br /> The film was higher than other films at AICE here in Israel. Fortunately for the team that arrived for this movie. This is Grand Guignol, a little masterpiece. <br /> <br /> My only criticism of "10" is that sound and music are sometimes powerful. It tends to get pictures that speak for itself.
