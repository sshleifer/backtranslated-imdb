The short history of time is not just a documentary about the beginning and the end of universal and reality, as we know it, it is the story of a man and a genius known as Stephen Hawking. This is his story that reflects the story of time and change in universal history. The documentary / editing style style of the interviews begins and ends quickly with fading black. Almost like blinking between segments and interviews, the documentary gives you a strange feeling like Stephen Hawking's point of view and not the camera's eye. Driving time is just over an hour. This is a short story, then again this topic can talk about days and days. An interesting and proud story.
