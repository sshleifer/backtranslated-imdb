The medical nurse Betty has a strange but fierce combination of a repulsive, mitigating plot of extraordinary character. Just as I looked at Fargo for the first time, I realized I was thinking about it for days and enjoyed it, I liked Sister Betty a lot more days after I saw it. Hard to understand, harder to explain. As others have said, it is quite forced in many ways, but it seems to be part of what makes it so striking. <br /> <br /> Greg Kinnear's fair work, great work from Morgan Freeman (although I worry he is stereotyped as a basic villain). Chris Rock was good but not special. Rene Z. is so natural that it is nervous - that is, it is irritating to be "natural" who plays someone who is not well headed. Also, a small part of "Alliance Janney" liked the "abrasive spark". <br /> <br /> Don't wait as many "on the road" as you might expect from some synopsis. (There is a "tea" but it's just barely relevant.) Rated 8/10.
