Nice movie. At first I thought it was a medieval detective with hi-fi, but the end ended with a surprise. I think the whole film covers too many topics, each of which can be the main subject, eg. revenge, friendship and dream. But it all interrupted them without focusing on them. I think it would be a great movie if it was built from the end of the beginning. <br /> <br />
