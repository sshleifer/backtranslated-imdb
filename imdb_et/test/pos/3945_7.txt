Another go around with a monkey king going west .... sort of. <br /> <br /> From the middle of some action movie just goes from the first frame forward. <br /> <br /> A monk and his three disciples will go to the city to receive the sacred dies that bring peace to the world as they are translated and spoken to the world. But the forces of evil have intervened and kidnapped all the children of the city. The evil forces want the monk, because if you eat him, you will live forever. The invaders are fighting the forces of darkness before forcing the monk to be forced for safety (monk believes he can just win by justifying bad sons). Mung ends up with a lot of lizard empires who are planning to eat him at some point ... but the bad guys are coming and he's out of worst odyssey. <br /> <br /> Is a film that starts off the track from the rail? Don't make me wrong, I really liked this movie, but it's both scattering and the whole place where the plot and logic just fall, because some scenes just pick up the action in the middle, but don't know how we got there. save the disciples is completely out of the way). This is one of the most spectacular films I've seen for a while, but it made me laugh and smile as it didn't come out. The movie begins and you have no idea where things are and what's on the screen is interesting or funny and you're just going with it. How we get things often over me. He is full of strange aside and strange references when we go from heaven to ocean space, that the ribs of some mythical beasts are known to God. This movie floats all over the place, which helps keep it fun because you don't know where it finally comes (and that's why you keep the details to a minimum) and it's funny. <br /> And the action is very good, even if it is a good piece of CGI animation (which gives some cool pictures, golden staff, spider attack formation, angel flight ...) and its very Action and comedy as it is really wonderful a love story whose story is an ugly imp and a monk who finally falls in love (and who has other complications), an interesting look at the nature of love and what is true You are being moved. <br /> <br /> But much of what I enjoyed was still upset with the scattering structure, but the movies couldn't hold their ideas together and the whole story really did not hurt and filmed with joy every time we reached the road because the sleeves take you out of the movie and make you realize How much is cribbed from other sources. <br /> <br /> It is definitely worth noting because it has a lot of options, just be ready for some places and you have a good time.
