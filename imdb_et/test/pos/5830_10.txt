I admit I almost gave up watching TV shows. Why? Because most of them are doctors, forensics, or some girl / boy who can predict a murder while sitting on a toilet. But I have to say I was wrong when I looked at the first episode of Oz's most genius exhibition to date. Oz is an exhibition of maximum safe prison and shows the life of each cell in prison and episodes of their disappointments. I like this show that he has the courage to show real life in prison without any annoying signs, stereotypes, and unrealistic dialogues. Even I thought the characters in the show didn't have to be heroes, so you quickly changed their lives. Of course, their show has a lot of violence and some disturbing pictures of rape and taking drugs, but this is the point of the show; to show how brutal and depressing may be the life of a prison ... hell, you can't show life in prison like "clean environment" with "nice signs", right? Oz is perfect in every sense, the actors do a great job and the whole hour of the show really goes really fast. The only thing I didn't like about this show was the last season of the show, I think it became too strange and brutal and the final was not satisfactory. But in general, Oz is still my favorite show on television, over Sopranos and a million CSIs and Dr House's crap with just one title. Brilliant show with balls to show what other exhibitions take away from us; realism.
