I saw a 2-hour version of Choker Bali. I can't say it's long. The film has a certain natural pace and it doesn't seem to break down at any time. Costume and costume resemble what we would see in old films. It really is a ripe role that has enough space to act. The script also supports the story very well. Aishwarys is a miserable widow whose husband dies in the first year of marriage. The film talks about the nature of the passions and desires and of the conflict with which he faces the widowed situation of these times. <br /> <br /> His best friend in this movie also plays well with Raima Sen. - handled. His innocence and Aishwarya's ability to speak English and be educated to be admired have been done very well. These are indeed the dominant thoughts of these times. We see how far we have come from such an era! <br /> <br /> The film talks about the liberation of women as a story of a fine line. I found that the story is very similar to Ghare Bahire, which was also written by Tagore. It does not depend on the struggle for independence in some sense and, on the contrary, struggles against the independence of India in the silent struggle for women's rights. <br /> <br /> A well-made movie is definitely worth it. Aishwarya Action: par excellence. Rituparna has carefully treated the story. Another classic Rabindranath Tagore.
