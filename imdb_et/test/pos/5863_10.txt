This film is probably one of the most creative horrors. It has everything you want ... temporary, drama, comedy, confused subpages, native Americans, eating a brain ... If you are looking for all, endless movies, look no further. Human story, revenge. And how to get it better? "I know I sucked their brain!" With great sound effects and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.
