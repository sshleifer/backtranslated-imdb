The film was surprisingly wonderful, especially considering the latter. The third was dark and semi-interesting, but it wasn't nearly as fun or enjoyable. It is full of comedy drawings on Martha Stuart, the puppet anatomy, masturbation, and it actually took place during terrible and disturbing images. The film was not intimidating or intense, and I am sure it was not the director's intention. It was fun because stupidity, Jennifer Tilly is up and sexy. The dolls doll girl was so well handled, mouth, lips, eye eyes, knife on the chest and costumes. The dolls were just wonderful and made the terrible deaths more relaxed, given that they were made by wonderful dolls. The new Chucky look was great and Tiffany was very cute. Some of the scenes where Chucky was a human Tiffany made my father smile. Jesse and Jade were surprisingly attractive and the special effects were cool. The conclusion was so uncertain and the fact that they could do another is quite unlikely. It may not be as tight as movies like Halloween H2O or Urban Legend, but it's definitely more fun !!!!
