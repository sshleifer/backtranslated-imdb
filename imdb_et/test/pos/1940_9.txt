I just watched another comment posted here, where the writer discusses the worrying ways in which the teenagers of this movie use their dead friend's body. what is ignored in this statement is perhaps the most unpleasant of them, it is not surprising that what crispin glover character is all about. he is excited about one of his friends who murders a friend of another friend, the killer. not because layne did not like this man, but he is excited about his death because it gives him something to do. this poor boy is bored of life and died from the inside that the murdered friend is something excited because it gives him something to focus on.
