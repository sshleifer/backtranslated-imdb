There are also other films from boarding houses and student and employee opposites, but "St Trinian bulls" are all over them! Other posters have thoroughly summarized the plot so that I do not cover the same land. I just want to say it's shameful that it's ultimately on DVD, but in a format that can't be used in the US! :-( <br /> <br /> Enjoy, fans in New Zealand and Australia! And if anyone reads it, pulling on such issues, please help release this DVD with region 1 encoding! (I'm not saying "if") is it published on DVD in the United States?
