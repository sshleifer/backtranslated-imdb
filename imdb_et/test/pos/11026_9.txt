There is a lot to admire about this film, but the thing that first surpassed me was part of an eccentric hermit, a loving and romantic role of Hollywood, but what is completely persuasive here and unlike any character I've ever seen in a movie or life. Also a very convincing and disturbing image of Tourete's syndrome
