Great show. <br /> <br /> First of all, people who don't like it. Don't like it, DON'T SEE it ... <br /> <br /> This is (was) an awesome show. Better than Jim says (my favorite). It shows the household of the REAL family (unlike 8 simple rules, etc., where everything goes to peach). <br /> <br /> They are speakers, they are dirty. garbage in the kitchen. It happens in real life. Sorted like a "hell portal" and all like dogs over fast food boxes. <br /> <br /> It's "been there" to show you .... You know what's coming but fun to watch because you've been there before. <br /> <br /> Good light, they work great together, a marvelous exhibition that ensures DVD release. Mel Gibsons "Security Videos" were also highlights of the series. <br /> <br /> Opinion? Good Exhibition, Comparison of DVD Extract (It is also worth not to cancel it).
