In 1794, the second year of the French Republic, formed after Louis XVI was executed, this film represents a powerful battle between the revolutionary leaders Danton (Gerard Depardieu, his best) and Robespierre (leading Polish actor Wojciech) Psniak). Moderately revolutionary, Danton has returned from his home country in Paris, where he has since been Robespierre as head of the Public Safety Commission last year. He is opposed to "Terrorism Governance", which resulted in the execution of thousands of citizens, mainly by guillotine, believed to be against the revolution. Danton is confident in the support of ordinary people and tries to convince Robespierre to limit bleeding. But Robespierre and the Committee are afraid that Danton's popularity will lead to their fall and make Danton and his supporters judge to be traitors. It was the first French film made by Andrzej Wajda after he arrived in France from Poland. His Polish film company was shut down by the government, as he supported a union of solidarity that was opposed by the Polish government in the early seventies and eighties. His previous film "Man Of Iron" (1981) dealt with the Union of Solidarity and its leader Lech Walesa, and it is easy to compare Walesa and Polish leader General Jaruselski's relationship between Danton and Robespierre. Danton / Walesa is a voice that contradicts Robespierre / Jaruselski, who continues the dictatorial rule, even though they have lost the support of their supposedly representing people. The film is based on the Polish game "The Danton Affair" written by Stanislawa Przybyszewska in the 1930s, which was criticized by some for being static and theatrical. But what the film does is focus on the committee's ex-post meetings and scenes in the National Assembly and the courtroom, rather than on the streets in Paris.
