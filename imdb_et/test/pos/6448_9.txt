I read the above comment and can't believe it! Of course, her child's film, this children's book adaptation! This movie is easy to get, try play.com or amazon and its very easy to get a copy! Jokes are so fun for kids and adults and the adventure is pure without violence! It is perfect for children of all ages! The songs are fab and yes, a bit repetitive, but what the kids need, and watching it, heard my kids all night singing "hi hi cocalorum"! They loved it, the story of innocence and friendship! Very cute and worth a look for kids and adults of all ages!
