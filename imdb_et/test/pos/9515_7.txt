Another "end of the world" movie that makes a comparison of the exhausting "Day after tomorrow". Follow the same structure as DAT, but clearly in Japanese style. How does it cost? It depends on your taste for the Japanese melodrama. <br /> <br /> I have found that small human controls are what makes this movie unfamiliar for 2 hours. Also frequent headlines that explain some science. Impacts are probably the best I've seen in Japanese film and they are very good at comparing Hollywood. Many catastrophic scenes are really terrible, although the human horn is usually turned off. And this is one of the drawbacks. While the fear of thousands of deaths on screen, as in the recent "World War", may be too great, we cannot really understand that the whole nation is going to break into the ocean. chaos, but mostly this part has barely touched the story, despite the fact that the film has many levels and it is as realistic as DAT, it is up to the end. The story depends on one of the clod's piece of equipment and the second plot device that would be at home in the dangerous film "Gorath" of the 1960s Japanese ground. After a reasonably good science and mostly a realistic disaster, it is a bit of a disappointment. The unexpected stop of the movie for pop music songs doesn't help (if you don't like this song). This made me a "thrilling" end to a little drag. <br /> <br /> The overall direction is good and the art design is great, it also works great.
