This story has been a special place in my heart for the past thirty-one years. As a boy, I enjoyed stories of mountains and desert. Books like "The Wild of the Wild", "The White Fang", "The Frontiersman" and "My Side Of the Mountain" influenced me enormously. I wanted to live as much as a mountain man, but nothing inspired me to do this when I saw this movie on television in 1975. I wanted to be like "Trapper". However, as I got older, I found that I was too home to live. However, I still romanticize this kind of life. I agree with another review of this movie that the story is simple, which is quite common in "Disneyisque" -type movies, but if you can watch the mechanics in which it is done and see the story in the heart, the real topics, I think you'll find yourself pleasant touched. I do this once a year to watch the movie. After thirty-one years I can still go out when I see a rushing snow tower on the hill and hear a echo, worshiping Trapper's smile. <br /> <br /> - Good luck old player and stay free - <br /> <br /> PS If you want to read more about the real story, I found this link on Mad Trapper on the rat river: <br /> <br /> http : //www.mysteriesofcanada .com / NWT / madtrapper.htm
