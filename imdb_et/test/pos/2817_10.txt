The best bit of the movie was when Alan pulled her chicks down and ran a cut throat razor over her blush and her bump. It was also great to see that Alan stood up and down like a violin elbow later in the movie. <br /> <br /> Alan was as hell as he was annoying and pushing between four eyes. sofa. <br /> <br /> I have been laughing over the days with a cucumber cutter. A brilliant idea for script writers. Alan comes back to Eastenders so he can do the same with Peggy. <br /> <br /> Alan is back and this time he is armed with a razor. Beware whether you are a girl and she finds you and pulls her knives.
