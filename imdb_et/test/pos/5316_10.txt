My God, Ryan Gosling, has made many deep signs during his career, one of his great actors. For me, this is a very deep film, needs a lot of concentration, not because it is difficult to look at, but because you understand it when you put your shoes in that child, though it is all and is a famous father who is a writer. Remember, you do not understand why he kills this poor child until you actually heard what he has to say, and you start thinking at least that many things he says are true. A simple child, sweet, very gentle, in the usual way like any teenager, but inside it suffers because he starts looking at the world differently, so you understand why he did what he did. I recommend this movie to those who love deep drama.
