After two short scenes that don't seem to be related to the rest of the movie, we'll see a dark hair color behind the limousine. His driver stops in an odd location at Mulholland Drive, a complex, tightly forested two-lane road full of mansion overlooking Los Angeles. Like his driver and another man on the passenger seat, the limousine rides two racing cars in motion to kill him. Only a dark-haired woman lives. She runs the road through the brush to Sunset Boulevard and hides her in the woman's apartment. Shortly thereafter, Betty (Naomi Watts), who is an outgoing woman's niece, appears in the apartment and goes to a dark haired woman who is now an amnesia. Most of the first part of the film is Betty and the dark haired woman who is trying to find out who she is, why people tried to kill her and why she had thousands of dollars and a strange key. It is confusing with strange surreal threads about Hollywood producers and directors, from time to time entering the land of hoodlums and prostitutes. The film is built so that meaning is always open to interpretation. It's basically guaranteed that you don't understand this movie and you don't get much confidence in your interpretation for the first time. Even if you have a lot of experience with movies with similar views - such as Memento (2000), Donnie Darko (2001), The I Inside (2003), and Butterfly Effect (2004) - you may not understand it for another. The studio was aware of it so much that they had director David Lynch, who wrote "10 tips to unlock this thriller" and put it on the DVD on the back of the chapter listing device. Lynch has a specific layout, these tips are almost as mysterious as the film itself. It will not help if you try to figure out in the beginning of the process that the structure is extremely complex. It takes a very long time to find out which parts should be "real" and in some parts have complex setbacks, only contextual hints that they are setbacks. <br /> <br /> But is it worth watching or trying out a movie? It probably depends on your taste. At the surface level, the film is probably attractive when you are a fan of surrealism, although it tends to feel a bit slow and too loose for some viewers. But these features and many other surreal aspects of the film are typical of Lynch. The main Lynchian moment is the old couple at the beginning of the odd who smiles almost like alien pod people who are trying to put on the front. If you are familiar with this style and like it, you will find a lot of love here, although Mulholland Drive is quite a little appreciated by Lynch. It is also noteworthy that viewers, who are mostly interested in it or who enjoy it as much as other aspects, have a rather steamy lesbian scene on Mulholland Drive. It is not free, although I have no problems free, but it is rather an important film soul. <br /> <br /> Like all Lynch movies, it's simple when it comes to a unique approach to every aspect of film art. art and his attention to detail. Any serious film student (including "armchair students" / "cinephiles") should study at Mulholland Drive; many love it. Lynch won't let anything move. It contains great color schemes (such as the abundance of reds and pinks) that have important insignia. He uses an unusually sound, such as a ringtone that moves to the next score (when Betty first arrives at the airport). He directs his actors to give their lines in a number of strange ways, such as his characteristic odd pause. He gives his strange and surprising sense of humor, such as the name "Winkie's", and the "Hot Dogs - made for Pinks" sign, which indicates some color symbolism. <br /> <br /> Lynch's attention to detail in product development offers important and sophisticated tips for the entire film to help unlock its meaning. It is interesting to note that Lynch even requires that DVD programming be unusual - the disc has no chapters; You must watch the movie in real time or forward or rewind to return to certain points. <br /> <br /> If the film's surrealism and hidden meaning are attractive to you, or if you just love "puzzles", then Mulholland Drive is worthy of this aspect. The interpretation of the film is quite accepted, at least on a broad and general level. I don't describe the usual interpretation here - it's worth exploring, but only after you've seen the film a couple of times and come to your conclusions. Many articles and monographs on film and interpretations have been written; for me there are even dedicated websites. <br /> <br /> For my money, although I generally love Lynch and find a lot of different things about Mulholland Drive, it's not exactly 10 for me, at least not yet. I have the feeling that my result may still rise in subsequent views. But the part of the movie "twist" makes me much better in other works like The I Inside and The Butterfly Effect. Mulholland Drive is more appealing to the surface for surreal touches, but the plot doesn't wear them, as well as some other Lynch films. <br /> <br /> Mulholland Drive is definitely recommended for the right crowd. If you are serious about a movie and do not have to think about what you are looking at (as if the two might not match), it should not be left out.
