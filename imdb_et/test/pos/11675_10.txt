First I watched through this documentary because I was interested in the subject he was depicting, LA-mites. <br /> <br /> I listened to this music and I loved this music and I read many small references made in the early 80's and easily achievable in Finland. <br /> <br /> So if you don't like that music, why are you writing about it? I like this kind of music, it speaks of my soul, so I know that bombs are all over Europe and America, so why do you who find this music "reluctantly" comment on it at all? <br /> <br />
