I saw this movie when I was a lot younger, but it hit me. I loved the relationship between Orry and George so much. I was the story of Orry's and Madenline's love so enraptured. I'm hopeless romantic, so it really came to me. I especially liked it when he first met. I just want him to have more time with him and their child. So you know that in Book 3 I was so painful that he died. I didn't really understand it because they had little time together. I just loved Patrick in this movie. I bought all three books and I can't stop them. My 12-year-old son is stuck with it. He likes fighting in war. I cry every time. I wish I could personally meet Patrick and Madeline! It was a great movie and cast!
