Violent men are a pretty good Western country that definitely offers its great pain. <br /> <br /> Edward G. Robinson is a great ranch who is trying to push down smaller shepherds, one of whom is Glenn Ford. Ford is ready to sell his groom (May Wynn) until Robinson's ambitious brother (Brian Keith) murders a Ford. Then you know what happens next. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is like Robinson's leading woman, what role she specializes in. Dianne Foster plays with her daughter, who has to admire Ford. <br /> <br /> Violent men are nothing more than an "A" movie with an "A" movie, but it's very well done.
