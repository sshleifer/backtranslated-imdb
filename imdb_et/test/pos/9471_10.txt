I have the opportunity to see this movie early on in Brea and I've been crazy ever since. The film is based on Shakespeare's twelfth evening, which I have read and loved a few times and seen on stage, so I certainly liked the references. But whether you like Shakespeare or not, it doesn't matter - the movie is on it. It is super funny, witty and charming. Amanda Bynes is fun and so was David Cross. In fact, the whole cast is big - I just happen to be a huge fan of David Crosse. The cast is hot and the soundtrack launches many cool bands and some that I never heard before, but I know they have a CD so I'll definitely buy it. Everyone from our audience laughed from beginning to end - all age groups. !!!!
