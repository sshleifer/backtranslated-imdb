I put this movie in the queue after a recent trip to NYC and I couldn't believe I would never have heard of it! It has all the cult classic, starting with the characters. These are the archetypal roles we know about every day life, but they are played both by the nuances and completely (the performances of Peter Stormare and Bai Ling were particularly strong). Their interactions are vivid and grounded, while they are subtle, peculiar humor that is too rare in the United States movies (nowadays). Writer / director Ramin Niami does a beautiful job of weaving these scenes with the funny and moving portrait of the past city. Highly recommended!
