If people were really stupid then I could be SRW - the supreme ruler of the world. In this, Knotts plays somewhat of a spider class for some small jerk cities, led by a group of curved simpletons, just a little brighter than it is. When things look a little trembling, they go patsy Figg. Lots of laughs when Knotts makes their usual worship, stumbling block. I especially appreciated the scene of the extension cord; high level.
