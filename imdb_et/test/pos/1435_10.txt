I saw this movie about 12 years ago and I still remember it, as I just saw it recently. This is how much this film influenced me. <br /> <br /> Given that it's a 50's movie, I think it was before its time. It surprised me that how he retained his honesty on this issue might have been some taboo at that time. Very realistic to show an angry and heartbeat trip that the addict decides to start. One can only imagine how the audience was influenced by the realism of this film these days. <br /> <br /> I personally think it was one of Frank Sinatra's five performances on the big screen. When others talk about movies about mental illness and / or addiction, I always recommend to Man a golden shoulder as one of the five best.
