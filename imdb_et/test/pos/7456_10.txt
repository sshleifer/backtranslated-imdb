Perhaps the deepest comic in the US, "Duckman" runs four seasons of 70 episodes in a short time. <br /> <br /> Unlike the often innocent criticism of "The Simpsons" (a very good show on their own) and the rude-bad-humor of South Park, every bit of this series follows the plan. The criticism of US society from his mercantilism to selfishness carries much more bites than any other animated series. <br /> <br /> Cultural references in "Duckman" sometimes tend to be hidden (everyone browses fan sites understand that most of them are not even caught). It is different from "The Simpsons", which usually uses pop culture "Duckman" instead of hidden high-level things. As other people write about it, the characters grow (Bernice, Duckman and Cornfed). Also making the main character not only an insulting neurotic, but actually a person who lives with a personal tragedy (as explained in episodes such as "One and the Future Duck" ("You Love Him till the End of Your Days") ... ") and" Bev takes a break "(if he has the opportunity to tell Beverly all the things he can't tell Beatrice), the series is anchored in deep reality. <br /> <br /> No matter how familiar he and his passionate madness is, he can't to understand at all. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think the best comic and one of the best series ever made in the US is ever on a DVD, but too many things Duck said are much more meaningful today.
