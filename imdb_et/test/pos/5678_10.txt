I went with my friends and saw this movie last weekend in London. We didn't know what to expect, the poster gave away some of it, and I wouldn't say anymore not to ruin the plot, but we found it to be a great movie with a big acting, convincing plot and scary as hell! Having done some research on making a movie, I have to give it to those men, filmmakers, actors, writers, etc. who have made such a film with so limited resources. Post-production production is also very well done. For all, I give them 10 out of 10 and hope they will continue their good work. Hold it, guys. You rock!
