I saw this movie when I was very young. This is my favorite of all time. I had not been able to get a copy recently and watching it brought back so many pleasant memories. I loved the image of Sidney Poiter Porgyi, his character with both strength and courage. Pearl Bailey's share, albeit small, was not unlike many of our own family members. My favorite songs were and are still "Bess You Is My Women", "Porgy, Don't Let Him Handle" and of course "Summertime". According to the instructions, if I interpret them correctly, I can't post where I got my copy, Sorry. That's why I signed up to share this information.
