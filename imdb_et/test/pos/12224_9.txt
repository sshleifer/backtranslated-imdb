I am constantly surprised at US networks. What is the question with them? Another very promising series that followed only 15 episodes and we don't know what the hell is all about. I really enjoyed this show thoroughly and I'm so annoyed that we never know what's happening with symbols and "monsters." This exhibition was everything. Humor, intercourse, action. The more you want. Why oh why was it pulled? It just doesn't make sense. Buffy continued with the 7-series as Charmed and enjoyable as they were, Surface, Invasion, and Dead Like Me were even better. Just because the show does not get terribly high ratings does not mean that it is garbage and if they give it a little longer, more people are likely to stick with it and get a big hit. One season does not allow enough time to catch and the nets are far from ready to pull out of the plug. They should learn that, like fine wines and cheeses, they have time to ripen. <br /> <br /> Get back to the surface and invasion - P L E A S E !!!!!!!
