I just saw it at the Toronto International Film Festival. Director Neal Slavin's impressive starring role is William Macy (seen last year's TIFF competition), meat oil (AKA meat fillet, AKA Michael Lee Aday), David Paymer and Laura Dern (also starring Novocaine, also this year). The festival, based on Arthur Miller's novel by the same name, follows Focus Christian, but "Jewish in appearance" by Lawrence Newman (Macy) when he fights against hatred and anti-Semitism in his neighborhood. Between the Jewish shop owner on the street (Paymer) and the neighbor's neighbor (Meat Loaf) card game, Newman has trouble dealing with his internal conflict and conflict. The guilt is the knowledge that is right, but it does not make any battle to keep peace and peace with its neighbors. Things become more complicated when they meet and marry Gertrude (Dern), who all think is a Jew. Gertrude teaches his wife in some cases about book reviews with covers. <br /> <br /> Will Newman end up staying for the Jews or escaping? See it to find out. <br /> <br /> Operation was amazing. Writing was incredible. The film was great. The sound was well done. Technically amazing, the movie was annoying. Cooling. Emotionally intense. I found myself kneeling a few times in the fetal position. I have a great admiration for everyone who worked on it. I haven't seen this movie for a long time. It touched me. <br /> <br /> Wow.
