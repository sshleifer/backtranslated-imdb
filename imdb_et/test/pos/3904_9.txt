I first saw the victim (also called Out of Contention) over 25 years ago when I was very young. Being a child of Bewitched's passionate childhood, I loved to watch everything that Elizabeth Montgomery celebrated. This movie was (and still is) a real affection - whether you are a Miss Montgomery work fan or not. Elizabeth always stands out in her roles, for example rape as a victim of rape and as a suspect in the Lizzie Borden legend. His performance on the victim, Kate, a terrified woman trapped in an isolated house during a storm, is great with her killer killer. If you like thrilling thrillers, this is one movie that keeps you close to the end. Another good result worth mentioning is Eileen Heckhart, who plays a terrible and suspicious household. Unfortunately, like most Miss Montgomery movies, the victim is not available on DVD and I believe that although it was released some years ago by VHS, it is a rarity these days. I was happy to send it when it was aired on television about ten years ago, and so I have a very good movie. Must See!
