Most critics have apparently left this film, like many other Charles Bronson vehicles, just like one of the pointless violence. And while there is a great deal of chaos, DEATH WISH 3 is not as daunting, especially for fans of the series and its star. <br /> <br /> After this time, Charlie Paul Kersey will be released. the police chief desperate to clean up the harsh part of New York. Launch-happy vigilante moves in the heart of the gang territory, where he returns to a one-man army in a good and evil war. Bronson, at least the "older" version is really his best. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying DEATH WISH 3 is classic. Indeed, the discriminating eye has many drawbacks. Characters are usually made of cardboard. Violence is up. The man goes well in his 60s and controls dozens of young people. However, the tradition of the original DEATH WISH and later films, such as Michael Douglas, has a strong crowd charm. Who doesn't want gangbangs to get their reward? The 1980s films also have very good moments and lump liners. For example, if a tenant in his apartment building sees the Kersey bumped up, he says that he is "thinning the flock". Only Bronson can really work. <br /> <br /> So you see that the key to enjoying DEATH WISH 3 is what it is. It's not Spielberg and it's not art. So throw a popcorn in the microwave and have fun with it.
