Finally, I got this movie on an excellent Sazuma DVD, loaded with interesting additions. I've read a lot about it and unfortunately I missed it at the Stockholm Film Festival. It's not quite successful if I thought it was, but it's still worth it if you like a strange and unique movie. I look at it rather than any recent so-called. Horror movies from Hollywood came out today. What reduces my experience is some music that sounds dated and relies too much on cheap syntheses. For me, all these tonal / harmonic elements of the score could have been pulled out and replaced by David Kristians with an excellent sound design. But that's just my opinion. Otherwise, it is a bold, angry picture with welcoming meditative and poetic parts, such as beautiful series of photos. I look forward to the resurrection, and I commend Mitch and Karim for their efforts in non-mainstream cinema production. They are a great inspiration when I immediately start making my short film.
