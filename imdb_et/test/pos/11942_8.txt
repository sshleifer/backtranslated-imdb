I gave it 8 stars out of 10. It was a great plot, Peter Coyote and Michele Lee, as well as the rest cast, did their parts well. <br /> <br /> Both Peter and Michele were too long in the teeth when their characters were supposed to be, and their children in the film would obviously have been more suitable for their grandchildren. <br /> <br /> I missed the first ten minutes of this movie, so I don't know how that body grew up after 25 years and got a mark on Denny Traynor (Peter Coyote's character), but I had no trouble with it about the event. <br /> <br /> Barbara Traynor (Michele Lee) is stunned when her long-term husband, Denny, was arrested about 25 years ago in Oregon for murder, Denny said she was never. <br /> <br /> Denny, her story is changing. Then his story will change again and again until Barbara knows what to believe. <br /> <br /> Barbara is still doing her way of thinking to get into a mysterious time that turns around a fateful time, Denny and a young girl named Sherry, received a stranger called Wayne Kennedy, which ended with a murder. <br /> <br /> I found the movie fun, well paced, and it had to make me realize what actually happened between three people. <br /> <br /> During the final credit, I saw it based on a real story.
