It was really an amazing adaptation. I missed the first episode, so I unfortunately missed the link between the characters and the smooth flow of the story. But as soon as I looked at the second and then the third installment I just blew out. I ordered a DVD less than a week later and couldn't wait until it came. I went straight out and brought the book. From the moment I opened it, I was hooked, I just couldn't put it down. I decided to finish the whole book before I dare watch the DVD at all. I preferred the book because it got inside the characters, you could fully understand where they came from and what was inside the story. They were a lot of adaptation, which was a disappointment because the book is a masterpiece and I think they could have done it perfectly if they had been able to stretch it for a long time. I think only installing a 3-hour slot is great in my opinion. It followed perfectly the twisted main lines. And the actors who were the main characters where amazing! The scene of love was pure beauty. It was so gentle and loving and just showed how natural homosexual love can be. I was completely blown up with both the book and the TV! I loved both Sarah Waters' earlier novels and found the customization of Tipping the Velvet quite enjoyable. But when I read and looked at Fingersmith, I did not know that none of his previous novels / adaptations were able to hit it. Sarah Waters has indeed surpassed her this time! I suggest you check this out! If Velvet Tipping wasn't your thing, don't let him put it. Fingersmith is a brand new ball game. It's a beautiful, but dark twisted story of love, greed, and betrayal ... <br /> <br /> May be!
