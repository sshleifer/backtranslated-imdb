I also remember this film as a youngster in a local small theater where foreign language films were filmed every week. It was an encouraging adventure of all that was left in my memory. <br /> <br /> It was especially impressive where Noel Purcell was an old sailor Paddy who drank too much, saw or heard manifestations and died in a cave of fear. I always watched Noel's career even decades later when I saw him. There's also the youthful Cyril Cusack as James, who is the design of the beautiful Jean Simmons, which is shown as Emmeline. <br /> <br /> I would like to have a video of this movie and update my memory. Where can I send my request?
