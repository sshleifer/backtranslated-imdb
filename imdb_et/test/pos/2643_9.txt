Straight, I love this movie. I love it all. It has a great soundtrack, has many recognizable faces, and it's funny as hell. There are so many parcels in this movie and each of them is funny in one way or another. <br /> <br /> When Spicolli illuminated the screen two years ago, Drake is almost as memorable. All he wants to do is fun. She moves out of the house without her parent's consent, she leaves work when she knows it, she is obsessed with sex, she loves her drugs and sweet and tries to be a good friend. His lackside attitude makes him such a joy. And she comes out with some great lines. And there are so many tiny observations that you don't see, but they make you ridiculous when it hits you. One particular moment is when Tommy and Bill talk about Bill's former girlfriend who gets to know someone else. At the end of the conversation, Tommy takes his big beer bottle and just throws it over his shoulder at random. Then he says good night and the scene ends. It's a perfect scene. The world of Tommy is yours. She really lives in the party and have fun. When the conversation is over, his time is over and he doesn't care about who he offends in this process. He has innocence. "It's accidental" is his favorite song. <br /> <br /> Another classic scene is Reggie, who gives Bill a donut. He tells her that I and my friends will never forget, because we are scrolling the film ten times and watching this part over and over again and hurting ourselves. It must be seen as appreciated. <br /> <br /> Natural life is thrown back when teen comedies were funny, dirty, good ears, entertainment, and just wanted us to lose our world for 90 minutes. Wild Life does all these things perfectly. If this is a movie you haven't seen, give it a chance. It's classic. <br /> <br /> See also the army shop, which Jim has trouble with. She is now a very familiar face and it is her first role on the big screen.
