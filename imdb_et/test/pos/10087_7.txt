Another Asian horror movie full of intense and horrible moments. Another Asian horror brand is the complexity of the plot, which is also here. MAIN SPOILER WARNING! <br /> <br /> The movie starts quite simple - two sisters go live with their father and stepmother after they have hung up on their mother. The sisters seem very hostile to their mother - especially the parent - and they seem to ignore their father. Everything goes smoothly until the mother locks the young sister in the wardrobe and the older sister tells her father. Then it hits you, "your sister has been dead for years" It turns out that the older sister has still not recovered from her mother's death and what we did not know was that her mother's wardrobe fell on her younger sister and also her kills. ego - it turned out that stepmom (actually sister alter ego) is sitting on the couch when the real stepmom walks! I hope this has become clear for the confused Asian horror. <br /> <br /> Finally - my favorite scene is a scene where my father invites friends to dinner and one of his friends starts to suffocate, which breaks the panic attack. Very horrible! 7 out of 10
