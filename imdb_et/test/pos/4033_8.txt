OK, so this movie hasn't been able to beat Oscare, but it's not a bad movie. Original "D.O.A." is definitely a better film, but that doesn't mean that this movie is bad. <br /> <br /> The stars in the movie are Dennis Quaid in his early role when he became really famous for the first time after "the right things", making him star and very beautiful Meg Ryan when he was still quite famous. <br /> <br /> This is a refreshing of the 1950s movie rather than a reprocessing. are different and the characters are different. The plot is quite the same. The man (this time the English professor at the University of Texas in Austin) is poisoned and only has 24 hours to find out who poisoned him and why. Meg Ryan plays a young college student who is trying to help him. Jane Kaczmarek plays Quaid's alienated woman who is low but intense; he steals every scene where he is. Daniel Stern (also in his early role before "Home Alone" made him famous) plays Quaid's colleague. Charlotte Rampling also has a supporting role. <br /> <br /> The whole upper limit is cast; The film is stylish, fast-paced, keeping you up to the end. I think this is a movie that is definitely worth the thriller and the modern version of the classic movie.
