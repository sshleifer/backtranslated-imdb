At first I didn't have much faith, but as a citizen of Costa Rica I can assure you that the film shows the reality we live every day and shows a lot of things in our culture, like our way to talk, our music, our way of our rights without fear, without arms . <br /> <br /> I'm really proud of what they did, and how they didn't forget this movie. they wanted us not to get the money, but to deal with a short budget, allowing us to evaluate beautiful scenarios and great photography. <br /> <br /> I strongly encourage you to see this movie, you will not regret it.
