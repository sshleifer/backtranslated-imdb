This is Australia's TV series. It's classic. Stories and actors are great. Who can forget about Picker and his gramophone or Chet? It's a cult TV. The Australian actors of the series were the best of their day and have the immortality in The Outsiders. What can I say about a timeless adventure. Music and song just awesome. The final credits that start with the wheel closing, Keir sleeps n shifting around and then can't long shoot just much better. All 13 episodes are equally strong in the Australian myth and I think it is the series. It does not matter that the two main characters were from abroad, I think it is the key of the series and why it is so good.
