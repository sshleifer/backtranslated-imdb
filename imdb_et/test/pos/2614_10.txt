It was so! I would never have expected the end if I didn't know behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> One of the things I hated was why Shannon started, not Alyssa. I hate him to die his character for Shannon. the funny thing is that in a scene where the piper died in the hospital bed and Prue wept by her, I started crying too lol. At a time when it was about 10yo and my favorite character was Piper from the beginning, so I told myself when he died, I can't see the show anymore! lol <br /> <br /> then all the time back was shocking and very good. I also blame Pheobet for Prue's death because, with her sisters, she had to be slutty bi *** and be with her a good demon son. and forever one of my favorites and classic CHRMED. <br /> <br /> ALL ASKED! Be blessed!
