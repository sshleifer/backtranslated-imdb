After you have tried the "North & South" in the mini-series, I couldn't wait to continue, "North & South II." Then years later, the third book, "HEAVEN & HELL - NORTH & SOUTH - BOOK III." Finally, the last installment came from the ongoing saga of the Maine and Hazard families. This series made me so enraptured that I recorded every part of the TV and then managed to catch hooks with family and friends, and I looked at it every time someone else wanted to see them. My tapes are old and I crave this trilogy on DVD. If you continued with Book III, you didn't get complete satisfaction and you don't know how it all turned out. Do it yourself and demand this device on DVD!
