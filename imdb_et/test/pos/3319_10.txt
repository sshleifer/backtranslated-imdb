If this is not my favorite movie all the time, it is definitely the first five. I love it. All this is perfect - clothes, outfit, lines - yes, they are not so normal people, but ... Right under small scenes, especially at the beginning of offices, changing their shoes, choosing a baby, dipping an office bony plant, lunch in the fridge ... Like what we are doing today, girls are doing in 2005. I think all the smaller characters are wonderful. If someone like Joan Crawford is up, it's all part of the package. If you choose a lot of things in the movie, it is very obvious that it was the beginning of the sixties, because women didn't start to "take it off", at least not when they didn't want to. As far as the characters are controversial, for example, if Suzy Parker's character acts like everything he plays, but then too exaggerated to Louis Jourdan's character, what many people are - are not contradictory? In real life, they interfere with scenes such as Diane Baker's character, who finds love for her life after her ill accidental baby - located in a hospital with a big old bandage around her head. It's also part of the package, it's a charm - shiny escapism. I like today's mix of real stories (a stereotypical career woman with only married men, so she doesn't have older families) who want, "ah, if I could get into the love with a doctor and she loves me even when she knows my variety past and saw me all after scandalous messing up !! "I just got a DVD, a widescreen, it's even more beautiful than full screen ... Yay!
