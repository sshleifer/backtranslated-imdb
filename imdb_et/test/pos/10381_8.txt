It's just stories; Locations and naked bodies are beautiful, but after the second story, I thought that creating a real movie takes more than just beauty. Then the film will naturally appear. Stories move, except Sophie Marceau does not give her story in this movie. Malkovich plays a story for both. The vote does not combine stories, but helps Malkovich to think a bit. <br /> <br /> I would say it's worth and the best Antonion. Given his age - remarkable!
