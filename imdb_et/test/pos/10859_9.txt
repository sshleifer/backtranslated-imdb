It is surprising that such production is being produced these days, especially on television. Considering the strong sexual opportunities and explicit love scenes, not to mention lesbianism, it has provided excellent treatment and direction. Sets and costumes are flawless, the style is stylish and the characters are nice. There is fair humor, but it has surprisingly dark differences. The real one is really a tragic figure, but not happy. It also avoids the flaw that most movies / exhibitions make in dealing with homosexuality / lesbianism. The characters are very human. It seems that by allowing people to be satisfied with watching television gays and lesbians and watching movies, most exhibitions fill clich√©s and make characters obsessed with being gay. Not so. When the velvet is tilted, the main character is hardly aware of what is lesbian! <br /> <br /> The BBC has made some great productions in the past, and this adventurous period only confirms their excellence on all fronts.
