I don't think the world would be ready for this movie. I know I wasn't. I was expecting a conventional small budget schlock to use a boiler. Instead, I got Shakespeare's most intelligent reprocessing from Peter Greenaway's Prospero books. It should become the final version of Romeo and Julia. This is not, of course. But this is the loss of the world.
