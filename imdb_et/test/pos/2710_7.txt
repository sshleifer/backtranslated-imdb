One of the best TV biopsy I just want her to have told us more. I have read many stories of life and seen other things about Carpenters, and this film did what he could do, based on family restrictions. Cynthis Gibb did a great job of trying to bring Karen to life. One of my disappointments is that there was no more information on Karen anorexia. In the list I have made of the disease (especially the wonderful book by Cherry Boone O'Neill, Hungry Attention), anorexia appears to be a control disease. Karen saw in his life that he could control. He felt that he was being controlled in all areas of his life. Don't get me wrong, I believed he really loved music, but he felt he had little control over his career. She really loved her family, but they didn't express it well, and she didn't know how to understand her family. The film may have touched much more on it. I respect the music of my carpenters and I wish she was still alive to contribute more to music today.
