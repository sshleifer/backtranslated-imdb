It was very good, except for the two things I mention at the end. Animation is great, highlighted by Nick Park and the company's exaggerated brand of teeth and characters, which makes you laugh almost every time someone sees you. The color was also great. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie is wise comedy everywhere. This is one of those animated films with so much to see and hear every frame that would require all the views to catch all the gags. It's just a funny exaggerated look at the "Wallace" oddball and his quiet and clever dog "Gromit". On the way, it's fun for people to get along with their vegetable gardens, similar to how the loving pictures of the obsessive dogs were "Best Show". <br /> <br /> My only complaints were two typical Today's movies, animated or not: 1 - We make a movie movie look like an idiot; 2 - We move the final action scene to the predicted result, but by overturning. These side-by-side movies are still a very fun movie that should make many people and film laugh several times.
