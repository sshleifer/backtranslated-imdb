Yes, non-Singapore citizens do not see what this film is great. Some references in this movie fly directly over the head of foreign viewers, and most of the Singaporeers are the ones who actually get it. But I ask you, foreigner, to look at another mess that has been cut off from Singapore and compare this movie. It's like comparing the pieces of the mule diarhea with a small diamond. This movie is the first one that really shows some of the poor sub-singapore in Singapore - something that is force to pretend not to exist. And there is a part of the movie where the gangster (ah-beng in our unique "ingris") speaks four languages, namely Tamil English Malay and Hokken. Well the truth is most of us can and do it all the time. The sad thing is that foreigners' viewers have an easier time in their country of origin to get fatty small claws with this pearl, it was initially banned from giving and R-rating and about 20 cuts on it. It is nice to know that one of the best, creative, nervous and original movies ever created would be easier to get uncensored, uncensored; halfway around the world as your nation.
