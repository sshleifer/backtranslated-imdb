Penelope Spheer ("The Wayne's World of Fame") noticed the documentary "The decline of Western civilization", about the late 70's and early 80's LA punk scene. Most documentaries contain interviews with concerts and concert materials (which often become violent). All in all, we can see how the punk movement was responding to the hippies: given that the hippies were natural, they tried to make them as possible as possible, which is to do with hair and everything. But we also see how they really do not suffer and sometimes they become skinheads. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's really a great time capsule. We are not quite sure if we want to feel for a long time or feel that it is against it. But this is certainly not a documentary that leaves you neutral. Really worth it.
