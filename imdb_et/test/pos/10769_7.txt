Strangely enough, the Independent Film Channel showed this movie a week after it showed KARATE BEAR FIGHTER - although the bear movie was another trilogy and this movie was the first !!! What did they mean? Although all three of these films are probably based on the life of this great Kyokushin Karate master, you can't help but think they have to be a bit of a decoration - especially in this first movie. Of course, the man probably fought and killed the bull and later the bear (in fact he fought and killed a lot of herds during his career), but in this film, which was placed in the early 50s, at the end of the movie, the hero actually fights about 60 boys and kills many of them brutally. I just can't imagine it really happened. So I did some checks and found that although many of the details are correct, some of this movie is pure punk! Yes, he killed a person with self-defense and YES he followed the widow and his son and spent the year for them - trying to forgive them. But at the end of the movie it is good to watch but hogwash. Seeing that one of his opponents would get his head and all the other details could not happen, or the Japanese government would have locked Oyama to protect society! The movie is fun and the fight is great. There are no complaints about an action or action. The only small complaint is the camera's work, which is sloppy during some fighting scenes. Despite this small complaint, this is the most enjoyable film. In many ways, the moving Karate masterpiece resembles pretty Zatoich movies - which is fun to watch, but many of them are really impossible. <br /> <br /> FYI This movie titled "The Death Master" and I saw it. This is not a bad duplication and it was written in a box (big plus), but still I prefer a subtitled version.
