No numbers lie, 109 people have voted for this movie. It says very much about the state of one comic book that is more intuitive to the end of the 20th century. And for you, who knows Bill Hicks' work, if he were alive today, imagine what he should say about his country's boyfriend president? The fact that his short career remains unknown is a sad situation and this film, or rather, the two films explain. First, you see how his talent was obvious from the beginning, over and over again, those who always knew Bill Hicks was not just funny, he was unique. The film also shows how the quality of its material was too complicated for the entertainment industry. His drinking also helped his career problems, but it is less visible in this film. And then the second film is a complete play. If you have never seen or heard Bill Hicks, this is a wonderful introduction to man and his dark but intelligent humor. Especially thanks to the fact that the subjects are now almost 14 years old but still ironically up to date, this is underlined by the fact that many events took place under the first President Bush. <br /> <br /> Looking at them together - first the biography and then the performance - makes you aware of how great this young man is, how fast his life has passed, and how the American media can sometimes act as a great homogenizer. Make sure nothing is too provocative, nothing too interesting and a result? Well, as the man himself said, go to sleep in America, your government is in control ........... During his lifetime, at least in Britain, this artist was recognized for his talent and was successful there. 11 years after his death, 109 people in IMDb can say something about the film. If you've seen both, I hope you understand why more people should listen to Bill Hicks.
