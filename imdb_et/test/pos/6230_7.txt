"Tourist Trap" is my favorite among the atrocities of the early 70s / 80s. A group of youngsters are moving somewhere, a couple in front of a car, and this car is flat, and our film opens with a young man, Woody, pushing the tire while looking for a service station. He finds a seemingly abandoned place and still hears the voices and examines and reaches his aspirations through his stomach. Together with the rest of the youngsters (VW Thingis), they pick up a Woody girlfriend and find the same place, Slausen's oasis or something like that. And then Mr Slausen happens together when the girls enjoy immersing the stream. Of course, VW Thing died at that moment mysteriously, so strange Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors) offers his help. Mr. Slausen has a museum with lots of waxes, and he lives in the museum, but behind him is a big house where he tells Davey's life. And who is Davey? Why, Davey Crockett, he says ... but if it were Davey Crockett, they would probably be safer. The girls are left alone when Slausen helps to fix the car, but of course the curiosity gets better and he's going to explore and find a house full of creepy dummies and one pretty animated name ... Davey. Next, there is a rather horrible nightmare one by one in Davey Prison, who says he is Slausen's brother. One girl (previously robbed) is treated with plaster, which causes her death when she covers her air supply. In any case, it and kind (but weird) are somewhat complicated. Mr. Slausen is not exactly what he seems to be. Good, horrible number of 70s horror and a lot of dummies create a very horrible atmosphere. 7 out of 10
