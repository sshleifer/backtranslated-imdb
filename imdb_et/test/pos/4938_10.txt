This is a great movie to watch with a good friend, boy / girl friend or family. Basically, one of those who know the good movies you want to share with your loved ones. This movie is light-hearted, but makes you think and makes you laugh. <br /> <br /> Just a simple but universal plot. You think most people can in some way associate it with the movie. The movie characters are amazing and the actors are doing a great job of sucking the film. And on the film, everything along the way is a fun life from Jewish humor. I watched the movie for the first time last night and now I want to have it. :)
