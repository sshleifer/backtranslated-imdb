Like Clive Barker's eager reader, I really waited for this movie before it was released ... I didn't miss it. "Nightbreed" is a horse of different colors. Rich in civilization's lower disintegration and drips with alternative existence in a way we have never seen before. Barker is his best when he allows us to saddle our world with an unprecedented horror, but at the same time shows the other side of the coin. Here, "monsters" are weakly beautiful beings, while people are deceptive ugly creatures of self-sensitivity. We will soon find out that we are all wrong. Most of all, the most often missed bonus for my "Decker" by Craig Sheffer and David Cronenberg is the best I can see. "Monsters" are flawless masters of English beings, many of whom were brought to life by "cobobites" in "Hellraiser", including "Pinhead" by Doug Bradley himself. "Nightbreed" is an absolute must see for every horror fan and everyone who just needs a bit (something) of their fear. It's Clive Barker at its best.
