A good film is proof that the film does not need a deep multilayer story and other complex elements. Even if this story could be extended in many directions, especially in a more sociological way (people love money), it seems to be perfect just as it is. Because of many sudden changes, the spectator leads without unnecessary complications and without the eye of the spectator. <br /> <br /> But acting for me is not so good. Except for Lindsey McKeon, others were medium or even worse. In some scenes, they just looked ahead. Except Lindsey, who was more convincing. It's a really simple movie that just lets you back and enjoy. <br /> <br /> 7/10
