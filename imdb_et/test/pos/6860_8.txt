I saw Anatomy when it came out and recently bought it and the sequel of 2003 and when I look at many different genres of foreign movies, you must definitely watch movies in your original language. Not only is it annoying to know that voices do not belong to the actors, but they always seem joyful as the whole movie is one big long-lasting toothpaste or something. It makes an otherwise fantastic movie that is terrible and I have had many friends who thought that foreign films are not as good as North American movies - that they are not "enough Hollywood". Also, these translations are never correct, it is too written and screws the film vibe, even if it is basically the same. I watched my week's anatomy for a second week in German and with my roommates subtitles because she was on her laptop and she didn't want to miss out on some of her subtitles because she had written. 30 minutes and he asked me to let him finish his work, then start the movie with subtitles. She loved it! Both movies are fantastic as intellectual horror movies! Kelly
