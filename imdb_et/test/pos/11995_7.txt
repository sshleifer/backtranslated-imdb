Seriously. Had it been the first Shack movie, it would have been satisfying like funny, silly and silly. A light satire comment on the class system would make it a pleasant late night. <br /> <br /> But everyone wants to compare it to the first movie and maybe it's not fair. The first film is a cult classic; what could continue? Something. So take this other movie independently and it is definitely your moments. <br /> <br /> Jackie Mason is fun and makes the best Rodney wannabe awakening. Is he as good as Rodney? No. Are his lines good? But he's funny. The rest of the majority is real, but not unfulfilled. You understand the faces in your face and don't know how they got where they are today. <br /> <br /> The film is predictable but no longer in this genre? Again, this is not the best comedy, but if you like Cannonball Run-type fun, you will enjoy it.
