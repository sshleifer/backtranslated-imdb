An unusual film about a man who communicates with his friends about his social blackmail. Peter Boyle makes this film with a nervous imagination in his working class, a rigid "Joe" who loves the future and is afraid of the future and worried about it. In the first semester of the exhibition, the young Susan Sarrandon's film debut as Melissa Compton, a weak-willed rich girl who slips her loser boy full of scene from the scene. His boy is a weak spot in the film, a poorly portrayed drug addict and a reseller who meets his death after overdose of Sarrandon. We meet Boyle Joe at the bar when he talks about outflow and minorities, crime, hippies and drugs, and it's easy to see that Archie Bunker's later Norman Lear television character is based on Joe's refined version. The comparison even leads to Joe's wife and personal life and pastimes. Joe puts himself in Melissa's father Bill Compton's life, and two make an unlikely couple when they search for Melissa, who has escaped drug treatment and women who call her friends. Their search leads them to the "oar-gee" as Joe calls it, the nudity of the free love festival fed by drugs, and surprisingly, so that Bill Compton and Ultra Conservative Joe join together. They rob and lead to a violent and murderous ending that predicts a taxi driver six years after a sudden and chilling end. Joe is a funny film that, at least on the surface, is anti-violent and racist. But the main character of the movie, Joe, becomes a very groundbreaking tool he fears when he enters and joins the illegal and unrestricted sexual surplus he receives. So the film is not a powerful message in this sense and leaves you with doubts about what the end result really was.
