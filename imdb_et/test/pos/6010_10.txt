This film is a great example of the high-quality dramas produced by Channel 4 and the BBC over the years. Ted Danson offers powerful memories that nobody remembers, and a society that believes he is crazy. This is a remarkable force that is best known for its role in Cheers, a TV comedy. Supporting cast is all very well chosen, especially Mary Steenbergen, Danson's wife, who acts as part of Gulliver's wife. But above all, it's a smooth and very gentle transition between our world and the Gulliver world that makes this movie. The difference between the perspective of giants and dwarfs, all the actual actors, has been captured nicely. Rare cinematography and direction.
