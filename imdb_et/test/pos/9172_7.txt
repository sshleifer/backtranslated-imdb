Though the concept of "Date Doctor" is one thing that records this movie from otherwise ordinary romantic comedy with a common plot of the genre, I found it to be quite enjoyable to raise my opinion so I created more of it than it would have been mediocre plot without many twists. Will Smith does a good job, as always, acting as Hitchin, a man who devotes his life to counseling men, how and how not to win women ... ever since his unsuccessful attempt to keep his college girl. There's a lot to laugh when he tries to help his last patient, overweight, asthmatic Albert Brennman (Kevin James) successfully meet a beautiful companion, Allegra Cole (Amber Valetta). Also, if she decides to release a woman she meets in a turkey who just doesn't seem to want her around, she finds herself in Sara (Eva Mendes) - it seems to be a big deal with her so I think from college he has never practiced his own rules. Unfortunately, Sara is a gossip columnist interested in a "date doctor" who received Allegra as a dorky man, not seen, especially after the player / jerk Vance Munson (Jeffrey Donovan) interrupts the heart of his best friend (Julie Ann Emery) and hints the date he showed to the doctor that he was disgusting when he didn't realize he refused to see him. However, the problems remain and Hitch is left, thinking about what to do with my relationship, but it is not a great help for Albert to find out what else to do. Action is good, there is a lot of humor and some other points that mean. Hitch's character is witty and wise, sometimes he succeeds at once. True, the misunderstanding where a woman is guilty of something that a man hasn't really done (why do they always show it?) How common and irritating - I think it wouldn't have been if it was the first, not the 5th time I've seen IT, but the rest were brand new. I only want this movie longer - I remember I was able to watch it 3/5 when he played the restaurant on TV once - but I still approve. It's definitely worth the money to pay for this shortness.
