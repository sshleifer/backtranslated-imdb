This mainly concerns love in World War II, but we must remember that it is also a biological example for Dylan Thomas and his surrounding people at this particular stage of life. <br /> <br /> Movie timing is just great. It really strikes what I think would be the spirit of those times; smiling and hoping you won't bombard. While this may be boring for some, the film has a particularly dangerous edge. <br /> <br /> At one point, my heart was over when the film hit its top. It really has some fun moments, which are dealt with the skills of the four main players. Cillian Murphy is fine here, like Matthew Rhys. Both are polar opposites and it makes an interesting watch. The relationship between the characters of Sienna Miller and Keira Knightley is wonderful and we have a way to thank (and be the Suggs "Madness fire"). <br /> <br /> Despite this, it's a rather slow movie. With just two hours, it's a slogan to come to a conclusion. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a fictional warfare that has many wonderfully designed moments that were undoubtedly helped behind the scenes by the excellent number of well known British names. But it really drives too much. However, worth a look. 7/10
