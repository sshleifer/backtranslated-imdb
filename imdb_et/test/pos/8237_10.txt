It is well known that Irene Dunne could sing some more. And I think his talent as a comedy can only be understood if one has tried Haydn's sonata or Debussy's song and made it successful. His instrument is his voice and his handling is pure music. He could deal with any part. The only thing he couldn't do was not its success. This movie is a great example. In this, he speaks to Ruth Gordon (because the game is a matter), feminine, charming, deliberate and self-improvement, generous, defensive and defensive, but never pretentious. He succeeds in being as credible as Alexander Knox is one more difficult role he has with pride. The viewer can believe what he sees and takes care of. It is refreshing to see a movie that is both entertaining and intellectually challenging, pushing all the right patriotic buttons. I sincerely hope that all of Dunne's work will make it a DVD for one day, because it's really hard to keep that secret for just a few initiatives.
