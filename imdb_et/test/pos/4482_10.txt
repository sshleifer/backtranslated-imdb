The passion in the wilderness illustrates the larger spatial. This is a visual narrative that is illuminated by great cinema. The passion was filmed in the deserts of Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Namibia and Tunisia. <br /> <br /> We are in Egypt, 1798. Augustin, a Napolean soldier, sends a writer and artist Jean-Michel Venture to De Paradis for his official mission to document, measure, draw and paint cultural heritage. Egypt: its dunes, amazing ruins and mysterious people. <br /> <br /> But can you really "document" the majestic sand houses, broken buildings and natural bedouins? Do you really collect Egyptian nature, nature, man and time? <br /> <br /> Jean and Augustin disappear in the amazing sparkling, golden desert, the size of which goes beyond their senses. <br /> <br /> "Egypt can't disappear! Here's Nile and there is the sea!", says Dehydrated Augustin, and soon he will discover an ancient, dwarfing cave that leads to the palace. <br /> <br /> Pleasant and almost fraudulent, he is trying to rest; the amazing sound rumbles her; his eyes, body and emotions become hypnotically locked over time as he stumbles upon a sensual, sensory experience. <br /> <br /> Wild, sleek female leopard looks back at her and their love relationship begins. ... <br /> <br /> A brave love affair, a daring movie.
