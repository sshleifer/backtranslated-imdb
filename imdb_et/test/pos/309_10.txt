Of all the Vietnamese war films, this is probably the most frightening and disturbing, and it is really a lot to say with so many outstanding ones. This has a senseless feeling. Everything is in the film that scares you, so chaotic. It doesn't like it when it shows many different things compared to other Vietnam war films. What drives such a high level is: <br /> <br /> Leadership was remarkable here. Francis Ford Coppola shows his talent in his latest epic films. Unlike other directors, he feels like a war. Most others show and show you the horror of war. But Coppola makes you feel confused, shocked and scared. These feelings of war are usually told about a movie or story. This is something I have experienced very little in watching the film. Writing was, of course, amazing. This brought you to the center of the movie. It never made me bored and this movie is three hours. Cinematography goes hand in hand with management, which has greatly added to the experience of watching this movie, showing all the chaos around you, even when everything seems calm. <br /> <br /> Operation was cooling the bone. Also look at Marlon Brando, who gave his last excellent performance a cheated columnist. If I ever think of a crazy soldier, I think Marlon Brando is in Apocalpyse Now. Brando n with this movie you don't want to look into your eyes. Like the movie, he was puzzled. For me, this performance is as memorable as what it gave to the godfather. Martin Sheen gave a very profound performance and probably his best career that saw everything he could see through his eyes, and yet he wanted him to achieve his goal. It is just a wonder why these two did not become Oscar candidates. Robert Duvall was able to show some of this madness with his ridiculous battle strategy among those who played music to tell the enemy he came to. The Duvall character who asked one soldier to surf in the middle of the battle was also shocking but plausible. Other great supportive performances were given by young Laurence Fishburne, Sam Bottoms, and Frederic Forest, who all met the attitudes of many soldiers at that time without clich√©s. They also used the office of Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford, whom I both love. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend people to watch this movie. It has a message and all those involved in doing this are their best. There is nothing I can ask about this film with its excellent action, leadership, writing, cinematography and great end. See and see why he lives with his title Apocalpyse Now.
