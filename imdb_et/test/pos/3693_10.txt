I found this movie very delightful. I'm biased, I think. I happen to adore Kathy Bates. I found he was singing an extra race. It has a very nice voice. <br /> <br /> Ms. Bates is playing Grace Beasley The movie takes you to her doledrums married in Chicago, England, home of her recently murdered singing idol Victor Fox. There he meets his three surviving uppity sisters. He also discovers that Victor is leaving a male lover, Dirk Simpson. Br /> <br /> The story brings you to surprisingly comical and heart-warming situations, as Grace and Dirk develop true love for each other after the initial rather rude rejection. Grace pint-big, fun daughter-in-law, Maudie to find a series killer who was murdered by Victoria. <br /> <br /> Everyone in the picture did a good job. Especially enjoyed by Julie Andrews, Lynn Redgrave and Barry Manilow. This movie was fun. It makes you cry. Music is completely charming. <br /> <br /> The other posters on this part of the movie that have encountered any part of this movie aren't just a clue. <br /> <br />
