I thought it was a big movie, Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie. Yasmine Bleeth's character plays with women who are in love with Richard Greico's character. They get married and everything seems to be perfect unless Yasmine Bleeth wants more than anything but has a hard time imagining. Richard Greico does everything to make him happy, and goes to extreme action to make him happy. I thought it was great in this movie, and it keeps you away. This shows how naive it can be when they are in love. Yasmine Bleeth is a good actor in this and I don't know why she never did her career. Richard Greico is very misleading as a deceptive husband and plays the evil part very well. I do not know why certain participants do this and some do not. Everything and all the great movie I would recommend.
