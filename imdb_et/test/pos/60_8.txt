Frankly speaking, it is self-evident when looking at the players' interaction. <br /> <br /> There is always music in the background. Whatever the difficult times these people go through, but Nanny's house is full of laughter and such famous music that brings us back to this era. <br /> <br /> Ms. In addition to Merkerson, other notable performances include Terrence Dashon Howard, one of the stars rising from the moment. Mos Def, Jeffrey Wright, Marcy Gray, Louis Gossett Jr., Delroy Lindo, Rosie Perez, Carmen Ejogo, Jimmy Smits and the rest. <br /> <br /> S. Ephata Merkerson deserves a wider audience. "Lackawanna blues" clearly shows that he can do something he wants because of his enormous talent and charisma.
