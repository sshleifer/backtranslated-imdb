John Parrish is a former Union officer who plans to sell his ranch and land to Wilkison in Anchor. The problem is that the price offered is low and when they start tempting Parrish and his staff, he has a change of heart, especially when things become worse brutal. <br /> <br /> Originally after looking at it, I had a feeling of frustration, mainly due to the casting involved. If you have Edward G. Robinson, Glenn Ford and Barbara Stanwyck in the same movie, you hope they will get a story and a script to bring out. Unfortunately, they are not able to produce Western classics, which deserves several repetitions, or is my survival waiting for it? Well I slept on it and decided to think about the picture. I think yes, it is fair to say that the actors involved deserved a better story to work on, that is, when everything is said and done, the plot that is milked for all that, and then some. But violent men are still a very rewarding film, no matter what the production potential is. <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford as Parrish is as cool as Eskimo's nose, and it's always nice to see Babs Stanwycki playing a bitch because he's good at it. If Eddie G, who is used to being in the West, is good if it is a written part. Robinson, who stepped into the last minute when he chose Lee Wilkison, Broderick Crawford, was injured, is the one who has changed most of the time in the shortest time, even by supporting such indicators as the devilish Wade Matlock (peaceful joy of reliable Richard Jaeckel) and Judith Wilkison {radiant Dianne Foster} leave the impression. But what it is, the Robinson crest, carrying a "bad" guy, is at least memorable for all the right reasons. Lone Pine Alabama has been used with many western images {see seven men from now on to another glorious use}, but here's Guffey's truly eye-catching and eye-catching eye. to give Donald Hamilton a pride in adapting to the {Big Country} novel, but every niggle and irk that my l personally, I found two more reasons that really liked it, so it would be definitely recommended. 7/10
