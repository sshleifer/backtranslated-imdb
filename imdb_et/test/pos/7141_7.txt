True, this is not John Sayles' best film (Brother From Another Planet), but it's also not completely forgotten if for no other reason than his message. Like Batman, the Wild Thing's parents were murdered before him, leaving him to fight for a "zone" that is a corrupt part of an unnamed city where greed and violence dominate. Instead of getting into Chopper's (Wild Ding) Wild Thing, he fights for justice by using his powers in Thai Chi and the terrible feline impressions, from time to time. He becomes something of a city legend, a modern Robin Hood and an old hero. 1987 YOUR BEST, WILD THING LIVES
