Two years after the plane! Started by Jim Abrahams, Jerry and David Zucker poured one of his stars - Leslie Nielsen - in this fun TV series that is surprising at the old US detective shows like Dragnet. Nielsen played Frank Drebin, America's response to Inspector Clouseau. It had the same style of humor as "Airplane!" clever visual gaggles in the background, unobtrusive absurdities and repetitive signs, such as Johnny's shoe shining boy who seems to know everything. Village Sites (including William Shatner!) Opened an Open Credit. The "police unit" was the first US sitcom because "Batman" could not laugh. Many have regretted that only six episodes have been made, but I think it was right. The concept would never have been a complete 24-episode launch. Five years later, "Police Squad" successfully made a big screen when the first "Naked Gun" trilogy appeared. The last laugh was Jim, Jerry, David and Leslie.
