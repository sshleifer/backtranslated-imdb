I was lucky enough to see the DVD version of this movie "Horror Classics" before it was mysteriously removed from four movies on DVD and replaced with something else. The film and picture quality of this publication were a nightmare in itself. But this version is STILL better than deluxe DVD. The reason was noted in the Brad Fiedel interview segments on Special Edition DVD. He had noticed what I first discovered prominently about this film. It is the use of music on the film at moments of inactivity, but leaving moments of activity silent, thus giving a stronger sense of horror scenes. The problem with this reissue is that it carries the extra movie score used to fill these deliberate gaps in the score. Fiedel complained about it and made it clear that her music was not her. The music sounded like Howard Shore's work for Videodrome. It seems to me sad that I am also a big fan of this movie and I have to associate them. <br /> <br /> The film itself was able to add realistic elements of interest to the genre horror film. A group of friends goes to the mountain, one of which comes from. In the mountains they face a family with a nightmare secret. The film is moving at a great pace. In fact, every time I saw it, I was still shocked that 45 minutes had passed before things really went wrong for campers. <br /> <br /> Although the Horror Classic version is full of loopholes, the fact that horror scenes are not included is what makes this movie intelligent and even better than most movies ever seen. Director Jeff Lieberman had made before this unique horror film, making it one of the mainstream and at the same time very different from the mainstream. This is a good fun movie with amazing action. The new spiffed up DVD version is worth the rent, now the collection item Horror Classics version, now OOP is worth the hunt.
