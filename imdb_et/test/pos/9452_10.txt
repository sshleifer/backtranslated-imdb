I just rented this movie last night from a video store. It was new and not long ago, the rent was just overnight. I, my little sister and my older brother, usually hate watching movies and watched. When the film started and after watching it for a while, we laughed historically. Even my brother. This movie is fun, I actually laughed. No matter how funny some movies are, even if I think it's funny, sometimes I don't laugh. But this movie ... I laughed. My brother thought it was the best "kind of movie" he saw. Finally, I watched the movie again about 2 or 3 hours later.
