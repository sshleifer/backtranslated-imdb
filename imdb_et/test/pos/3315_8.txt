A couple of years ago I looked at TCM's first moments, but I stopped after about 15 minutes. I saw it in the Palo Alto Stanford theater and I promised to do a 40-minute drive. Stanford is an old-fashioned movie house that starts closing every movie. Yes, they have curtains. They opened the Fox logo fanfare. When "The Best of Ever" appeared in big pink letters, they spread against the New York skyline, I knew I was right to wait. <br /> <br /> I slipped this movie up. There are so many moments in the look and feel of the film: When Hope Lange first walks to the publishing house, there are published magazine titles on The Teenager and Elegance; Joan Crawford's stubborn apron, which he wore to serve his guests with his party without dressing him up; the way the camera tilted to show how crazy Suzy Parker was changing (it was almost sideways at one point); how Hope Lange lived in the apartment he shared with others, although he probably made much more money than the beginning of the film (I think it was too scandal that one gal lives alone). <br /> Hope Lange was so beautiful; so was Suzy Parker. And how would Mark Goddard play a non-speaking role? I fell in love with her when I was a child looking into an empty space. <br /> <br /> When this gem saw on the big screen, it prompted me to plan another track for Stanford to see the old blind house. By the way, I bought a small soda and popcorn on the concession and I was surprised when the employee asked me two bucks.
