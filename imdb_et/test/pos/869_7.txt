A very interesting drawing of a film based on the novel "Waltz to Darkness" by the writer Cornell Woolrich. It is a drama rather than a film of a movie that tries to send a message that love changes your own life, that is, your love for every person and the love you received from him. The rich man made his life a love, while his partner finally realized that he was the only one who loved him. Belmondo played well as usual, while somewhat young Michel Bouquet played his eternal role as a detective or police officer. To be honest, Bouquet was not so impressive in this film, but less than Catherine Deneuve. He was not as convincing as his role as a prostitute, then a lover / wife of Louis Mah√© (Belmondo). For those wishing to visit the world, the film offers an opportunity to see some of Ascension Island and also the city of Lyon in France.
