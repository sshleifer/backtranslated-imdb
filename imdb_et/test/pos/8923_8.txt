This is a great movie full of complexity, themes and great dialogue. The characters are well drawn, Phil is the biggest loser ever. <br /> <br /> The character of Adam Haddrick is the weakest thing I have seen on the screen because Alec Guinness's image of Adolf Hitler in Hitler: The Last Ten days. "<br /> <br /> I just wish they all went away. But without giving too much, there are some situations that you just can't get to your exit.
