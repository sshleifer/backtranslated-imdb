Ahhh ... 80s. 1982 makes me think back to the really mad time we were facing in America. The 70's "Do What Feels Good", "The Last American Virgin," is a wolf in sheep's clothing, another of the days of teenage sex comedy glory. Oh, sure there is sex, but I can't think of another movie - OK, this and "Ridgemont High Fast Times" - which actually didn't kill the topless between teenage scenes - were pretty good things here between splitting. <br /> <br /> The film follows three hormonal friends. Gary (who wants to lose her innocence), Rick (without plaques) and David (overweight, but not inexperienced) because they are desperately trying to overcome the difficulties with Gary's men's world. But the funny thing happens on the road to Kegger - Gary falls to Karen (a beautiful brunette who loves bad guys), and it doesn't seem to follow the sexual conquest that David and Rick can facilitate. The only problem is that Rick and Karen get hot and heavy and skip Karen. This is Gary, who is next to him when he goes to get an abortion, and that's Gary who really cares. But who Karen dances at the end of the movie ... Rick. Disconnect "R" and add "D" if necessary. <br /> <br /> What separates this movie from other 80's is that God is trying to make a real drama here and not, "my parents just pulled the driveway." And you know what? I bought it. <br /> <br /> It was not sloppy. It wasn't far drawn. And when Gary saw Karen at the end of the movie, Rick dancing at the end of the film, I felt very sorry for this boy. Our teenager, Romeo, actually believed in a failed love - and when her heart was broken at the end, it touched me. <br /> <br /> So, aside from R&D, there is actually a very credible and interesting story here. Oskar deserves? Not a mile away, but I don't know it would be a "category." Like the "Fast Times Ridgemont High," they actually tried to make a real movie here, letting hi-jinx fall where it can.
