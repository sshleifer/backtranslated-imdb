I saw this movie since 1918 in our local Helsinki Film Archives. The Danish Film Institute seems to have reconstructed it in 2006 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Nordiski film company, one of the largest in the early 20th century. I believe that there are currently several copies in circulation in Europe with translations in English. <br /> <br /> I found the movie exciting and a trip to Mars. The plot line is definitely original, but I really don't want to know more about it, because now there is a risk that things will actually ruin you ;-). <br /> <br /> The movie is also on DVD, ask the Danish Film Institute (Det Danske Filminstitut) for a website at dfi.dk with 'Himmelskibet' for more information.
