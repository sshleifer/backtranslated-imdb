It was such a beautiful film. Such amazing power from Joseph and Brad. Very innocently written and done. Must See !! I cried my eyes almost through the film. It is a film that every family should look at with their children, it teaches us all the very important lessons in life and how we should approach the harsh topic of AIDS, how we should teach our children to cope with it and the people around them. Not only with AIDS, but with any terminal disease. I hadn't even heard of this movie until I did. one day and it happens over. I recommend everyone to look at it, just don't forget your box box. More movies should be done as such. Extremely heart warming.
