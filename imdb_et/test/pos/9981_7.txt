This is not a movie I would normally watch at 2:30 in the morning, but I got into it and couldn't stop before it was finished. <br /> <br /> Shia LaBeouf has shown that she is not just a young actor but can handle more demanding roles. The fact that these roles have been delivered in the last two years shows his ability. <br /> <br /> It was really his movie. Of course there were others involved, but they were pale compared to his role. <br /> <br /> It was a time when gold was privileged.

Go for a fee.
