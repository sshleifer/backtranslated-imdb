I gave 9 points to 10 points. I was sitting in tears almost all the movie because I have to laugh! <br /> <br /> Of course, it wasn't great, but it wasn't boring. Erkan & Stefan is appointed as a beautiful Nina bodyguard. In doing so, they come between the "front lines" of BND and CIA. Of course, these two are not bodyguards or gentlemen, so they run from one disaster to another; and they make it so funny that if you look at some scenes, you can't stop tears! Like the actors, these two "buggy exhilarating" characters are pretty good, better than some so-called professional. <br /> <br /> Do you think the speech of two heroes is curios or "pseudo-strangers"? Well, if you hear quite a lot of Turkish-German people in Munich, just like them, you will remember Erkan & Stefan. And maybe, in ten years' time, it has become a common voice for young people. So if you want to laugh, watch this movie!
