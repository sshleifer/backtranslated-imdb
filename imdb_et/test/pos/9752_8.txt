I found this film to be educational, fun and very mobile. I was impressed when I learned how much Justice Arbor had contributed in Kosovo. <br /> <br /> Wendy Crewson is very little appreciated and is good at seeing her again in Canadian production. Other easily recognizable letters are Leslie Hope (24) and John Corbett (Sex in the City.) Although the story of this film may not be entirely factual, I wanted to learn more about the Arbor word. A great movie that inspires young women. <br /> <br /> I say the movie is "must see".
