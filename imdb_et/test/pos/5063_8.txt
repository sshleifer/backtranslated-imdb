A national, topical political thriller aimed at a controversial US policy area, another amazing Orwell phrase (loss of collateral, anyone?) For torture of terror suspects during timely trial. The inhumane questioning is monitored by the Egyptian police commander, the target of his own fundamentalist suicide bomb, thereby connecting the two main lines of the film. Both work very well, chilling the graphics of the bombs and the reality of their reality, the void of which appears in the stylish Tarantino-type rebound and the scenes of torture of innocent people, depicted insecurely in all their details. The film appreciates the use of torture as a reliable intelligence tool - in fighting terrorists and against unpolished faceless bureaucracy (here is a personal, cold-loaded Meryl Streep, like the CIA leader who randomly orders the transfer), which can destroy innocent lives. Do not forget that Kafka's fiction is thinking more about the innocent killing of Brazil in 2005 in London, where the head of the metropolitan police was still in work and no one tried the murder of a poor person. Actors are great everywhere - two main roles of innocent people and terrorist bombers are real and consciously unknown players Omar Metwally and Moa Khou. Like Yigal Naor as a threatening police commander and Zineb Ouhach as his idealistic beloved daughter, these performances are true, their little knowledge (at least for me), which adds to the credibility of their characters. From the larger local Hollywood names, Gyllenha's reputation is growing with the following films, playing here a man who was originally segregated, but later with conscience and suffering, who is finally doing the right thing. Witherspoon plays a part of his disappointed woman mainly in one key, but it is unbelievable, while David Fabrizio and Alan Arkin show convincingly the self-care senators and their shortcomings who go so far as to help their career prospects be at risk. There are some weaknesses per plot; There is little dramatic need to create an "interim check" around El-Ibrahim's escape, and the character of Streep is obviously a bogey-man / woman. Worst of all, Gyllenhal's on-site girlfriend's meaningless engagement is just about the interior design and a short free love scene. All in all, however, there is an amazing thought-provoking cinema experience.
