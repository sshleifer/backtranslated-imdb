I have a problem with a movie snobber who thinks Americans are insecure half-writers who can't understand the jokes of more sophisticated Europeans, les Francais, les Italiens ... who are almost anyone of whom English is a foreign language. If humor "My Father's Hero" is different from "Mon Pere ce heros", the French sense of humor is different from that of America. Not better, not "wiser", just different. If you think Hollywood's "cinema" is for French cinema, just think about how much French cinema has borrowed from Hollywood in the first place. Where would Belmondo and Delon be without Bogart? Truffaut without Hitchcock? Jerry Lewis - not known for his fine and brain style - has been idolized in France. Schedule ........ Monsieur Depardieu is exceptionally good as an unhappy divorced father who is a 14-year-old daughter on vacation in the Bahamas. She did not know that she introduced her to other hotel people who love her to make a more interesting boy with an eye on her. It is not surprising that complications arise. "Green Card" and "Cyrano de Bergerac" have been entertained with fun and M.Depardieu is all very well with it. He makes a good impression of Maurice Chevaler's "Thank you for the little girls from the sky", which is actually funny and quite awful as his audience, all of whom believe him as a 14-year-old girl lover, rise up and leave twice. - Two when he goes away, happily knowing what's going on. When he turns at the end of a song to admit the applause that is awaited, it is an unmistakable price. Without him, the movie would indeed be very average. It is a lot of fun with the huge twilight indicator on the screen. Not pecs, the sixth package - just the right kind of human. Powerful!
