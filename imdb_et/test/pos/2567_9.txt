I have to admit that I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. I didn't expect Samuel L. Jackson to play the slide and also sing blue. <br /> <br /> The Beaver County Cinematography PA often does. They advertise the movies in the lobby, all of you are happy to see it, and then the disappointment when it is not shown ... <br /> <br /> that this movie would have seen at least a week. But while I remember correctly, MI3 appeared on three screens (this or some other suspected blocking). <br /> <br /> Like the Blues Brothers and Crossroads, this movie contains mystical and legendary music. Passion and hard times. Religion and Sex. Hell Claims from the Past. Redemption. I mean so many elements that the blues would work. <br /> <br /> It was just a good story for the whole story. Of course, many people do not see that it has no pirates or crawling spiders. But he has Samuel L. Jackson ... Think about what happens to Jackson's Pulp Fiction after he walks on the earth and lives, and it essentially describes him as "T". /> <br /> Excellent and underestimated, but aren't they all good?
