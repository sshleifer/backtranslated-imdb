What a great movie, even more so because my wife and I got into it so tenderly, surfing the channels on a nice frozen day in North Texas. Kathy Bates is his usual best leader between very normal and human spending characters, one of the most amazing films. Why this film didn't get the attention it deserves when it was released in 2002, it's hard to understand. Why was it on the head and shoulders on so many larger fanfare and distracting trash cans that are obvious during the viewing. It is obvious that as a public, we are forced to feed what powerful and influential has been considered "great and wonderful", while true gems such as "Unconditional Love" can shine all those contenders into a truly enjoyable cinema. Rent or buy this movie ..... you won't regret it!
