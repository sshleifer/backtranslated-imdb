Andreas arrives in a strange city. She doesn't remember where she came from and how she got there. She is bound to get to work and gets to the city of her apartment. All his associates are pleasant and polite to him, they say they are passing by. But later, Andreas discovers that the city is not as pleasant as it seems. When she leaves home, she sees some people wearing a gray costume, purifying the dead body of a bloody mess, probably a suicide victim who had thrown out of the window. The procedure is done with a calm mind as if they were emptying the trash. The next day, Andreas will meet with a suicide victim completely alive. More and more Andreas is discovering the unknown atmosphere of the city. <br /> <br /> Den brysomme mannen can be the best Norwegian film I've seen. The original, artistic management is usually absent in Norwegian films with only a few exceptions. The plot is also very original and can even be called a postmodern horror, because the film gives us a frightening idea that we should deal with a completely unknown world. and the more you try to understand in your life in this city, the more pointless it becomes. I'm interested in how the director manages to create a feeling that the universe is destroyed, a nightmare that you simply cannot escape, not even with death. <br /> <br /> Go see it, it's really worth it! I gave him 10 out of 10.
