I'm an independent movie fan. Dialogue led, character research pieces are for me. Some other posts are right: "Wannabes" does not rival "The Godfather" for the best mobile film. On the other hand, "Wannabes" is a well-written and well-managed picture with surprisingly good results from all actors / actors. My problem with another review: <br /> <br /> - Conor Dubin looks like Italy is the only one in Ireland. he has a dark complexion, not a traditional ruddy of Irish. He does not look out, rather gives excellent performance. I found this at 7 bucks in Blockbuster and was pleasantly surprised to say at least! Highly recommended.
