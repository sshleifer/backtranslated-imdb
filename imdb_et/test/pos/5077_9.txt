"I'm afraid you are talking about a racket where men force you to talk." This Shakespeare line from the Venetian Merchant repeats in a new film, "Presentation", which introduces the viewer with "enhanced interrogation methods", a transfer that began in the Clinton administration and has become more common since the September 11 terrorist attacks. The film has all the stars, Oscar winners Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin and Reese Witherspoon, as well as Peter Sarsgaard, Jake Gyllenhaal and Omar Metwally. Supporting the roles of the unknown participants will also lead to the feeding of the audience to the plot, and will show how many people may be affected by the attacks and our means of overseas terrorism. <br /> <br /> The task is followed by the birth of Egypt. suspected (metwally) taken by US officials after a flight from South Africa to Washington DC for an open prison abroad. His pregnant wife (Witherspoon) is doing Washington to find out about her disappearance through a family friend and senator worker (Sarsgaard). Gyllenhaal plays a young CIA analyst at the Overseas Detention Center, who monitors the violent interrogation. <br /> <br /> This movie follows the emotional disturbances of the victim of torture (Metwally) and those who are involved in receiving the expected information. Some, like the CIA analyst (Gyllenhaal), have visibly shaken and intimidated the methods used, while others, the Streep and the foreign interrogator (Yigal Naor) see it as necessary and effective. <br /> <br Some may describe the film as a political work, but ultimately it is emotional. Metwally as a tortured prisoner is an Oscar-worthy. The film does not intend to preach, but rather to interview and inform the public about a subject that often does not have a human face. The release has been known to have worked, but it is known that they give false information to innocent prisoners. The film simply depicts the emotional struggle of such grave companies and does so in a way that affects each viewer differently. The film keeps your interest and whether you are dealing with every character.
