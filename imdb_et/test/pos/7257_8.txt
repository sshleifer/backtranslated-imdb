I like like historical (periodic) movies and get new ideas for my historical group costumes and a friend suggested it to me. I like Johnny Lee Miller as an actor, so I thought it was worth it, and I was definitely rewarded! His portrayal in English was much more accurate than in the past. The aspect of this comedy left my sides hurt, the costumes were not terrible and historically I didn't come too much. I also noticed that England did not have the proper sewer much later, but anyone who does not go deep into England's past does not mean or care. Definitely worth it. I highly recommend this movie.
