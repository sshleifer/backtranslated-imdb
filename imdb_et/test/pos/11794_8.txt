People watch movies for different reasons. There was no big budget for this film, no special effects, no cars and no explosions. Actually, there are not many of them. At least not in my life. <br /> <br /> This is a very real movie about very real people, none of them fulfilling in any way, but they put together a situation where they learn to study and accept what is different and which in turn changes the order from chaos. I am not prepared to limit the possibility of parapsychology because I am not an expert and do not use the full extent of my brain. <br /> <br /> So watch this movie about characters. It is extremely full of a wonderful, peculiar crowd. During the first three minutes, Kiefer Sutherland sets the life of Detective Michael Hayden perfectly and he develops this film throughout the film. Excellent action, very plausible. <br /> <br /> Henry Czerny couldn't be better, and his "Harvey" and Kiefer "Mickey" communication increases the contradiction between these characters. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the harsh homeowner, Mrs. Ramsay, I'm sure she and my mother are good friends !!! <br /> <br /> There are a lot of these great characters, but here's the space limited to watch and enjoy the movie.
