As a commentary on this film, I quote below the words of the writer Paulo Coelho. <br /> <br /> "If you really want something, all the universes will decide to help you achieve it." It's too easy to forget who we really are and what we want to do in life. Because we always have too many comments and tips for safety. I had almost forgotten what passion feels. Despite the adventure, I get out of the danger zone, I really believe that fear is the price I have to pay for a new trip in life. <br /> <br /> Thank you for inspiring me with this lovely story. My blessing is to understand unconditional love. It is the most valuable love of the soul's light.
