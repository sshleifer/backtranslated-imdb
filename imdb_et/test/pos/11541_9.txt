I will put it as clearly as possible for those who are not aware of Bill Hicks' legacy. He was just the biggest stand-up comedian in the world, almost certainly in my opinion the biggest one he ever lived with (his stand-up idol has a great Richard Pryor, whose battles are parallel with addiction). His death in 1994 was hardly noticed in popular media, coming only a few weeks after Kurt Cobain had committed suicide. His tragic death in such a youth conceals any sense of injustice he naturally ignored during his life. But the harsh truth is clear as the day: no one has demanded their coat. Almost skillful and inventive is not a living comedian. <br /> <br /> Attention is paid to gracious respect for "It's just a ride" that stand-up comedians often look at work as stepping stones for richer use - flat films and morally guided sitcoms made to capture - but not enrich - unimaginable audience life. That's all Bill Hicks accepted. His sermon was always a rallying cry for people to think for themselves, to control the institution, to meet as a single contest. <br /> <br /> His complaint continues to grow every year after his death. His star shines long after so much less light is blown out. If you have been a bright, intelligent but ultimately compassionate output, then you will be enriched and rewarded. <br /> <br /> The man himself wanted to quote Dylan: "To live outside the law, you must be honest," he said. Bill Hicks was honest, besides, he was the most fun.
