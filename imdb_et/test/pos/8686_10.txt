I watched the Nile princess for the first time when I was about 10 years old. I'm 63 years old and have never forgotten a movie. Nor have I received Egypt. I've been looking for the internet trying to buy a movie but haven't found it. It makes me wonder if this is one of Hollywood's lost movies. I loved Debra Padget and Jeffrey Hunter together. They have such charisma together. If you asked me something about the movie, I couldn't tell you anything except who was in it. I remember with uncertainty about the Nile scene with Debra Padget, where there are many other women. I've always wanted to see it again. I never thought of it as an escape movie, but I see where it probably was. I hope they put it on a DVD and I see it again before I die. It was a great movie.
