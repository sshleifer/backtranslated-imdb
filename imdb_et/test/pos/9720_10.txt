Every story is a lesson for young and old. But what else I have to say can ruin the future story. But I believe that what I have to say is for everyone; for only one specific episode: soldier and death. <br /> <br /> Okay ... all the stories that are sticking to me are "soldier and death" because it's my life point realized that life was a terminal. I'm not kidding. Ventilation was on my 8 1/2 birthday ... and I always remember it. I didn't remember the title until today, but I got a new summary. (May 15, 1988) <br /> <br /> It is always difficult to explain that death is a natural part of life. It is also difficult for adults to accept that children can accept this fact. I am a living proof (now 28 years old) that children can accept this and occasionally remind adults ... <br /> <br /> I write it with a tear in my eyes. Heath Ledger - a wonderful actress of my own age - died today. It reminded me of the many lessons I have learned in my life. So I write this as a reminder to the young and old ... no one is immune to the stock in our store. <br /> <br /> I don't want to say that death happens, but this story was the first time I saw death not bad; but some of the life in this story was quite literal. I can't help it. It was a changing moment for me and it is always. <br /> <br /> And for that ... <br /> <br /> I love you with Jim Henson (and I still remember a lot of your life to death and your commemorative coin exhibition) and thank you to Brian Henson for keeping the working group alive! Honest, I thank you, all your co-workers, editors and practitioners. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> The world knows. <br /> <br /> Thank you !!! <br /> <br /> (And everyone who doubts me ...
