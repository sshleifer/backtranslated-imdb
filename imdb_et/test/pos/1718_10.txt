As a fan of the old doctorate and after the mediocre Fox movie, I was suspicious of this new doctoral thesis. I gave her a chance, and I'm so glad I did. <br /> <br /> Yes, some episodes are not as brilliant as others, but all are enjoyable and yes, Eccleston's doctor has been far from us, but ... Eccleston's doctor is almost the best. His performance is sometimes comical, among others dramatic, sometimes totally crazy, but always fantastic. <br /> <br /> This and Bille Piper as Rose make the rest of the series (Camille Coduri is also fantastic when Rose's mother is) and the depth of this series does not exist before. This series is incredibly powerful, especially considering its Sci-Fi. I mean, who would have thought you would have been sorry before, or even shouted how many times in the history of this series have been such moments as Rose's father, emergency doctor and "You were awesome ... so I was the last call? I recommend to anyone, whether a PhD or even a TV show to buy this set on DVD, it's really "fantastic!". <br /> <br /> Now there are only 4 episodes through the last series (and I look forward to the new Cybermen) I have to say that David Tennant's doctor is not so good, of course you can't agree, but I don't think his doctor can see these emotional moments in the previous series. I also have to say that I think this series has not been as good as the last, but the return of Sarah Jane & K9 was a fantastic episode, a real pearl. Not to say that this series is not good, just not quite good. <br /> <br /> So whether you like it or not, and whether you prefer Tennant or Eccleston, the doctor is back and he'll stay here. "Fantastic!" - Almost as much "Fantastic!" -
