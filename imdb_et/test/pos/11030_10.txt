I managed to get the original BBC video of this movie and loved it so much that I have to try and find the original video in my original box; thanks for eBay. <br /> <br /> Deleted in any format since 1990, this extraordinary wildlife film is fine and well-functioning. Stewart Raffil's (MAC & Me)-run productions, passing through the wilderness of Alaska, have nothing to do with stunning and the timeless story of a trap that tries to survive in frozen waste with two young tigers, moving forward every time you watch. <br /> <br /> Why no big business has this movie on DVD, it's a big miracle; but it is especially special to know that it is also difficult to find. <br /> <br /> If you find this movie randomly or end up watching it, add it to your collection, make sure you don't let it go. Films with this caliber, as shown, do not come often. <br /> <br /> A true masterpiece in every sense and very valuable in your commendable comments: "When NORTH WIND BLOWS deepens deep into your heart as soon as you see it."
