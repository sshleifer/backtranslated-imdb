After "Muppet Babies" success, Warner Brothers "Tiny Toons" speaks. But instead of making Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and all the rest of the Looney Toon gang, they created new animal characters who were children in their personality, but personalities who still reflected their predecessors. Includes Buster & Babs Bunny (No Link to Their Running Dick or Grips), Plucky Duck, Hampton Pig, Dizzy Devil, Shirley 'Loon, Elmira, Montana Max, Furball, Sweety, Rats and Assorted Animals Perfecto Prep and Original Looney Toons cast himself. "Tiny Toons" lived in Acme Acres and attended Acme Looniversity, where Looney Toon's gang worked as teachers who served the younger generation of mentors in comedy. <br /> <br /> Bush SR took different pots. administration, pop culture and various other gags and spoofs. <br /> <br /> Buster & Babs, actors of the show, as mentioned above, were in some ways similar to Bugs Bunny, but they also had different tics and comics of personality, namely, the tendency of Babs to embody anyone and everyone, while Buster, who is capable of playing for himself, usually played directly on the man (or straight rabbit) on Babs's antics. Plucky Duck was a virtual copy of Daffy Duck (not a screwdriver from Daffy, but an egomaniac Daffy), almost as big as an ego like Daffy and as much obsession with Buster & Babs as Daffy was with Bugs . trying his face, but he strangely passed through. Hampton was still a shy version of Porky Pig and had an ungrateful job of playing Porky Plucky's Daffy. Shirley, a blonde duck gal, was a girl of a new age valley, which Plucky went in and came out of his mockery of contempt or competition. Dizzy was a damn purple version of Tasmania. Furball was quiet Sylvester and Sweety was a pink Tweetie bird. There was also a purple lady skunk who wanted a pint-sized version of a boyfriend and Wile Coyote and Road Runner. The evil was defined by Montana Max, a rich boy who had always put out or made people's lives unhappy. There was also Elmira, who was the keeper that everyone was afraid of. And then Godo Dodo, a strange thing, was an a-ma-gig creature who had no clearly defined species except that he was "Wacky Landist" or something like that. <br /> <br /> Pop culture references Batman (quite often), Michael Jackson, Vanilla Ice, Dances with Wolves, Indiana Jones, Star Trek, Supergirl, Fast Food Joints, Ten Commandments, Twilight Zones, Saturday Night Live, and even the Simpsons , <br /> <br /> Not only funny, but also managed to be warm and touching, something that the successor "Animaniacs" has never really achieved. Also followed by "Taz-Mania".
