This is a movie that leaves you wondering if it is? Although many people have complained of ambiguous ending, it gives the audience the opportunity to think and interpret these signs. This is my interpretation and theory, and I believe it is very good. First, here's the plot. One day Prot (Kevin Spacey) suddenly appears in the center of a busy train station. After trying to help the wife, she is arrested and sent to Bellevue and later handed over to Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) hospital. He is free to talk about how he came from K-Pax and is here to report on Earth. Of course he is classified as a looney and locked in a low security ward. He interacts with other patients and quickly persuades them with his story. In fact, he says he can take one person with him. Soon Dr. Powell doubts Proti's insanity and when the plot progresses, it is harder and harder to prove Prot. Finally, Dr. Powell learns that Prot is Robert Porter, a smart man who worked in a slaughterhouse in New Mexico when his wife and daughter were murdered. The prot claims he plans to leave for K-Pax at exactly the fifth anniversary of the murders. Time is coming and going, and Powell finds Prot or Robert in a catatonic state. One of the patients is missing and never found. <br /> <br /> My theory: Prot is not crazy. Prot is from the planet K-Pax. Robert Porter is a friend of Pro. On one of Proti's last visits to Earth, Robert was a child, learning from his father's constellation. Prot and Robert were the best friends. After his family's death and Robert kills the murderer, Robert decides to commit suicide. Prot is in K-Pax at this time, but he rushes back (as a speed of light) to stop Robert. So the Prot takes over Robert's mind by taking over his body so that he speaks. Later Prot (who still lives in Robertis) comes to New York and is locked. When he leaves K-Pax on July 27, he will take him with Bess, but he must leave Robert. So now we have catatonic Robert. Only a few people were flammable in the Earth system and Prot added their knowledge. Robert Porter, though clever and knows his constellation, was not an astro-physicist. <br /> <br /> FOLLOWING AREAS: This is true. The prot could have left the institute at any time but did not choose. The last words to Dr. Powell are: "Now that you've found Robert. Take care of him." The prot was probably left there to ensure that Robert left his place. <br /> <br /> SUPER HUMAN RIGHTS: It has been proven that Prot was significantly higher than sunlight and could even see UV radiation. Prot offers its usual K-Pax reason, but there was no ground cause. It was also mentioned that Protile was given extremely high doses of the drug that had no effect. <br /> <br /> Helping Patients: Throughout the film, you will see that Prot helps other patients (or patients who discuss the Prophet's recommendations) a better sensible world. While the psychologist stops with Proti, Dr. Powell talks at the end of the film about new lives that patients have led. <br /> <br /> SPRINKLER SCENE: Sprinkler is linked to Porter's home in New Mexico (which is ironically when Roswell is). Does Porter bind the sprinkler to the death of his family? Is he trying to protect Powell's daughter from this terrible fate? I have a different position. It is assumed that Porter had committed suicide in the river. Indeed, Prot (under hypnosis) is very concerned with Robert. I believe Prot binds the water, not the sprinkler. He's trying to protect the girl from watery death, as he was Robert. <br /> <br /> Hypnosis: Dr. Powell feels that he may discover the true identity of Prot in hypnosis, but Prot gives a lot of information, but never gives up his Prot persona and demanded the homeland of K-Pax. <br /> <br /> SECURITY CAMERA: Why should the camera release for obvious reasons? <br /> <br /> MYSTERY DISAPPEARANCES: First, the Prot disappeared for a few days north of his trip. Funny, patients are not at all disturbed. Indeed, they try to convince the doctor. Sometimes I think they understand better than employees. Of course, the most important loss is Bess, the winner of the essay contest. Not only does he disappear at the same time, but his only surviving essay remains. <br /> <br /> This is just my humble theory. You can deduce what you want. You can take Dr. Powell's theory that Prot was just a man Robert Porter took to protect himself from reality, but it would give up too much of the plot holes.
