Honestly, when I went to watch this movie at the Plainfield Indiana Rave Theater, I didn't expect much. I just went to this movie because I thought hey, this is a WWE movie that is a good laugh. Then I sat down and watched it and saw why they chose Glen Jacobs (Kane) to play Jacob Goodnight. He is probably one of the biggest men on the screen (much worse in my opinion than Freddy or Jason) and he has one big advantage over other films that attract me to the horror movie. This shows that Jacob Goodnight is a human being. He has a heart, no matter how complicated and horrible. He feels the pain, something Jason doesn't see or see. He feels sadness and joy, though again both are crazy about what you see when you see the movie. All in all, in my opinion, there is a different experience than many of the Sliders, and it surprised me in some way, like the one who lived at the end.
