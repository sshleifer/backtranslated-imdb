Monkey Island Curse. Released 6 years after the success of Monkey Island 2. You think Monkey Island 2 has finished it to put an end to Monkey Iceland. But it all turned out to be a trick to attract Guybrush to jail. But it is enough that all of this is that Monkey Island has come back and the votes are just phenomenal. If LucasArts should make a Monkey Island movie / comic, it would probably be the one that looks and sounds. The plot is really good and it's just awesome. If you haven't heard of the Monkey Island series, buy Monkey Island Archive or Monkey Island Booty Pack and play all the games that start from Monkey Island, then Monkey Island 2 and Monkey Island Curse. Monkey Island 4 was a real good, but one of them is the best.
