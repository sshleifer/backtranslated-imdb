I agree with Aussie's comments mostly. However, it seems that the idial is identical. Christina (Kelli McCarty) inhibits the rural property she plans to open up in mountainous areas. He knows the Chip (Bobby Johnston) he knew when he grew up there. The plot thickens when James (Paul Logan) arrives with his new stripper friend Shene (Devinn Lane), because Christina was a friend of James's millennium and this has resulted in James doing something wrong. For the interest of Sophia Linn (Monique Parent), a romantic writer such as Eric (Sebastien Guy) and Linda (flower), a couple of city lawyers, appears as a guest house. James kills one of his dirty tricks in the business of a local building inspector Christina to shut him down. So the question is, "How far will James go to sabotage and will he succeed?" <br /> <br /> See Devinn Lane here and "Beauty Betrayed". He seems to be making a transition from a harsh core business to the R-world. Another remarkable is Samantha McConnell, who plays the role of "Bait", which is clearly the most outrageous character of films!
