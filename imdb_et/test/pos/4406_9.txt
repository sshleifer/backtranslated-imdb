As a person who spent hours driving in the back of North London trying to avoid a terrible congestion, this film immediately filed a complaint. Throw my interest in what London was back in the late 1970s and you have the prerequisite for my TV Sky version! In the paper, the film marked all the right boxes and, having just looked at "Knowledge", the actual film itself lived, if not exceeded, my great expectations. <br /> <br /> Visually, I was surprised how different London then looked back (I lived in Islington in the 90s, long after changing gentrification). Indeed, it is sometimes dirty, messy and clever. However, there may be a bad residential area in London, but today's general feeling is much cleaner, brighter and more pleasant (based on what this movie shows, not your memories). <br /> <br /> The story and story of the actors, well-marked characters will probably go to Nigel Hawthorne as a Vampire. Absolutely brilliant! He deliberately acts unexpectedly, alternating between the entire linear gravity and the surreal moods, to frustrate the knowledge boys when he tries the experiment after the experiment. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a great, thoroughly enjoyable journey back to a very specific time and place that I find to be endlessly exciting. But even if you are not particularly interested in London in 1979, you still have a joyful dialogue and knowledge of "Knowledge".
