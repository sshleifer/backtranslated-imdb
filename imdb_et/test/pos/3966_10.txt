Received ... let's see. The only reason I had chosen to see that this movie was an ad that was shown in ads when Shrader (sp?) Said, "ASK MY MY WEINER". After that I had to watch this movie and I watched it with a couple of friends ... and WOW amazingly. One year's best movies. The whole movie I laughed like crazy! The plot of this story is that Bartleby (Justin Long) doesn't accept any of the schools she wore, so she makes another fake college for her and her friends so she can fool her parents to make her college. So he finishes and fools his parents ... until more students look at the site and see the click (ACCEPTANCE ON CLICK AWAY) and all these rejects come to that school. They face many problems and they just don't look right. 10/10 LOVED IT NOW WATCH IT
