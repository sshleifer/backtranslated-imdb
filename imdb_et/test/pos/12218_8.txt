*** SPOILERS *** Whatever else (or can't) say, SURFACE is great. Cinematic art is just stunning (at least) and fx is nothing, if not modern. Conceptually, the exhibition offers a little bit of everything - and almost everyone (parents, kids, fantasy and / or fx fans). TERMINATION OF THIRD CLIENT WITH BLACK LAGON READING, WHERE IS A JAWS AND GODZILLA WHICH WAS FOUNDED FOR GOOD MEASUREMENTS. There was also no sour sign that would have hit the action; here is a surprisingly solid casting. This series of SURFACE seemed to be far away, and because of its simple conversations, the viewer wore the better part of the season. All things are very well done. I hope it will recover next season ...
