The three main characters are all hopeless, but still only one of them regrets: Ernesto, a hopelessly dedicated Mercedes. It was part of a frustration: screaming at Mercedes to get a clue and scrape off non-head Harry without being effective. Harvey Keitel's moving story of his outrage that plays gorillas on a cheap TV movie is incredible. When you expect the least, Quentin Tarintino makes half a monologue and Anthony Quinn makes Ernesto a wealthy man. <br /> <br /> From time to time, great moments of the story appear, but finally it is hard to know what to know about this movie. It does not have a happy ending or even a complete one, but it is somehow right. <br /> <br /> This movie is strange, but then I am; No wonder I liked it.
