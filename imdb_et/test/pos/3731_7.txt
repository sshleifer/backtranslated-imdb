I saw it with little background today on what to expect. I'm going to the movies next to the escape to leave everything behind and enjoy the "story". I found it to be a good movie, not big, but good. It was worth my money and tears :) <br /> <br /> Diane Lane was wonderful as always, Richard Gere is not over the actor. He kept his own and has a certain presence, which we always expect. She brings her style to the movie. <br /> <br /> I think it was such a love story that is not always spoken of. It was dirty and had other priorities, but they wanted to be together and wanted each other to wait. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend it!
