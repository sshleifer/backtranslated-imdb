Okay ... so I'm looking at my mother and father's extensive DVD collection (mainly because they don't take late charges ;-)) and I'm coming from "A thousand acres". I was stunned that there was a movie with Jessica Lange AND Michelle Pfeiffer (Jennifer Jason Leigh, a little look) that I didn't see. I don't think I'd ever heard of it. Well, that's exactly what I dream about because I have to admit that my parents raised my brother and my movie friends. With some exceptions (neither of us can even consider looking at the Lord of the Rings, but my father loves the Matrix trilogy - GO FIGURE), we have very similar flavors in the movies. <br /> <br /> Today it was especially evident with the weather. It poured rain all day, so I jumped to this movie and soon after I was mesmerized. <br /> <br /> It must be one of the best "dreams" I've seen. Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer are especially good in their role, especially as they play very different types. The character of Jessica Lange is a pleasing follower for the people who rarely take the lead despite the older child of the family. Rather, he worships his father (Jason Robards) and his sister Rose (Pfeiffer) and, for the sake of the devil, to teach his little sister Caroline (Leigh) how to follow suit. Michelle Pfeiffer plays very STRONG inadvertently with cancer who is barely able to keep her anger in her unhappy life. This movie is five years before the White Oleander, remembering that it was certainly inspiring to see that he was playing such a strong and angry character. <br /> <br /> I should say that this movie may seem more like women. But true movie lovers who enjoy the movie about what it is, regardless of genre or target audience, find it difficult to deny the secrets of the family of drama about it and what they do with the people involved and those who love them. I don't know how I saw this movie right now, but it was definitely a pleasant mess in the rainy afternoon. ENJOY !!
