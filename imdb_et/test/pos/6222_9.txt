An excellent Scandinavian eldritz ore tradition, a very far-reaching analysis of the large number of major problems we are just about to see. <br /> <br /> It should be compulsory to see all politicians. <br /> <br /> Take your privacy, the sustainability of nuclear power, global climate change, quality of life. <br /> <br /> Reminiscent of Thoreau's Walden, but with modern twists and remarkable humor. <br /> <br /> I am not Finnish, although I have traveled there with good friends to Finland, but I found it completely accessible and also culturally informative.
