Centers in Czech WW2 pilots? Elder Frantisek, the boy's impulsive Karel and the quiet piano game Honza in the background. As the film opens, it is the 1950s, the war has ended and Frantisek and Honza have been imprisoned in the former monastery. In their now Soviet-controlled homeland, they are the "enemy of the people". Honzat has been seriously treated and died by his Communist nations. In 1939, many pilots managed to get from Germany to occupied Europe and go to England to join RAF. Despite their great motivation and experience, they face the reluctance of RAF and the British overhead. Finally, they fight in the British battle. However, Frantisek and Karel find their friendship seriously tested if they both fall under the same woman. <br /> <br /> For a romantic sub-region, it's very similar to Hollywood's Pearl Harbor production. However, given the context of the film and the possible fate of Frantisek, it is possible to read the treatment of an English woman for two men who symbolize British treatment with Czech and Polish RAF pilots: this is possible when the war is over. br /> <br /> In addition, the film is much less clich√© than Pearl Harbor and the characters are better realized. Dark Blue World also appreciates its stunning air strokes that were seamlessly created with a mix of models, real-action aerial filming and extracts from the 1969 epic British battle. <br /> <br /> In short, Dark Blue World is a well-made, moving, thought-provoking and fascinating drama that puts shame on Pearl Harbor. Highly recommended.
