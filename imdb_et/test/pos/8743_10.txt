Traffi is an excellent ministry dealing with drug trafficking in Europe. It's a European-produced PBS series based on an Oscar-nominated film. If you love traffic, the Traffi must be unseen. <br /> <br /> In general, I would recommend recommending this minimization to anyone interested in looking at drugs from a social perspective. The scenario is exciting and unexpected, as it spans the lives of drug dealers, traffickers, farmers, policemen and policemen. Unlike other films that sensitize the drug issue, Traffik introduces it as an IS.
