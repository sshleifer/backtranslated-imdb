And what is this genre? Backstage reveals the story; which theatrical life is really behind such Broadway (and other) curtains. It's definitely a lot of competitions: Singin's Rain in both I and II (1929 and 1952), 42nd Street, Golddiggers of (You name years). Dames, 1934; Noise (1992) from far away and the star was born I and II since the 1930s and the tragic 1950s: not to mention the summer of 1950. The list goes on. What makes this movie so special? And why are there so few comments about this stunning movie? Have so few people seen it? How amazing to see the younger Frank Langella pre-Draculat and pre-Frost-Nixon for 30 years! How amazing to see fresh and talented Tom Hulce before Amadeus! And another great Stiller! What a great composition of talented people so long ago! And such a script! Who was David Shaber? So full of realistic frustrations and sins as ordinary sentimentality and sensitive comedy! As a particularly striking example, the Star-Is-Born-like episode, where the heroine reaches Broadway, while Langella's character has to explore another province. <br /> <br /> Langel's subsequent hysterical and sadistic blow stared at a Latin teacher and his grandson, where his rage and disappointment are just one of many fantastic and psychologically real moments in the film. (Latin language teacher and his love life backstage life surely reflect Marlene Dietrich and her seduced by Professor Blue Angel in 1929.) Another order of mercenaries and cold-hearted agents like Kevin McCarthy, preceded by Burt Lancaster The Sweet Edu odor (1957) and followed by Alan Alda in Clubland ( 2001) in film history. The sexual release of Hulce's character resembles similar incidents to O'Neill's great comedy Ah, Wilderness. <br /> <br /> And what respect for the long lost operetta: Victor Herbert's Red Mill; Rose Marie and King Rudolf Frimli Vagabond; Sigmund Romberg's desert song, etc. Which bitts satirically add to big games like Romeo and Julia. A tribute to the theater itself, marked by the letter of Langella. The richness and depth of this film is just endless. And that title would be mixed! Who could be what this great movie is about this ridiculous and unpleasant title? But, on the other hand, what title could be applied to such a great drama that could have lived up to its confusion, emotionally? <br /> <br /> PS: I saw (2009) Frank Langella in his last showcase: Richard Nixon Frost-Nixonis. How this magnificent actor will be triumphant in just 30 years!
