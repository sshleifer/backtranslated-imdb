Roy Scheider is not Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood, but who is it? Seven Ups is one of the best policemen, even today, and is the only one for the McQueen Bullit and Dirty Harry series, which is not a bad company. There seem to be three things that make a good policeman's movie: an incredible script that has great potential for action, great chase, and some tough things to do. This movie has all three and car chasing is better than Dirty Harry. Scheider plays the head of a police group to get the bad guys of NY for 7 years or longer; consequently, the name is Seven-Ups. Generally not quite up to Dirty Harry or Bullitt, but much better than all the Dirty Harry series made by filmmakers. 9/10
