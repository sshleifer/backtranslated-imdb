I saw it at an independent film festival in San Francisco and liked it a lot. It was a bit strange for me because I don't like horror, but I only had a few minutes to close my eyes. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was good, costumes and settings were not far from BBC quality, which is amazing for the indie movie. I liked the way the twist of the plot and even the figs change, it surprised me in good ways. I even warmed Willy Grimes's character, which I didn't like at first. It would have been better if the woman had a motive to be so interested in going to the islands: it seemed very similar to the plot device. <br /> <br /> Dominic Monaghan likes and does a good job in training, horror and more meaningful moments. Nice voice in the story. <br /> <br /> This would be a fun and unusual date movie.
