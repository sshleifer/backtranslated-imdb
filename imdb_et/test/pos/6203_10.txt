Whether drama, intercourse and traits you would enjoy if you want the drama that attracts you and your entertainment, and educate you. <br /> <br /> Writers know their material and show. The direction is always tempting and not splitting, and the acting is terrible. Why this exhibition did not win any prizes tells me that the "powers" in Hollyweird do not know about drama or much more on this issue. <br /> <br /> At the end of this episode, the plot had a twist that was a complete surprise and very well played. I am glad that it was not used as a shock for this series of climate change that would have been more typical and boring. Rent this series at once! We hope that it rose back from celluloid extinction.
