This telling, simple film makes a very clear statement about the teenager and his father. Although it is a theatrical release, it has quality on "television". We can attribute it to Director Frank Frankheim, who studied his craft in the first days of live television in New York. Indeed, he led the CPL's "Climax" film-based "Deal a Blow". "Young Stranger" represents his Hollywood debut. After four years of interruption during which he made more television, he returned to The Young Savages with Burt Lancaster and a year later, "All Fall Down" with Warren Beatty and Angela Lansbury. <br /> <br /> Casting is competent with James Daly and Kim Hunter (especially good) who play James MacArthur (his first theatrical film) title character who played the same role in the television version as his first appearance on the small screen. Look for the supporting roles of James Gregory and Whit Bissell.
