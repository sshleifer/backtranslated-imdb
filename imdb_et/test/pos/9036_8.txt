I described this film as surprising ... it is true in many aspects. Educational material (wrongly accused black man), characters (people you expect as stereotypes, often show atypical attitudes during the film), production ... <br /> <br /> All these factors make a refreshingly unusual film, especially during that time (1949) . The only possible spoiler is sometimes a chewing dialogue and from time to time a high moral attitude. <br /> <br /> But if you do, if you are not going to watch the movie, you can find yourself like me - stay up in the middle of the night to see what happens. <br /> <br />
