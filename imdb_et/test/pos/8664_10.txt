Den Brysomme Mannen is one of the best films of all time and is related to a person who is trapped in a world without senses, feelings, love, truth and freedom. A world where people are afraid when someone speaks their mind, expresses themselves or shows affection, a world where no one is free and no one has a clue what its thought is. Just like the world we live in, the Den Brysomme Mannen World is a world of lost souls who are trying to fill, but focuses on the complete opposite of what they do, materialism, social acceptance, and mediocre satisfaction. <br /> <br /> Den Brysomme Mannen deserves the full attention of every human being because we could all use the fresh awakening.
