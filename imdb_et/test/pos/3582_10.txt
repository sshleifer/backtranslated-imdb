The whole series, not just the blue planet, is nothing amazing. The best nature series we've ever seen. The episode in autumn is like driving into space! We've watched it with our 10- and 7-year-old boys and all four of us haven't been able to pull. We read a negative comment about it and couldn't believe it. There's so much new information we never learned at school. It is also the best view we have seen on television or in the film on the delicate balance of our country's ecosystem. The time and effort involved in capturing these frames is very visible when you sit and watch this series.
