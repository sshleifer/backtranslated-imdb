This movie is really worth it - Robin Tunney stands out and Henry Thomas proves that he is one of those rarities, the child is an 'actor' who grows into a real actor. The characters are perfectly drawn and in the wrong hands because of their depth they could have been convincing - but all the actors are just amazing. The cast spot for this movie must be "Girl, Interrupted" (both films with a bright Clea Duvall). Score and music options are perfect and there are many steps to avoid making a movie just for character research. If you want this story, you won't find it in this review, but I say the climax haunts you for a long time.
