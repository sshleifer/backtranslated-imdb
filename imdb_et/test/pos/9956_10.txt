never seen this vision of a loved one, not to mention the Venetian merchant's production, I can't comment on how honest the previous adjustments of the game are, so I treat it as just another movie that is trying to be more than a Novocaine eye MoV is an instantly captivating film of a young lover bassanio (fiennes) and his merchant-antonio (iron) and Jewish money lender from shylock (pacino) <br /> <br /> bassiano has broken and needs money to admire the lovely portia ( colleges), he goes to his friend antonio, who blames his friends so that he borrows money from shylock. <br /> <br /> now there is no antonio like jews in general and shylock in particular and shylock bitter and twisted abuse he has suffered antonio in particular and Christians generally agree to borrow antonio money provided that if antonio doesn't return the loan within the agreed deadline, shylock will cut antonioso kilo meat body <br /> <br /> comment <br /> <br /> film is breathtakingly beautiful and has worked and spoken to force you to think about what each line means, which in turn causes the viewer to gain knowledge of characters and characters of their motivations <br /> <br /> it seems to me that this is a film about the choices that shylock makes, and how making the wrong choices leads to the destruction of knights <br /> <br /> the moment Shylock demands that he would have died, the rest of the world was against him and his companions to reach his fall. It annoyed me very much, usually in the movie, when the victim gets the chance of revenge against those who have harmed him, the victim succeeds, or makes the wrongdoer a mistake that leads to great hugging. Happiness and Faith <br /> <br /> This movie is a powerful and exquisite imagination of random antisemitism that shows how the whole society can turn on a minority and make it seem like a victim of a really criminal <br /> <br /> movie 10 / 10 out of breath
