In addition to being a lesbian love story, FIRE is also a comic satire of Indian classical (?) Indian culture. I think this is the quality that is little appreciated about the film. These two genres (i.e. a deep meaningful alternative-love story and a comic satire) usually interfere with both oil and water, but Mehta (somehow) can achieve balance almost perfectly. Servant Jatin's behavior, family treatment with her, constant inevitable presence of bedding grandmother, Ashok's obsession with swami teachings: this is a culture similar to India, these are things I feel typical right now. They have been crying out to find out and ridicule. In developing his priority topics, Mehta manages to achieve his secondary theme skillfully. In fact, the great humor of the film, which provides a significant relief from the difficult topics of taboo lesbian love and gender equality, appears to be the usual satire. The movie flows from the comic to a serious subtitle. <br /> <br /> All in all, the wonderful use of symbolic devices (Radha compared to the legend of Sita and the advent of fire, and therefore pure; the lifelong desire of young Radha to see freedom eventually reaches the ocean. Kudos Shabana Azm (Radha), the lighting team and Deepa Mehta; Hollywood-like (and un-Bollywood-like!) Made this movie special. One criticism: the first scenes seemed to me to be rather inseparable because they didn't flow well together. <br /> <br /> Decision: 9 out of 10. Nothing little for a movie that's so burnt in my mind.
