It's a clever and fun movie that speaks behind where Johnny Carson's successor, Tonight Show, was chosen. But the ultimate dissertation that David Letterman's superior comedy talents were ignored because of his controversial nature, and the show that was diminished by lower Jay Leno's abduction on television in the leading comedy program, is just as wrong as anyone who has watched both Leno and Letterman present themselves. The difficult and simple truth is just like in the movie "Jay Leno is the most fun man in America". And David Letterman is not. Once you understand this, a large part of the movie will become irrelevant. Ultimately, the whole film is a little more than the sour grapes by the Letterman fans, who simply cannot agree that the better comics were chosen by people whose business is known to do such things. The final proof is that, despite Letterman's early leadership, perhaps due to the hypothesis of the sequel to the Tonight Show, Leno's show has consistently proved to be more popular, so at least I think Letterman's claims are unfair robbed of his legitimate legacy.
