I saw this movie for the first time just over a year ago. I've seen it 4 more times. I had never heard of it before and I feel familiar with classical cinema. A real, polished, rough diamond. <br /> <br /> The pearl of this film revolves around Jon Voight (the sign of "Conrack") as a young teacher who has been appointed to teach the children of the islands of Yamacraw. in one school. First of all, students show that they know very little about the world outside their home. The heart of the film is Conrack, who has inspired his youth to awaken the world around him. Pupils recognize their teacher quickly by learning and the remarkable ability to understand the concepts that were only strangers to them in a short time. Conrack uses unusual and smart teaching methods that happen and a little fun! God forbid. Learning and having fun? Together? Cannot be or say responsible persons. To avoid spoiler, I just say that Conrack finds resistance with a boss man .... and the end is really bittersweet. <br /> <br /> I am a 35-year-old white man with some learning experience, so I should identify with leadership, Pat Conroy (aka Conrack, Mr. Petroy). But I don't know if I know black children. As a child, I was in school on the other side of the city, since 1979, 4th - 6th grade. These films remind me of my classmates. Fortunately, in the fourth grade, there is no understanding of racism at the age of 8 or 9. I just remember we're all kids, playing 4-square, kickball, hidden and rolling relays. <br /> <br /> This movie is very moving. There are amazing moments from start to finish, non-stop. I found myself in many tears in my eyes, then suddenly laughing loudly. It's a funny movie. <br /> <br /> "Git away from the wind!" .... "Sir, if you are ready to accept the mess, then I should tell you that the rabbit did it only on the lap" ..... "So you are a white teacher, Mr Conrack. My sons love Mr Conrack, you you are a good looking teacher, you are a good looking guy. "....." wind 12 mph Small boats warn, big boats OK, don't worry "something out." .... "not steak, but Eleanor Roosevelt, not stockbroker, but (something latin) ... it's latin ... they're waiting! "...." Conrack sings like a frog .... I sing good, who speaks "!". <br /> <br /> It still mystifies me that I still don't listen to this movie or have very little or no reputation. I'm going to look for more comments, comments, backgrounds, and "fits" when they're there. What amazes me is the action of untrained children. One child, Mary, I understand, was an actor, and you can say that. However, other children have many lines and real reactions. I don't know how they did it! I think Conrack and Mary had a precise dialogue to work while some scenes naturally open or ad-libbed. <br /> <br /> Conrack is a special movie. In my opinion, this is one of the very few films that are so good AND so unknown. Others in this category include King Rat ('65), Dark Passage ('47 with Bogie and Bacall), Gods Black Crazy ('80) and Bad Day in Black Rock ('55). I recommend them all. But first take Mr. Conrack's class.
