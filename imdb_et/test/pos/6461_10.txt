This is a powerful film that seems to have reappeared after Joe McCarthy's censorship period. It affected me as a Jewish teenager who had different color friends and whose father's family had suffered in Europe during the second quarter of the twentieth century under fascist regimes. Unlike the later rip-off, "On the Waterfront", which seemed to have taken some of the same topics and turned them into Hollywood political correctness at the right time, he spoke of his story in direct and characters and realistic terms. It was the antidote to "The Wind", "The Birth of Nationality", "The Triumph of Will" and so many other admirers of hatred and violence. I put it next to the recent German film (also hidden in the US), "Rosenstrasse". <br /> <br /> I remember that the black and white format and the TV version of the story were black. some of the stations, because the black hero's wife was white. As a young citizen of civil rights, it was a conflict for me, because on the one hand, I was boycotting a cigarette in Georgia and, on the other, a TV show sponsor, the main tobacco producer in Georgia (I can no longer remember) which one - is anyone else?). <br /> <br /> I would like to find a movie or a TV show CD so that my sons can see something that my opposition to racism in general (unlike only against racism against Jews) and the recognition of the natural connection between racism and militarism.
