The great British director Christopher Nolan (Momento, Insomnia) directs this strange film from a troubled writer who is embedded with the following people. It turns out to be harmless first, but soon it becomes dangerous if you take a step forward when you meet a man of similar thinking, who shows him ins and outs. These two men will soon be moving into a strange world involving mafia and prostitution. Jeremy Theobald plays a writer and a similar minded Alex Hawit. Both are excellent performances. This low-budget movie shot up in a party style without promising any places and big letters, but it has many huge budget movies that are a smart script and a creative direction. Impressive debut by today's best director. Good stuff!
