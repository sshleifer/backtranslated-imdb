I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. I read the book ten years ago and was intrigued by how it translated to film. <br /> <br /> The manuscript is very true to the book I liked - it is rare in itself these days. Testimonials were firm and plausible, and stroyting continued in my understanding, even though I already knew the end of the book. <br /> <br /> Intelligent and well-designed film.
