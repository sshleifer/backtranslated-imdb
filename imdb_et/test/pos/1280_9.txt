It is interesting to acknowledge the previous works of large artists. Sometimes, even without the 20/20 vision, you can see the gears and the wheels, which make these people what they are. Here is a look at Christopher Nolan's past, one of today's great epochs. <br /> <br /> The filmmaking style of Christopher Nolan places great emphasis on the story. Although people may complain, it relies too much on shifting backwards, but I find it exciting to use this technique differently each time. Memento was probably the most difficult story I've ever seen. Discounted cynics who say it's old meat that is packed with fancy dressing. Memento shows how even the simplest stories can change peace of mind. Prestige, which was remarkably removed, still showed creativity in how his three stories intertwined. Even in a humidified company like the Batman series, Christopher Nolan sprinkled some of his outstanding yarn knitting tricks, breathing new life into a dark knight. <br /> <br /> The following is an intense story of an intrigue and mystery, where we see a dilettante writer who becomes a reluctant voyeur who becomes an ignorant companion in a variety of small crimes and finally sees an end that no one could have expected. Ever heard before, I had no idea what I was expecting. At any given time, the film kept me where it drove me. Since the mystery angle was clear, I was constantly trying to figure out what would happen next. And this is where I think the film will work so well. The film has many elements that led me to many wild geese. <br /> <br /> The film is completely black-and-white and has been talked about in several schedules, both of which are considered inaccurate these days. After that, everything is the least in the form of a formula or a treat. It looks like the story doesn't speak like it is, but you don't feel like you're driving. The lack of self-expression or the arrogance of self-consciousness makes this story speak. Highly recommended!
