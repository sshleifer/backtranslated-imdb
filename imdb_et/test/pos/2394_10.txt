I loved this movie, an independent film making at its best. Cinematography, tempo, rhythm and action were completely in sync. Fred Carpenters Best Job So far! The film is well written with lots of land that will take you to the end. It moves well and keeps you involved. As a photographer, I was most impressed with cinematography. Lighting creates the mood and beauty that is usually found in a much larger budget film. This gave the actors a great canvas to work on their magic. And that's exactly what they did! The great performances of all participants and each of them was well cast in their roles. As I said at the beginning, this is a great movie and one of Fred Carpenters' best movies. You like it.
