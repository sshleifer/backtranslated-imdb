I'm not much of a "policeman" movies, but it's supposed to be a classic and when I found it cheap, I bought it and stuck on the shelf, just so I could finally look yesterday, and I wanted it! Now you can be in New York City, but this movie is perfect for the winter months. Roy Scheider is a member of an elite police team called The Seven Ups, which is 5 men fighting crime. In the opening scene, they will recover from the antique shop with a full-fledged shoebox, repelling the attacks in the "bull-shop in China" routine. But that's just the beginning. There seem to be two men depicting the police, who rob mobs and hold them for ransom. Richard Lynch happens to be one of those slease bags and he's just as scary as ever. If one of the seven sites that is a funeral limousine driver blows his cover, he was beaten and filled with a car trunk that then leads to one of the most exciting caravans I've seen. Amazing, but how easy traffic in NYC is chasing, but still it's amazing when Scheider follows two robbers through what I think is the Bronx and then the bogie, and then finally, the Scheider's car comes back in one heart stop I I've ever seen. Anyway, as the policeman dies, Scheider and his men are suspect because the police officer knows so little about his activities that he is talking about the robbery of mobiles, so of course, this way of thinking nip in the bud and Scheider is ignorant of the bottom of things. Generally a decent policeman, not really my thing, but I liked it. Look for the small role of Joe Spinelli (Maniac). 7 out of 10
