The film is a very good movie. One of the best Yash Raj movies. The direction is incredible. The scenario is brilliant. The story is great. It talks about being calm, whom Kiran's girlfriend's friend confirms. She is a full-blown psycho doing things like she spoke to her mom on the phone (anyway she died 15 years ago) etc ..Kiran is dealing with Sunil. Peace does everything she can to get her. He even tries to kill Sunil, but he lives on it. The movie is every moody. Shahrukh is great, the driver is pretty good, Sunny is average, Anupham is okay and so is Tanvi, Dalip did good. The film is owned by Srk. dialogues are brilliant (Shahrukh and much, if not overflow and comedy). "Jaadu Teri Nazar" and "Tu Mere Samne" are completely melodic songs.
