Our America is multicultural, with so many subcultures. This film simply talks about a timed story of one of these subcultures. Basically, it is an objective look at a group of forgotten people, living their lives outside the rest of the world. In general, it's a good movie. It amused, provoked thinking, and showed a life that would not otherwise be seen, right in our own yard. You should all see. Having lived all my life in the United States, I had no idea that there were citizens who did not know they were citizens. This film illustrates the diversity of our country, showing this small part of the south. Obvious conclusion: if it is really real, what else is there that we don't know?
