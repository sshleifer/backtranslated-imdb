If you are interested in learning more about what is happening in today's civilization, there is a great book called "Outlaw Seas" or "The Outlaw Sea" that describes the story after these things happen. Offshore lawlessness is a reality for several reasons. One, many of the world's merchant ships are a questionable register (citizenship), and enforcing international law is difficult if shipowners do not have an office in the real country. Two, many shipping lines deploy teams from black third countries. Teams are often (as illegal immigrant workers) threatened and tempted to respond to questionable or illegal activities. Third, language barriers are often not only between officers and crew, but also between team members themselves. The team is rewarded for their performance and silence. Four, if they have committed illegal behavior, they will be able to hide the eye visibly little more than the fresh color. Anyway, it's an exciting reading. <br /> <br /> Scary story, great movie. Does anyone else notice how HBO seems to be the best and most important movies? Hollywood has difficulty distributing sufficient Oscar-worth films every year, so many of the top five candidates usually come from Britain. Jerry Bruckheimer = End of High Quality Cinema. <br /> <br /> I loved Sean Pertwee's thoroughly evil action. I also loved Omar Epps.
