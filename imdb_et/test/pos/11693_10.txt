That was a great movie! I saw it in the Karlovy Vary IFF in the Czech Republic and won an award there. This is the first movie I've ever seen of Jan (director) and I was impressed. This is a great story about love and family. The film has a great balance between comedy, romance, drama and everything. I'm not giving away any plot, but it's a well-made film and I'd watch it again if I had the chance! Cinematography / editing is great, the film just flows and the characters are warm, and they are the ones that can be associated. I hope you can enjoy this movie the way I did. If anyone knows where I find it in the United States, or if they plan to distribute it soon on a DVD, please let me know!
