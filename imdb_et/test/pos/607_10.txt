This movie talks about Geisha's aging in the Tokyo War. Okin, played by incredible Haruko Sugimara, borrows money for two other former Geisha, Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa) and Otom (Yuko Mochizuki), and they frustrate how he is somewhat unpleasant about it. Tama has a son, the daughter of Otom, who says during the film that they are leaving, while Okin, who is never a mother, will have two men from his past who, as it turns out, just want money from him. This is a convincing story of what choices you make, what you do to get through life and who you are responsible for and see. Haruko Sugimara has always been one of the greatest character actors of every country in my eyes, and he plays mostly surprising, less than compassionate Okin, with the superiority of the air that makes you not like him, but at the same time almost jealous of him. At a time when great films were made by, among others, Ozu, Mizoguchi, Kinoshita and Kurosawa, Mr. Narus is with him. If you have a region-free DVD player, you should try to find two sets of Narus boxes in England. I think this film was a large-scale study of women who are at risk of being irrelevant. That they really don't make this movie a real masterpiece.
