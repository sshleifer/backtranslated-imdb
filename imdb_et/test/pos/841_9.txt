"Female Convict Scorpion - Beast Stable", the third in the series, is a great piece of cellulose. Tooned closer and photographed by Nikkatsu's violent rosy than other Scorpion scraps, it is amazingly captured, focused on passionate enthusiasm and galloping and degenerate galleries of populated rogue. Shinya Ito, first installer, returns for this surreal fable that starts with Scorpion (Meiko Kaji), who cuts the hand of the police, which he handcuffs and flees to the Tokyo subway. He hides in the area of ​​the red light, where he interacts with his friends with a prostitute, who is seen for the first time as a vision of having his brother (who reaches him impregnation) in incestaous proportions. Scorpion's desire to protect this unfortunate woman will eventually reveal her identity and all hell breaks open. She is beaten, sexually assaulted and locked in a strange bird tree inside. I loved all this hypnotic, nihilistic, and emotional film. It's the boss of the first three Scorpion films, and there's a big scene next to it. I can't recommend it enough.
