In 1982, a small film called MAKING LOVE shocked the audience with their honest and open-minded romantic love story that just happened to about two men. <br /> <br /> I've been waiting for years for a good, old - romantic romance between two men; OLD DAYS are all and much more. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is soap, melodramatic, clich√© and quite horny. It makes it so wonderful. Nothing like a romantic movie, and this movie is the best word in a romantic sense. <br /> <br /> As for the religion problem, apologize to the people, but these things happen and happen to gay people even now. Not only does the Church of Mormon not allow its gay members. Homosexuals in every religion are facing tough decisions and rejection. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. It has a perfect fantasy romance based on the daily lives of the characters. If I could give more than ten stars, I would. A good love story never goes out of style; great love stories like LATTER DAYS are unforgettable. <br /> <br /> It's time!
