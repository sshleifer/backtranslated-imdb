I just saw this movie today at Phoenix Film Festival and loved it. The synopsis was listed in our program because "the old Shakespeare's actress calls her three children to commit suicide." I wasn't sure if I was going to see it, because when I read about it, I liked the "suicide party" idea that seemed very interesting to me, but the "old Shakespeare actress" was worried that the film would be kind dry and boring. But I decided to try it. I'm glad I did. It was not at least dry and boring that this dialogue was excellent, funny and smart, but not pretentious or difficult to understand. Peter Falk was fantastic in this role, he stole the show. I was also pleasantly surprised by Laura San Giacomo's performance, usually with her mistakes, but I enjoyed her very carefully in this movie. I think that Judge Reinhold's part could have done better for the other actor, sometimes he seemed so nervous and looked like an actor, not as you looked at it. But the film was so good that I got the actor's discomfort. I recommend this to anyone and told some people to see it as soon as it is available to the public. Who knew that suicide could be so fun?
