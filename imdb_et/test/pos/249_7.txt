Rita Hayworth as Rusty Parker is COVER GIRL du jour - she is one of Danny McGuire's club dances, according to Danny (Gene Kelly) and the one who comes in contact with her. Take the example of Vanity magazine magazine John Coudair (Otto Kruger): Rusty is fascinated by the resemblance of Grandmother Maribelle (also played by Hayworth in the setbacks) he devoted to love, trying to revive his youth by believing that he and Maribelle were wrong. He doesn't believe Danny could give Rusty the happiness or everything he should have right - he even gets Danny to believe it. When Rusty becomes famous in Vanity's "Cover Girl", Danny will deliberately drive Noel Wheaton (Lee Bowman) on hold. What happens when Danny returns to the city with his sidekick Genius (Phil Silvers) to find out that Rusty is getting married to Wheaton? <br /> <br /> As a musician, COVER GIRL benefits from the songs and songs written by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin, including the Long Ago and Far Away candidate (perhaps one of the most beautiful ballads ever written) and beautifully decorated as a Hayead and Kelly duet), Maribelle's "Sure Thing" (the more pure "Poor John" is not Kern / Gershwin's collaboration) and "Put me to the test". Dancing is, of course, top-notch because Gene Kelly was more than just a hand in choreography. It shows in the simplest dances, such as his dance with Hayworth, to put me to the test, or cheerfully overflowing "Make your way tomorrow" (done by Danny, Rusty and Genius), which foresees the reaction of the gene character to the police policeman within the SINGIN headline number. Kelly gave a particularly technological and artistic coup to the "Alter-Ego" dance. Like his descendants ANCHORS AWEIGH and AMERICAN PARIS (Jerry the Mouse and 16-minute ballet), this dance is an example of the amazing innovation and creativity Kelly emphasized to contemporary film music: dances that could not be staged, and years before the CGI -d, Kelly insisted on dancing with one person who could match her talent and style - herself. The number is barely five minutes long, but it (and the Kelly genius) still breathes away, even sixty years down the line. That's why I looked at COVER GIRL, and if nothing else, this dance is really worth it. <br /> <br /> You can say that a lot of money has gone to COVER GIRL and Rita Hayworth - it's not worth it. Recognize the scene when Rusty hits Broadway - a big screen that introduces all the different girls, giving way to the huge stage behind Rusty's entrance. Hayworth is indeed one of the most beautiful girls in the movie and dances in style and grace, worth almost Kelly. (Very few of Kelly's companions have this honor.) He's fun in some scenes, like his drunk when John and Wheaton come to Joe. <br /> <br /> But for some reason his performance still lacks a sparkle that would help cover GIRL over the general curse of mediocrity. This curse is revoked only when Gene Kelly is on the screen (dancing or not) or when Eve Arden is John's long-term secretary next to Stonewall, with a second comment or a clever observation. Since the film ultimately belongs to Hayworth, Kelly and Arden will not save it as a whole. That doesn't mean the movie is bad - it's not. It is enjoyable, with great songs and lovely numbers, and lots of beautiful girls. But it's not just classic. Dancing, however, is classic - so look at COVER GIRL for it and you won't regret it.
