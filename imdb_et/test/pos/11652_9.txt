Tim Robbins makes a great movie. Her husband (susan sarandon) gives a great result as a sister to Helen Perjean, who wants to help Mattew Poncelet (Sean Penn) who is accused of murder and who also die of an injection ... what you get. Great action and it's a movie that gives you something to think about - <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon deserves the best actress of the year 1995. This is probably one of his biggest films. <br /> <br /> I didn't see "Craddle on Rock," but I must definitely see more Robbins movies. <br /> <br /> Rating: 9/10 or *** 1/2 of 4. Go and see .....
