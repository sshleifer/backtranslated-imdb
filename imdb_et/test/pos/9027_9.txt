I really don't understand why people don't like such a movie. I found it to be a lot of fun (of course, it is a great Laura Fraser!) When I first heard about it, I thought it would be in line with the role of "Weird Science" and to the extent it is true, but there is a twist , which I didn't really see. Having seen a trailer from a DVD (which I did not see before watching a movie), I saw that the trailer was really "twisting"! Very strange. <br /> <br /> As the film progresses, the comparison of "Weird Science" is becoming less and less, and I think it is better for the two films. Certainly there are some scenes that do not work great, but they are made because of the enthusiasm of young people. <br /> <br /> All in all, I would recommend this to be a great example of a Sci-chick flick, and I don't think I've seen them a lot!
