Tourist Trap (1979) is an entertaining horror movie in the late 70s, a film that involves a number of young friends who are left on an old abandoned lane through a crazy old wax museum. <br /> <br /> The museum looks strange but harmless to the old man, but things are very disgusting when the young group members start killing who is responsible for the murders, whether it's old man Slausen, or is it his horrible dummy collection, who seems to be alive and hungry for blood !! This movie was a good thing, it was quickly faced, the performances were very good for the actors / actors (Tanya Roberts was very sexy) and the movie was never boring and, as I say, it had very scary scenes so be prepared. hide under cover! Definitely recommended for horror / ghost fans! I'll give this movie 10 out of 10 very respected 7.2.
