Just before Dawn is one of those really good slashermasters that send chills every time you watch it! This movie has a very tight, very functional, very well done camera work (nice work by Mr. Lieberman!), What makes a very well done slasher! However, at the low level of the 80s, it has an impact after it has ended. The opening killing (bicycle through the finger) seemed so real! And the death of the mouth of the mouth left me stunned! Generally, I give 10 stars to this lost classic 10 stars! if you are looking for gore-fest, don't look here. but if you want the chills to come back, look at it. There are 6 deaths and one of them does not see, but it leaves you thinking that "how was he killed?" the stranded topic reminded me of the 1977 mountain eyes that followed the same concept but with the cannabis in the desert. But still slasher fans, give it a forgotten gem, I promise you, you will be staisfied!
