If you want to see the real, whistle-like nature of communism, see DARK BLUE WORLD. (Tvamomodr√Ω Svet) He talks about how brave Czech pilots who refused to surrender fled to England to join the fight against the Nazis. After the war, the Communists feared that they had taken dangerous Western ideas of freedom. So these heroic Czechs had been thrown into a horrible prison for pilots, where some guards were the same Nazis they risked losing their lives. <br /> <br /> If Hollywood wants to understand why so many of their movies are flat, they should compare the parts of the "Pearl Harbor" character drama to this movie. In Dark Blue World you really do all the characters. Pearl Harbor is all like a slick version of a real person. <br /> <br /> There are countless stories in this movie. One funny scene that I think is that Karel is taught in English by a rather formal English language. If he can't say the word, he laughs at the lesson. According to the typical stoic English, the teacher stands calmly but vigorously with Karel and complains that he is acting. <br /> <br /> The aerial battles of this movie are amazing and will help to make the movie more lively. I read that it would cost $ 11,000 an hour to rent aircraft, but it was worth every penny. <br /> <br /> Ladies, you should cry for movies, but guys .... be careful! This movie would make General Patton cry. And if you are a lover of the dog, use the side of the Kleenex box. Don't tell me I didn't warn you.
