I don't know exactly what it is, but the movie is happily sitting on my shelf without thinking that I'll ever leave ... Fulci has made one of the most ridiculous, bizzare, cheez-infected and well-unique films I've ever had. you've ever seen. Not sure what to say yet, but I love this movie !!! Steak tartar is absolutely terrible, and the whole Nazi torture of torture is a strange fun ... I'm not sure what Fulci was trying to do, but has anyone heard that Fulci Wes Craven accused him of "Scream"? "Cat in the brain" is indispensable for bad film students everywhere ... Yes, I'm sure it's not a "good" movie, but I guarantee that certain scenes will remain in your mind forever! This is madness, people ... I think if I were a "serious" critic, I'd give it 3 but only enjoyable (again, I can't really explain my feelings). 7 .... Really pulled out ...
