I've seen this movie right now and can't get sick yet. It's like a frickin drug. I know many people don't like it, but there's something that just draws me. Every performance is remarkable, but Aaliyah is the one who steals. Not only did he play the role of Akasha, but he became. His body movement and beauty were taken very well. It is also nice to see that a black girl was chosen as the Queen of Egypt (No, I'm not white, I'm one). True, it is not known what color the ancient Egyptians actually, but it was a nice change. Stuart Townsend made me completely forget that Tom Cruise's portrait on Lestat and Marguerite was once again striking. All in all, the movies were a good time. For those who haven't seen it, be sure to look at it openly and don't take it too seriously. I mean, this is a movie about a vampire who will become a rock star. Take it that way.
