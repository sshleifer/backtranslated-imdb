It has become one of my favorite films and certainly one of the best Western countries I've ever seen. Finding a stylish place for the genre (westerns are or were not, because they are not done very often? Moral games that are too often understood by critics with intellectual claims), I bought a DVD without seeing the vision because I had read enough about William S. Hart's work (much of which she wrote and directed) to interest me and thought I should have at least one of her movies in my video collection. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I approached the actual viewing with some intimidation. My previous experience with the quiet "classic" of the cinema had left me unrecognized. The opera of Chaney, the birth of the Griffith nationality and the Fairbanks' Zorro sign were good, but not nearly as good as their reputation could be expected. They were either too long or theatrical, or both. <br /> <br /> The toll gate still came as a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> This is a story that is said to be simple and straightforward. Black Deering (played by Hart), the leader of the notorious successful band, thinks it's time for the group to break apart before his luck ends. But there is his head against him, Jordan, who goes into all the latter, promising great wealth, but leading them into a trap in which he is an accomplice. Everything is killed, except Deering, who has been imprisoned. If his captors acknowledge him as a man who once rescued several soldiers and settlers by warning the impending outbreak of the impending Indian attack, they will allow escape. Free, he's trying to find an honest job, but he's nervous and ridiculous, and finally he has to survive. Soon he will be continued not only by the sheriff's position, but also by Jordan (now managed to get paid) and his henchmen. His flight takes him to a distant cabin where a single mother and his little son live. After some initial doubts, they bring him to his heart. Deering sees an opportunity for a new life, but realizes that it may not be possible. <br /> <br /> Hart was the first great western star and the first to inject realism into the genre. One of the pioneers in filmmaking has created many signs and situations that have become clichés in Western countries for more than ninety years. What keeps her movies interesting, however, was her ability to overcome the cliché (maybe her imitators are not far enough) to make the material fresh and innovative, even now. Three such cases in Tate Gate illustrate this: <br /> <br /> 1) In one scene, his character can kill a crowd trying to kill Jordan and kill an outsider instead. The next close-up shows that he is clearly disappointed. The frustration, however, does not come from the fact that he has attacked a man who had hitherto caused him any harm, but he fell short of his target. <br /> <br /> 2) In the second, when he escapes from the hangover, his "borrowed" horse enters the gopher hole and interrupts the leg. Hart pulls his weapon out to put the animal out of his misery, but before he pulls the trigger, he gives a sad, loving pillow, as if to say goodbye to his old friend. 3) Finally, after he has strangled Jordan and thrown his body on the rock, he returns to search for his weapons and his opponent's pistol on the ground. He moves forward and gives him a quick horse before installing his horse. It is a simple gesture, but it highlights the deep enthusiasm that he knows for the one who gave him and his comrades. <br /> <br /> And I love the title The Toll Gate. Allegorical is that a person cannot start a new life until he has paid for his old sins. Deering is paid in the form of sacrifice. Today's more sophisticated audiences may not fully buy this sentiment, but it may still work for you when you shoot it. <br /> <br /> Viewers who love their videos in a pristine state are undoubtedly objections to the quality of the DVD image, especially the poorly deteriorated final roll. I don't mind at all. This copy of the 1920 movie is even a miracle, because the prints of so many other silent films have disappeared. If you keep this in mind and look at the film as historic, its visual flaws are not so difficult to accept. William S. Hart was born in New York in 1870 but grew up in Minnesota and Wisconsin, where he studied Sioux and Indian sign language. He read Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson among his friends and collected Remington's paintings, so his knowledge of the West was the first. If his vision seems too romantic in today's standards, it is much closer to reality than the spaghetti of the 1960s and 1970s in the West and subsequent revisionist works. Both the star and his films have been late for re-evaluation.
