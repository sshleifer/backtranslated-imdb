Earlier commentators have observed a similarity between the film and the third man, director Carol Reed's classic film Noir, who play Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten. This similarity hits the viewer almost immediately. It is a great praise to compare Robert Krasker's award-winning cinematography with a third man. The plot of the stolen identity is also delineated quite precisely but under quite normal conditions. I found it to be very creative and fun. As common as a "faulty - or stolen - identity" device is in the theater as well as in the cinema, it is just a device and should not be mistakenly drawn. Consequently, although the viewer may have seen this device "thousand" times, the plot of the stolen identity on this device is full of surprises and turns. This is an unexpected turn that makes this movie much fresher, more original and attractive when the plot summary can be passed on. The stolen identity is not based on the tension of a character on most films, because there is no real secret here. Instead, it relies on continuous and smaller surprises. In short, the wrong identity device is quite common; but this plot is not. <br /> <br /> Finally, although I wasn't cast, I found the actor to be evenly good, occasionally prominent. I could have just imagined that other actors would turn this movie into a melodrama, bombarded, overwhelmed with gestures and obvious facial expressions. Operation is always more restrained and subtle. Donald Buka is particularly restrained and plausible, never "blowing his cover" with the manifestation of an apparent face, as we often see in films that depend on maintaining joy to maintain dramatic tension. <br /> <br /> The only disappointment of this otherwise subtle film was the very weak development of the Love Story Substation. In its present form, it seems to be the end - a little surprise - to the end. Or maybe during their shared trials, the actors just couldn't deliver a sensitive chemistry level that I could rate. This sub-plot should have been more visible when the story opened. All in all, I thought this movie was a small little pearl and I was wondering why I didn't see it before. Try it, you like it.
