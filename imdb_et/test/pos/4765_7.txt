What you saw in BULLITT and FRENCH CONNECTION is nothing compared to what you have here. Chase continues for almost 15 minutes and that's the best you will ever see. This film has become a classic blessing of 70's film art. This is a sharp and realistic image of the New York City avenues. The behavior of Tony Lo Bianco in this film is one of the most impressive of those who have ever shot. He hangs out with his companions and puts it out as the police are responsible. His childhood friend Roy Scheider is a street detective who is puzzled by the loss of mobile phones. You can say that Lo Bianco enjoys the whole movie game. Sometimes the movie gets boring, but when you feel like giving up, something big happens and it pulls you back. The score given by Don Ellis determines the cold, gray winter tone in New York. From top to bottom everything, my husband Joe Spinell appears at the beginning of Toredano's role in the garage. <br /> <br /> Score, 7 out of 10 Stars
