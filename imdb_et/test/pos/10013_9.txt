I saw this movie at the Rotterdam International Film Festival in 2002. It seemed to be one of the less popular films at the festival, but as it turned out, it was more interesting. <br /> <br /> The story, an actor trying to cope with his drug addiction and himself, is based on real facts. What's more, the characters in the movie are real people who live this experience again, this time for a movie that is partly staged on stage. Not only are they good actors, they are also Jia Hongsheng's parents in real life, the methods used in their relationship with Jia are very effective. <br /> <br /> Jia Hongsheng is a Chinese actor on some actor in the late eighties beginning in the nineties. Later you can see him in big movies like Frozen and Suzhou River. Between these two career options, Jia becomes a drug addict and loses all the ability to act or even do something productive, except for a somewhat pointless attempt to become a guitar virtuoso. <br /> <br /> I like how the scenario decides to emphasize its behavior after retreat more than the drug horror. It seems that pain and fight Jia is. At the same time, we hate him as he treats the people around him. <br /> <br /> The film pulls the viewer into a tiring pattern Jia seems to be sticking with her parents and sister trying to care for her. Because there are personal "interviews", the features of which seem to make us know Jia not only by ourselves but also by others. <br /> <br /> The film has a strong feeling, but Jia's scenes are flowing with excitement and parties with luminous shades. This is what makes bitter humor in many film festivals. The music is beautiful and stayed with me for a while. It is a film that may not be easy for many people to remember, but for people interested in serious and modern Chinese films.
