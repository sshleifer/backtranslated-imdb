it is cool!!! there is no partnership like Errol and Olivia. there love is genuine! I'm 24 years old, but this flick is now as enchanting as I am sure it was 60 years ago. Raoul Walsh is an underrated genius, his direction is so wide, so wide, but so intimate. the last scene between Colonel Custer (Flynn) and his wife (de havilland) brought me almost tears (it was not easy for a 24-year-old boy!), there is also a deep Christian message, the faith Custer takes with you, and his wife's trust and fidelity to the extent that it allows him to go to fulfill his moral obligation to protect innocent civilians from certain mass murder. such a question is not dealt with quite similarly. a must-see vision for all who want to see this determinable moment in American and military history, from within. patriotic, for all the right reasons. I knew that Errol Flynn was the star and De havilland was the legend of the screen - it only confirms my doubts that they are one of the greatest!
