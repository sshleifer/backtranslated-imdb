This movie is a hidden pearl. I don't understand why this movie doesn't get any more time. Errol and Eleanor Parker offer a real attractive pair. And their chemistry is impeccable. I really liked her reference to her daughters as Robin Hood. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Errol Flynn. It's nice to see Errol playing with his father. At the expense of all his own children, he was a very attentive and loving father in real life. Supporting cast is also great. You cannot misrepresent supporters such as Hattie McDaniel and Lucile Watson. Hattie McDaniel makes the movie much better. This film has now become my home tradition of vacation. Enjoy !!!
