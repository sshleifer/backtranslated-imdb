HOUSE CALLS was an amusing 1978 comedy (Walter Matthau), who now wants to play but can't help but fetch his patient (Glenda Jackson) who refuses another bed for his bed post. Matthau likes a woman, but she does not really want the commitment she requires, she only accepts her within two weeks and then decides whether she wants to do it or not; but other complications make it difficult for Matthau to make a decision when two weeks have grown, even though she is clearly in love with her. Matthau and Jackson are surprisingly effective chemistry as a pair of screens and have been given strong support from Richard Benjamin, Candice Azzar, Dick O'Neill, and especially Art Carney, who is in the hospital where Matthau works. Matthau is even a short scene with his real son, Charli, who appears as Jackson's son. This interesting comedy is still pretty good in all these years. If you have never seen it, you should rent it.
