Okay, it's too long and it's too happy. Still, The Great Dictator is an exciting movie. Chaplin is doing terrible work on Hitler and trying to portray the Jewish oppression of the Nazis in Germany (that was before the concentration camps were well known). Not a Chaplin masterpiece, but it's worth watching. <br /> <br />
