It's a pearl of film, Slapstick violence, Simon pegg and Green Spew. <br /> <br /> Powerless looks and uncontrolled motorbikes add to this rock. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, I can highly recommend it, maybe not as good as the bottom, but not far away. <br /> <br /> If you have never seen a man with two nose hooks, what are you waiting for to buy this movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't even see the end when it turns out that Ritchie and Eddie are both ghosts. <br /> <br /> Feeb - 1 boiled egg.
