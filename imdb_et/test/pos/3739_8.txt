That's right, we have a 2008 film using the "Brief Encounter" and "Madison County Bridges". Basically, this is a story of lost love, redemption, and triumph of the human spirit. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere and especially Diane Lane's performances are very good. Gere gives a modest performance here as a doctor looking for meaning after the patient's death at the operating table. Lane is the mother of a rebellious daughter and a nice young son who has left her misleading spouse and has lost her father in the same year. <br /> <br /> Scott Glenn steals an exhibition scene with Gerega. She is a heart-broken husband and she speaks of her love for her divorced wife, which brings her eyes to the eye. <br /> <br /> Fresh her triumph as an accepting mother in "suspicion" Viola Davis seems like a friend in the movie and literally hangs her hair at a rather benign level.
