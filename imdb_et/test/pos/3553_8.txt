Believe it or not, Mona Lisa was actually stolen and disappeared for almost two years. In 1911, Leonardo da Vinci's La Gioconda (better known as Mona Lisa) was taken from the Louvre as a small thief (and former Louvre employee) who allegedly tried to bring back the world's most famous art to his homeland, Italy. His actions after the theft seem more likely to be painting for his own personal benefit. (Of course, he had no hope of finding a buyer.) Mona Lisa was quietly returned to the Louvre on the last day of 1913, remaining there with the exception of casual loans. If "Arsène Lupine" appeared in 1932 (twenty years after theft), most movers would have recalled that the 1911 crime and their knowledge would be somewhat plausible for this film. "Arsène Lupin" is quite enjoyable, with MGM's usual high production standards and the usual effective direction of Jack Conway. This movie is not gratifying; what he lacks is credible. <br /> <br /> John Barrymore is the captain of the title criminal: he specializes in "impossible" crimes, which he makes even more difficult when they announce them ... but of course he always committed a crime and lets himself go fool. Tully Marshall has a good scene as one of Barrymore's victims. Lupine has a tendency to develop hidden shades that allow Barrymore (A-Class A ham) to withstand its fragility. John's older brother, Lionel Barrymore, is Guerchard, Javert's Surgeon Detective, who is guilty of Lupine. <br /> <br /> Karen Morley was an extremely beautiful actor, full of populist political activity; On the screen he was the most impressive in the roles of the workgroup that installed his political beliefs (like his exquisite performance in our daily bread). "Arséne Lupinis" is, of course, Morley's dark hair darkened by a dark-haired blonde, and she's all set in joyful equipment that makes her rather uncomfortable than sexy. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS. Finally, Lupin decides to steal Mona Lisa from Louvre. She splits the painting from her frame, rolls on the canvas and saves it out of the flower basket. We see John Barrymore's randomly branded, tightly rolled cloth, which is said to be the largest work of art in all human history. I had to laugh at the mistake of filmmakers. In real life (but not in this movie), da Vinci Mona Lisa painted on a board so that early on it would be difficult to roll! <br /> <br /> Finally, Guerchard captures lupine and grabs him for Le Calaboose. The scene between John and Lionel Barrymore in the police car is very happy because their true affection for each other comes out of their characters' dialogue. I would have found this scene unbelievable with two other players. As it is, I can't imagine anyone, but these roles are played by Barrymore's brothers. Well, maybe Dennis and Randy Quaid, but just barely. <br /> <br /> Don't look at a good plot of land here, but "Arsne Lupine" is a great example of old style. I appreciate this movie in 8 out of 10 points.
