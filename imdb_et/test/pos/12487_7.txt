Excellently adorable Suzy Delair plays an imaginative performer who has succeeded in the theater. His wife and attendant, played by Bernard Blier, have been drawn, but jealous of a man. If he discovers less than preferably that his flashy husband has planned a church together with an old businessman to advance his career, he loses all control and threatens to murder a businessman. Then I have to stop describing the film here, because it cuts on thin ice whose twists, revelations, ambiguities and intercourse mean that some of them would endanger it. I am not sure how good or bad this French police procedure comes from the song and dance community, although it is certainly interesting that what we all know is the one who did not. We just don't know who did it. <br /> <br /> The story depends on the following clues procedure, where the ideal alibis fail and where cautiously created preparations and scams break down. Interestingly, it is a temporary film, which, despite its knowledge, produces an interim check, which is traditionally thought to be too fast. <br /> <br /> Goldsmiths' Shadow is the least darkness of Henri-Georges Clouzot's films. It's not nearly as dirty as the shocking Les Diaboliques, both tragic and frightening wage increases, or as le Corbeau. Perhaps this is due to the vibration of the 1940s French dance halls and theater settings, all of which act as the militant of this criminal. <br /> <br /> Clouzot understands and affirms its signs, even if it is worse they have a more vindictive feature than their other films. If she may be aware of Les Diabolique's leading women or truck drivers who are sinking into terrible deaths to repel the unhappy life of fear, it may not necessarily be a support or an agreement. part of the filmmaker because they are the characters who made explicit decisions that determine their fate. All the characters in this more solemn film have scenes and moments that we like, even Louis Jouvet's harsh, cold detective, who is worried about his youth's childhood after the trouble and despair of his entire life. with caps. <br /> <br /> There is humor and fun sexuality, the latter being mainly by Delair, which neutralizes the pressure to some extent. Clouzot quietly practiced his craft, the patient, until he made his unreliable later films, where he promised his audience to give mercy.
