The word of every great praise fell before the height of the film. This movie is a real example of how a psychological horror film should be. <br /> <br /> The plot looks a bit confusing at first sight, but it certainly explains a bit about what's going on and what you really want to look at for a second time. But after the second look you will join together and then you will know how amazing the film is. It's not your stupid ass teen slasher movie where you just turn off your brain and sit in front of the screen to see big b ** bs and lots of blood. <br /> <br /> If you want to increase the psychological horror of this movie and look at it alone with an excellent home theater system that supports Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1ch, without your badly-minded friends who are kidding in a very stressful situation. And don't forget to turn off the light. <br /> <br /> My points in different aspects: - <br /> <br /> Direction = 9/10 Action = 8/10 Atmosphere = 10/10 Sound Effect = 9/10 <br /> > Total = 9/10
