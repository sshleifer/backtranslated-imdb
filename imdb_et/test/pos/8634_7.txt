Bud Abbott and Lou Costello always had good adherence to the children, but in my career, I think I could say that they only made one film that could be for children. Jack and Beanstalk were this one movie. <br /> <br /> It was part of two images of an independent transaction from Warner Brothers, the second was Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd. These were the only two films the boys painted. They both, as usual, work as a nanny for a very cautious and reluctant young David Stollery. Although it starts with Costello, who wants to read the baby, Jack and Beanstalk are sleeping, the young boy stops reading it at Costello. Lou is sleeping and he dreams that he is really Jack's giant killer. Dorothy was a big girl, 6'2 "and you can imagine she had some difficulties, except when her height was used as a joke. The only player ever looking at her was John Wayne in three Godfathers at 6" 4 "Henry Fonda and James Stewart in our cheerful ways were also barely over him, but again his height was part of the gag. Beautifully, but it wasn't worth it. It was William Farnum's last film, whose career dates from the days of the early silent screen and even the previous one. He played King Princess Shaye's father from the beginning of the 20th century. <br /> <br /> Some were not terribly memorable musical numbers from Jack and Beanstalk, recording the title song, well remembered as a boy with 78 Bud and Lou song songs and stories. I was in my early years, but it became a lifelong fan of them and their TV series. <br /> <br /> Jack and Beanstalk are still a good children's picture for the very young, though I keep tan parents to warn their little deliveries so that they do not mimic the young master Stollery.
