Critics and audiences both pretty much filmed this movie, but I didn't really think it would be too bad! Even the critics I usually agree with was thought to be a mess, and I usually despise the "horror films" of PG-13. So this means one of two things: either (1) I'm too happy and my taste in movies has decreased over the years; Now, to be fair, some movie critics are true - there is not much character development, and the story doesn't happen much. But does a person live with people, how much did you wait for a custodial movie? Cut them somewhat loose! As a former babysitter who looked at the flare light at night, I can say for sure that the stalker guy was one of the most horrible mofo! Who knows? I think such things give me needles. <br /> <br /> Yes, I admit I was having fun, and I don't care about the size of the minority who puts me in.)
