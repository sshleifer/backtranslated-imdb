I watched this movie three times in my life at different times and really enjoyed it. This Can-Can is an authentic Joie de Vivre explosion, like the musical by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly, but in French. And Jean Renoir has a nice respect for his time, his friends, lovers, music and dances. At the same time, the age of the exhibition is full of affection, full of affection and French mood. This is an impressive impression of impressionism (people who like impressionist painters like this picture). This is especially a tribute to Toulouse-Lautrec and, of course, Jean-Reno's father Pierre-Auguste. You will find a reliable and wonderful colorful holiday in the Renoir masterpiece. Excellent casting, landscape, sound effects and music. Even this tells us about the creation of the Paris Moulin Rouge, apparently this is a fictional story (and not very original, because it falls very well known by the morality that the show must continue). But Jean Renoir's output is great. <br /> <br />
