This film surprised me. Open credit sequence contains nicely made animations. After that, we get into semi-solid production that betrays its small budget. Characters, typical American teenagers, are introduced slowly, with more personal detail than usual in such films. By the time a shlitz hits a fan, we know each of these characters and whether they like or hate them according to their different people. It's a slow uphill, which really resembles a slope with a large roller skate. Fortunately, when the action starts, this inflatable old school is HORROR! Steve Johnson's makeup effects are awesome. Quality is equal to much more budgeted films. And the fears are hitting. Kevin Tenney offers his best movie ever with heartfelt surprises and creepy settings. The humor of the tongue, sometimes cheesy, refers to this film as a horror of the 80s, as opposed to the earlier genre, such as "The Night of the Living Dead" or "The Hills Have Eyes". But for true horror fans, it's worth it. Play it as the first entry on the double bill, the 1999 remake of "House on the Haunted Hill". The dynamics of design and character are so similar that you really have to think about what movie they actually did?
