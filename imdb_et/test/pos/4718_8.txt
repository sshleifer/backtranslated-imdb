It was high time to shoot the situation in a largely ignored Asian country like Myanmar, and Beyond Rangoon is Hollywood's answer. Initially, I thought Hollywood would dramatize the 8888 uprising events and traditionally add to the Hollywood Spice the Titanic-like love of a leading hero and a Burmese male who is an old man. Fortunately, there was no such thing - which can also explain why the film was not financially successful. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film was honest with God and I was glad about the accuracy of the events being presented. . In addition to filming outside of Myanmar in Malaysia and Thailand and not getting an exotic place in Burma, I couldn't find much of a movie. <br /> <br /> You cannot blame the people for the despair of the movie and the resulting overwhelming measures. After all, it is the real events of the civil war. Hans Zimmer's music is definitely a USP for an adventurous tragedy for people who have no connection with it. <br /> <br /> I was only one year old in Rangoon (now in Yangon) for this angry time. When I heard a movie about my real life experience, which I was too young to accept, I had to get a DVD and it goes without saying that I had no complaints about it because it is a miracle of eye opening for me .
