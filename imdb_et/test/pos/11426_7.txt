Watching Laurel without a Hardy movie seems strange, but it's fun. This is a well-made parody of what became a classic silent film, and it shows Stan's talents very well. Although his pictures with Oliver Hardy were great, these early solo aspirations give you an idea of ​​how well he was in his craft and how great he had been if he had continued the Keaton and Chaplin tradition as an independent star. Dancing with his actual husband's coffee environment is the best part of the picture and he has pretty funny bits that match Laurel's great dance stages. And the bullfighting climax is the pearl, because even the bull is customary. And I like the irony at the scene where she is hired and wearing her familiar Laurel and Hardy speaker. As much as I love the Laurel and Hardy teams and I feel that during their main time there was never a more funny comedy duo on the screen, it's nice to see them alone anytime (see THE FIGHTING KENTUCKIAN, which Hardy did with Duke) Dale Roloff
