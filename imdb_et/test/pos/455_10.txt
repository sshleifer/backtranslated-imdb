I really enjoy this movie. For the first time it was in Turner's classic films. All the actors did very well, but Brynner steals the show as always (he is so sexy!). This is one movie you see in Brynner's emotions. In fact, this film is the first thing I ever saw to laugh at him because he plays a very strong, bigger life and a serious role in other movies. In this film, you see Brynner's both masculine, strong and sensitive sides. Brynner seems to be the "ladies" in this film. It's amazing how Brynner eats a glass cup and speaks Russian. love. I don't understand if both Brynner and Kerr (both with very good chemistry) stars in the movie and then Brynner always dies when he reminds you of "King and Me".
