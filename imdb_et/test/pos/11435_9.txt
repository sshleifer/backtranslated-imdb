When I went to the cinema, I didn't expect much. I didn't know anything about this movie, but it was the only movie I saw because then I was in a small town. So I saw this movie and I was fascinated! "La stelle che non c'Ã¨" is a trip through a new industrial China and it shows it honestly! Most of the time you will see China's stupid places and you will see what really happens with this new industrialization. The main characters are sad, but hopefully people. He is a naive Italian man who can't believe what he sees. He is a translator from China who has lost his son. Sometimes it is sad, sometimes funny, but always poetic! Great movie with great actors! So only one star is missing!
