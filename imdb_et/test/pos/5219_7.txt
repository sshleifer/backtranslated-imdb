I do not like boxing, do not understand the attraction. I liked this movie. Latin Positive Images Without Violence on Drugs, Sex, or Street. The plot actually had stable, loving families. The fighting sequences are violent, just like boxing, but not like the ultimate Rocky movies. There is nothing wrong with familiar events with different angles and ethnic origins. It's a good rental.
