I have the impression that "Hail the Woman" has been done at all; released only one year after American women voted, this turbulent drama makes a serious allegation of a sexual double standard that values ​​women's sexual behavior harder than male. A prologue placed in the Plymouth Colony in 1621 shows a pilgrimage girl who was sentenced to fucking stool to flirt with a boy; boy is not punished. Now we come to Flint Hill, New Hampshire at this time (1921). Oliver Beresford (Theodore Roberts) is a bombastic Bible writer: what we call the "God worker" in Britain and Australia. Beresford has decided that his son, David (Lloyd Hughes), will become a preacher, no matter how David knows it. In the case of Beresford's daughter Judith, Beresford is sure that women are not important enough to be more than women and mothers. Apparently God spoke to him personally. <br /> <br /> David's evangelical career is under threat when he impregnates a local girl's unmarried man's daughter Nan Higgins. (The Tully Marshall ID is identified under the credit only as the "Odd Jobs Man", but the close-up of the check shows that his name is Jake Higgins. 1921. Nan goes to the big city to melt into oblivion as another unintentional mother. <br /> <br /> Judith is naturally terrible because of her gender limit. (Or, rather, the understanding of other people.) He meets Wyndham Gray (Edward Martindel's excellent performance), an author who encourages him to overcome sexist stereotypes. But Judith is unofficially associated with local loyalty to Joe Hurd, who is unable to do so. Hurd is played by Vernon Dent, a clever speaker who is remembered only for comedy roles (another banana for Harry Langdon and a villain on three Stooges films). It gives you excellent performance in your role outside your normal range. Unfortunately, Dent spent his last year due to poverty and complete darkness due to diabetic retinopathy. <br /> <br /> Finally, Judith comes to orphans. In 1921, I waited for the children's home to be white only, so I was pleasantly surprised when a Chinese boy turned out. (And unpleasantly surprised when he has used a racial ass as a butt.) There's a strange mistake in the film. In the order of Christmas, we see the mistress of the orphanage, who speaks of "Saint Nicholas' visit," but (in the title of the dialogue), she credits the Santa Claus SIX reindeer, not eight. This is followed by a short animation sequence that shows Santa's six reindeer that are attached to his shot. I assume that the animators (either by chance or by saving money) continued with the two reindeer and the title card changed the poetry to make a mistake. His most famous performance is his role in "The Lost World", where he is easily built with a robbed brontosaura. Hughes gives his "Hail the Woman" scene a memorable result when he finally rebels against his father's tyranny. Theodore Roberts has been accused of carrying out his role as a caricature in the execution of the screaming father of the gospel. I disagree: unfortunately, decades after this film was made, I continue to meet "holy" fools just as this man ... wants to destroy the lives of those around them and make sure they have God's authority to do it. /> <br /> In the central role of Judith Beresford, Firenze Vidor delivers a delicate, realistic and intelligent result. I usually do not like Vidor, who tended to be cast into the roles of glamor, but was not sufficiently motivated to justify them. Here, her character's appearance is less relevant than usual. <br /> <br /> All this movie is directed by John Griffith Wray, a director who deserves much better knowledge. Unfortunately, Wray died at the beginning of the age of talks, in the mid-thirties: if he had lived for another ten years, he would certainly have had several early sound classics. 'Hail the Woman' has several very beautiful screen compositions: I was particularly impressed by the scene in the New England woods when Vidor and Dent have a quarrel in front of a huge resurrected tree. (Wondering where it was actually filmed.) "Hail the Woman" deals with an unpleasant theme, but it deserves much better knowledge, and I appreciate this ambitious drama from 9 out of 10.
