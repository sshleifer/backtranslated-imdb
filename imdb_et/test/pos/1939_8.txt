River's Edge is more than just a story of murder. This is the accusation of apathy wave that has plagued young pockets for decades. Our main characters are a group that my high school would have called "stoners". One of them simply decided to strangle her girlfriend, because she probably had a nerve to "talk sh * t" to her. This dangerous young man, played by Daniel Roebuck, is intense, which amazes you. She takes the other kids in the group to show them her girlfriend's body, and oddly, no one seems to be out of it. The balance of the film balances the desperate circumstances of those people and how the guilt is eventually able to move into even those apathetic children. <br /> <br /> The River Edge is definitely not condemning or honoring their characters for its characters. We clearly see the dangers of such a controlled apathy and only the desire for drunkenness or high. We are shown that these children have an insecure life, and maybe it is meant to explain their terrible behavior. But can it be just an unstable home that leads to this type of destructive life? Crispin Glover is his usual attacked by himself. He rides the city after full paranoia after murder. He strives for compassion because his friend had to commit a crime, but he clearly does not understand what a young man might have done. Dennis Hopper plays an older man whom these children get. Although he is certainly a rebellious figure, he cannot be associated with the apathy and rage of the younger generation. Recognize your confusing reaction when Roebuck describes how his girlfriend killed him. The nature of Hopper is as natural as he knows that this young man should not drive on the ground. <br /> <br /> What do you think about these children? Well, it really is not possible to like their characters. Some of them are less despicable than others, but you can't help them with hatred or mischief. Twenty years later, many young people still have apathy alive and well. When are these kids wrong? What makes so many of them want to act against social issues? This film, and the questions asked by her teenagers, will stay with you for a while. This is a fact. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
