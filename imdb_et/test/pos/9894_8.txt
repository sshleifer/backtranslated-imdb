Peter Falk shines at the burst of a 90-year-old Morris Applebaum, a patriarch who has decided it is time to review after the final. His three children, Lauran San Giacomo, David Paymer and Judge Reinhold, are notified by letter and are immediately invited to reach their eccentric father. Laura San Giacomoga has a great father / daughter chemistry whose character happens most of the time. This is a well-rounded example of your average, uncertain family and their memories, pains, growth, and ignorance / tolerance towards each other's lives. The musical result is one you enjoy and one lining is well timed and fun. Although I found the actual Checking Out party, the rest of the movie is definitely a laugh, a cry and a theater smile. Move over "Big Fat Greek Wedding" .... has arrived "Big Fat Jewish Suicide".
