My young aunt is unique in many ways. First, it is the first feature film of Hui Ya-Hung (Kara Hui). Another He actually did the fighting scenes after the operation that had been done for him a few days before filming. Third, this film is out of the chain. <br /> <br /> The film is started by Wang Lung Wei, who is trying to take the inheritance from his brother. His brother then has to marry Kara, so Wang can't take treasures. The story is pretty good, bringing everything to the right place. <br /> <br /> When I say that this is not already said or even a great butcher for the victims of such films or for the 36th House disciple. Fighting scenes is what selling a movie, and it has no problem doing it. Liu Chia Liang and Wang Lung Wei dealt with the fight you have to believe. Why these two men have not won over each other, but over me. <br /> <br /> I don't want to really spoil anything, but you have to see your young aunt to get excited. My only handle is that Yuen Taki wasn't used as widely as he used in 3 Evil Masters, or even the Invincible Pole Fighter (8 Diagram Pole Fighter) to see great movies. 9.2 / 10
