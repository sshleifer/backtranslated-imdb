Like all the very old movies, this "movie" is very short - it takes about one minute! Therefore, because of this brevity, it is not really possible to compare it with more modern films. But for this time, it is actually a very remarkable movie. Most of this is because the prints were hand-painted - making Annabelle red and other colors because she does her amazing dance. I've actually seen two different versions - one where he's red and the other he's changing color. I think the red depicted on the DVD "Big Train Robbery and Other Primary Work" is the best of them. Dance itself is very hypnotic and resembles amazing art. And unlike other one-minute (or less) days of movies, this one I have repeatedly seen is just visual and weird. <br /> <br /> If you want to see it online, it's a 36-second version of Google Video (type "serpentine dance").
