I don't see how this quality film gets an average of 5.7 on IMDb voters. This is a classic Australian production that resembles recent efforts such as LOVE AND OTHER DISEASES, SUGAR TECHNOLOGY, EXISTING LANGUAGE, RUSSIAN DOLL, SAMPLING PEOPLE, US SECRET LIFE, LA SPAGNOLA, STRANGE PLANET, FRESH AIR, VEHICLE OUTDOOR PATSY CLINIC, etc., 19 -year-old, unique student (Newton, perhaps his best role, at least CHANGI), the over-religious mother gets shocked when she decides to enroll in the same course as her - and before you think of another MOVIE MOVIE here is the real content. Of course, this is a simplified view of life in general and of art students in particular (but then they are quite simple on all philosophical mumbo-jumbods?) . The principle cast is terrible: Cusack and Newton are wonderful and Rose Byrne (see him also in 1967 GOD) is so underrated that it is not funny. He is a beautiful, fresh and confident actor who deserves every recognition. I gave MY Mother 8/10.
