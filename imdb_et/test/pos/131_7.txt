A pretty interesting look at some of India's growing middle-class characters. Although India is rapidly modernizing, its culture is not constantly known. This film includes a patriarchal society where women are not yet truly free citizens. The land of organized marriages, men who punish with perfect impunity, and women who expect it to endure will eventually come to a short time. I had an impressive Nandita Das who was quite attractive and played his character completely seriously. But I was even more impressed by Shabana Azmi, whom I understand, is Bollywood's long-standing contest. His silent beauty and mild psychic suffering were excellent. The lesbian subtitle of this movie was never erotic and never titrating. (Darn!) Look for those who are interested in a wide variety of cultures.
