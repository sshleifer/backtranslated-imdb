I didn't feel the film until I saw that it had recently included the top 20 spaghetti soldiers. (After the marathon I made them in the last few weeks in the sub-section); then it was very good that the film had to come up on Italian television almost late at night (for the first time, I'm pretty sure in good years)! Unfortunately, the reception of this channel cable to which it was transmitted is not very good lately: I recorded the VHS movie but decided not to keep it because of this factor; As it happened, the next day, watching the movie, I saw that it was available from Italy's 2nd Region DVD (where there was an interview with unauthorized scriptwriter Ernesto Gastaldi) - and having impressed enough, I decided to order there and then, even if I knew that I won't be going to the DVD for quite some time if I like to miss one movie and the next! Here are the short brackets: when I recently bought the west coasts of spatulas on an Italian DVD, I decided not to order Sergio Sollima FACE TO FACE (1967) because I had the impression that it was a bare bones thing; but I've just learned that the disc actually contains interviews with the director (as it was bought with THE BIG GUNDOWN [1966]). It seemed to me that Sollima did not make the same contribution to the DVD edition of this film when he considered his favorite work for FACE TO FACE (as the director's talent bio added to the Blue Underground Region for one disc yet another Sollima Spaghetti) in the West - RUN, MAN, RUN [1968 ]); The problem is that I loved the Great GUNDOWN so much that I followed it through FACE TO FACE, which was part of the Italian TV! I ordered the DVD for this movie now - especially since it's still discounted - but as I said about POWER POWER at another glance (though I can still review Sollima's interview when the disc arrives) ... <br /> <br /> OK, filthy: The movie we are watching is quite unusual in the West Spaghetti and a very interesting, indeed ambitious one, which is the transfer of JFK's murder case into the old western setting! In fact, it resembles Anthony Mann's black and white thriller THE TALL TARGET (1951), which dealt with a murder attempt in the USA. President Abraham Lincoln. This is one of the most popular Italian stars of this subtype, Giuliano Gemma, which is probably his most impressive role in Western countries (many of his other films tend to be light-weight). The supportive selection consists of at least two other characters: Van Johnson (with one of his few and most remarkable Italian films), as the American President killed in the post-civil war Dallas and Fernando Rey, the southern conspiracy leader, who not only prints his murder, but also maneuvers the new US leader Johnson's Vice President by extortion! Benito Stefanelli also makes a good impression as a corrupt sheriff who deals with Gemma through the whole picture and with whom he is dealing with a few times in the dark, where the weapons rely on the floor rather than their respective bags and the only light in the room provided by the cowboys cigars! Ray Saunders is also involved as a Gemma black tie, which eventually ends up as a scary "Lee Harvey Oswald". Behind the luminous cinematography of the film is Stelvio Massi, who later cut his teeth as director, with many poliziotteschi; Likewise, Luis Enrique Bacalov is delivering another large "Euro-Cult" score, which is quite different from Ennio Morricone's style, so it is equally distinctive. Valery's direction here may be as it is in other western countries of Spaghetti, but he handles enough procedures (the last bomb attack is especially well done); the film is certainly one of the sub-ratings in the subheading, and for those who are so inclined, the novelty of the line alone should do it.
