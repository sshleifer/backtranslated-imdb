Robert McKimson's Acrobatty Bunny is one of the director's best shorts. Although the circus-based setting can create harsh memories of McKimson's terrible "Big Top Bunny", Acrobatty Bunny is actually almost boring like travesty. Bugs Bunny's hitting a wild lion is fresh and funny from the start, not to mention a very attractive look. There's a classic scene where Bugs takes his hole through a strangled lift just to get out of the lion's jaws. Brilliant Disney parody hollers "Pinocchio" lion throat! This brilliant opening is a sign of the future. Initially, the lion in the cage and its surroundings has some expertly choreographic antiques, followed by a fun grotesque and irritating "Laugh Clown Laugh" transfer that I used as a child on a regular basis! All this culminates in a short acrobatic sequence that gives the comic a name. I have never loved the circus because it is a caricature device and finds it usually a boring and predictable set of gags, but "Acrobatty Bunny" breaks the mold and the result is a very funny short that is McKimson's best.
