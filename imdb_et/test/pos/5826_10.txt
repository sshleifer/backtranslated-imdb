This exhibition contains everything the prison drama could ever want. In the end, the season is over. The characters are very strong and it gives a lot of power to exhibitions. When you look at the exhibition, you know not only the prisoners, but the prison staff. Actors who play in prison at the exhibition have done a very good job of imprisonment. Also, if you like law and order svu or law and order criminal intent, there are many actors at this show. The only problem with Oz is that it wasn't long enough. This exhibition can easily be from nine to ten years without getting old. Even after the end of the season I find that I watch Oz all the time on DVD. This exhibition is just one of the best TV shows. Don't be stupid, see Oz.
