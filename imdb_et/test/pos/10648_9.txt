This film is a benchmark for non-mainstream cinema history. The use of assembly is a quantitative leap from the relatively simple deviations of Strike (Eisenstein's 1st film). Take the scene to the steps and repeatedly mark the soldiers falling down to repeat the horror that really happened! A very intelligent monumental film, you must see all the film students!
