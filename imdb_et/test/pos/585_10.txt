"Why are there so many songs on the rainbow and on the other side?" Kermit presents this relatively simple double poll at the beginning of "Muppet Movie", singing his signature song "The Rainbow Connection". As time goes on, the question and the film will only become quite big. <br /> <br /> I give up this movie as a children's comedy, but I look at it as a classic for generations of love with serious ideals and a warm-hearted message that gives more heat each year. <br /> <br /> Since the milestones in my life are rising up from me, I hear more and more of this elementary ditty-like strain and realize that it can match someone's life as we all dream. And that's the movie. It's not just a bunch of dolls - it's a bunch of dolls that have the strength to continue their dreams, which is a good lesson for everyone. <br /> <br /> And while the film's humor and wonder are always good, they are not a fair judge of the film. Only "Rainbow Connection" and the powerful emotions he understands. And that's all: "Rainbow Connection" * is * Muppet Movie and vice versa. It is existentialism that corresponds to children's entertainment - it is not easier to describe.
