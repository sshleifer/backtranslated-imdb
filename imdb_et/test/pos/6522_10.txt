Fred was such a big show. It was easy, but somehow very addicting. I still remember the days when I watch it on Kids WB Saturdays, but then Kids WB did unforgivable.Kids WB got like this older relative who is trying to act "hip" and "funky fresh". * quake * They became like a relative who is trying all the cool to operate, but the test is a cheesy disaster. They pulled the coconut Fred's fruit salad inland and all the other good exhibitions to put some of the most meaningless exhibitions I've ever seen in my life (Johnny Test). The only thing that looks at KWB is the random bits of old exhibitions and 4-year-old anime. show the schedule. It brings me back to my first point ... BACK!
