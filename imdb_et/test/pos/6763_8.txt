It's a wonderful film about people. Weird people. Everyone in the movie has a very tragic past, so they all have their own problems. Their problems develop in a way that makes the plot of the film very absurd; but it does not make the film worse, but better because it is beaten in a way similar to fantasy, so nothing is real. This review may seem a bit strange, but then again, the movie is not quite normal ... It's also a fun movie in many cases. If you haven't seen it, look at it. Enjoy!
