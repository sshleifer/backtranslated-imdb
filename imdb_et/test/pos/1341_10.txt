When I was five years old, it was my favorite TV show. I remembered it was at 11:00 am every day at 11 am. The premise of the exhibition was the simplest with Carole and Janis than the hostesses of this children's TV show. They sang songs and read stories as children. This was done in the studio, where there were only 54 episodes that were broadcast again and again. I remember Sherlock, a doll, inside a tree. The exhibition taught us how to read, add, subtract and alphabet. Thirty minutes a day I learned something new with Paula and Janis. I remember these days as pleasant memories, and now I hope that today's children can learn to love the simplest things, such as hearing stories, cheap props, riding a swing and talking to dolls. The set was perfect and simple, but Carole and Janis did it at the same time. I miss my childhood and those days where the most important thing was to look at the magic garden. Life seemed so much easier and better. Now I hope the children will enjoy the show today.
