As I have said in the title of this review, I say that, but "engagement" comes to what Hollywood's romantic comedies are ever hoping for. I've been both a critic of the genre and a namesake as long as I remember myself, but with a tragic remark, "Hitch" has caused me to spend somewhere in my life in a two-hour neighborhood with a ridiculous smile plastered over my face. <br /> <br /> This film can sometimes be uneven and pointless, but it still has some humor, which can only be British. It's a wonderful Hollywood attempt to make (or recompile) a movie that invites all of us to a romantic comedy that can both think and laugh at the same time. I give this film out of 10 out of 10 ... ... something you almost can't see to make romantic comedy in the near future, or at least I hope.
