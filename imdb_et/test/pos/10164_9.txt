I put this second version of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" on my Top 10 Hitchcock movies. Together with "Frenzy", this is probably the most controversial film among Hitchcock fans. I think it is much better than saying "Rebecca", which has gained an unreasonable amount of recognition. <br /> <br /> The film contains many brilliant scenes (most of them mentioned in other reviews), but it's something to expect from Hitchcock. It takes almost half an hour before things really happen, but this time is used to prepare for the next events, full of intriguing tension. <br /> <br /> If you can ignore the wrong projects, the only weakness of this movie is the main villain played by Bernard Miles, who is quite flat and undeveloped. Fortunately, Reggie Nalder is a horrible murderer. And the little boy Hank is not as irritating as most old movies.
