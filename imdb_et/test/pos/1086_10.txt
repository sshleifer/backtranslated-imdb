This is by far one of the best movies India has ever done. Here are the plus points of the movie ... <br /> <br /> Great direction, cinematography and editing, editing is very smooth and the timing of transitions is great. <br /> <br /> While the movie shows the lives of Mumbai police officers and their hardships, it will never be boring or likeable. <br /> <br /> Mind-blowing acts as the leader of actor Nana Patekar. We certainly hope that he will receive the best actors for Academy Awards. <br /> <br /> Controlled violence. Violence is controlled and the film does not become a bloody mess. <br /> <br /> There are no foolish songs like in normal Indian movies. <br /> <br />
