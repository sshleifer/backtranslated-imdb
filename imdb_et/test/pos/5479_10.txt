It is a perfectly designed top-of-the-line Washington thriller led by talented Wolfgang Petersen, whose screenwriter is Jeff Maguire (who has done very little over the years so that he may tend to have his own roses). In the film, Clint Eastwood is an agent of an aging secret service, and John Malkovich is an avenging assassin who is opposed to mass testing and inventiveness, where the life of the president is at stake. Unnecessary secrecy and competition between competing security authorities almost deny the President, who is authentic. This film was made at the top of both Eastwood and Malkovich. Probably Eastwood has never done a better job than he does here, and it's so easy for an old pro. He has wonderful sound effects that collide and swell when he runs with the President's car as a bodyguard for which he is too old. I don't know if anyone else has noticed that the humor of these sounds has been added. My "watchdog", whose name is Vigil, enjoyed the movie even more than I did, but then the bodyguard films are very his thing. Rene Russo was the perfect choice for a female agent who falls against Eastwood because she is so obvious, but talented, and she looks. This story is tense every inch of the way, and Eastwood's psychological struggles to fail from past protection have obviously been shown by his typical underrated action. With Eastwood, if he raises eyebrows by millimeter, be careful! Of course he is a super-cool master. Malkovich has the opportunity to get rid of everything he may want in a paranoid way, and he takes the center of man empty. What is good.
