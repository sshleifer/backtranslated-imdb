Jewel Thief is one of those temporary thrillers where viewers are kept up to the end who is a villain. The thrill is built from the first scene, when the gemstone becomes a national problem, and the movie has cleverly hidden clues to guess who is a gemstone. The story shows that Dev Anand (Vinay in the movie) and the jewel have the same faces. But you get a 1,000-fold shock when you finally know the criminal. There are a lot of surprises and a lot of bad things, but there is time for romance and six melodic, ever-lasting songs sung by Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Kishore Kumar and Mohmmad Rafi. <br /> <br /> This movie was also talking about his song videos. Think of the temptation and shock of bullying in Asman Ke Neeche. Or blocking roads by Dev Anand when Tanuja went with friends to Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara. Or romantic Dil Pukare is a beautiful Sikkimas. Or a wonderful dance that was made by Vytautas the Hotho Pe Aisi Baat. Add it to Rulake Gaya Sapna Mera and Raat Akeli Hain and you will not forget this movie for some reason. <br /> <br /> You can act by Dev Anand, Ashok Kumar, Tanuja, and Vy mightima and guide Vijay Anand (Dev Anand's younger brother) to make it one of the most loved Hindi films of all time.
