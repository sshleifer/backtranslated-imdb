Forget the plot of this movie. Forget it is wonderful Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Forget the fact that this is one of the few films starring Jennifer Lopez that I can stomach. Although the story that is impossible to believe and a large part of the dialogue seems to be viable, it is only important to remember that when you watch this movie, it contains some amazing and disturbing images that have ever been put on film. Just as Salvador Dali decided to make a crime drama. Must see cinematography seriously interested in using a film application as a canvas to display the actual works of fine art. I should give this movie 9/10 for this amazing visual display.
