The sexy murderer Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) still misses a married blessing with her former boyfriend, mad killer Charles 'Chucky' Lee Ray. After receiving the damaged Good Guy doll, who last played his spirit and made repairs, he makes a satanic ritual that returns his life to the toy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, for bad people, Tiff, a redesigned maniac, does not show marriage, and so he tries to catch him in a cage, a bride's doll. In the end, the rather angry Chucky (Brad Dourif) escapes from his borders, flowing in the Tiffanyni bath and catching his soul behind his "bride". <br /> <br /> Realizing that they are now both the same contradiction, the plastic couple set their differences apart and decided to lead the New Jersey Hackensack, where they can place their hands in a magical amulet that can relocate their spirits to human hosts. Jesse (Nick Stabile) and his delightful girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl) are being taken to their destination, psycho-dolls begin to rape the murderer, their unwanted companions blame. <br /> <br /> Although the idea that a child's doll is in the spirit of a mass exterminator has always been quite comical, it wasn't until the fourth child's feature filmmaker completely anticipated the inconvenience of space, choosing to play things much more laughs than intimidation (although we still have lots of OTT drunk to enjoy gore-hounds). <br /> <br /> Talented Hong Kong leader Ronny Yu follows the procedures by wisely interpreting the language. -Language for a smooth and thoroughly enjoyable movie tour of the script. Similarly, the bearings of the excellent cast handle are perfectly combined with Stabile and Heigl, which makes a nice pair, but smoking hot Tilly steals the show as a blonde, buxom, pout, PVC mini-skirt temple tiffany. Kevin Yagher's impressive expressive puppet effect goes to such a long film success. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is unlikely to find a lot of serious fear enthusiasts, but those who enjoy the strange at times of frantic popcorn accommodation, twisted, black humor, a crazy death scene, and splendid splits should be a blast.
