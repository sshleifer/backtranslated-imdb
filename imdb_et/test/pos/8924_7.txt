This film was clearly an early attempt to create a new director, but still managed to be original and entertaining, and at some moments of thought. But I have to say that this story wouldn't have come without Paul Anthony's Pipi star performance. He made well-written parts very credible and influential, and the weaker parts are much more tolerable. I must also mention the activities of Alani Cumming. It was refreshing to see him in such a part. He played a role that gave the film a very solid foundation. Like Paul Anthony: Who is this man? Why haven't I seen him anymore? Someone gives him more roles, please!
