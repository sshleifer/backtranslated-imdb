This film is a random cable, and I never saw it, I thought it would be similar to Bruce Willis's "American" movie, which ordinary trick story about American freedom, etc. But it wasn't; it was so much!. <br /> <br /> Of course, Martin Sheen is great; (I've never loved seeing her in a movie, even if the script is bad because she's so talented). Kathy Bates is an overwhelming mother and does a good job. The real surprise is Emilio Estevez, who has not always been in the biggest films, but also directed the film. Please do not stereotype her from the "Breakfast Club" movie; he is much better at it and I want him to do more non-commercial, atypical Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> The film is realistic as we see from Emilio's home in Vietnam during the Thanksgiving Day. Kimberly Williams is a sister who feels like a soldier, her brother; he is quite alienated from his family, and especially in the current history of the US, this story is very relevant. <br /> <br /> I learned a lot about post-traumatic stress and you really know it; This is not a violent, journalistic image, such as "Plato", it is a character study that leaves us even more interesting and concerned about the consequences of war, especially when considering the age of young soldiers who are victims. With today's violence, it is rare that the film causes true sadness and tears; it does it and deserves recognition.
