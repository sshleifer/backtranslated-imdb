The film is not for everyone. Some may think it is bad if it is actually underestimated and natural. There are obviously no evil deeds and no strangely beautiful moments. There's a lot of indecision, a lot of contradictory feelings. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film looks very honestly on a very difficult topic, Sex with Minors. It is complicated because the characters try to deal with love and sex when his body and hormones are still evolving and both their minds and personalities are still developing. The complex is also because society has very simple views and complications of juvenile sex, because the characters do not know if society is right or if their instincts are right. <br /> <br /> Some don't like the movie because it leaves unanswered questions. Issues such as those who were really responsible for those who were harmed did so well, whether it was an art that was more damaged, whether some of the problems related to their relationship stem from the fact that society denied it, some the problems are caused by their own immaturity and probably the most important, was it really a crime? <br /> <br /> Film is decisively neutral in this respect, and it is this neutrality that is its strength. This is due to underestimated action, simple sets, lack of background music, soft lighting and a general "flat" presentation. The message is clear. We do not understand such a relationship today and quick decisions are definitely low.
