Looking back at Alfred Hitchcock's career, it is never surprising how such a brilliant and visionary person cannot be recognized enough when he was revolutionary for the film industry. It is probably a sign of how Hitchcock was in front of his era, always trying to draw an envelope and never slip with a film made just for entertainment, but always with its deeper and more toxic motif. On a foreign train, one of Hitchcock's first and undervalued hits, it is a great example of these qualities - an entertaining and halting story, even if viewed more than 50 years later, yes, but so carefully and intelligently built that it is now a masterpiece in filmmaking. It is said to be one of the pioneers of the foreign trains, who are somewhat obsolete in certain aspects, but retains all the slightly well-designed tensions, as it was in 1951. a little more shocking). The brilliant use of cinematic and lighting and fast, careful editing is what makes the film shine by pulling out all the tension and keeping the audience focused on even slower scenes. If there had been any doubt about what the masterly filmmaker Hitchcock was, then just five minutes on the train of strangers should be enough to deny such feelings; each shot is so carefully selected and designed to bring the story to a very innovative level. Unfortunately, the story at some moments far enough away from our focus on excellent cinematography and editing - Bruno, who is able to reach the sewer grid, is simply incredible and is a stereotypical old man who climbs wildly under the carousel and offers unintentional comedy relief , which is designed to be the most intense and interesting film scene. These are just short moments, but they are weak enough, otherwise with a star movie. <br /> <br /> But what really makes strangers out of the train is the story. When Hollywood films are in danger of falling inevitably beyond and beyond the clichés, it is a wonderful refreshing to see a 50-year-old film, which is actually made smart and original. Of course, this is quite simple, but the term "exchange of murders" is just one that would not fly in today's and age movies, which makes it even more interesting to watch; The brilliant scenario of the movie keeps the action at a fast pace, always offering great memorable features. But the deeper themes of Hitchcock can not only be noticed, especially the concept of "darkness in the heart of humanity", which is demonstrated by elderly women who are fascinated and inspired by the prospect of murder, as well as Bruno's own cavalier attitude towards death. Hitch also works in many dark humor (Bruno beats his cigarette with a baby balloon priceless) and irony, capturing tense scenes in happy, easily developing environments, such as iconic carnival scenes, to create a more scary atmosphere. It may be a temporary thriller, yes, but ignoring the hidden brain below would simply be unforgivable. <br /> <br /> Bruno's antagonistic figure (Robert Walker's failed perfection essay, which is unfortunately the role of his last film but easily stole his admittably very talented companionship film) is undoubtedly what makes strangers on the train so memorable, this character is admiration. Here we have just a perfectly designed criminal, the more interesting it looks like ordinary and uncomfortable. Instead of breaking the madman and the hero at every possible moment, Bruno is a calm, controlled, psychotic confusion. He speaks of murder in such dark shades, but keeps a passionate glow when discussing the different fashion of killing people. Bruno could seem like "Id", as Freud put it, the inner, darker and more unobtrusive aspects of humanity. This makes it an interesting contrast to the hero, Guy Haines, and how he sees the suck and uninteresting, almost like going home, that the evil outlook is much more interesting and tempting than the constant pursuit of doing the right thing. Despite this implicit message, Hitch still has enough feelings to turn to Guy every time and rejoice for every new obstacle he is forced to overcome. It is the talent of actor actor Farley Granger that, despite Robert Walker's offender, who is just stealing an exhibition, the Granger hero is still worthwhile, still in our support, even if we fall victim because it is much less effective. Excellent support from Ruth Roman, who is able to overcome clichés and be more innovative and more complicated in romantic interest, Kasey Rogers, giving an excellent result to Guy's terribly manipulative and hedonistic first woman and Patricia Hitchcock, which proves that she is much more talented than just a "director's daughter "would mean. An excellent (just a wonderful Walker-driven cast) cinema pulls the movie to life, adding much more value to the movie than just the breathtaking style of Hitchcock. First of all, strangers can still be too outdated for some viewers, but it is still a shock if the modern and modern audience likes it. Given that it appeared half a century ago. Once again, Hitchcock proves its unparalleled tension and film technique, and the film's surprisingly original and enjoyable premise is worth it alone. Recommended for anyone who wants to make great but great fun movie experiences! <br /> <br /> -9/10
