I don't need to repeat Glenn's summary. The black-and-white rendition is even more powerful than depicting the darkness of the country's village life at that time. Babette's deep friendship with two older sisters touches the heart strings. Supporting cast is excellent and their performances are excellent, it would not be fair to point out any sign because the whole story depends on the pain as a whole. I can't justify my finger exactly why I appreciate this movie because I'm not a professional critic; individual viewers can agree with my assessment because enjoying this type of movie is always in the eyes of the viewer.
