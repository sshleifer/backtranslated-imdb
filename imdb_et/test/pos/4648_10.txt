Hope that and how can I deal with it? <br /> <br /> This movie is classic and mature, laughs, adventure and all stars, 80's! <br /> <br /> What happens when you collect a group of jocks and sororiety, a group discussing nerds, a band of misfits and a couple of couselors? <br /> <br /> Loads of laughs that get you more! <br /> <br /> David Naughton stands for Adam, a "yellow team" leader, a kind and hip college advisor who helps students with everything from classes they want for the first days. <br /> <br /> His nemesis is Harold's "Blue Team" manager, who played the fun of Stephen Furst's "Babylon 5" celebrity, a rich, ex-college jock boy with enough trophies to make any fanfare jealous. Pit these two against each other and throw "red team", "white team" and "green team", incredible "view" in the observatory, consequences of cheating on miniature golf, super tour Pabst B Read the Ribbon brewery and angry An old landlord among other adventures, and you have everything memorable at night! <br /> <br /> Look for Michael J. Fox, Eddie Deezen and director Andy Tennant's performances in one of the latest films he did before becoming a director, and you have all the star, fun, cast. <br /> <br /> The only aspect of this film was Debra Clinger's performance as Laura. He was terribly over, but the rest of the movie is so good that he is simply ignored. <br /> <br /> I am the owner of this movie and can never be seen enough! <br /> <br />
