My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it first appeared. The controversy surrounding the original edition (teenage nudity, physical intimacy, and unwanted pregnancy) were topics that did not touch our film's views. We were of the same age as Paul and Michelle, and we experienced many of the same intense and confusing emotions. We were too young to get into simple (at times) acting and corporate (at times) emotional appeals. This movie told us that the story of adult love could never be. I still remember sitting in my cinemas with my girlfriend and holding my hand as she starved during the tragic (albite syrup) final scene.
