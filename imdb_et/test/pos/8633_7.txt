Having read so many negative media about this film over the years, I would have always avoided it, but the emergence of cheap public DVDs finally encouraged me to look. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it has been transferred from a bad copy. Today's prequel, captured in a tinted store, is blurry and contrasting, which is absent. The face is occasionally hard to do. Having said that the real story is entertaining and Lou has filled up as an actor, it is more so in the films of many boys. <br /> <br /> When a movie turns into a 'Jack' story, the movie switches to 'color' and I use that concept loosely. Most tones are orange or brown. Greens are particularly bad. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Ford is a "big" giant maid, a big plus because I enjoyed her early "Andy Hardy" look. <br /> <br /> With so many negative comments that have been put down to the actual quality of the publication, I am still delighted to give this movie 7. It gave me a lot of laughter and it is more than most of the comedies I've been watching for decades can be managed. <br /> <br /> One way to see if you get this opportunity.
