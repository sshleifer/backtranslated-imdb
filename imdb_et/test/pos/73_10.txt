Yes, I am a romantic who loves musicals and comedy, and it fits the bill! Julie Andrews gives a "Whistling in the Dark" production number at the beginning and end of this movie. The sedate-to-outrousous number that he performs in the middle of the story when he believes that Rock Hudson has seen the dance / call girl is striking and will make you sure to strangle. <br /> <br /> I just want this movie to be found on video or DVD because I would definitely buy it for my home experience with a heartbeat!
