For the first time I saw this movie, it didn't look like anywhere. When I looked at it a second time, it made much more sense. Give her the opportunity, look at it more than once, there are many key elements that shape the story that could be missed first and even the second time. Cohen's brothers tell the story of the beginning of the 20th century in this story to make a credible device and story. The combination of Clooney's leading role is well suited to support Turturro and Nelson. John Goodman's appearance in the movie is fun. The sound track is also great. This movie has become my family's favorite. 10/10, sure.
