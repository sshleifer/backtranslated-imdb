I can say that every time I see CONRACK, dir. Martin Ritt, DP. John Alonzo, I feel extremely inspired and enlightened by the power of cinema in such a simple film. <br /> <br /> The 1968 film Conrack. It is based on a real story. This is a story of a white man (Jon Voight) who teaches a group of young black children when the incredible world is outside their small South Carolina island. <br /> <br /> The story is rooted in the noble reason for the teacher's work to change children's lives. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
