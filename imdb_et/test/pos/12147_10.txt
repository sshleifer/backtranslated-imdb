I saw this film at the Telluride Film Festival in 1997, which honored one of the screenwriters, Jos√© Giovanni. It is a very big performances of Noir crime drama, incredible Belmondo and Lino Ventura. Attention is paid to every character and sophisticated psychological images detailed in loyalty, betrayal, love and hope. It's a great drama, a great thriller and a great movie. There's the best Melville. ("Class all risk" in French is "Classe Touriste", meaning "economy class").
