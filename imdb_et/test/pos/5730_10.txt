Many of us who went through high school probably did this without having to take a physics course - I know I didn't. But after watching this program, I definitely wish I had. <br /> <br /> This documentary is a guide to the "Holy Grail of Physics" - an attempt to unite all the core forces of the universe into one "unified equation." "That Einstein's life in the last few years. Brian Green, Professor at Columbia University, introduces us to the theory of blowing this mind in a wonderfully simple way and gives us even greater recognition of the universe in which we live. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the embarrassing "masterpiece" that could connect and explain everything ... * everything! * In this universe, including the four main forces we know there are: electromagnetism, strong nuclear forces, weak nuclear forces and gravity. Green takes us on a tour of how Newton, then Einstein, and then the quantum-level physics revolution introduced our understanding of the universe. <br /> <br /> At this point, we are confronted with a problem that has plagued physicists for years, and one that no one has yet been able to solve. How can we unite all the forces we know together? We find Green as always pointing out the whole problem that the answer to this amazing problem can be in the theory of strings. However, if we want to describe the universe in string theory, there is a huge price to pay. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the numbering of the string theory is a mathematical equation that, as a result, we think we could live in a universe that is full, not just the three dimensions that you and I see every day plus 1 (time but rather that we actually live in the * 11 * universe dimensions. But mathematics from this theory does not end there - there is a possibility that there may be parallel universes; some of them are near you and me! Could we take such a theory, which will bring such consequences seriously? As Green notes; we are not yet fully aware, but we know that the mathematics generated from these equations already show us that the universe still has much to show us. <br /> <br /> For those who are afraid you can't understand the concepts of this program - don't be afraid. Professor Green is doing an excellent job of losing his mathematics and heavier concepts of physics and focuses more on the * concept *, which, when you take it all out of this mathematics, becomes incredibly easy for a monster beast, and green constantly refers to the "elegant" concept. Viewers of this program do not need a background in science; the concepts are so simple even if the child understands them. <br /> <br /> When you finish this program, you really understand what a wonderful and mysterious universe is that we live.
