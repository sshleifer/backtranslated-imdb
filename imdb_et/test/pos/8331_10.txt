A great "documentary" about how scientists believed dinosaurs behaved has hit some of the most prominent CGIs from Jurassic Park. Made absolutely serious, like the prehistoric episode "Nation Geographic". Grab your attention from the first frame and never let it go. My favorite thing was when Diplodocus fights for Allosaurus. <br /> <br /> 10 stars. That's what science is about.
