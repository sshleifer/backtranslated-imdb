I learned the thing: you need this movie like a funny period of comedy if you don't want to be disappointed. The film is enjoyable because it is a delicious comedy. I think the excess leap has damaged it: too much glorified Monica Bellucci appears in a couple of scenes and isn't as good as they wanted to believe you. She sounds unnatural, wrong: the best actor in this movie is Sabrina Impacciatore, who talks about the perfect Tuscan accent and looks like Massimo Ceccherini. Elio Germano is very, very good: I think the most promising young Italian actress is. Daniel Auteuil looks like Napoleon, but I preferred other participants. So the worst performances were the worst. <br /> <br /> Costumes and production design are okay: sure that American timing movies are more accurate about these things because they have bigger budgets, but the ability of Italy to reward it for lack of money. A nice period of comedy, in short, with first-rate pain (except Bellucci and Auteuil).
