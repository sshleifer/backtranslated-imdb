Though all the Fleischer / Famous Studios "Superman" cartoons are great, "Billion Dollar Limited", which is in the third series, is probably the best in animation, plot and temple. Why it wasn't even the best animated short for the Oscar in 1942 (Incredibly Enough, Only the First was) inexplicable. <br /> <br /> Here is Lois Lane assigned to cover one billion transfers. dollars in gold to US Mint. The masked gangsters came to their super-powerful (1942) car ride after the train, deciding to get it. Without going too far, this is an exciting journey for both characters and audiences, with truth, justice and Superman. <br /> <br /> As they did in all the Fleischer / Famous Superman cartoons, Clayton "Bud" Collyer and Joan Alexander, who played Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane, have won a voice here and Fleischer's multi-year Jack Mercer gets also one of the bad guys.
