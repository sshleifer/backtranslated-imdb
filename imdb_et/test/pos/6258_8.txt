This little flick resembles a number of other movies, but can maintain its style and mood. Remember "Troll" and "Don't be afraid of the blind". The interlocutors were good and just crossed the line from G to PG. I especially enjoyed the freedom of choice of parents; in other movies, I can predict the dialogue literally, but writing this film made better choices. If you want a movie that is not tough but gives you chills, this is a great choice.
