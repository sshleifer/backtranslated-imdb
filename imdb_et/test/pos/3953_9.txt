James Franco is totally cool in this movie. Not only beautiful and charismatic, but truly open and vulnerable. When Tristan was screening, some people were behind their back, being pouted and tangled and doing the whole James Dean thing, but I don't think it's true. Blind Spot shows the positive impact of his huge talent. In this film, he carries a completely different nature. This is a unique performance. Bittersweet and really moving. The lines of his magazine cut you a knife. You know a sharp observation behind your words. Tone is everything. It carries it through the action and mid-term reviews, as well as the bad bits of miserable humor. I also like the other two participants. Blonde girl is absolutely proud and the man is hysterical with his twisted tough guy stoicism. Some criminals seemed a little sketched, but this is really a mini point. The film is absolutely sure and Franco is so cool.
