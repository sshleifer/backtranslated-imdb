I haven't seen this movie since 1979 when I was a teenager. I grew up with the Sesame Street Cups and later realized how much effort and time it took to bring their characters to life. Jim Hensen was a genius and a master artist. When I was watching this movie the other day, he took time back when I was younger and things seemed so much easier. For this time, I appreciate this movie by 10. Laughs and gags are classic muppetism. I'm glad that these movies are still for the next generation. I hope I never do the magic of the muppets.
