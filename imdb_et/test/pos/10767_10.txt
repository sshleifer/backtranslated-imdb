I participated in the screening of the 2006 Woodstock Film Festival "Fierce People". I hesitated to label it as "premiere" because it was shot in spring 2004 and its premiere in Tribeca in 2005. He played several festivals this year. The release seemed shortly, then disappeared. Poof. Missing. Or it appeared to the public appearing on the film. At the moment, rumors of a theater or DVD show have appeared, but all have proved to be unjustified. Then the screening was announced. Maybe it can be called "a premiere again?" Certainly, I seemed to be witnessing a buried treasure. And what a treasure it was. <br /> <br /> I think "frightened people" could be described as an age drama. But it also has comedy and tragedy, but also a mystery. And a little farce that has been introduced. It makes it difficult for it to be harder, which puts it more in the indie category than in the Hollywood movie. However, its high production values, high budgeting and star-libraries are at odds with the indie label. So we call it a hybrid. And maybe that's why it's gone. It violates classification. <br /> <br /> Meet Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) with no father. In fact, Finland has never known him. But he sees him and listens to home videos sent from South America. The father is a well-known anthropologist and he has named himself a shop with a tribe of Yanoman, "Fierce People" who lives to kill and well. All of their activities are built around these two "tasks" and Finn is fascinated by it. Mom Liz (Diane Lane) is also somewhat absent. Although he is physically present, he disappears in the world of cocaine and alcohol. From Finland, an adult becomes his own small world with his film rolls. <br /> <br /> In the summer, Mom decides to drag her with New Jersey into the wild. The massage therapist, the mother, has taken care of the wealthy client, Ogden C. Osborne (Donald Sutherland, tour de force show) and has invited her to a longer household in her palace house. Osborne's "tribe" includes the selection of eccentric rich children, servants and village idiots, of whom Finns find themselves part of their anthropological research. Does his experience with his father's films help him survive as a visitor to this tribe? Will he be accepted? Or is he seen as a stranger who at the same time fights with his identity as a youth? This is the story of fairy tales, and I think it would be, if not in the dark underground that director Griffin Dunne and writer Dirk Wittenborn have brought to this great story. <br /> <br /> Father Yelchin's father's home video pieces, Finn must learn to go back to a teenager he could never have been, stop his mother as a parent, allow the newly sober mother to be his parent, and learn to take responsibility for becoming an adult as he did it had to happen. However, he must make it transformed into a dangerous, dark world where playing with fire is silly for this broken family. <br /> <br /> This is first and foremost a story-driven movie and Griffin Dunne emphasized so much in the introduction to the movie. He bought rights for the Wittenborne novel, even when it was written, and Wittenborne's own scenario lives in a masterful Dunne, so it's a miracle. <br /> <br /> It's also a character-driven film and Sutherland has never been better. His star turns around to Osborne, who surrounded them and is likely to be amazing. The character of Diane Lane finally showed so many personalities that it is hard to imagine another actor who pulled it out so well. He's breathtaking. But more than anything, "Fierce People" is Anton Yelchini's film. She has been a child-maker for a long time, but very little as I do. Except for the little-known "D" house (including the pearl), he is best known for his Byrdina TV "Huff". In January, she is seen in "Alpha Dog" (also sitting on the shelf since 2004, a film I saw at Sundance this year and where she is "heart and soul"). His performance here is much further than what one would expect from a young age and something not remarkable. "Acute people" is a treasure full of light and shade, comedy and tragedy, joy and sin, but most often do not know.
