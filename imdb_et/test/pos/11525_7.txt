Forty fathers, who were forty years old, thought that the film made compelling views - if not on the seat. I deserve a much higher rating than what it was writing 4.3. (I gave it 7.) <br /> <br /> I agree with some comments about the characters, but Cameron Diaz was once again a very different role. The plot was a bit stupid, but for me, the film's point was probably ultimate, quite surreal. A simple ending for any parent. <br /> <br /> I could imagine that a young, single tree can find the movie quite boring, but for other people who have not confirmed high doses, testosterone would find something sweet.
