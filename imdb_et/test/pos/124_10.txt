It was a great movie in every sense. It deals with the issue of tribadism in a society that is by no means a departure from the norm. He criticizes many Indian practices that many find oppressive - such as marriages by others, the importance of status and face, religious hypocrisy, sexism, women's assessment of their childcare capacity, binding concepts, and so on. At the heart of the film is the love story that goes beyond the limitations of society that the two main characters themselves find. The film has worked well and was genuine, completely believable from beginning to end, unlike most Bollywood films. The main mistakes of the film, as I saw, were first that two lovers seem to be opposed to each other, not necessarily to each other with a natural affinity, but to the fact that they are stuck in the impasse in their marriage without passion and not rewards. This may have a role in the sexual awakening of the characters, but most people who are stuck in the same situation are not "homosexual". It seems clear from the beginning of the film that the two characters are quite heterosexual - when Radha makes a scene with Aashok at the end of the film, he makes it quite clear that "he had died inadvertently" and that if he had wanted it, he could have made it completely to fill it completely and even when Sita seemed very disappointed when her husband didn't know her. Such situations do not make people homosexual - they can look for comfort in the same position as others, but it is not at all clear in the film that they are lesbians from the beginning - quite the opposite. Some people are bisexual, it is true, but most of them are either heterosexual or homosexual. The ladies in the film were both sensitive to the man. . . if that were not the case, would they naturally have found the need to express their wish in the relationship they would not otherwise have considered? The film ignores it. Another mistake is naming the characters. . . The names Sita and Radha seem to be deliberately shocked and annoyed (imagine a movie in America that shows a gay relationship with a man called "Jesus" and another called "Paul"!) using different Hindoo scriptures. The film is strong enough to stand alone and I don't think such devices are needed. Anyway, the bugs don't take much further than the movie's power. It's really a very moving and powerful story - images and characters will stay on the road long after leaving the theater.
