Just yesterday to see Monster Mani. It had been a long wait and after a lot of expectations and rebuilding, I was happy to say that it came out and met my expectations at every level. True, you can't really wait too much for the plot to deteriorate, but after reading some of the reviews, I was ecstatic. I mean, what would a fan of a trash bin not want to see, by mowing people with their own make-shift monster truck, by hiding hidden internal roots? I was waiting for a cross between Road Trip and The Hills Have Eyes and got so much more. It was a horror comedy that actually worked. The filmmakers got it right when they started to ridicule you and laugh at the same time. Weaving to Michael Davis that he went with everything and pushed the envelope with humor. Allow me to list just a few reasons why I love this movie so much: first it is a story. It has ended with so many other plagues. The son of the college gets the wind that his childhood breaks. He is a 25-year-old virgin he is, from his Vista Cruiser hops and decides to admit that he knows his love, hoping that he will fall on the head and the mountains and all their good Jews. There is a good friend of Harley hidden on the back of his wagons. Harley is a former friend who laughs and talks like Jack Black High Fidelity. You can't help but like a guy, but if he was your friend in real life, you need to keep a light ball bat (laughing all you want, but have you ever hit one?). So, he's a little unpleasant, at least say, but you can say he's a loyal friend, deep ... Anyway, they're on the road and when they stop at the bar, they deepen the locals. Now they are in a monster truck with a clone of leather. That's it. Yes, along the way when they get up, but I'm too lazy and hungry to go right there so just look at the fucking movie. <br /> <br /> Another thing I love was humor. It had a ridiculous smile from a movie from Cabin Fever. Just how confused is it? Well, I don't even go to the whole cat scene and for the "corpse burrito" I leave my virgin eyes too. The outpatient bar was somewhat disturbing and the man who looked like John Turturro struggled with me too. Harley, though a totally unpleasant frat-boy, can indeed pull one liner off. Of course, love blockages. I need a new pair. <br /> <br /> GORE. It pours it hard. If the first hour plays as a comedy on a demented road, the last third touches blood and guts. If the film hadn't kept such a bright tone, it would have been a bit annoying, but seeing how it all laughs is not possible for you to disturb it. If you're still in your seat, you'll probably see the humor in it, but seriously, there were buckets and buckets of red stuff. There was a big plot that I didn't see and when the credits rolled, I was completely satisfied. I was just what I came from, and I'm really glad I bought it. Like Cabin Fever, it gets a lot of repetition. <br /> <br /> The film's appearance was outstanding. It was a deliberately cheap look that made the whole thing fast in the late 80s and I loved the exaggerated colors. It is obvious that the Monster Man was made with a relatively low budget, but similar to Cabin Fever (sorry to compare these two), it works for the film. Cabin Fever was the 70's, it was the answer of the 80s to it. So take it for what's worth. There are no CGIs here. We all need it. I'm not quite sure why he didn't get a theater release because that's all Jeepers Creepers should have been. Thank God for the Lions Gate.
