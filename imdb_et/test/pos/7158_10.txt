I saw Franklin giving to Paramount and loved it. I have to be honest that I really didn't want to go and I was pretty tired of movies made today. I have to tell you that Franklin was talented and wonderful together I laughed at my ass, it was a great story that I couldn't believe two men shot it and put the whole thing together. I thought if these men could make that budget for such a movie, imagine what they could do with the big money. And then I thought it was a jailed man whom Iam studios would probably have. Thanks for the guys I lost and in my movie and that's why I'm going to the movies to forget the world for a few hours.
