A small town boy working in a big city becomes a big star and then a spiral. It will show you fame and then fall from fame and a little back. Actors and great director = great, great movie called Boogie Nights. <br /> <br /> Anderson. An amazing director who made Boogie Nights amazing. From the end of the movie to the end of the movie, you can feel how beautiful this film is. Some scenes are breathtaking, literally. Great story, great movie. Mark Whalberg was fantastic, Philip Seymour Hoffman was wonderful because he was in everything. Thomas Jane was also great, and although he only had a small part, he played it perfectly. In this movie, there is one scene that I can't overcome, "Drog Deal Gone Bad Scene" was amazing, combined with music performance and cinematography to make it amazing. I didn't see Boogie Nights and thanked God for being so rounded and I'm now a big fan of PTA (Paul Thomas Anderson). <br /> <br /> Do all you have to do and watch this movie.
