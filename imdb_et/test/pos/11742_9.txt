A beautifully interesting song with the same name as the movie won the Best Song Oscar in 1955. <br /> <br /> Love is a lot of brilliant things. <br /> <br /> This is the April rise that only rises in the Early Spring. <br /> <br /> Love is the way of life to live. <br /> <br /> The golden crown that makes the man king. <br /> <br /> Once upon a high and windy hill <br /> <br /> In the morning, two kisses blurred and loved the world. <br /> <br /> Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it to sing. <br /> <br /> Yes, true love is a much splendored affair. <br /> <br /> How we forget about such a beautiful song. Director Henry King was entitled to work with Jennifer Jones twice this year for this film and a highly rated "Good Morning, Miss Dove" movie. Jones was nominated for "Splendored Thing", but he could also have easily named Miss Dove. <br /> <br /> William Holden is just great when a warrior sent a communist revolution in 1949. His love for an oriented doctor Jones was pleasant and so memorable to watch. <br /> <br /> Although the end is not pleasant, it is still one of the greatest romances ever put on the screen.
