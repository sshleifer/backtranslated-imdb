Ingrid Bergman, who plays the loyal administrator of the dentist Walter Matthau, who is to break his boss in the harbor, is absolutely wonderful in this film. He is dealing with a mental repartee in a script where he is terrible and steals a terrible scene where he and Goldie Hawn are talking in a record box (Ingrid's monologue is ahead, but his face tells you that he believes in it with all his heart). Matthau is a strange choice for a leading person (he is too old for Goldie Hawn and too unrefined for Bergman, not to mention being too unreasonable as a dentist), but I liked how he was trying Goldie to try and bounce himself wrong. Hawn (who won the supporting Oscar) is as fresh and bubbly as she is today. This bedroom farce is not terribly complicated (and somewhat reminiscent of "Wednesday"), but it is a welcome relief from the noisy, teenage-oriented comedy they are showing today. "Cactus Flower" is a cute sigh! *** from ****
