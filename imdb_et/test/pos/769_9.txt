ACCESS is a little movie that pops up on you. What appears to be a fluffy nonsense comedy at the outset is the British style, based on a very good story of age and the need for important friendship between the young and the elderly. Writer Jeremy Brock ("Mr Brown", "Charlotte Gray", "King of Scotland") leads her scenario, and the result is consistent, gradually involving fascinating and diverse characters, each filled by female actors. <br /> <br /> Ben Marshall (Rupert Grint, who stands for a self-evolving actor as a "Harry Potter" series) is a quiet, tiny little poetic seventeen-year-old living with his bird watching Vicar (Nicholas Farrell) and his obsessive compulsive, rigid, evangelical do -Gooder Mom (Laura Linney) home, where "the needy", such as the murder crossing Mr. Fincham (Jim Norton), takes precedence over family matters: Mom is a kind of relationship with priest Peter (Oliver Milburn) using Ben as his cover! Sad Ben is trying to learn how to drive a car. Her mother is a poor teacher and decides she needs professional lessons and needs to work to help pay for the needs of poor Mr. Fincham. Ben follows advertising and meets Dame Eve Walton (Julie Walters). He hires Ben and fireworks starts. Through several incidents, including camping trips, Evie insists that they learn lessons from each other's nature: Ben learns self-esteem and self-confidence, and Evie finds a true friend who allows her to leave her static fa√ßade and be Julie Walters, always offering the best skills to act in all her created in the characters, finds a role like no other here: he is extremely wild and lovable. Rupert Grint is exactly the right choice for Bensi's challenges. Between these two chemistry there is as good a offer as in the classic film Harold and Maude. Laura Linney is always a great actor who plays a rather different role from her usual repertoire. And a supportive cast is a fine-grained panorama. This movie is a delightful surprise and one sure that the heart will be warmed up and entertained by those who love writing and directing the fine and acting - and the message! Grady Harp
