Every American who thinks he understands World War II should see this movie. Few war-related Hollywood movies are a stereotype of Japanese soldiers spoiled as emotional brothers who don't follow thinking. We like to think that every Japanese man was ready and able to fight death until the day we were bombarded with Nagasaki. The "fire on the plain" shows a different reality: the troops are miserably underfunded, demoralized and hungry for cannibalism. They refer to human flesh as euphemistically as monkey meat. The film and the novel on which it was founded also died of the myth that Japanese soldiers preferred death to surrender: they had reason to believe that their enemies had no mood to take prisoners. For me, this raises the question of what most Americans would rather avoid: when the Japanese army was so beaten at the time of the war, why was Hiroshima's doll needed?
