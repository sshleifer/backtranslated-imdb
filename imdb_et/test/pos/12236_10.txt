CG in a changing world and non-cartoon animations, etc., Faeries was at least warmly welcomed by me. I think it is important to show these films once in a while to preserve them and remind us of where the originality and fun of the caricatures come from. People talked about how it is boring because of graphics and things, but hey! Think of movies that are considered boring when every film looks like a new art situation and all their mothers are doing these days. Call me old-fashioned, but I liked it. It is a wonderful story of supernatural beings and people, and everything it needs from its audience is their imagination.
