We looked at this film in our chemistry class, so obviously it was an educational value. I thought the film did a great job of combining the personal experiences of the science, moral, and manhattan project, but not focusing on strong action. I recommend this film to scientifically inclined or to those who are interested in moral problems behind Fat Man and Little Boy, but if the subject of nuclear bombs carries you, you will not see it.
