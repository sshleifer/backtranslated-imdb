I'm not a filmmaker, but I know it's hard to tell the story in seven minutes and draw your audience. Horses on Mars are doing this and more. If you watch a good movie, you don't want to stop it. So I felt like watching this movie. It is visually expansive and the microbes take on the human qualities that you feel you are traveling with. <br /> <br /> I really look forward to seeing the exciting adventures of Mr. Anderson in the future. Well done.
