Finally, the silly anime, just a six-episode episode, is about an unhappy local boy named Kintaro (well, he's called a delivery boy, though he's destined for his 20s), and the adventures he has on his travels. Each episode sees him arriving in a new city, acquiring a new job, developing love before the end of each episode before the end of love. <br /> <br /> Gentle sexist, minor, very immature, occasionally anime that just smiles. <br /> <br /> No one will start if you are not an anime fan, because it certainly does not convince you about the genre, but for those who have already been transformed, it is a fun fluff.
