This movie is just awesome. It's so much fun. Although skating and other assemblies have been played, comedy is fantastic. Raab himself and Brandon Dicamillo are fun. There are moments when you can't hold your breath. There are also scenes that you can watch hundreds of times and still laugh. This is one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen.
