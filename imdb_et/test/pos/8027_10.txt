This film was overshadowed by "The Jackal" (Bruce Willis, Richard Gere), which appeared in the same year. Without seeing both movies, I can honestly say it's the ultimate movie. <br /> <br /> Jackal's output was very good, probably with a much larger budget. At the same time, Task is well written and has an exciting story. Aiden Quinn is flawless in two roles. Aiden Quinn and director Christian Duguay did an excellent job of creating a deep and multilayered relationship between the title character and his family. I especially liked the end. <br /> <br /> I was reminded of Jack Ryan's character in Tom Clancy's films. Both are naval officers who are thrown into incredibly dangerous roles when they work secretly for national security. And yet, both Harrison Ford and Aidan Quinn reveal their characters as heros, capable of being viral as well as gentle. They have real tenderness and vulnerability in their relationships with their families. <br /> <br /> What I do not understand is how the opinions of all the people posted on this film can be as positive as the lock-warm reception the film has received. It is a film that has enough complexity and nuance that it will be overwhelming after several views. If you are a fan of espionage genre films, I would enthusiastically recommend "Task".
