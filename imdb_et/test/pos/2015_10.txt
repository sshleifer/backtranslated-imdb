This is the second film in 1985, the second was "The Wedding Singer". Although the "Wedding Singer" depicted the pops of the 80s, "Rock Star" is all about metal. and Jennifer Aniston plays with her girlfriend. When her fixation rewards her, she changes her life all day. <br /> <br /> The story does not become too dramatic and it only scratches the life of a rock-star. Sex and drugs are very limited in this movie, but it's full of Rock's Role! The music is fantastic and the concerts are great! The feeling of the whole concert is very busy because they used a real audience (there is no cgi here). <br /> Rock Rock is all about fun and if you have anything to do with the old metal scene, you will love this movie! <br /> <br /> 10/10
