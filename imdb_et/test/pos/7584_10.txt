Horses on Mars are an appealing animated short, which sometimes takes a comic look at the evolutionary process in the eyes of those who are still developing. The story is personal and sometimes sentimental and supported by a strong digital animation and narrative that involves the viewer in that story. I was fortunate enough to take a brief look at the widescreen format at the Sundance Film Festival of 2002, and I assume that if it is a small screen, this part will lose its ability to draw the reader's less thoughtful story and stunning graphics.
