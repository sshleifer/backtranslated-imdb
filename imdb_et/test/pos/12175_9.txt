I liked Erkan & Stefan ?? cool and fast story that didn't fall into detail. These two guys are great and can always come up with new ideas. High image quality and cutting support a lot of film. <br /> <br /> Erkan & Stefan show that the German film industry is able to convey successful Hollywood concepts to the local "satire" in our cinemas.
