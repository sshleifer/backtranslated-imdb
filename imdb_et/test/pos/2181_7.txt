This terrible five-star finale cheap remake suffers awfully. Humphrey Bogart is the leader of the sleazoid radio station, who is desperate to gain momentum. The owner decides to have several moral exhibitions written about the famous murder case 20 years ago. So they hire a fake preacher (Harry Hayden) to track down a murderer who was acquitted and lived under the name. The preacher arrives on her daughter's wedding day, but the ruthless radio station refuses to expose her mother and destroy their lives. <br /> <br /> Bogart is always good. Hayden is a good slimy preacher and Henry O'Neill is a good father. All others are just terrible. Helen McKeller has no compassion (important for the role), Linda Perry is a sad actor, Beverly Roberts is fine, but she always looks old, Claire Dodd and Hobart Cavanagh don't know, Carlyle Moore is a boyfriend, Virginia Brissac is Robert Middlemas moving as a station owner . <br /> <br /> It is less than an hour, but there is a pale copy of the original featuring Edward G. Robinson, Aline MacMahon's dynamic performance. Frances Starr and Boris Karloff. But it's always worth Boag.
