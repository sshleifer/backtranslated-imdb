You can say within the first 30 seconds of this movie whether you want to stop watching it. The film opens with the images of planes landing at the aerodrome, one plane diving into a runway filled with mirage. You can guess precisely that this movie is not a "story". At first glance, it is even easy to think that opening images are repeating images of the same plane. The original drama is the sharpness of your perception, based on your willingness to experience the movie simply as a series of pictures. If you want to see the movie after opening, you won't get bored. You may even be mesmerized. Film can be an emotional experience; it can be an intellectual experience; it can be both. Based on the DVD commentary, which is imperative, it was first and foremost an emotional experience for Herzog, and at one point he explicitly talks about how the film is a collaboration between the filmmaker and the viewer. There is plenty of room for the viewer to make this movie exactly what he wants to do. Game of chance?
