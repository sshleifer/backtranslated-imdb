This film received less attention than "its own", perhaps because it has only one "name" letter. But given that women's professional baseball was only eight years old, the existence of Midwestern town is a much larger economic entity for Japanese baseball, both in terms of financial insurance and popular support. That alone would make it a better film. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Baseball" shows the conditions of the Japanese-ball life: joyful joy, respect for judges, pressure from business owners on managers, extreme conservatism of playing - and none of the hot dog players are welcome. Dai Nippon. Japanese parties are not comfortable for foreigners and show it in many ways ("gai-jin strike zone," says one American player, "bigger than Buick.") <br /> <br /> Script may not have won any prizes when playing but again I found it to be much more enjoyable to watch than the tiny "Too". Definitely recommended for those who want to see this great sport.
