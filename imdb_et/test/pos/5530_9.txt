It was one of the lines of the trailer of this film, and if the journalists did not exaggerate. All six players on this screen are 99% of the time so they have to be good. <br /> <br /> It is always fascinating how certain plot surfaces can be treated for both comedy and deadly difficult situations. Mary Boland, who is bright and Charlie Ruggles, is playing their usual characters who are going to California. Share the expenses they advertise to share the ride. They're getting a Beast of Burns and Allen and a dog. The same premise in California was a terrible generation of several generations. <br /> <br /> Of course, when you travel with Gracie Allen, you know you're going to get nuts, trying to think of your Monty Pythonesque from all over the world. And if that's not enough, you get W.C. Fields, a part-time sheriff and a full-time pool living with Alison Skipworth. But at that time we didn't get into such things. <br /> <br /> A real classic comedy from the thirties, which must not be missed.
