> This show is one of the biggest things coming out of America since The Simpsons. Not only are there thousands of new ideas, but it is actually controversial (see Jewish jokes, season 1, part 1) and not afraid to "tag" people. But Fox's big thoughts have canceled it with Greg Bunny and Futurama, so make sure you buy the 1st season box> if you're still getting it. This is the best money you will ever spend. This is definitely a display that gets better, the more you look at it, because at first the constant setbacks will get a bit annoying and may not always fit> the story properly. But after a few episodes, you will understand how> it is great and how well it is currently compared to other examples that are showing in the weather> at the moment.
