After five minutes, I began to feel like it didn't, you got a totally unheard hero and his overweight stupid friend. Everyone saw it before, yes right. I was ready to miss for a few hours. It's something I'm quite used to ... we're not all. Then after a few minutes of testosterone, insults and such a truck appeared. Okay, the filming techniques that use this look were clumsy, but who cares! This truck is amazing! Soon it will be taken away and we will be back to the geek and his overweight friend. But now I'm convinced that at least it's not too terrible. Then again and again the film's intelligence is astonished. There are so many jokes at their expense, it's like everything in the world except two. The mind behind the makeup was the genius I swear. Believe me, if you are a man who you forget so many jokes in this movie, there is so much here that only the girl understands. <br /> <br /> Brother Bob is by far the best mountain killer that can be found everywhere, the fact that he sewed together adds to the effect. Of course, there are some real facts here, but this is not always the case. If our "hero" bleeds and blood in his brother Bobi to put his death, it is now a garbage. There is no chance that the nose bleeding can be so bad and does not mean a broken artery or something. I all use too much blood, but it takes it too far. Incest jokes are a bit predictable, but still funny. And the way a brother bob runs out is more than classic. In general, this movie rules, it really breaks overacted melodramatic fear that we got so much in 2003-2005. The completion of this move simply couldn't be better. <br /> <br /> It's sure to be followed by anyone who likes their horror when there are multiple orders and attitudes.
