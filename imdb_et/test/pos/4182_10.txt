When I first saw this movie, I waited for "our boys" to be cute and more like an expanded TV show. I didn't get it back then. But years later, at the end of AASA later, in the 1970s, PAR-TAY, where certain substances were smoked, inhaled, and abundant with tequila, was "HEAD" late at night. We looked at it and finally realized what "HEAD" was. It cheated on his show, as shown in one of the songs that called himself "made as a picture". As Davy Jones wrote in his autobiography, "They made me a monkey," he publicly admits that all those on the film had smoked all-night smoke. They created themselves, society, everything! Great movie! Tho, when 52 a old grandmother, I no longer "induldge", I still watch this movie when I want a good LOL!
