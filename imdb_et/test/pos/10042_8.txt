The sustainable arm of this film is its humor. Warner Brothers played his star in strength with his generic Custer version of a striking, striking and unsuccessful strain of romantic winch and unexpected idealism. it was again Robin Hood and Flynn flourished. All of his best pictures used his talent to timing the agony and comics, and that was no exception. <br /> <br /> This is also useful in returning to the former co-star Olivia de Havilland, despite an earlier agreement to break the partnership; part of a strong-minded Libby Custer has a better role to play than the sweet love-interest types he was tired of playing in the late Flyni movies, and after seeing that he had asked de Havilland to make a fair share. In this latest collaboration, he drops all of his remarkable operational skills into the heart, basically a romping adventure film, and the screen chemistry has revived - once he and Flynn have the chance to develop their characters beyond the original romance of an old couple, equally striking. <br /> <br /> Flynn / de Havilland's tying and comedy line is what has made this film more resilient, when most other Flyn's westerners are in such an affection for the modern American public, although supposedly not their star - has long been forgotten. The action scenes are quite varied (despite ironic thought, extra death during one movie film in the fall) and pieces of villains, a schoolboy, are the same people who were horrified by our hero on his first day at West Point and hence his career. This reduces the cast list, but it is too moral convenience. <br /> <br /> But they are largely irrelevant to a movie that is never more than just entertaining entertainment. Abrolytically supported and supported by female supporters (including Anthony Quinn, who is an all-in-one non-verbal role as Sioux leader), Errol Flynn keeps his way through the usual arsenal of charming beautiful looks, unexpected sweetness frightening tribulations, flash point frenzy, cheerful companionship and great octane charisma. She's a reckless braggart, but you can't help her as she is. And without Garryown's setup, it's hard to go away, because it's many days after the ears are dragged. <br /> <br /> This is one of Flynn's persistent hits; it also includes an amazing number of good works that are a memorable film.
