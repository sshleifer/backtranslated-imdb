"I know I'm a human. And if you were all these things, you would attack me right now, so some of you are still human. This thing doesn't want to show you, he wants to show you, he wants to hide himself fighting if it is, but it is open. If it takes us, there are no more enemies, no one is going to kill it. And then it has won. "<br /> <br /> John Carpenter's The Thing is one of the fun horror movies ever made? fast, smart and purely exciting from start to finish. So all the movies in the genre have to be done. <br /> <br /> The 1982 Antarctic film focuses specifically on a group of American scientists. We do not give an introduction to our mission, but push their existence when a couple of seemingly crazy Norwegians appearing in their base camp, fleeing from a fleeing dog. The Norwegians are killed and the dog gets into a colony where things really go crazy. <br /> <br /> Soon it will be clear that a dog is actually a stranger that shifts its shape, which manifests itself in the physical form of its victims? in other words, it starts eating the Americans and imitating them so well that the rest of the people can't distinguish between their friends and enemies. <br /> <br /> A MacReady-led research package (Kurt Russell), starting to fight for your survival, using puzzles instead of magic. If it really is among them, how are they going to reveal it? How many things are there? How can Thing kill you? (Or can it be destroyed at all?) <br /> <br /> The creature-origin movie is easily explained: thirty thousand years ago, a space launcher frozen on the Antarctic ice fell on the ground. Thing tried to escape and the Norwegians discovered the ice who unknowingly released it from his natural prison. <br /> <br /> The Thing, the film itself, is similar to Ridley Scot's "Alien" icon (1979). Have many comparisons been made? The protagonists are abandoned in a pristine area, which is rarely kept by an enemy who can kill them one by one. But the "thing"? for all practical purposes? came first. <br /> <br /> Based on the famous story "Who is going there?" John W. Campbell, Jr. (typing under a pseudonym like Don A. Stuart), the film was originally adapted in 1951 to Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby. The result was "The Thing From Another World," an indisputable class. To be fair, it was little like a short story and Carpenter's remake makes it more just. <br /> <br /> The idea that Thing can adapt everyone's physicality is what essentially makes this movie so big and the most important story for a short story. In 1951, the special effects were just too poor to portray the shape-changing organism reasonably, but thirty-one years brought much progress in SFX. <br /> <br /> Creature effects artist Rob Bottin does an excellent job of what he can do is easily become a cheesy gore-fest with an amazingly frightening (and realistic) mess of blood and fear. Thing, though never really a single form, is constantly seen in the morphing stage and the effect is just great. They still offer twenty-two years later. <br /> <br /> Ennio Morricone's result (nominated for the Razzie Award at that time) is a bit too electronic and funny, but still usable. <Br / Since its casting consists entirely of men, the fact that its end is the most sensible and atypical conclusion of all time, "The Thing"? by any standards? is an unusual Hollywood best. It is not surprising that at the time of its publication, "The Thing" performed badly and "E.T." ? was released in the same year and there are lots of kids? got two higher pictures (far away). <br /> <br /> In the long run, however, "The Thing" is better in almost all conceivable ways. The Spielberg story is outdated and floped during the reopening of the 20th anniversary. "The Thing", on the other hand, has gradually climbed the ladder of cult classic? This is one of the most famous films ever known. <br /> <br /> Carpenter is known for a very uneven career? his amazing "Assault on Precinct 13" (1976) to the great "Halloween" (1978) frustration and stupidity "Escape from L.A." (1996), "The Thing" is his best film. Although her reputation has never been honored over the years to relieve her in most of the "amazing movies" lists, "The Thing" is still one of my favorite horror films and ?? after careful checking? masterfully made. It is a brave and brilliant thrill that is simultaneously unique and cool? real relief for movie fans who are tired of the same old horrors. It's at least really unpredictable.
