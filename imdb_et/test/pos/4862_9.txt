Cleopatra 2525 is a very funny and fun show. You shouldn't take the whole show seriously, but if you want to have fun, this is your TV show. The quality assurance provided by Xena manufacturers is the Cleopatra 2525, which is no different from Xen. The formula of women warriors is put into the future, where they do not have to fight against warriors or gods, but dangerous robots that are on the surface and are forced to live underground. During the two Cleopatra seasons, they develop an interesting and funny underground world, and we get to know three main characters: Cleopatra (Jennifer Sky), Hel (Gina Torres) and Sarge (Victoria Pratt). They are all different, but they work really well as a team. Three of the main actors appeared earlier in Xena, like most of the regular / guest (also known as Hercules or both exhibitions). I especially liked the characteristic character of Danielle Cormack (Ephiny Xenas), which is very different from all his earlier roles. So if you liked Xena and Hercules, you love Cleopatra 2525. If you don't know, try it: I'm sure you enjoy it.
