It was a very good PPV, but as 14 years later Wrestlemania XX, WWE created so many matches, some games were useless. I'm not going to go through every card because it takes forever. <br /> <br /> But the highlights included the biggest blasting demolition victory that won the Ots and Andre Giant label crews. The first mixed tag game featuring Randy Savage and Sensational Queen Sherri vs. Dusty Rhodes and late Sapphire and the first clash between Ultimate Warrior and Hulk Hogan. <br /> <br /> Some games were a complete waste of time. As the Bolsheviks vs Hart Foundation was only about 40 seconds long, Size B Ware vs. Rick Martel was short and Big Bossman vs Achema was too short. <br /> <br /> Mr. Perfect vs Brutus Beefcake and Ted DiBias vs Jake Snake "Roberts was really very good. <br /> <br /> General Class B
