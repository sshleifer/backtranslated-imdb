Several weeks ago I lost my beloved companion and 14-year-old friend, the golden retriever named Sasha. When I came home from the animal hospital, alone, after one of the most painful decisions in my life, my teenage daughter sat next to me. . and we talked about this Twilight Zone episode. I may be wrong, but I remember the line that Arthur Hunnicutt said when Satan tried to defeat him, but his dog could not go with him. . . and his dog, in turn, was angry with the goalkeeper who tried to trick the old hunter into "stepping in". . that it would be "one gentle of heaven when dogs were not allowed," and the spirit of the old mountain man and his dog decided to go away from the gate (which they had thought into heaven to travel alone from eternity). What a tiny moment when they meet a "good oil" nationalist on this eternity, only to discover that he is an angel who was sent out and "a certain neighbor, of course, dogs are allowed into heaven." <br /> <br /> I testify that I cried when I spoke to my daughter when we mourned our beloved golden course. Rod Serling was really a genius, a voice that spoke of racism, hatred, "ignorance" in the early sixties and was a great inspiration for me to become a writer. This episode, forty-five years, gave us a pleasant message to anyone who has lost a loved one. I invite you to get a copy the next time there is one Twilight Zone marathon or buy it. There are also tears, but also comfort. As always, thanks to Rod for what you taught us. . ., even now.
