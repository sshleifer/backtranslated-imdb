For people who are the first timers of filmmaking, I think they did a great job! We need to support the emerging industry, which comes especially from the north. It was very popular when I was in the cinema, in a good house and in very good reactions and a lot of laughter. This is a feel-good movie and so I felt like I came to the cinema! It has bottom humor and a positive community it represents. The film has just been opened, I hope it works well - people should support this little movie. I think this "vinny ..." person is something bitter, nothing! And get too personal ?? shame! I say well done to everyone it touches? I look forward to your next venture.
