I've read both the book and the movie I've seen today. The story is so powerful that almost all scripts or scenarios would have done it right. So there was nothing. But it is still a beautiful movie because it makes one thought and feeling just like a book. Watching it is not like watching a documentary from an unsuccessful country and feeling sympathetic to people who suffer from oppressive regimes, but like any other common man, looking over the generations across the continent. Amir's craziness, his guilt, his dilemmas, and ultimately the choice of redemption might have been any of us. There is no unmistakable character to search and idolize, but all of them are gray, just like all of us. <br /> <br /> Another important observation is that the film is doing a great job for the Afghans in twenty years. The lively, caring childhood represents Kabul before the Russian invasion and the abandoned ruins of the city that reflect what the Taliban have done with it. <br /> <br /> Child actors deserve "thumbs" all the way. They can embarrass every mature actor. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen a movie yet or read a book, just walk into the theater, remembering that you can see a multilayered story woven on the multicolored fabric of emotional emotions and feelings. The purpose of this film is not to interfere with the anti-Soviet and Taliban feelings, but to experience the trials of human experiments. <br /> <br /> I read some of the site's external evaluations and I have to admit that I am not looking at a review point that summarizes the story as far away as a distant observer and draws attention to technical details about amazing cinematography or something similar. At least for this film, you should try to combine it rather than objectively evaluate it.
