it would be a disgrace if there is still a speed racer watching, be it dubbed or subbed (I prefer the duplicated version (which is rare) because it was funny ... in good ways). For a quick racer, it's never too old to watch it. go red and yellow !! I saw it for the first time when I was about seven and enjoyed listening to a pleasant opening. it disappeared for a while, then I saw it a few months ago (I'm 19). Imagine a nostalgia feeling singing "here he comes, here comes the speed player! He's a demon on wheels ~ ~ ~" over and over again. anyway, the mach 5 concept created so many "ultra-multi-functional cars", but none of them could overcome their genius in construction. other cars just seemed too much. and it was not just races and fighting with different bosses that made me interesting. it was a rider-x mystery man and how the world of speed player almost turned it around. they made some mango story, but all turned out pretty well. although I don't remember if the show proved how rasser-x looked like manga, they did.
