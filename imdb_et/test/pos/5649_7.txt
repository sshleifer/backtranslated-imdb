I saw it on a VHS tape in 1993, but has not found it from any source. This is a very grim and uncompromising look at the last days of the Japanese Army in Phillipines. Anyone with an interest in the Pacific War would see this movie well and see the conditions under which the other party fought. I understand that the Japanese army was completely cut off from any reuse of Philippines in 1945, so there are undoubtedly many frightening cases here. Maybe I couldn't identify the film with the characters, but I appreciate their humanity and the struggle to survive. If I had to compile a list of the ten biggest war films, this film would be on it. See if you can get it.
