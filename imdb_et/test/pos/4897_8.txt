I just saw the story of Gentlemen: Apocalypse, featuring Mark Gatiss and Reece Shearsmith of the League, in a special screening of Manchester. <br /> <br /> On the back was Peter Kay (who has a short front panel of the film), which caresses the back of the movie after the Q&A session. <br /> <br /> The movie was complicated (good way) and very funny. That's why Geoff Tipps, Hilary Briss and Herr Lipp are trying to save the fancy Rosyton Vasey for their creators. <br /> <br /> The league plays a wide range of its characters and self (or character based on itself)) and is supported by British character and comedy actors such as Bernard Hill, Victoria Wood and David Warner. <br /> <br /> Warner is especially eye-catching, which reminds me of his smooth and cutting time Bandiids. <br /> <br /> The film moves into and out of different realities and allows some Rosyton Vasey denizen to grow beyond their usual comedy limits. <br /> <br /> Steve Pemberton's Herr Lipp has an amazing Bretchian moment near the end of the movie that has to make a decision about his purpose and meaning in life that brings the throat to an unexpected unexpected moment and surprises you with his delicate symbols. <br /> <br /> This repeats something Mark and Reece said after the plot of the overwhelmed with these famous characters is wrong and that the whole movie is really a love letter to them. <br /> <br /> For a format that started as a radio character based on a sketch show, these guys are really an advanced idea so as to maintain a movie that will take you on a journey through fiction, "reality", comedy, tragedy and a pleasant journey of less than two Obvious characters carry a long form of story from their 70 odd existing creations. <br /> <br /> The fans of the show love it. It pays to pay attention and attention to detail, uninitiated may be a bit lost, but the pleasure of LOG was always the ability to almost instantly tune in its acutely observed characters and take a stylistic leap to respect the farce and expressionist film. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of respects here, including "The Shining" and "La Belle et la Bete" to name just two of the things I noticed, and they really show their love for cinema and history with segment 1690- in England, when it comes to film, it is quite reasonable. <br /> <br /> What I can say, wonder, beat, feel emotionally and cut over and they've definitely pulled what many have failed. Successful British TV comedy for cinema translation. <br /> <br /> If you've watched a gentleman before, look at it; You enjoy it. <br /> <br /> If you haven't done so, rent a DVD and then watch it. <br /> <br /> Well done boys and thanks for the charming and humorous Q&A.
