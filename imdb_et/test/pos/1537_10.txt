This film gave me repeated nightmares, the voice of Alan Rickman representing the almighty, insidious, fascist ruler. The most terrifying film I have ever seen - the psychological fear that is more powerful than what every "horror" movie has ever achieved. Alan Rickman's voice always represents the power and fear of a totalitarian state that reminds Orwell of 1984. This film describes those who do not care much about the current world governments. This movie is annoying, but so everyone should watch it - it's a description of reality that no one should ever experience, but so much.
