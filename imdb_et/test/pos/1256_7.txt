Kid - 39-year-old Russell Duritz has a life that most men would envy - he has a great job, is honored (and afraid), he has a beautiful house and makes money in buckets. But everything is at the expense, in which case there is no social life, no conscience and fear of spending the rest of life alone. She just needs someone to show her the way. is clearly an adult movie. This is exacerbated by a marketing campaign that is clearly targeted at children - it is put together with "Rugrats the Movie" and "Pokemon 2000" trailers (aren't they yet?). But I was encouraging. serious and appreciates your life. His guide to this journey of self-discovery is himself at the age of 8 (they never explain how Rusty arrives and, frankly, I don't care). Young Rusty's innocence and rampant optimism give him a real advantage - he summarizes Russell's work as an image consultant. However, for a good script to succeed, participants need to implement it. There is no problem here. <br /> <br /> Although Willis has three times ignored W.C. Field warnings of children or animals starring at him have repeatedly come out, just as Breslin has been properly exposed, as he did with Osment dramatically. Willis succeeds in balancing the characteristics of Russell's brilliant power mechanism with vulnerability and confusion, unchangingly ridiculous. Meanwhile, Breslin is dead in the portrayal of every childhood - something that has always been stuck for some reason. We also get two bonus shows: Lily Tomlin is great when Russell's flat assistant and Jean Smart are the perfect insightful charming anchorwoman (I loved her "Guinevere"). <br /> <br /> Kid is charming, hard, and real. And it complains to adults of all ages.
