Trilogy is very interesting. Some go along with the bang (Lord of the Rings), some are gradually weakening (some matrices). floats outside their flawless exterior. Case and point: "Three color trilogy". This trilogy chapter, which is the last, is the most philosophical and thoughtful. In "Blue" we had a more visually stunning, more character-based plot, in "White" it was a more light-hearted, narrative-led story where we listen more to what the characters say. "Red", however, is focused on what "as" and "how come". It casts doubt on our own destiny and focuses mainly on the past and the future as it is today. <br /> <br /> This chapter is about a young model that runs over a dog and takes it back to its owner. He will soon discover that the dog owner is actually a cynical pensioner who spies with his neighbors through the use of advanced intelligence to make phone calls. All three trilogy features the main features of the film, but the story is much more. Think about 'blue', a story about a woman who is losing her loved ones. We have consistently shown ideas for modern French society and how it characterizes character. "Red" is not just a young woman who finds refuge in the life of an older man, but it is also about chance, hope and destiny. <br /> <br /> Irene Jacob stands for Valentine Dussaut, who first finds an old man (Jean-Louis Trintignant) whom we never find, extremely self-centered and disgusting. Although she has learned through reflective analysis and her voyeuristic intentions, she is the ideal person for her if she was only 40 years younger. Irene lives with another, younger judge who resembles a very old man. It's "what if" that keeps the movie around. What if Irene was born 40 years ago? The old man would have been his perfect place. But what if the younger judge is actually his perfect match because he is so similar to the parent. Valentine doesn't know this, only we do, and Krzysztof Kieslowski refers to this almost every frame Irene has. We are constantly seeing our presence with a smile, like the recommendation of almost Irene's destiny. <br /> <br /> I mention that the old man has no reason for that. This is the reason, because it is a very symbolic story for the general theme. We have to compare the older judge with Auguste (Jean-Pierre Lori), the younger judge in more than one way. We find out that the old man had someone he loved, but he went away. In the second scene, we see that the heart of Auguste is that the love of his life goes away with another man. There are constant reminders about whether Valentine will ever meet this man. Even if they go through each other without noticing each day. There is also a phone motive that Valentine is a way to keep a sensible and up-to-date life for Auguste, which leads to her heartbeat, and an old man, this is the only thing she has left. These three elements make it possible to hide the psychology of the characters. It is a kind of statement about what they are and who they are. <br /> <br /> All three "Colors" are by far the most common in France. "Blue" denotes Freedom (personal nature), "White" denotes equality (which is accepted by more than one) and "Red" is brotherhood (to communicate, to learn). And while this last chapter is a clear focus on brotherhood, Kieslowski assures that he will bring the other two together to combine all three stories. For example, we see an old man trying to reach Valentine and illuminate him with his spy equipment, which reflects the principle of equality. We also see close to the end that Valentine is doing some breath-taking and that he is more concerned about himself than others (not Michel's speeches), a clear example of Freedom. According to all three principles, Kieslowski also combines all characters with the ultimate and most heartfelt scene. <br /> <br /> "Red" means where you could have been if you were older or younger. The question is, is anyone perfectly perfect for everyone and can one person change your life. The last chapter, which has ever been made in the most inspiring trilogy, breaks down obstacles in both leadership and storytelling. It is not just about our modern life, but also about where life could and should be today. And while the film is thinner than "blue" and "white", it boldly expresses its expression of love and compassion. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine that "red" was Kieslowski's last film and that he died so young. Nevertheless, trilogy is always his masterpiece, and we always remember him for his work, rising to Bergman, Fellin and Wenders as a truly remarkable director who has never been awarded an Oscar. Kieslowski, you're missed!
