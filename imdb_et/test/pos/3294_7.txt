Director: Tay Garnett, Ford Beebe, Cast: Mike Mazurki, Vic Christy, Fritz Ford, Tay Garnett. <br /> <br /> Based on the number of comments on IMDb, this seems like a forgotten movie. It seems to me to be ironic, because it is actually one of the first films I remember. My mother took me and my brother to see this movie at Spokane Garland Theater when it first appeared in the mid-1970s and I still remember it. <br /> <br /> I am going to memory here, but I believe this move is related to a trapper accused of a crime he did not do and the law goes after him. I believe it will be placed in 1800 in Alaska. The narrator talks about the trap played by Mike Mazurki. Really, this is a very good movie with a great place. It can be compared to the 1981 film Death Hunt by Charles Bronson. These two films have a very similar story. The main difference between the two is Death Hunt is an adult-oriented film, while Challenge is a family-friendly film. <br /> <br /> Mike Mazurk and Tay Garnett were both quite old when the film was made, which I find impressive when it is thought that this film has been filmed in Alaska. It was the last film by Tay Garnett before he died, just a few years later. Both had been in quiet time.
