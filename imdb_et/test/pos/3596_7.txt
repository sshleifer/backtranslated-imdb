I didn't read the book. also don't care. The film was a beautiful romance and I think women enjoy it. no, it wasn't a "10" movie, but it was enjoyable. Women, if your husband is bored like mine, check it out for yourself. hurt is a wonderful as a philosophical doctor who offers a thoughtful monologue in "love" and "loving". <br /> <br /> Also, if you like the nick cage, he was terrible and funny. I enjoyed watching the developing romance. <br /> <br /> Also, if you like a Christian ball, you will see him in balance. this is a "10" sci fi movie. <br /> <br /> See this movie. ignore previous user comments. <br /> <br /> One - especially ladies! also visit my site under my name with one word and "dot" com.
