Recovery is a balanced and balanced drama of a sensitive subject that does not stop the main character. David Tennant and Sarah Municipality bring out complex and controversial emotions that are deeply in love with a couple who try to reach the personality changes they both suffer and must also do a tragic accident to survive. <br /> <br /> Tennant, like Alan, brings humor and dangerous lecherousness as an engineer recovering from the memory loss caused by a traffic accident. Alan is not simply depicted as a victim, but as a person who has the best opportunities to understand his new life. Sarah Parish's Tricia is not a clich√© stand-by-her-husband's housewife who does something to support her husband. He fights Alan with falling out of love, because the man he's new and loved is now a completely different person - a stranger to him. <br /> <br /> Contrary to some opinion, it seems to me - in my opinion - a perfect Sunday night. Too often, we have shown soft family drama or detective series, such as Heartbeat, which rot and destroy the brain. The program's commissioners seem to think that the traditional day off is also a day when our minds are sleeping. A bigger challenge and a thought-provoking drama like recovery would seriously change the situation.
