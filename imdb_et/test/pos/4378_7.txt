I can't say I enjoyed it as much as "The Big Lebowski" or "Raising Arizona", and felt a little bit, but "O Brother" is an enjoyable movie that deserves some good laughs and Coens fruitful taste, complicated a sense of creativity. The DVD edition includes a featurette and I was interested to know that Coens is quite simple in his director's techniques. It surprised me! Of course, this film is not the best example (and I only say it in comparison) and it was not worth any Oscars (many think it has been robbed), but maybe it depends on the complaint. <br /> <br /> Although I liked Coen's previous work, I have never been a fan of the old western or "Hazzard Dukes" or any of the things they show in TNN every day. I think that is why I didn't feel enthusiastic about controlling this movie, seeing it revolve around the South peoples. For all southern readers, I don't want to insult your people! I'm sure you will feel the same way when you watch movies from urban areas like "A Bronx Tale". If you live in a city all your life, it is hard to get used to this kind of movie. But all the excuses left me, I found that the characters are fun and peculiar. I think John Turturro made a great accent and saw him talk in real life. Tim Blake Nelson was also good. Of course, George Clooney - who I assume is not the best for accent assessment, deciding to bring the idea to work with a coach and develop New England's accent "Perfect Storm" - naturally seems a bit uneven and constantly fights with the accent. His performance was good. Coen regular places like Holly Hunter (in a short but sweet role) and John Goodman (also on the screen for a short time, but every moment it steals). <br /> <br /> Although I don't usually do it dig music, I liked the title "Permanent Man's Fever". The DVD also includes a music video of this song. In general, I found the movie fun and original, but it doesn't have the quality of my face that Coens has shown us before. It's a little effort, but good. However, I suggest you check it out. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
