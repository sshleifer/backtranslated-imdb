"Down Periscope" has been in our library since it first came to VHS. Since then, we have acquired a DVD and a digital Cinema Now. <br /> <br /> This is a peculiar flick that does not go military overboard as a pro or con. First of all, it is a surprise to the comedy and the main characters vehicle that the sequel has never been offered. <br /> <br /> The film has become an obsession with the following culture, even among the very young. I became aware of this when I visited the USS Drum mobile phone in Alabama in 2002. Among them was one of the baby band binders who had taken all the roles of the film and had planned to live it again with their nightstand. <br /> This is a fun romp that makes you proud of both our Navy and Hollywood ... a rare company. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Kelsey's grammar, Lauren Holly and Rob Schneider, there could have been an otherwise unnoticeable movie, so much fun!
