In the 1960s, Cleveland TVs were able to watch the episode of Flash Gordon at Ghoulard (Friday at 23:30). It was the best mockfest material ever seen by someone younger than us. We would have regular "sleepers" (though we didn't call them) just to have fun with this group of friends. Next week we will quote the latest episodes of your favorite cornball lines. <br /> <br /> Watching this today provokes much of the same reaction. But if you can't laugh in dialogue, flat creatures, foolish costumes and terrible spacecraft for a long time, there are some good things that I didn't appreciate for the first time. Production designers built great kits, both in rooms and in laboratory equipment. The character of Charles Middleton's "Ming Merciless" was the best screensaver of all time, definitely until then and arguing better than anyone else. Jean Rogers is surprisingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> Then what do I know? I'm just a child.
