In Luchino Visconti's film "Death in Venice", not only the beauty of the world around us breaks down, but Gustav von Aschenbach simply breaks down on the human body when applying for beauty. To understand the decline, we have to admit that we are fascinated by beauty, best described and explained in the Socrates quotation found in Thomas Mann's version of Venice's death. the spiritual only aspect we perceive through our senses? Secondly, how divine, when the mind and the virtue and truth tell us through the senses? Should we not die and eat out of love? "In the film, we see that this thing happens, the man becomes a longing for the longing beauty that turns into a long time for the boy Tadzio. Even if his moody part tells him that adoration of beauty can lead to sensuoussis and give up, he can't contain himself. <br /> <br /> It would be easy to describe it as a beautiful film, we can see the extravagance of the salon early on and we will discuss the perfect summary of the life of a century's upper class, all the filmmaker Pasqualino De Santis has excellently summed up in the film. sensual artistic achievements in materialism and sensual beauty, and these things have fallen into the past, the city we know to be incomparable beauty and uniqueness is nothing more than a leisure resort with terrible hotel staff. The streets become a tiring labyrinth full of disgusting rotting and rot, the city breaks down beside the protagonist Through this, we have a look at why this famous composer is a weak and harmless person. The death of his daughter and probably his wife, along with his music failure, allows us to understand why he is destroying himself. <br /> <br /> Alfred, with whom Aschenbach has thorough conversations about the meaning of beauty and who can create it; but Alfred is more than a friend, he is Aschenbach's alter-ego, and what Alfred says describes the composer's own doubts and fears. The scene where Aschenbach decides to leave Venice, is immediately followed by Alfred's clip, telling him that he is weak, alienated and lacking in feelings. Finally, we can conclude that these setbacks are not a reality at all. It is the decomposition of memory, not the objective transformation of the past, these changes become distorted memories. We can say that these are broken memories, because even Aschenbach refers to it, he says, "reality interferes and worsens us;" and after seeing the office of the travel agency we see Aschenbach with Tadzio and his family and warn them - leave Venice, but immediately after the meeting we see him again with an official sitting and realize that all this was his imagination, he works for a long time without dialogues, designed by Gustav Mahler With toxic music. He allows the viewer to go to life as we look at Aschenbach's life and respect for his surrounding beauty. Slowly, the viewer understands that our hero is overwhelmed by the growing awareness that the city is stifling the slag. The falling city puts Tadzio's middle-aged man on the stage of attraction, a romantic longing for something ideal and unclear that it can never be used, even in fantasy. The beauty of this Polish boy lights her fire, which at first makes her shine, then consumes her. The film ends with von Aschenbach, who sits weakly in the beach chair, watching Tadzio's fight with his friend, seeing his black hair down, and he looks like rotten blood, a vision of his outdated moments before his last soul. The last disintegration has happened, the city is dirty around him and it has changed what he ignores. As Aschenbach dies, he has the same painted face at the beginning of the film as the old man on the ferry that disturbed him. It was a catching of beauty that initiated its decomposition, and when striving for artistic beauty, it could not feel its own death and the city surrounding it; his sensuality is respected, while constantly controlling death and decay. These three themes relate to the cursed and the death, the beauty, the death, and the disintegration in Venice, these are the art of Visconti, the beauty of his work is the breakdown of beauty. <br /> <br /> In this movie, we deal with the embarrassment of one big man. We see the honorable composer Gustav von Aschenbach striving for true and pure beauty, and in pursuit of this attribute, it breaks down around him and leads him to unhappiness, to lonely death, looking at his target of affection. I believe that through these films, Visconti is trying to tell us that it can't be beautiful. The degradation in the world around us is inseparable and, if we are confused, it can destroy glory. In the event of the death of Venice, everything is erased by searching for culture and beauty. Beauty and consolation are woven as thorns in Visconti's work at once beautiful and destructive, which are the themes that define her art.
