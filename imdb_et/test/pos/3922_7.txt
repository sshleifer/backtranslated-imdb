Carly Jones (Elisha Curtberth), her bad boyfriend brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray), his boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki) and his friends Paige (Paris Hilton) and his boyfriend Blake (Robert Richard) and Dalton (Jon Abrahams) travel City to watch the important game. They decide to go to the camp halfway and continue their journey the next day. But Wade's car car hits and stays with Carly to buy a new neighborhood with a wax house. When they get here, they realize that the place is a ghost town, and two abducted siamese brothers have made people waxed. <br /> <br /> I liked this "Wax House", a really worthy teen horror movie. The story follows the standards of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and other slash films, and it is well done, has a good team of actors and actors, and the special effects and death scenes are amazing. Even if the movie was not good, watching sexy and delicious Paris Hilton is worth it. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Casa de Cera" ("Wax House")
