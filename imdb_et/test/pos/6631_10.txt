I would no longer be surprised if critics miss the most obvious things of artwork because they are people and most people are lazy by nature. This means that the simpler notion that Ingmar Bergman's big 1968 film Shame (or Skammen) is just an anti-war film is damaging the image of a very sophisticated and highly nuanced film. Compared to the more dramatic predecessors of film films, Persona and Hunt Of The Wolf, the shame is probably the classic film of narrative. But the key word is seemingly because, although he lacks a Persona braille pop psychologist and wolf horror movie Hour Of The Wolf, it is one of the best films ever made on war, not as an anti-war movie or a pre-war movie. As such, he must be one of his greatest films among his wild strawberries, as well as one of his best scenarios, if not the best. <br /> <br /> Though seemingly a psychologically exterior image of movies, it really says a lot more realistic things about the human psyche and the will of survival. It was played by Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullman Jan and Eva Rosenberg (perhaps the young notorious American spies who many European intellectuals felt innocent), two musicians who played in the local Philharmonic Orchestra before the war, and they went back to land on a small island that is working in a greenhouse. The country in which they live is not mentioned, as is the island where they live, although the film was made on Bergman's small island of Farö, directly in the north of Göttland on the Swedish island. It seems that their people have been fighting with the invading country for years or perhaps they have been engaged in a civil war against rebels in another province. It's all deliberately blurred, because this war is meant to symbolize all wars. This is reinforced when the film starts with the on-screen military quotes, such as the role of credit. These include Hitler's quotes for Vietnamese American soldiers. After the early scenes depicting the prosperous nature of their rural life and the advent of war, where even old men are forced, the aerial attack destroys Rosenberg's land because enemy jets are flying overhead, bombs are falling and what seems to be the chemical agents of Orange agent like nature. One plane is hit and the parachute jumps out and comes in the hanging tree. Jan, who starts the movie as a strangling coward, refuses to go and help, so Eva goes alone. Jan joins him and they find the pilot is fired. It seems that he is indeed part of an intruder or perhaps a rebel. A number of government soldiers will soon stop at their home and ask questions about a dead pilot, then suggest that a couple leave home because the invaders are near. the film is misinterpreted at the micro level, such as Marcman Gervais, a Bergman scientist, who makes movie comments on the movie DVD. Like many other critics, he claims that Jacobi is Quisling who has collaborated with Invaders. But this is obviously misleading because Jacobi is the original fascist government. As a testimony, for the first time, the invaders have been marginalized after they have invaded Rosenberg lands and shot their agitproporium. We know this because the government, which later interviews them with a fake interview, and the words in the mouth of Eva, see the film as an evident proof of its betrayal, and Jacobi works with them clearly, the fascist big brother statisticians. Secondly, Jacobi is responsible for what kind of citizen has been gathered in camps, working with intruders, and Rosenbergs have been saved again. Third, Jacobi says his son has left the army, and when he was an intruder, he is not so happy about his son who serves the country. Likewise, the rebel forces are neither official armies nor official holidays. Finally, Filip is clearly an organization's rebels or intruders and why would he have colleague killed? <br /> <br /> Gervais and other critics misinterpreted and misinterpreted such a key, both obviously and unintentionally, and the obvious point of this film questions their ability to distinguish all aspects of Bergman's films. It's a wonderful and wonderful film that is very high in the Berman canon, but it's a disappointment to read how so few critics and viewers have actually understood this complex message, rather than giving up cheap, lazy and simple claims on it just against the war and quite easy film, compared to two exemplary predecessors. And that is the shame of Shame in the long run.
