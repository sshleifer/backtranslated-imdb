Although "The Jackal" is a "better" aesthetic [and boat boat budget], this movie goes down to "Carlos" real staff ... <br /> <br /> Quinn stands out when The naval officer recruited Wiley Jackal to pull him out, and Kingsley and Sutherland turn himself out. Risking his family, his career, and everything he believes, he takes on the task, though completely unwanted. <br /> <br /> To put it more, it would break ... it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 Niro ~ Stars [of 4]
