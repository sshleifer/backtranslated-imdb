The film with its one-off, minimal cast and simple photography (with a few short special effects) reminds me of one of those old 60-minute playhouse dramas that are so popular in the early years of television. Nonetheless, the intercourse hangs over the poor war widow over East Lupino, as he tries to deal with Robert Ryan with his semi-psychotic master before one of his moods kills him. And who is better than the complicated part to play as a great actor Ryan. He wasn't very versatile - looking at the essay comedy is almost painful. But no one was better at wounded idealism (dangerous surface) or the mental pain of this film. Few actors could express as much of their eyes as this lean and harsh figure. <br /> <br /> The problem with Lupino is that he is locked in his house with a man who is kind and gentle at one point and rushes to the next. The thrill comes from his various ploys to keep him happy during the escape. This is the whole nail tip. This is not one of Lupino's many good "spiritual" parts that he was so good at. Instead, it has a role that many smaller actors could have dealt with well enough. My favorite scene is Ryan and Bratty teenager Margaret Whiting. Ryan already has difficulties with his masculinity and what others are saying about him. When Whiting walks and finds an attractive look on Ryan's floor, he begins to flirt with his promising sexuality. In the process of creating problems, Ryan abruptly drops away - fineness is not his strong suit. Destroyed, Whiting attacks her masculinity, calling her work "for women's work". It does that. Until then, he has been polite and professional with Lupino, trying to set himself on a normal path. But whiting has hit its raw nerve. Now it is a hell to pay because Whiting bounces out of the door, leaving Lupino to pay the price. This is a raging scene that has been expertly made. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is one of the films produced by Lucino and his wife at a time when viewers were away from their small black and white screens in favor of wide-screen glasses. Damage. What a tremendous talent was behind and behind the camera. He deserves at least the honor of Oscar for the film industry, to whom he contributed so much.
