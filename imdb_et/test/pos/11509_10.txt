The film tells of Paul (Páll), a young man who succumbs to madness and his presence at the "Kleppur" mental hospital and his friends. Victor (Viktor), who, while studying in England, started thinking that he was Adolf Hitler. Peter (Pétur), who took a lot of LSDs and tried to fly from the roof, did not lose broken bones or physical damage only with madness, he is against China. Was Beatle (Óli Bítill) There was the most time spent in the hospital, though Viktor is a little older than him, he says he wrote and sent telepathy to each Beatles song. <br /> <br /> The novel is a better film and covers all of Paul's life from birth to death, watching the film for a long time, but when I remember it, it does not reflect Paul's childhood. <br /> <br /> Englar Alheimsins is funny, sad and powerful if you haven't seen it. and read the novel first, making the movie better
