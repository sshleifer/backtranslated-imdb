This film set the standard for excellence in African-American films when it was made. I heard the movie from different stories over time, that the nomination for the academic award was a boost. This movie plays different emotions and you will definitely feel all the signs. Of course, some actors are a bit of wood, but fortunately these parts are not important. Music is sensational, and if you do not believe that the end is a tear-jerker, you have no heart in your heart. When you look at "Cooley High", you will see that many movies have copied many of the elements to strengthen their movies. The biggest example of this is "Boyz N The Hood".
