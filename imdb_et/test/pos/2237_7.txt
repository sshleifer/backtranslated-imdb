I tried this movie late on television and waited for a low budget campy "masterpiece", I was surprised by a pretty decent movie. Angelina Jolie's unique ability to act (or if I should say its absence?) Makes her perfect as an android, and the other participants, though terribly average, are at least not terrible. <br /> <br /> There's a plot; quite a complicated chart that includes conspiracies and the length that a couple (one person, one android) will continue with its illegal romance, along with the "big brother" type and confused with the dropped android-murderer. Production and kits were also much better than expected. I haven't seen the original Cyborg so I can't really compare that much; This movie is not a Blade Runner, but a late night, futuristic guilty joy that is worth watching.
