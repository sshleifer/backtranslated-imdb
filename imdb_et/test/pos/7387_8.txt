If the ending was not so fantastically unexpected, I don't think I could appreciate this movie so well. <br /> <br /> This film has a lot of inconvenience, embarrassment, "disintegration" in nature. This kind of thing is not my kind of drama, so the pace seemed to me dragging. <br /> <br /> In addition, the main characters are complicated, and so they care a lot - the husband (Alan Rickman) is bitter and the tough and the woman (Polly Walker) is aside and a bit naughty. The action was just good (Norman Reedus was very tempting), but the characters themselves were perhaps a bit too realistic (for me). <br /> <br /> The setting was nice and appropriately isolated and a little spooky. Cinema had something that seemed to me a bit old-fashioned. <br /> <br /> But the last 5-15 minutes of this movie are so brilliant that every awkward scene, inconvenient conversation and inexplicable character behavior is absolutely worth it. I thought every typical plot of the twist, except what happened. <br /> <br /> The end will definitely make this movie worth watching. Intrigue and drama, not quite as much.
