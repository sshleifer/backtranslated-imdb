Almenábar has once again given us the best quality film. This director is amazing and he has proven to be equally talented and effective in overcoming genres. <br /> <br /> The film's superb character through dialogue and personality, as well as finer details (Ramon's father's look), allows the audience to identify very closely with the main issues, changing the emotional impact of even more important and deeper events. Visual images are sometimes simple, at times stunning (beach dream) and I think that Almenábar films really benefit from compiling music - it fits perfectly with the different mood of the movie. <br /> <br More than just a film about euthanasia, which in itself is an important issue, this film deals with the person's duality, who from time to time really seems to enjoy life (albeit in a rather limited way), and another one who is blamed for her desire to die. The timid sense of humor, which seems all the more funny, is the overwhelming sadness of the film because they give the melancholy a welcome atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Although this is clearly in favor of euthanasia, this film is an excellent work that represents the many perspectives of Ramon's friends and family. The most striking thing was Ramon's father when he said, "There is only one thing worse than losing a child. The child wants to die." <br /> <br /> Excellent writing, acting, leadership, cinematography, music - 10/10.
