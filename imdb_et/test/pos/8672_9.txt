One of the best films I've seen for a long time is accurate in my vision and beautiful and very imaginative in realizing it. I can't say much without giving it up, and I don't want you to see much about this movie before - just look at it. <br /> <br /> But ah, there are ten lines of text to look at in the IMDb list. Conundrum. What can I do? Tell me about the movie? No. Can't do that. I think I enjoyed this movie just because I saw it without any excuse. Please do the same. <br /> <br /> I think this can be said: the actor is excellent and undervalued, and what I have loved against foreign films is that movies are actually movies, not stars.
