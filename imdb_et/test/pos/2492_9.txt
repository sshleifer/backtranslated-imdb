My curiosity and patience to finally see this controversial movie, which is now published for the first time in the United Kingdom on DVD, is more than rewarded. Peter Watkins has stood out with outstanding technical skills. This pseudo-documentary is certainly ahead of its time and still scary and timely. <br /> <br /> The film is inspired by the confusion of the United States in the sixties when the government has increased its legitimate use of violence and oppression, while the anti-war movement is increasingly reacting more violent and radical. So, the government has introduced so-called punishment parks to overcome the overcrowding of prisons and the special training of riot police units. Convicted 'criminals', mostly activists, are chosen to 'take years and years to jail' or spend three days in one of those parks where they get their freedom for their death or even longer prison sentences. . However, the situation in the parks is their worst. It reminded me of the real version of Battle Royale (2000). <br /> <br /> The film's structure is extremely effective and resembles the parallels with the Cannibal Holocaust, made almost ten years later. Both films are structured and filmed so that the viewer is in the thinking and cognition that he is actually watching a real documentary and is therefore shocked, although he is aware of the fact that it is a film. Both face the inherent violent nature of mankind, but where the cannibalistic Holocaust has no deeper meaning (first and foremost, it is a film of exploitation in every sense) and does not raise critical questions about the world situation Punishment Park does just that. <br /> <br /> I have been deeply impressed by the punishment park and I find it hard to believe that such a powerful and important film would have been rejected and marginalized for so long. Maybe it says enough about the truth of its content, how power structures work in this world. I disagree with Watkins' polarization and the criticism of stereotypes, because the film depicts the activists and the legitimate power structures who are actually as polarized as here. If they were not, there would be no conflict in our society and therefore no change. In reality, the confrontation between these two groups often takes on stereotypical forms, be it between activists and founding in Latin America, Russia or New York. If these groups were not polarized to these extremes, activists would be part of the silent majority who, by default, complain, but at the same time live in the injustices of the world. <br /> <br /> As Peter Watkins tells us a DVD introduction, Punishment Park participants are mostly amateurs. Most children were real activists from LA, most police officers were part of national forces, and even some members of the judiciary are part of the social and political creation of time. Without introducing both groups, the spontaneous and improvised feeling adds to the scenes in the improvised courtroom. Parallels are drawn with time-related issues, such as the repression of Black Panther members (one of the black prisoners resembles a convicted charismatic BPleader Bobby Seale) and Chicago's seven trials. <br /> <br /> I admire the obvious and sincere attitude of Watkins to injustice and his concerns about human rights and the increasingly repressive actions of governments (nowadays in the name of the war of terror) to silence those who disagree and refuse to brainwash. The punishment park remains a very important film that should be shown in schools and seen by everyone who shares these concerns. Perhaps this can finally be done by marginalization.
