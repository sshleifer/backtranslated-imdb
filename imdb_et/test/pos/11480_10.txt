I think this movie is a complete masterpiece - I think it is Fernando Fragata's best work and no doubt the best of Portuguese films. I don't think you could get such a "zero-budget" type movie as impressive and amazing as it is. <br /> <br /> The direction is made at an incredibly fast pace and the music is also made up of Fragata is mostly excellent. At the same time, the story is creepy and humorous, and it is certainly an advanced study of old words: "Misery loves the company", which is intertwined with the amazing secret of the mind. More than a perfect recipe for gliding the eyes of viewers on the screen between one and another. <br /> <br /> This is called Neo-Hitchcock and I agree. Like the best Hitchcocks, he kept a glimpse of the whole film and most of my assumptions were far from being intelligently out.
