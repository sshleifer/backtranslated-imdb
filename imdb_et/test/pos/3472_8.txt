Let's get clear from the beginning: I'm a asshole with an emotional sensitivity of a cubic stone. Therefore, I consider the drama and cry of people with disabilities, social stigma, or any kind of illness, and talk about it as weak bad films. I mean, if you have a message, you can say it without the help of sick or bad people. <br /> <br /> But I liked this movie. It concerns people who have unbelievable happiness because personal health goes, but they do not call it, on the contrary, they try to live and people try to "protect" or "take care" of their active removal from real life. The message is a living life in full, even if the end is as sad as possible. <br /> <br /> My conclusion: As the dramas of sick people go, it's the keeper. It's sad but budding. I like James McAvoy, even if he always looks like an arrogant uprising. I also say that Steven Robertson played very well. Is it or it actually has partial paralysis. :)
