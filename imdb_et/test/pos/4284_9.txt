The plot of this wonderful mindset is so much more complex than film as infidelity and responsibility for an accident. I was hit by a man, Wilkinson, who wanted a driver, the initial vision when he thought it was Everett, released to the police, and the heart (and morals) changed when he learned he was his wife. He was also really good and / or he was trying to redeem himself by letting him go with Rupert. Then things were decided and SHE decided that the right to do so was to testify that he was hit. The most important thing is the issue of redemption (in the case of an accident - infidelity - in its odd, faulty path) in the treatment of Watson's Everett's most ill patients. I believe that is why he struggled. <br /> <br /> This seems to be a common theme in today's British novels: Brideshead Revisited, Affair's end is reminded. Love it.
