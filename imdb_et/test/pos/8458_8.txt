Intelligent, nail-biting drama came out somewhere in 1979 and soon it was on the cover of every American newspaper (as a life-imitating film). An employee of a South California nuclear power plant is threatened by a boss if he decides to go public if the real story of a plant accident is. Probably a stuck valve problem, a television news team movie, shows that it was an accident that attacked catastrophic proportions - and worse, the safety conditions are cleaned up by millions of dollars to save everyone's lives. Sometimes the film becomes too technical (especially in the second half) and can use more human activity, but Jack Lemmon, Jane Fonda (like the post-coffee news-on-time in time), and Michael Douglas (freelance operator) are great. The bits accompanying the nuclear protesters are so precise and bitterly satirical, as well as the news text (the structure and coats of your company are men) are caught alive. *** 1/2 from ****
