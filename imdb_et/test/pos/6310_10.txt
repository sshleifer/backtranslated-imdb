Well, where I start ... <br /> <br /> As one of the other reviewers said, you know you're a real dinner when you see the opening technique - minutes and minutes of the movie time spent by the man who is traveling. <br /> <br /> I don't repeat Rubin's great story. But I would like to say that this movie captured me more than any movie I remember. I sat in the word of mouth and on the edge of my seat all the way. The camera works, soundtrack and * fantastic * performances (especially Tony Servillo) lead you to the screen and don't let you watch. <br /> <br /> It is Italian, so of course everyone looks fantastic, but it's not just a cool style. It's a movie that has a lot to say about happiness, loss, and love. <br /> <br /> Go and see it.
