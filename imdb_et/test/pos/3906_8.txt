I remember watching this movie, when it did. week's movie in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> Although I haven't seen this movie for over 30 years, I remember how scary it was ... in the sister's dead body cellar, storm rage outside, horrible house where there is no electricity and a murderer still in the room. <br /> <br /> They just don't make such movies anymore. Elizabeth Montgomery was a very undervalued actor and I liked it not only in "Betwitched" but also in several of her Bewitched roles, such as this one and the 1975 "Lizzie Borden Legend". <br /> <br /> I really want someone to come out with a DVD that has several 1970's of movies on one DVD. Wouldn't it be fantastic to watch "When Michael Calls", "Bad Ronald", "Don't be afraid of the Blind", "Crowhaven Farm", etc., all in one DVD? I know there is a market for a DVD that is for all of the baby boom generations who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s. Perhaps, if we are happy, someone will offer us a DVD that has a great selection of t.v. such films.
