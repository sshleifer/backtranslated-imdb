Dear Readers, 2001: Space Odyssey is Kubrick's best ... although I really can't say that Space Odyssey is his only movie I've ever watched. But still it's a good movie. Strange but good. <br /> <br /> The film is in three works, similar to a novel that is surprising because the author wrote the script. Anyway, let's start with a simple but remarkable opening, which also features Sparach Zarathustra on the speakers. Then there will be a boring disbelief in the "Human Dawn" sequence. Then there is the strange "Finding Monoliths" on the Moon, played by Strauss's Blue Danube. In the end, things become scary for spaceship scenes and HAL and people kill. After that, things will die and we will have a "Entry into the Monolith" sequence that was too long and a very weird end. Although, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a good movie. It's not Star Wars, Stargate, Terminator, or Abyss, it's rocks. My congratulations to Chef Kubrick. <br /> <br /> A signed, continuous DVD collector
