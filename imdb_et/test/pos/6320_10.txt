I have this movie. I'm actually from the same city as the brothers' leaders. But it doesn't make the movie better. But if one night you don't want to look serious and not welcome, I strongly recommend the demon in the summer. Yes, the lines are cheesy and the plot is horny. But it contains the key elements of horror / comedy. I just want to see some kids in the small town make the full effects of the movie. And I say "bravo" to Campelli's brothers. Now they make more movies and continue a long dream. Demon Summer was one of the films that will help them start a great career with a great future.
