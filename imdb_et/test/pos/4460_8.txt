DO NOT HIGHLIGHT (Lucio Fulci - Italy 1972). <br /> <br /> It is definitely the most indispensable candidate for the craziest title of the movie and it is a great achievement in giallo. Originally, the film titled "Don't Torture Donald Duck", literally translated from the Italian title. The little Donald Duck figure briefly plays as a toy, but it is hardly enough to change such a title, but apparently it changed due to fear of Disney's legal consequences. I drove a little bit of Fulci's earlier LIZARD woman's leather (1971), but here's all the right ingredients. Surprisingly effective mystery, good against false and unimaginable landscapes. Everything just clicks. I think it is rightly welcomed as one of the most accomplished achievements of the director. <br /> <br /> The story is placed in a small mountain area in Sicily, where someone kills young teenage boys. Among the suspects is the most obvious young woman, Maciara (Florinda Balkan), a self-proclaimed witch who is suspicious of discovering a child's skeleton and sticking pins. Guiseppe, the village idiot, is also a suspect because he made a weak attempt to benefit from the disappearance of one boy and walked directly into his trap. By the time a new instant message (Tomas Milian) arrives in Milan to cover his murders, he will immediately question the assumptions of the authorities when he meets two other suspects: the moody attitude of local priest Don Alberto (Marc Porel) and Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet), boring A young woman from a woman with a worrying past about drug abuse, which also attracts sexual relations with young boys in the city. Talk about your main red Baltic herring. <br /> <br /> Fulci contrasts with the modern and traditionally elevated highway that passes through the Sicilian mountains, passing through old cities, where life is still firmly established in tradition and superstition. One could discuss the political attitude of the film between the Nordic and South countries or comment on the virtues of small towns - general conventions of society - which are too often dangerously close to moral degradation, chaos and - ultimately - the justice of the population. The film is often interrupted because of its Catholic tone, but it is not a very important element here, except for obvious grounds relating to plots that would give too much. It's actually pretty much like a movie like Joël Seria's NOT US EVIL (1971). Probably some insult in Sicily may be caused by the rather insecure image of the film about the Sicilian values ​​of small towns (if another boy dies, the local population is considered to be a sluggish lynx), but - given the problematic link between Sicily and the rest of Italy - I think it is not for other Italians problematic. The film won too quickly vague to have much influence anyway. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Fulc, the amount of gore is usually the main subject of discussion. Although there are no scenes in the eye, the film contains two very graphic scenes. In the final outflow, the murderer climbs a rock, breaking his face along the rocks with terrible results (though not very realistic). And in the tomb room with Florinda in the tomb of the Balkans, Fulci's desire for sadistic violence and usually does not keep him graphically showing what most filmmakers just suggest. Certainly, Fulci's repertoire is one of the most terrible scenes. Above all, it is a tense, well-written, effective little mystery that is nicely lenses by Fulc, an impressive genre game like Barbara Bouchet, Marc Porel (not particularly convincing as a priest), Tomas Milian and Florinda Balkan (mouth-blowing crazy as a city witch) . <br /> <br /> Obscura Camera 8/10
