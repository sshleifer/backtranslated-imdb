I'm a 55-year-old pretty busy gay man. Since I don't watch TV, I watch at least 250 movies a year, mostly on DVD. I keep notes for all movies I watch and appreciate. Since December 2003, I've only seen five movies from eighteen. So, I appreciated EIGHTEEN better than at least 700 other last films. Mr. Bell is too modest in his movie commentary. Eighty is a great movie. And it also brought two "first" for me. <br /> <br /> I was watching the movie for the first time and I was swallowed up in the last half hour and withered something that happened to me only three times earlier. (Five minutes of the movie I knew it would be very good.) When Jason started talking to Whitman, I lost it and then ... Kiss. Well, this is one of the big kisses in the movie, and this is the scene of Filmdomi's most terrible and unforgettable. When Pip blows at the end of the candle and the credit rolls, I got stuck. I rejoiced. I love the happy ending. I'd love. <br /> <br /> Then I looked at the trailer and the TLA previews and thought, "Okay, is it $ 800,000, or is Indie really so big?" So, I immediately looked at EIGHTEEN, something that happened only three times before. And eighty blew my socks again, even more. Then I watched the documentary "Making Eighteen" and was amazed by Mr and Mr Bell. <br /> <br /> So I thought I'd look back at EIGHTEEN's director's comment. I've never seen a movie three times in the evening. After the third time, at 3:00, I knew I had just experienced a big movie; The eighteenth is now with its 10th best film at 10am. And in the small universe of very small homo or homo textiles, there is Brokeback Mountain, Eighty, Mulholland Drive and Maurice. <br /> <br /> Thank you Mr Bell! Eighty is brilliant and fully realized, with great pain, superbly moving, underrated score, excellent cinematography, entertaining, movable, perfectly matched and humming song. I can go on, but I don't move too much. <br /> <br /> This movie should have become Oscar nominees, certainly one of the best pictures. The performances were excellent. Mrs Gill's cute and shy voice was a surprising epiphany. And Sir Ian McKellen? "Nuf said. Awesome. <br /> <br /> Eighty is why I was hoping for over 200 mediocre, totally frightening movies (some $ 150 million plus range) a year to find one treasure that's one fine, magical, unique and unique enchanting, perfect "Faberge egg" that includes an unforgettable heart. <br /> <br /> Finally (I promise), my second "first" - I've never commented on any movies before. < br /> <br /> Thank you again, Mr Richard Bell, an amazing genius, give this man $ 100 million for his next film, making $ 700,000 for one of the top 50 films. $ 75,000 a year living expenses and fit with my next film collection, Mr. Bell is already a 31-year-old director, can you imagine him at the age of 45? <br /> <br /> Intelligent, witty, gentle and brutal, boy embarrassing, undervalued, but sharp, chilling and exciting, fairy tale sparkling, haunting, unforgettable: EIGHTEEN, MASTERPIECE.
