We see at the beginning of Little Dieter that the theme of the film is Dieter Dengler, obsessive compulsive. Or at least it seems that it has a continuous opening / closing of the doors and a large grocery store with a large basement. So, Director Werner Herzog puts the central question of why Dieter is like that. In fact, he is not necessarily obsessive compulsive, as he is simply, well prepared. And why shouldn't he be after his life? In addition to the Juicens, the darkest and most exasperating and frightening, and simply haunted survival that is the core of the picture, Dieter also has a story. For example, Dieter's own childhood was a slogan from the very beginning, being in the "blue walls" of post-war Germnay, a poor family with no food or prospects. But enter into a passion that does not yield (which is, of course, part of Herzog's bread and victory and love in your films) that flies, and for Dieter there was nothing but to fill it. What leads to becoming a US citizen is more than he could have afforded. <br /> <br /> Dieter is one of Herzog's most appealing, distinctive and compassionate indicators throughout his career. The man who remembers is a brutal memory of the time he is a Vietnamese, though at least it provides some of the most influential conversations in the documentary of the last 20 years. Ironically, storytelling is done differently from The Wild Blue Yonder - mostly Dieter's many and many exposures related to some of the most detailed details of his time in various prison camps (tactics of torture, bugs, brutal, sad violence and threats like a wedding ring), and fifth the most interesting and sad parts of your best friend Duan. They escaped from prisons, but found that their trip to Cambodia would not be so easy. Now, for the most part, the speech speaks of something that is tempting, that is, when Dieter looks through his stories and occasionally reactivates it (modern Herzog could only do it if Dieter was already middle aged, who is in handcuffs and all through the jungle), you can remember it all. All this becomes even more lively to try to realize these little details and their intensity together. This Herzog keeps these parts simple and knows when to keep Dieter in their responses, making it even more important. He's never completely "normal," but unlike Timothy Treadwell, you don't even think of laughing at him. <br /> <br /> So with your hero (whether war or not, it's hard to say if Dieter argues that the claim that dead people were true heroes, typical but perhaps quite real, Stylishes Herzog with his old film footage, describing Dieter's early life (period of WW2 scenes and posting German debris) is always an enchanting vision, and Herzog gets up with his timing and compilation of music, and records Vietnamese videos of jungle and field views. Herzog is also very wise not to inject politics into politics, there is no "me Americans used", nor what is mixed. There is even a point that Dieter does not hold too much terrible things that happened to him that what happens during the war (and of course he fell from his plane to people with bombs). Now, through a lot of these harassing and even smaller bits that are involved in prisons, bathrooms, and food scraps, always scary Herzog also controls humor. One of my favorite scenes in a movie, where Herzog broke for a moment at Dieter, is when he shows a "trainee" movie that is used by American soldiers to show what should happen if they give up just in the jungle. all the moves they could include, including a knife, a burner, and a very fast helicopter to come around (and put it to a fun dead job). <br /> <br /> But even the moments where one laughs brings absurd moments during an absolute crisis and how one can never imagine being alone in an outdoor area surrounded by people doing something to hold that person in war form in the form of a security. Without knowing that flying and airplanes are the only lifestyle he'd ever want to get (and ending his movie in a wonderfully low light, an elegant note where he drives off a big plane), Dieter knows what he has to do to survive at all costs. Yet, as in many of the films directed by Herzog's main characters, there is an almost unchanging spirit that persists when a person is strong enough, even between fearful moments (Dunae's fate) and problems to salvation to a helicopter (whether he is an American or a spy, they ask the chopper). Dieter is such a spiritual man and, through Herzog, has given a fantastic, tragic, creative, well-photographed, though perhaps too short, respect to his life. And, of course, it will pump me even more for the future drama of Rescue Dawn.
