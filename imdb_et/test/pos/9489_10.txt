Zeppelin is my favorite band, so when I heard that double-dvd came out, I was reasonably excited. I just cut it back and say that if you are a fan of Zeppelin, you have to buy it and buy it right away! This is quite remarkable! It blows out "The song remains the same" completely out of the water. Why this material has never been released before is over. The film shown here really shows Zep at the top of my game, which I never knew "song" really did. Jimmy Page is undoubtedly the best, and these performances make Jimi Hendrix look like a chump! Be on the look of the lively jam "White Summer" ... wiva! <br /> <br /> Viva Jimmy page! <br /> <br /> Viva Led Zeppelin! <br /> <br /> 11 out of 10
