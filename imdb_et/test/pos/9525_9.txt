Railway children, at least the 1970 version of the film, written and directed by Lionel Jeffries, a longtime British actor, is a unique ... classic. It speaks of a childhood story with great simplicity and charm; sentimentality is silenced; involved in childhood adventures; and Jeffries brings intelligence and style to their production. <br /> <br /> The Waterbury family is leading the idyllic life of Edwardian in London. Father is blooming, mother is beautiful and loving, kids are good and fond, home is warm and cozy. Then one evening during the Christmas holidays, two men appear on the door, talk quietly with their father and take it away. After a while, Waterbury (Dinah Sheridan) and Bobbie, 14 (Jenny Agutter), Phyllis, 12 (Sally Thomsett) and young Peter (Gary Warren) have been changed. Only their certainty and good spirits see them. Now, Mrs. Waterbury is talking about poverty, so that children live in a picturesque old cottage in a rural area near a railway, not too far from a small village train station. Children discover the track and regularly sit on a small hill to drive passengers on the train. One day, an old newspaper that goes to the city of his business looks at his newspaper and finds himself back. It is not a long time before it has a story. When the time passes, Mrs Waterbury brings all her love and intelligence to her children. He starts writing stories for making money. He teaches them his lessons and provides them with warmth and security. But the story is about these three children, especially Bobbie. At 14 he is old enough to share his mother's concerns, but young enough to enjoy his sister and brother's adventures. They find a station that can't speak English. They discover that he is a Russian refugee who no longer knows where his wife and child are. They demand that he come home, and their mother takes him in. Before long, the children have written to the old gentleman about the assistance requested on the train. They help young men to break in the train tunnel. Soon he's home. They decide they have a birthday party for the captain of the station, a man with few friends and several children who are sticky for his dignity. It is not a long time before children help him to understand the difference between friendship and charity. In other words, the three children in their childhood adventures encounter all kinds of problems and can be important to see that all the problems are happy. But what are their own problems? Finally, Bobbie learns from her mother that her father was taken away because she was accused of treason by giving state secrets to the Russians. Can Bobbie find a way to help? Is the old gentleman more than just an old gentleman on a passing train? Will their father's case be opened again? Is there a happy ending? <br /> <br /> Jenny Agutter was almost 18 years old when he was part of the film; He plays 14-year-old Bobbie with great naturalness and charm. As important as other players, especially when Dinah Sheridan as mother, is the heart of the Agutter story. For me, Jenny Agutter's talent and Lionel Jeffries make her movie so memorable. Story problems do not raise serious doubts but are solved. And Jeffries doesn't just give us a professionally customized and targeted movie, adds touches that are hardly noticed, but that fascinate us. It may only include a freezing frame of one second than two people; or a small yellow wild water that is in the grass outside of Bobbie's home, then slowly pulling the yellow oil lamp that is on; or the notion that a delightful interior design or a green countryside view or a look at a train station from the mountain ... all suddenly resemble these charming Edwardia hand-tinted perfect timed drawings. Perhaps this gentle story cannot compete with the time children today need their Nintendo monster-spatting skills. I am almost positive that it will not be the attention of most of these parents, especially Batman and Leone weaned children. However, this is a completely assembled film and should not be forgotten. 19 years later, this story was back on television. This time, mother was Jenny Agutter.
