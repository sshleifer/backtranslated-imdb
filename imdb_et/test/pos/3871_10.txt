Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been! I love watching her! I was 10 years old (1979) when I first saw him. I look forward to unexpectedly anyone he acts on. hopefully one day I will see him personally. he is very hypnotic and mysterious and this voice is command and strong! she is very attractive, even now she is 65 years old she is absolutely stunning !!!! I think she's the biggest actor ever seen iv'e! I adored her in "Dracula" (with many other girls) and "God-created woman", "D" house, "Jason and argonauts" and more. I thought he was a genius !!!!!! can't wait to see her "good night and happiness"
