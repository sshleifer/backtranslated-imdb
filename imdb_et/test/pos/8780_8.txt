There are many familiar Hitchcock elements (from previous and later films), and this time they are blended with fun but hardly stopping entertainment. You can say that Dorothy Parker had a manuscript in hand, the most memorable scenes being the heroes' Cummings dialogues with the blind, and his meeting with a rather bizarre circus group. Famous Highs The Statue of Liberty seems a bit heavy - rated according to today's standards, but also compared to other Hitch monument finals (eg Blackmail, North by Northwest).
