Once, in Sweden, was the Sister of the Salvation Army. At the door of death he asks: "Send David Holm!" But Victor Sjöström (David Holm) can't live because he spends his year-round cemetery with his drinking coffees. The deadly sister Astrid Holm (as editor) wants to see if praying for Sjöström's soul over the past year has yielded results; allegedly it has not been. In the tomb, Sjöström tells the story of The Phantom Carriage, which he heard from his dead friend Tore Svennberg (Georges). According to the legend, the last person who dies every year has to accept the soul of the dead, until the New Year's Eve arrives ... <br /> <br /> Director Sjöström, whose leadership is very strong, unites photographer Julius Jaenzon to create a visually pleasing film. The great "double exposure" effect is often used but never seems superfluous; and it does not make the other dramatic adventures of the film less memorable (for example, the tearing of the Sjöström sewn coat and the tenting of the door). The story of Selma Lagerlöf was probably not something you could or would not want to break in the 1920s, which may or may not be why hoping to end this film is hopeless. And unlike similar spiritual stories, it is hard to stop your infidelity if you think too carefully about what is really happening in Körkarlen. <br /> <br /> ******* Roundabout (1/1 / 21) Victor Sjöström ~ Victor Sjöström, Hilda Borgström, Tore Svennberg
