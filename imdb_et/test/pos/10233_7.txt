If you are looking for an initial horror, it may be for you. It's strange and at times stupid, but it's just as good-looking, nice-sounding and original film, it's never failed, except maybe over the top. "Nightbreed" is terrific for fans or fans of monster films. <br /> <br /> Boone (Craig Sheffer) has got dreams of a city called Midian, full of mutant creatures. His therapist, Dr. Decker (director of horror David Cronenberg), has come to the conclusion that Boone is a murderer and gives him hallucinogenic tablets and tells him to turn himself on. After almost killing, Boone ends up in a hospital where she runs to a mental patient who also knows Midian and tells Boone where to go. In the tomb, Midian is inhabited by viable mutant creatures who don't let Boone enter. After only a nasty bite, the police escaped Boone, whom Dr Decker led to his seat. But Boone is not dead. The bite causes her to live and she goes to Midian. At the same time, Boone's girlfriend, Lori (Anne Bobby), tries to find Boone and get it down. If Dr. Decker knows about this place, there will be chaos. <br /> <br /> The plot looks long and complicated, but it's hard to understand. Among other things, the plot makes this film very interesting. Make-up effects are amazing. Creatures look unique and amazing and make it a very attractive film. To add more senses to the complaint, we have Danny Elfman's musical result that is both lush and hitting and fits the film like a glove. The shots in the movie are also beautifully created. Cinema is cute and the film creates an atmosphere that has never been broken. Even the actor is good, the biggest surprise is the director David Cronenberg, which gives a great, intimidating result to a man who, for one reason or another, wants to see Boon. It's strange that the horror film would have been well done. <br /> <br /> The film's problems ... are few, but the positive ones outweigh the negative ones. The script has random flat jokes to try and add humor, but almost everyone falls off. Mutant creatures look good and for the most part they have worked well, but sometimes they just seem to be their awesome makeup for the camera. The worst part of the movie should be the climax. It takes so long and is just a constant chaos. It is part of a movie that moves from individual characters and nice tight-knit frames, explosions from every direction, and violence that happens to characters we don't know or care about. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is amazing to watch. This is a well-made horror film, but even so, it is a randomly failed character and a dirty climax. However, this is the one you look at. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** out ****. 101 minutes. R for strong violence and language.
