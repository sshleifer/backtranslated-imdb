This version of The Lost Horizon is not a bad film at all. I think the problem is people who want to choose musicals, especially those made in the 70s. I saw the movie after its initial release in 1973 (I was ten) and enjoyed it, especially music. (Burt Bacharach has always been a favorite.) The story is fun, the actor is good and technically excellent. Of course, there are one or two rather foolish dance numbers, but hey, you can't beat everyone. I have this movie on video and I watch it every so often ... and I enjoy it every time!
