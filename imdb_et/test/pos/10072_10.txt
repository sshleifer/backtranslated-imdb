If you like Madonna or not, this movie is fun! I'm a Madonna fan and saw it in the theater when it was released. But over time it hasn't lost its stupidity and pure fun. Of course there are some bad features and cheesy functioning, but the whole movie is just a screwball comedy with Madonna actually carrying the whole movie with a big bomb. She is a cute, funny and only comedic role in her film career. Madonna usually only plays a role in herself, but looks at her as Nikki Finn in this movie, she looks like someone else. Of course, James Foley (who starred in the dramatic and haunting "close-up" with Sean Penn & Christopher Walken) and starring Griffin ("After Hours") who is also perfectly cast and fun. material. The story is not genius and does not expect any climate change, but if you are in the mood to watch a fun, clean, 80s romp, or if you are a Madonna fan when it is BLACK SEE. Soundtrack is also very remarkable and includes 4 Madonna songs: # 1 hits "Who's That Girl", # 2 hits "Couning A Commotion" and one of her best ballads "Love of Love" (Top 10 Hit in the UK) and " Can't Stop, which has been left over from True BLue sessions last year, is only available in VHS, but will soon be available on DVD.
