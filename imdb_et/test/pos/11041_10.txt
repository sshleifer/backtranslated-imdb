Review of Greta Garbo's GREAT Classic movie and thought her performance was great. At the same time, his greatest performance was the German version, which had English captions. Greta Garbo even told the press that the German film was her favorite, where she had to change the sound of Silent. Gretal had a high-pitched voice and had to do the lessons to reduce her voice for her future roles in the movies. This story was very sad because Greta Garbo (Anna Christie), "Ninotchka", 39, was a young boy and his father violent as peasants as a sailor and then a captain of a coal park. Old NYC, Brooklyn Bridge, Coney Island and Manhattan Skyline were many scenes. Charles Bickford (Matt Burke), "Days of Wine & Roses", a classic veteran actor gave a great supportive role.
