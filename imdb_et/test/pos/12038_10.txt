It's a tough movie that comes in the United States, but if you find it - and you're interested in Percy Aldridge Grainger's life and music, you're a treat. This is pretty historical accuracy. Richard Roxborough Grainger looks amazingly like Grainger in this time period. Emily Woofi Karen Holten is a bit more beautiful than the real Karen, but it was an inaccuracy I was happy to discover (!). I think what really struck me was how well Roxborough photographed Grainger's outrageous personality. Barbara Hershey's rose was also a treasure. If he looks much younger than Rose did, it is more than just how he hit Rose's obsession with Percy. It's a simple movie to recommend. (Note that when he saw "Passion", my wife Grainger and her music had no special affinity (or knowledge), but she was completely fascinated by the film.
