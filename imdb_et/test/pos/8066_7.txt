Mary Pickford plays Annie Rooney - a police daughter who lives in a tough part of the city. He is a rough and drummer young man in an indefinite age (somewhere between 12-16) who loves to break down, but a deep heart has a golden heart. <br /> <br /> This is a very typical style for Mary Pickford. Like many of his films, he plays a young girl - although he was almost 40 years old when he was making LITTLE ANNIE ROONEY. And like many other stories, he was so weird and brave. As a result, I had a strong déjà vu feeling. If you haven't seen other movies yet, that's not the problem. However, he essentially plays a character similar to SPARROWS or DADDY LONG LEGS - although these two films are much better. Now this does not mean that it is a bad film - it is certainly not its best work - mostly thanks to the "Schmaltzy" story, which is very sensitive but not particularly convincing. An entertaining, but not essential, watch if you are not a fan of big silks.
