My husband and I looked at it last night ... It was wonderful. It moved very fast and the actor was great. Anyway, I adore Tom Wilkinson. He never made me a bad movie. The above description of his behavior hits the nail on his head ... Facial expressions are incredible. Even the scenic landscape is fantastic. We've just finished watching all of Prime's suspected series and I'm convinced the British have the chance to hit the audience. There is no doubt that I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to have some fun for hours.
