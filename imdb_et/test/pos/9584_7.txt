OK, so I admit that it often seems that most Sylvester / Tweety pairs have exactly the same plot: Sylvester tries to get a Tweet but repeatedly fails and always fails in the process, often with a bulldog. I think it's like Wile E. Coyote, who kidnapped Road Runner (in other words, mammals should never go after the birds). "All Bir-r-rd" has the same plot and puts it on the train. In some ways, the best part of these cartoons is to see which schemes Sylvester comes out to try and go after the Tweetet. We know he is failing, but it is also funny to see how Tweety turns into a bad ass (if you have seen his really early cartoons, you see that he wasn't at all "cute", but actually was a brutal streak). It works mainly to pass the time. <br /> <br /> By the way, I thought I saw - I mean, I'm trying - Sylvester gives him a trunk called Friz Freleng.
