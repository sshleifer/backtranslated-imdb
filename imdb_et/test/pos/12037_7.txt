In January, Turner's classic film channel spent one of his favorite actress Robert Montgomery films. His films are rarely seen these days, except for those that were atypical during most of his career - that is, the roles that are repeatedly on television are those that were spent, DOWNLOADING, JUNE BRIDE, NIGHT ON FALL, SAXON CHARM, RACE CASH HORSE, RAGE IN HEAVEN, CHICAGO EARL (briefly the films he fought to get roles because they weren't the usual comic fluff he usually appeared). It is ironic that nowadays, when we think of Montgomery's career, those films that were mostly made after 1937 were those that broke the original picture of MGM and Louis B. Mayer. Unfortunately, Montgomery was a talented comedy and recorded many movies routine. <br /> <br /> PETTICOAT FEVER is one such movie. Made in 1936 with PICADILLY JIM and TROUBLE FOR TWO, it was Montgomery's good performance banner year, which helped to convince MGM of the ability to play Danny at night. year. <br /> <br /> PETTICOAT FEVER is located in Labrador and Montgomery is the Dascom Dinsmore, the weather station operator. She has lived there for five years and has not been in the woman's business (except for Inuit women) for the most part. She has a girlfriend named Clara (Winifred Shotter) whom she suggested, but she has heard of her for two years so she believes she has given up on her. <br /> <br /> The Dinsmore world is rubbing when Sir James Felton and Irene Campton (Reginald Owen and Myrna Loy) appear. They flew to Toronto for a business meeting that Felton had to deal with. Felton is dealing with Campton, but Dinsmore finds his enchanting ... and gradually finds him equally attractive. It is certainly not pompous, in itself an important and hopelessly incorrect Felton competition (this is the dimension of Owen's behavior that he keeps the character fun even when it is hard to believe that such a boy is a master of Canadian industry). /> <br /> There is something surreal about this movie - probably due to the original game. Although the "Labrador" landscape is pretty funny, this is the purpose of comedy (witness, polar bear). But the height of surrealism is dinner Dinsmore serves its guests, a dinner of "bittersweet", which Owen eats with real pleasure. Owen (as a small-haired baronet) is dressed in normal clothing - suitable for the climate for the winter. But Montgomery is dressed in an evening dress (as if it were going to the ball at the embassy). Loy, seeing her dress, puts on a dress. They are served by Dinsmore's assistant, Inuit Kimo (Otto Yamaoka), who also wears an evening dress. - It turned out it's Owen! Owen, who had previously demanded that Dinsmore became a dress suitable for her station, is the only person who has dressed up for this dinner! Montgomery was MGM's most elegant actor with tuxedo or evening dress (Franchot Tone was his closest rival). This is a sneak-up movie when Montgomery or Fred Astaire was an elegant figure in such suits. It's hard to decide. <br /> <br /> Love does not move smoothly in comedy or drama. Clara appears (at the beginning of the movie, it has been hit too early when we see her on an icebound ship). Does Dinsmore break with Clara? Will Irene break with Felton? The movie is funny and Loy and Montgomery make a nice pair. They had appeared in another movie and both were in the second scene before that movie. But that would be their last movie together. <br /> <br /> One last interesting point - at the beginning of the movie, when credits are shown, you can see illustrations of men and women in comics. They are based on the work of John Held Jr., a great cartoonist / illustrator of the 1920s and 1930s, who was a flapper and "Jazz Age" recorder. It's an unusual choice - because it has nothing to do with a movie or Labrador.
