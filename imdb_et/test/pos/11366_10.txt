I followed this whole series when I was a child, selectively, not because it was in school. I read the stories at a pace. Experience gave me a lifelong love for Shakespeare and history. It even gave me a bit of an error, though only on the amateur level. Every time I read the history of Shakespeare, I first recall the derived black and white products that are seen on a large "furniture" TV with a rabbit ear antenna, with all the "ghosts" and nose that go though the kits were minimal, I remember correctly, it was totally irrelevant because it was so good. At that time, I had no idea who the participants were. Now I see that many of them are well known over the years. I especially liked Hotspur and Hal, whom I saw now, played by Sean Connery and Robert Hardy. I would love to see it on video, especially since many games are rarely made and there is less video. It would also be a valuable document from the mid-20th century on television.
