Large artists always suffered during the youth. I can mention Mozart and Beethoven, but that is not the case. <br /> <br /> This film was made by HG Clouzo, whose family wanted him to succeed in the legal professions. The biggest actor and also the director of the French theater before and after World War II. <br /> <br /> Both had health problems. Clouzot had tuberculosis among the young, Jouvet had heart problems and died in the theater. <br /> <br /> Such events shape the character of men (and of course women). It can even be said that today's artists are so poor because they have never suffered and fought for their lives. <br /> <br /> For me it is Clouzot's biggest film. "Fears of fears" are "tense" bigger, "Diabolique" also has more "tension" and a better plot, and this is more about "woman's evil". De Gaulle's entourage (mainly communists and Jews) blamed Clouzot for insecure co-operation with the Nazis and forbade films until De Gaulle left the French government in early 1946. De Gaulle came back in 1958. br /> The main characters are all good souls: Jenny L'Amour can play "putain" on the stage, but he is not a "whore" (dictionaries make synonyms of these words, but they are not the same), loves his wife and refuses small "presentations" (presumably lesbian) by Dora, a photographer. ‚ÄùMaurice, husband is jealous and crazy, but runs away from the offender. coward, because he fell in love with a woman and finally sold his love career more. <br /> <br /> Antoine, a detective (interpreted by great Louis Jouvet, mainly director, performs in French) Gray "no Noir, as well as EG Robinson" Double Compensation "shows the pseudo-criminals tenderness, tenderness of the Negro son (?) and compassion for the true author of the crime, because he remembers that his father cleans the latrines of some of the noblemen's office! <br /> <br /> he put him in the right mood, but deep inside he was very human. <br /> <br /> has his horoscope in front of me, he had Venus Amburis, which means openness, dedication, charity and altruism. For those who do not believe in astrology, my sincere apology ...
