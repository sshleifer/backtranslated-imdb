Thanks to the wide-ranging extraordinary scenes in many places in India and the Bollywood inspired plot that is still in fact justified, this very moving film is indispensable for those who love good romance / adventure. And that is why I mean "good", not Hollywood or Bollywood's simple and successful happy ending. In the East, West meets a different friend. The performances are inspired and brilliant, a cinematographic epic and a entertaining, engaging and brilliant heartbeat with no traces of skm, or cheap twitches. HARI OM is a sweet movie that doesn't bite. Look at this!
