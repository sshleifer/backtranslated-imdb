If you haven't watched the movie yet, but you like comedy, go out or buy at least! The fact that it won the Oscar animation is no coincidence! I haven't watched many other Wallace & Gromit movies (actually I think I looked at each other), but humor is very distinctive ... and some would say very British. Of course! <br /> <br /> The story is just an excuse for all the upcoming jokes, but even though it's not the most complicated, it's still working (by the way, my niece thought one of the biggest surprises would come, I didn't do it on Kudos, o)) . I think after you watch it, you go out and look for the other W&G movies out there. Have fun!
