The wind comes with one of the most popular books ever printed. This is by far the film of all movies. Romantika between Scarlett and Rhett made people dream of the whole world and turned leading actors into cinematic icons. One might wonder if it is really necessary to continue? And ... there are some great shoes to complete. <br /> <br /> Well, the book was the first. Alexandra Ripley's Scarlett, we have to admit, well written and fully respect Margaret Mitchell's world. He picks up exactly where we left the heroine earlier and gently guide us from Mitchell's inheritance to his own fantasy. In Scarlett, who defeated after Melanie's death and Rhett's departure, Charleston goes to live with his mother, hoping to get Rhett's love back. His typical manipulative behavior again brings a lot of criticism from Rhett and drives them further ... to a certain cruise that changes everything. Scarlett is now secret. The series follows the book quite accurately until Scarlett arrives in Ireland. Since then, the book and series were divided slowly. The actual end is different, but of course both have Scarlett and Rhett together. <br /> <br /> The series was announced with a worldwide search for the next Scarlett O'Hara. Many countries made their own TV shows featuring performances by young actors. Finally, about 12 girls were selected to participate in final screen tests and interviews in Georgia, Atlanta. Unfortunately, the manufacturer did not find any Scarlett among these actors. For girls, it is a sad show's big advertisement (it was already sold to many television stations all over the world before shooting started). Robert Halmi, a producer who bought the rights to Scarlett, said he discovered the right actor while watching television, gave him a call and signed the deal two days later. Joanne Whalley-Kilmer (who played "Willow" and "Scandal", the last one was Robert Halmi, who was watching this loyal night) is not Vivien Leigh, but he is definitely Scarlett! His performance is not a copy of Leigh, he does his character. The biggest difference between GWTW and "Scarlett" is the fact that the wiring is developing and growing as a human. This is a privilege of the series, why was something that was done before? Given that there are nearly seventy years between the first and the second story, it is natural that both authors emphasize the different aspects of the characters. When Mitchell works around Scarlett, dealing with the consequences of the civil war and fighting Tara, Ripley Scarlett lets his demons face. This is the most interesting aspect of the series for me, we introduce Scarlett differently when he learns that not everyone can always go the way he wants. I fully agree with Timothy Dalton's election to Rhett Butler. He depicts him with magic and irony and is less priest than Clark Gaber's performance. The remaining majority was well chosen. Julie Harris loves Rhett's mother, John Gielgud gives a very amusing report when Grandfather Robillard and Sean Bean are always dirty in their best playing, his Lord Fenton does not make an exception. Bad choices, however, with Stephen Collins like Ashley and Ann-Margret Belle Watling's adaptation was a waste of money. Costumes, kits and locations are detailed and convincing. The newly built Tara set seemed exactly the same and it is a moving sequence in the series when the house first appears. <br /> <br /> Is there another order? Romance is for me. One look!
