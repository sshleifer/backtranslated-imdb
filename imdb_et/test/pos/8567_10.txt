H.O.T.S. there is evidence that the film industry at one time censors "F-OFF" and made films what they wanted! In today's world, this film would be too "up" and "extreme" so it would be everywhere as velvet curtain. Although BestBuy had several copies of his $ 5.99 rack (if anyone wanted to get a copy)! The film was brilliant in its own way, as it interfered with humor with an R&D film full of Playboy Playmates! Unlike most skin colors, he had a lot. However, this is not exactly the reason you look at H.O.T.S. <br /> <br /> H.O.T.S. is a college film that reminds me of the revenge of Nerd's movies, because it takes a group of "middle people" and puts them against the elite gimmicks that most people can't stand! The only difference is that in this movie "Nerds" is much better hit! I note that there are some people who would consider this movie to be low and to me that it is unknown! Obviously, it is not meant to win the Oscar or to break the barriers in the movie. If you are looking for it, look what ever critics choose for you! You have to appreciate the fact that this film actually had a funny plot, a decent act (mostly a given genre) and a lot of girls naked! H.O.T.S. is one of those movies you look to bring out your thoughts about modern problems and everyday stress and instead laugh and enjoy time! If you are looking for a funny college-based film that has enough skin to make pink Miata straight, then you should definitely have H.O.T.S.
