This is a very big movie (documentary) about Istanbul and their people and all kinds of music. Director editing and success are very impressive. I am interested in Faith Akin because I saw "Gegen die Wand" ("Head-On") ("Duvara KarsÄ±") and I admired his work very much, but it is most relevant to me, so I've written here. It does not only mean the Turks and nothing like this, it is a very good biography of the city and how music in this life is preserved. Many people's views and so many different ideas even about life and love. I liked it very much and I know someone and everyone should see it, not only, but especially those that are in any case connected with Turkey ...
