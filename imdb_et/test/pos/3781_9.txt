Chaplin enters into the trenches of World War I into this moody comedy that never talks about the horror of war. Rain, mud, explosions - all these things are there, but Chaplin seems to them a strange unforgettable. He's one thing in France: to fight the Germans, something he does with incredible success. <br /> <br /> It looks almost like an extended ego trip for Chaplin - very funny until the last minute when it rises to a new level and everything makes sense. <br /> <br /> Maybe all soldiers dream before the war.
