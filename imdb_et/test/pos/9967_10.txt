William Shakespeare's Venetian merchant is about one Jewish boss and his bond to become a wealthy merchant, the loser of the debtor. The Jewish boss is, of course, Shylock and is given to Al Pacino such tougher results that even prominent actors such as Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes and Lynne Collins burn in the background. The film is set in the 16th century Venice and director Michael Radford relies on setting, mood and realism to tell his story by rejecting a rich period of costumes or a contemporary atmosphere with rock music to appeal to a wider audience. <br /> <br /> Radford cuts the game for three hours to run for two hours and eight minutes and also offers a historical background. In the opening narrative, he tells us how the Jews came to England, were persecuted and finally expelled from England. They were forbidden to own their property, to make a profit only by borrowing interest, and they were forced to live in the Venetian "ghetto", the forerunner of the upcoming darker events. In the film, the merchant Antonio (Jeremy Irons) speaks to Shylock in public, but he does not feel ashamed when he plans to borrow 3,000 dukas from the host to help his friend, and suggested that the lover Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) properly sue Portia (Lynne Collins), a rich heir. Although Shylock is offended by Antonio, he agrees to borrow money without interest for three months, provided that the loss of the bond entitles him to fine-tune Antonio's meat. <br /> <br /> The game is mainly a drama of hatred and revenge, but like many Shakespeare works, there is also a wide range of comedy. Here, comedy includes three pairs of lovers: Bassanio and Portia, Gratiano, Bassanio's friend and Nerissa and Lorenzo, another Bassanio friend and Jessica, Shylock's daughter. Portia has offered itself to a person who can choose the right treasure from one of three gold, silver and lead gold. The prince of Morocco chooses gold, the prince of Aragon, and both are disappointed. Bassanio, however, loves him and opens the pen to find the portrait inside. Radford Adaptation provides significant hours of time and space. Portia's residence in Belmontis suggests one of these magnificent bungalows with hanging gardens and art treasures in all rooms, well off the horrible look of the town of Shylock with a dirty street. <br /> <br /> If it turns out that Antonio can't repay the debt, Bassanio returns to Venice, leaving behind Portia. When he arrives, the loan is default and Shylock requires his pound of meat. Even though Bassanio, supported by Portia's wealth, offers a large amount of repayment, Shylock has planned revenge not only for losing money but also for external status. Duke, sitting in the court, does not interfere when Portia enters the shelter to protect Antonio. This is because the film reaches its dramatic heights as all the parties reach the final resolution. <br /> <br /> The Venetian merchant is not only an outstanding debt, but also the alienation of Christian Jews. society and their desire to belong. It has been one of Shakespeare's most controversial stories, and analysts have long been discussing whether it is an anti-Semitic game or simply a game of anti-Semitism that reflects the view of the Christian society in England that is widespread in Elizabeth. Although Shylock is definitely a caricature, he is an ambiguous figure and there are many signs that Shakespeare is looking at his shortcomings of human shortcomings, not Jews. Duke admits that he is just a man who has not been able to follow Torah's compassionate language. <br /> <br /> Monologue: "I am a Jew. Take us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, don't we laugh? If we poison us, will we die? And if you lie to us, will we die?" we don't act? ‚ÄùShylock shows universal humanity, expressing equality with all men. Although we are scared of the sentence he wants to conduct, we may feel that his pain has accumulated over the years. Pacino's performance brings new power to the text, and his often-up person has been replaced by a more subtle, less underestimated behavior that brings him to an understanding of his interest. During an interview at the Toronto International Film Festival, Radford Pacino said, "If you work with a great actor, you have a great machine. It's a bit like a powerful car ride. He's dared and we're all the beneficiaries.
