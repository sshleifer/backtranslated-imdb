Footprints are a very interesting film that is somewhat difficult to classify. "Psychological Thriller" is the most appropriate description I mean. The female protagonist Alice Cespi discovers that she does not remember anything in the last three days. The only clue that he has a photo torn by the hotel. He is also haunted by a repeated, very lively dream of scientific literature, which he believes he had seen many years ago. He does not trust anyone in his quest for the truth behind his amnesia, but it gradually turns out that he has visited the city where the hotel is located. This is an exciting flick, the main round of which is that it is virtually impossible to predict how events will begin and especially how it will end. The unusual character of the main character and the unreliability of all others ensure that the whole old paranoid feeling is present in the whole film, while the beautiful colors and some well-filmed sequences make it a visually appealing film. One and only important part of Nicoletta Elm, everyone's all-time favorite red-headed childhood Italian horror, is an extra bonus.
