The second link between Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner is excellent as the first. Maybe predictable, but I don't care and still laugh as much as I can see. Wile E./Road runner shorts were always the most special in my heart. So, knowing that the second disc of the golden collection not only contains 11, if they were in chronological order (2 to 12, the first episode was in Volume 1), it made me blurry. I love this stuff. This animated short is visible on Looney Tunes Golden Volume 2, 2nd plate. It also has a selective comment from Micheal Barrier. <br /> <br /> My class: A +
