I was just pinkish, watching it in the cinema and wearing my ear; eyes wide open, trying to take all the details that are at the same time unpleasantly simple, fresh, but incredibly complex, breathtaking and imaginative. Totoro. The plot works because of a 5-year-old pure heart who is focused on what they want and act conscientiously. They live in a world that is immune to cynicism and cultural learning, how everything is "expected". While most critics cannot ignore this movie because of the lack of a "message" or "plot" movie (although it's somewhere there), that's why this movie has to be evaluated. Too often, our decision is hampered by restrictions on cinematographic and cultural status. Like most of Miyasaki's films, everyone is completely unique, but undeniably Miyasaki. Ponyo can sometimes seem so unique and fresh, it may seem like an alien. <br /> <br /> The viewing experience is a great change from all the general childrens products that are usually sold to adult demographics (ie / Animals) it says like their human counterparts, Eddie Murphy Shrek. The cells still work so incredibly well in this digital age, where Toystory / WallE / Shrek / Cars generally triumph. That's why the film's feeling is more nostalgic, so the film seems timeless, a bit like Totoro and the Jungle Book isn't really outdated. <br /> <br /> The nuances of each character's expression and body language are such a nuanced interpretation that digital films such as Wall-e can never compete or, if so, it would be a very costly process. Wall-E would be very sorry to win the Oscar victory, and probably this year. However, it may be quite unfair to compare two media because it is really a craftsmanship and a story that will win at the end of the day. This is the real master of Miyasaki
