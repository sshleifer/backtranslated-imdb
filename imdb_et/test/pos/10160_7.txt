Probably the story of Jimmy Stewart and Dorise's young child. The child is kidnapped to make the parents quiet. They know something about a plot to kill an unnamed ambassador to London during Albert Hall's performance. <br /> <br /> The film is rich in Hitchcockius cases. A friendly, yet opaque Frenchman seems to be an innocent Stewart - Indiana doctor - a bit too intense to be just cumbersome curious. Later, the Frenchman appears in Arabic hiding, wearing a knife and whispering some information about the plot of murder to Stewart. Stewart tells his wife, Doris Day, that she really looks very funny - but refuses to cooperate with the police and risks her son's life. <br /> <br /> Instead, the couple are trying to take down the assassins, buy them out, and get their son back, taking them from Morocco, where Hitchcock has given us his usual tourist view of customs, places and food in London. There's a fun wild goose chase between Stewart and taxi store staff. Workers are more concerned about guarding their half-full specimens than anything else and mixing around to protect the leopard and swordfish carcasses. Stuffart succeeds in saving his throat from cutting a swordfish bill while rubbing, but bites a hand-filled tiger with Bernard Hermann's harsh results. The scene ends with Stewart out of the door. Hitchcock stops this jaw by shutting his head off the door. There's also a running gag, well done, some of the guests waiting for a couple of hotel rooms in London, waiting to find things out. <br /> <br /> There are two serious problems that are easily touched. One of them is the relationship between Stewart and the Day, which is not as rosy as it should be, is considered a civic ideal. For many years, she has been a star of the staging music and is internationally renowned. And she has given her everything to marry a normal boy who happens to be a doc. This is understandable, for example, in the case of a sister or sender or almost every woman who is not an international star with a promising career itself. It has not been entered, but edginess is noticeable because it was not in the original version. It reminds me a little bit of an exchange between Joe Dimaggio and his wife Marilyn Monroe, who had just returned from Korean entertainment. "Oh, Joe," he sank, "had you ever seen ten thousand people standing up and rejoicing?" "Seventy thousand," Joe muttered, a former hero of New York. <br /> <br /> Another problem is loyal. Who has greater social value? One's own son? Or an unknown ambassador. Are we putting ourselves or our loved ones at risk for national stability? The day is faced with this dilemma in its sharpest form at the peak of Albert Hall. His solution chooses political stability, although his motives are problematic. Does he scream to save the ambassador's life or does he do it to relieve the anxiety that surprises him? (See: Alec Guiness falls on the detonator at the end of the Kwai River Bridge.) Photography is extremely good and settings can be dangerous even on a quiet street in a London residential area. It's in the middle of the day and Stewart is alone and confident, but also frightened. Walking on Gulliver Street from somewhere, somewhere. Is he being monitored? Is his life in danger? And where the hell are all who live on this street? Hitchcock pays so much attention to the details of the location that we can make the wall of the brick next to him gluing the wall. <br /> <br /> The director rarely disagreed with Francois Truffaut when he was interviewed by Truffu in another way. Truffaut claimed that the earlier version of The Man Who Knew Too Much lacked the depth of the later version. Hitchcock replied, "It seems to me that you want me to make movies for the audience of art life," but finally agreed that the 1930s version was the work of talented amateurs and this version was a professional job. There is no argument. <br /> <br /> It's Hitchcock pretty much close to his music.
