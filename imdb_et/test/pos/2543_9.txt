This is a wonderful movie of Ale's soul. It's a trip to Ale's heart. I found it exciting. The director did a great job. He's talking about scenes. Particularly quiet scene. The Ale window is great. The scenes, when he is in bed, are one of the best-looking scenes I've seen. <br /> <br /> After control. It has been quite a time when I didn't look at the film's soul. As a philosopher, I can say that this film proves that age does not matter to your soul. Just like the soul of Ale. <br /> <br /> As he lives in Turkey, he's not interested in NY. This is a universal scene you see all over the world. As for my opinion, it is more universal than every other thing. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie. Otherwise, the soul will be a big deal. If you have it. <br /> <br /> Barry
