"The Honkers" is probably the best time for Slim Pickens. When we were shot, all those involved in the production thought that Slim was the Academy Award Material. Unfortunately, the joint artists were simultaneously released by James Bond and he did not pay much attention to "Honkers". Personally, I feel that most critics appreciated this movie. Sam Peckinpawi's "Junior Bonner" was out at the same time, and it seemed to critics more than our film. Cliff Robertson also had a few months before our release of a rodeo film that could hurt us. The picture is worth watching if it's just for rodeo footage - some of the best films James Crabbe did. Director and my co-author Steve Ian died a few weeks after the release of the picture, cutting a short promising career and leaving behind his lovely wife, Sally, her daughter, Gaby, and Stefani's newborn son. Please give this movie a picture. I bet you say it was worth it. Thank you to everyone who has read this time. Stephen Lodge
