I can't imagine a director whose thirst for blood and violence is bigger than Quentin Tarantino. (At least in his films) The refugees Basterd do not differ. We all know, Tarantino, a man who exploded in the early 1990s with a golden classic, such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Since then, he has been disappointed. Well, I'm free to say that Tarantino hasn't lost his touch. She brings us her best from Pulp Fiction and fortunately so. <br /> <br /> We know this story, the story of World War II, which only Tarantino gets. (Of course, fictitious) The film has never been made like this before. Brad Pitt is Mrs Aldo Raine, who leads the Nazi occupied occupation. Their purpose - to kill the Nazis. Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa plays the same role in the other half. He knows as a "Jewish hunter" and becomes as ruthless in his business as any other. The third sub-story consists of a young Jewish refugee, Shosanna Dreyfus, who knows the killing of his family. And of course he wants the Germans to revenge his destructive loss. There are actually three stories that intertwine with each other. If you know anything about Tarantino or his films, this is nothing new to him. <br /> <br /> War has never been so fun. Bastards are haunting, but at the same time very funny, sometimes even fun. In the dark comedy aspect, it is of great importance as in many other Tarantino films. Entertainment and fun are run by Brad Pitt. I found him very funny and fun. I couldn't wait to see her again on the screen. Even with his crazy accent he works in this type of film. Great impressions were also made by the great MÃ©lanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz. The film was full of remarkable performances. <br /> <br /> The story itself has so many historical inaccuracies to even count, but what then? It's not meant to be a documentary. Tarantino wanted to have fun as we should. The Department of Cinematography deserves great props with beautiful colors that highlight the film. You really have to love the last line of the movie ... but Pulp Fiction remains in her masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Quentin Tarantino is an entertainer. It is one of the most tragic events in history during World War II, but Tarantino has some ways to make it fun. Inglourious Basterds is a fun movie, it's tremendously fun, shocking, dramatic, pausing and funny. Jam is full of everything you are looking for in a movie made with this particular Tarantino style, it's worth checking out. It's time to experience what war is like in the eyes of Quentin Tarantino.
