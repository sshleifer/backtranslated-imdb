A conceivable man is one of the best foreign films I've ever seen. All technical aspects are, in my opinion, perfect (lighting, operation, control, tempo, etc.). STORY is breathtaking. <br /> <br /> It seems our death is beyond death, where he lives in a world where there is no beauty, passion or anything that is far from a pleasant human mind. His work is cold and uninteresting; his relationship is dull and uninspiring, and if it all changes too much, he tries to stop it before the train. But it doesn't stop - he can't leave this strange world to commit suicide! Working back with a man who felt as isolated and lonely, our protagonist joins him in mining a stone wall, hoping that he will discover a source of strange and wonderful scents and music. Just as they break through - and I don't reveal that much, it all ends and the movie ends as strangely as it started. <br /> <br /> It's enough to say you love this movie or hate it. I feel it is like a magical poem - it opens up to many different interpretations and all of them apply in the following form. If you enjoy new movie experiences and want to take out the Hollywood crap party, try this movie! <br /> <br /> 9/10 (and I don't just value it!), Despite its darkness, this film left me somewhat bigger ... something mysterious and beyond. Well done!
