Demons at night is definitely one of the most frightening, brilliant 80s demons of the same brilliant film that is brilliant Evil Dead and Demons. This movie combines cozy sexually active teens and demons into one fun movie. Definitely a welcome addition after the 80s passed the slippery skis, it was nice to see something a little different. <br /> <br /> The plot is followed by a group of teenagers who all meet in the hall of a Halloween party, formerly a funeral room organized by Angela. Approximately 40 minutes of calving and sex eventually lead to a demon or demon that finds its way out of the oven and has all the teenagers. Add some snazzy make-up effects, lots of gore and cool looking demons, and you have a sweet 80's cheese festival that would be one of the best demon-related movies in the list of many horror fans. First of all, I loved setting up this movie, "Hull House" is a really horrible and scary and great device for horror film and pros when demons appear, that is when it really strikes and it becomes fear and fear. This movie created 2 sequences, the first in 1994, which was okay, but nothing happened to it, and the third called Demon House was absolutely terrible. This is one of those horrors that has surely been a test of time and remains a real gem for many years. <br /> <br /> All in all, fun fun with demons is definitely worth it.
