I just saw this movie and it made me cry. It's a beautiful drama about two loving brothers, and I think it's a good idea, especially with a closed mind, to watch it. I've come to love the short film genre after seeing a couple of pairs because they have to make you look so fast and I have to say it's definitely a sign. It described some of the things I never thought of, one of the incest. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I didn't care too much. Just once I would like to watch a gay movie without killing myself after the palace. They look pretty much always in the tragedy. But it was "cute" how they had to be together, even if it was death. the inner appearance ‚Äùthat this film will put you. <br /> <br /> Thank you for listening and enjoying.
