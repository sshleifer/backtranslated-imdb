spoiler-- <br /> <br /> In 1993, the African-American director / actor Mario Van Peebles followed a tremendously popular city movie "New Jack City" with "Posse". The film was written and directed by Van Peebles, who also celebrates the main character, Jessie Lee. <br /> <br /> Plot: The film begins in the turn of the 20th century, when the United States ended up in the Spanish-American war. Apparently, the time when the US legal system could send a convicted military service finds Jessie Lee himself an unwanted recruited man serving in all the cavalry troops in Cuba. Some of his compatriots are the Little J (Stephen Baldwin), the fast-talking Weezie (Charles Lane) and the uplifting but easy Obobo (Tiny Lister). They find the hidden gold trolley on the spies and decide to keep it. But ambitious, dedicated Colonel Graham (Zane) gets to know about gold and is probably ready to kill him for Jessie Lee and the company. The shootout between Graham's forces and Jessie Lee leaves the Colonel blinded to one eye and his troops retreat. Jessie Lee's team of dirty teams can smuggle themselves (and gold) back into New Orleans, but it turns out that Graham is not far away. Jessie Lee and her allies are forced to ride west of Freemanville. Obviously, in the post-war years created by Freemanville, it is black. Jessie Lee's father, King David, was a charismatic preacher who founded the city. However, as evidenced by intermittent setbacks, King David was soon murdered in parallel with the K Klux Clan terror campaign launched by the cruel mobile at the same time. Finally, Jessie Lee and Freemanville find that the townspeople do not see her particularly happy, especially when Sheriff Bates (Richard Jordan), a nearby white urban area, makes it clear that she wants Jessie Lee and her partners are dead. or alive. Carver (Blair Underwood) is Freemanville's sheriff and de facto mayor, and his own agenda may not be around Jessie Lee. <br /> <br /> Analysis The sequences are all very reliable and Mario Van Peebles is a horse hero. After the success of New Jack City, it was almost expected that Van Peebles would train for a sequel or at least a similar follow-up of urban activities. Instead, Van Peebles saw the past 100 years, mainly creating a black western ("refreshing" the black-themed westerns of the 1970s) and continuing the legacy of the largely forgotten black cowboy films from the early 20th century. Unlike New Jack City, the film was financed independently and was originally released through Gramercy / Polygram Entertainment. It was reportedly killed during the execution of the big studio when Van Peebles threw "Posse" on them. Some of the more "curious" elections were journalists Big Daddy Kane and Tone Loc as father's time and angel. In some interviews, Mario Van Peebles has said that he is often against the type; Since then, the choice of rape singers in non-musical films has become almost common. Keen viewers observe a number of entertaining personalities: Black-action movie veterans such as Isaac Hayes ("Truck Turner"), Pam Grier ("Foxy Brown") and Larry Cook ("The Spook, who sits on the door") appear as well up legend Nipsey Russell, not to mention TV producer Stephen J. Cannell (who hired junior Van Peebles to celebrate "Sonny Spoon" a year earlier). The film is reserved for the key role of Woody Strode ("Spartacus").
