For anyone who has ever sought happiness, "Half Empty" is a must-have. This original intercultural musical comedy is fun with numbers that make "Manufacturers" much boring. Writer Bob Patterson puts his mind to share his thoughts on life, wisdom and happiness, even by writing inspirational comments on index cards when his girlfriend casts out his heart to end their relationship. If his successful book, "North Star", finds that countries have not succeeded, his publishers are sending Germany to sign books. Explaining his decision to Bob, the board breaks into a devastating song that would make Monty Python proud. Since the arrival of Hamburg, Bob leaves the German language completely unknown, leaving him clearly at a disadvantage. But his soldiers, impenetrable to his hosts, are true feelings about him until a wildly dedicated fan arrives and changes everyone's response to him. <br /> <br /> Original songs push the movie, often describing the lateral accuracy of the story. The cast exhibited by Robert Peters has a completely dry sense of humor and lives as a character without acting. Look at this: a case study on how good intentions are completely irrelevant; How Mistress Americans are Watching Abroad; How little is needed to break a song and, above all, a stupid, entertaining, unusual laugh.
