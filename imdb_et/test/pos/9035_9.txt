Intruder Tolmus (1949) Dir: Clarence Brown <br /> <br /> Production: MGM <br /> <br /> An excellent "South Gothic" story, adapted from Faulkner's novel, black man, accused of murdering a White man a young white boy with whom he is friendly to help him prove his innocence. Lucas Beauchamp (Juano Hernandez) is an anomaly in this small town. He is a black man who owns the land he lives in, and does not think much about the social organization that mostly keeps peace here and in many similar small towns. So, when Lucas was found to hold the pistol Vinson at Gowrie's body, he didn't return, then the young Chick Mallison (Claude Jarman) (who ever saved Lucas after his chick fell on his ground). The city is finally able to "make Lucas *****." Arrested, and a very real chance of being beaten at night, Lucas gets to Chick for help, because he's the only person he doesn't know. Chick asks his lawyer on John to defend Lucas and while he is disturbed by his own perceptions of accepting and fighting with the gathering mobile to save Lucas's life. <br /> <br /> The film has uncommon honesty from time to time and is mostly moral. The character of a lawyer has a tendency to talk about an incredibly self-conscious dialogue that sounds mostly on a printed page, but it has minimal effect on the tone. It is a credit for the rich character of all others. Juano Hernandez, who mostly appeared in Oscar Micheaux films, is great as proud Lucas. Porter Hall, as the father of a murdered man, perhaps the best role I have ever seen, and Elizabeth Patterson as a happy old lady who understands Lucas's case, supporting her supporting role. The setting is perfectly realized. It's actually filmed in Oxford, Mississippi, Faulkner's hometown. Brown also uses the crowd effectively, it is always an anonymous mobile against one person (like Lucas, when he is arrested or John when he goes to his office), it is very dangerous. Or the whole city grotesque, which is gathered in prison to see how it was a parade. Note that Chick and his friend Aleck are going to gather evidence in the graveyard. The picture was taken with Robert Surtees (BAD AND BEAUTIFUL, THIRTY SECONDS OVER TOKYO, BEN-HUR). <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of the four
