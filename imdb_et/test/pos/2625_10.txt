I was a 20-year-old college student who lived with people when I first saw it, and I've never forgotten it. I'm a big fan of Joan Hackett and this film was perfect for his remarkable talent. I am very pleased to see that so many other people remember this. Of course it is not available in the media! It would be perfect to show in a lifetime, but due to its age, they will not come. You never see anything before the mid-eighties. I still remember what made me look for the first time: Rex Reed reviewed it in New York's Daily News and said it was a setback for the forty big Hollywood movies and if it was made for Hackett and Grimes's parts were played by Stanwyck and Crawford. Think about it! P.S. So sad that Joan Hackett left us so tragically young.
