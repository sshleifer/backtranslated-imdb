It ends with a declaration that "just the movie you saw was improvisation" - if you have felt like an idiot to think about improvisation, it was a good movie and once again amazed the genius of Cassavets .... Of course, Cassavetes told some guys that it was not in itself in itself improvisation in his dead chamber, so ... this is a story of a light skinned black woman, Lelia, who goes white and her family: White brother Ben named and black-and-white brother Hughie. When he falls in love with a white prick named Tony, he is unpleasantly surprised when he discovers that he is black, and then goes on to the individual aspirations and shortcomings of the three main characters. Hughie is in the jazz singer's failure process, Lelia is still hopelessly pushed against Tony and Ben is angsty and generally violent, desperately needing something to shock her from her old existence. In general, I think it's really stasis vs. change of human life. I suspect that Cassavetes had the plot well organized and that the dialogue was improvised. Dialogue itself is very uneven - sometimes someone says something very memorable, otherwise it is memorable uncomfortable. What's amazing is the incarnation of amateur actors in their character. Cassavetes went through the show class he taught when he decided to hide, whispered in the ears of the top ten students, and that was the result ... the guys who played Ben and Hughie are very good. At first I did not like Leli, but when the film progressed, you see more and more people who are better than tension and drama - may not be the best in small talks. Shadows welcomes many of Indie's predecessors (1959) and is certainly recommended.
