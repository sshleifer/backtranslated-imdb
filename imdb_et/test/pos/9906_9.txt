This wonderfully funny comedy drama won a crowd at the Philadelphia Film Festival that created natural applause at the end. A film that is capable of staging director Jeff Hare with a nuanced performance, a vigorous pace, and one of Peter Falki's best performances in the years, appears as a loving respect for the high and fear of family life. <br /> <br /> Falk stands out as a Jewish ninetysomething Morris Applebaum, a wild eccentric Emperor of Shakespeare, who decides to end his life, but not before rounding his three grown children and throwing a "big fat Jewish suicide". The film goes with indelible joy. There's a "tushy room" by Morris; Laura San Giacomo is the passionate mistress of Morris; a quick fire comedy dialogue that resembles the work of Neil Simon and Woody Allen; Timing of David Paymer, the son of Morris's closely wounded psychotherapists; and Morris's patented egg creams (but be careful, drinking too fast, causing frustrating brain freezing). It is surrounded by a feeling-good and intimate atmosphere in New York. <br /> <br /> Director Jeff Hare turns out to be a masterpiece that draws memorable productions from his performance and gives the film amazing humanity. I was happy to see the earlier Hare movie: the dark and powerful "Perfect Little Man" starring Neal McDonough ("Minority Report") in Los Angeles, madness crazy. "Perfect" visceral spike and "Checking Out" nostalgic air are testimony to Hare's eclecticism and extensive talent. I look forward to your future work. <br /> <br /> I heard "Checking Out" currently has no distributor. Some wise companies make this crowd a good pearl because it is a potential post office at My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Toughest would give people around the world the opportunity to experience the joy of this film.
