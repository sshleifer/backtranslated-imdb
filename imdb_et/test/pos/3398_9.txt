This commentary deals with the "North and South Book I" of 1842-1861. <br /> <br /> US 19th century history has mostly identified the people of the civil war (1861-1865). This is a reasonable opinion, because it was a civil war that put the Union in a strong test; it was a civil war that made Americans understand how worthwhile it is to live in peace; in the end, it was the time that eventually created a shameful system of slavery. <br /> <br /> Since the birth of films, there have been people who have adapted this time on the screen. D.W. Griffith, in the early 1900s, made his unforgettable BTHTH OF A NATION. Yet the most famous film about the North-South collision is still what I think it has become with WIND (1938). Unfortunately, the great TV series based on John Jakes's "North and South" know fewer people. It's the best TV series ever made and the time spent watching it is very valuable. I stuck this video on the Polish television many years ago and I've enjoyed a lot of fun ever since. Why? First, the whole story is deeply rooted in historical reality. Two families - in South Carolina and Pennsylvania - are two completely different lifestyles. Nonetheless, they are united by friendship. Yet what they are experiencing is the struggle with all people: the friendship that was attacked by "truth" "political correctness", the love attacked by the "hateful" of "legal spouses", the strength of "social heroes". Orry Maine (Patrick Swayze) is my beloved character - someone who finds love and who is quickly taken away; someone who cares about friends, but political fanatics are on the road and ruin a lot. Finally, he is someone who sees the tragic future of his land, but something that he cannot do for the inevitable fate of the south. His friend George Hazard is similar in most aspects, but sometimes he seems to have a stronger character. It shows him that, although there are tragedies, he must live and live in despair because life is the most valuable thing. Although they represent two different lifestyles, their friendship is stronger than any prejudice, policy or conflict. <br /> <br /> Other characters are also very well developed. There are villains like Justin LaMotte or Salem Jones who are really evil, but most people are unclear because the nature of humanity has always been. Charles Maine is at first full of rebellion, a tendency to fight, but later he learns to be a true southern gentleman, to whom southern pride is not bold words, but above all bold deeds. Virgilia Hazard is the most fanatical aspect of the dead movement trying to condemn slavery and punish the owners of "black breeding farms". His marriage to Grady seems to be a symbol of equality, but also a symbol that says "NO" to South politics. Two interesting characters are Orry's sisters, Brett and Ashton - sisters whose veins are completely opposite. Brett, in his tenderness, but also in naivety, believes in absolute fidelity. She marries Billy, though she is northern, because she really loves her. Brett is valuable for all young people. But Ashton is a vamp, tigress, a woman who doesn't hesitate about the worst things. A clear picture of these worldviews is their conversation with men and family ... an unforgettable moment and universal! Most symbols lead their values ​​... yet, war breaks out and they have to set aside a lot ... Second, performances ... no one said that not all people act naturally. I wouldn't say that. I'd rather say that all the cast makers are doing a great job in the main characters represented by the younger staff of famous stars, including Liz Taylor, Robert Mitchum and others. Patrick Swayze when Orry does a good job. I consider this role his best. Lesley Anne Down Madeleine is also very memorable. Maybe her part means too much suffering, but she can really express all kinds of feelings really well. Kirstie Alley is very tempting and truly memorable as destroyed by Virgilia Hazard. Phillip Casnoff is worth considering both the terribly ambitious Elkanah Bent and David Carradine as a monster man, nasty Justin LaMotte. And, unlike him, Jean Simmons, who is truly magnificent as Orry's mother, whose heartbeats are the glory of family life and union unity, must be mentioned. Thirdly, the memorable moments leave the "north and south" meaninglessly irresistible. Who can forget the first meeting of Orry and Madeleine - what a charm, what gentleness in this scene! Or is the moment Madeleine's father dies, missed? I found it to be really powerful, at this point there is a real drama, a woman's drama who missed someone who really loved her. I also liked the order of Churubusco and George Hazard is so concerned about his dear friend Orry's life. Then his meetings with Constance are terrible. Virgilia's speech in Philadelphia is a masterpiece of the performance. And the last moment of the first part: although the north and south can separate, their friendship never dies. Orry and George are symbolically joining hands as the train moves. There are so many beautiful and powerful scenes that it is impossible to mention even half of them. And they beautify Bill Conti's stories and shot great landscapes. "North and South" music is very touching and memorable. <br /> <br /> What to say? "North and South" is a real dirt on the DVD, just an amazing TV series that is valuable to us: love, friendship, loyalty, honor, truthfulness, absolute fidelity. 9/10
