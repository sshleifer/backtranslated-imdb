I watch this movie every time it was a cable and it never got old. Who can forget some of the best lines of film history? --- JOHNNY THE FOUNDS! JOHNNY'S FAT BOY DRILLS! and CHANGE BETWEEN MELONES! I wanted to make the whole city so much fun in the treasure hunt. It's a fave of all time and I'm glad to hear that it's on the video! I'm positive that this is where MTV got its original assumption for the road rules series.
