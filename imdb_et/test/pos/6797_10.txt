Two great Hollywood stars (Elizabeth Taylor and Mickey Rooney) are perfectly connected to provide one of the family's all-time classics. A story about identified 12-year-old girls whose respect for horses doesn't let them win their British citizens. Mickey Rooney is a newly orphaned dreamer who wants to associate himself until he can follow his dreams. <br /> <br /> A beautiful side view shows that her mother was a young girl in her ambition. Repeatedly canceling his father's decisions in favor of his spiritual daughter, it seems that the mother knows best. The scene where exhausted Taylor goes to school is invaluable: Father protests: "Why did you let him go to school, he drops out of exhaustion before noon!" - Don't worry, he'd be back in half an hour; it was Saturday! Excellent Technicolor, a gorgeous music score and those beautiful faces that all tell the bittersweet story. Here's a good reason for the old saying: they don't do it anymore!
