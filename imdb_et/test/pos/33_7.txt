Lackawanna Blues is a drama through and out. It describes the life of a strong woman under the name of Rachel Crosby (S. Epatha Merkerson). Anyone who knows her is called Rachel as Nanny, but she could have just called Wonder Woman. He created strength, willpower, confidence and judgment. He had a home that he used for almost any person rejected by society. His tenants consisted of a lesbian, psychotic war veteran, amputation, and many other worshipers who made their home march out of the ordinary. Every successive event took Rachel and went flawlessly. He was not a compassionate dictator, but in fact he was the opposite. He showed his sympathy almost to the point of providing refuge and refuge to so many that he seemed general. <br /> <br /> Merkerson did a good job, but I believe that this role was anyway his alley. The film never had a wedge from Rachel. Of course, there were dramatic moments, but they were expected. Nothing was shocking or deep after Rachel.
