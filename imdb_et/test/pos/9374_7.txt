I have not read the source, Richard Brooks's novel The Brick Foxhole, which I hope it is not as intrusive as its title, but I understand that the original villain was a homophobic, not an anti-Semitic. (And frankly, Sam Levene is written as a gay man who picks up a drunken soldier.) But okay, you have to go with the stream. Think of 1947. Even antisemitism has not yet been treated on the screen. Many people in charge of modern films were Jews themselves, but anti-Semitism was verboten for years because it was considered unpleasant. So we can hardly blame the filmmakers for not leaving the victim homosexual. Now it's really unpleasant - and after all, many of the audience could have been against Robert Ryan. We are by no means free from prejudice, but we are still far from 1947. <br /> <br /> We watch this for the first time in years when I was impressed by the rather slow pace of the first half. movie, two people talked a lot of pictures, shade, the time between question and answer, unnecessary editing. But I could live for it because of the theme of the movie and some other things. <br /> <br /> One thing that keeps me glued to events is as deliberately like Robert Robert's performance. The boy does a great job. Sometimes it may seem to the police to be thoughtful, submissive and helpful. Then, alone or with another soldier, the anger of anger rises, not so much as he says, but how he sees it. The stupid thing that sticks to stare, these dark eyes glitter. Wow. <br /> <br /> The film has taken a lot of heat because of Robert Young's preaching speech about his grandfather's murder. It doesn't bother me at all, although I think Dmytryk did not have to talk to Young on his camera, "MICKS and PAPISTS". But given the context, this is one of the most shocking moments of the film. Part of its effect is due to the almost random message transmission by Young, and some of this is due to the fact that the message has not been heard on the screen before. <br /> <br /> Another feature of the movie that makes it almost surreal is the character of Paul Kelly and his relationship with the whore Gloria Grahame. St. Guacamo, which elliptical conversation will be given to Kelly. "You know what I told you? All those things I just said? They're all wrong." His character gently crosses the stamens. It is impossible to know what to do about it. He adds almost nothing to the plot, but the film would not be much less without his presence. <br /> <br /> This is a moody, dark film. His people live in the dark. And there is murder. Virtually no one shouts or screams. The fear that these men have experienced and some of them carry with them as malaria seems just under the surface. <br /> <br /> See if you have a chance.
