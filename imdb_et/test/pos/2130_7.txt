I missed a full four-hour version when it first appeared in theaters because it played for weeks. I had to leave to see a shorter version of two and a half hours a year or so later and I was amazed at what I saw. I left the theater to think I had seen a masterpiece and thought about the full version. <br /> <br /> The full version is usually good, but it has so stunningly dirty sequences that the entire movie is pulled down and almost drops under the waves. <br /> <br /> The problem is completely editing, which should be labeled as redundant. There are times when things are going on and on, and nothing happens. Hit people in a city that moves too long without being meaningful in narrative. We get the beauty and vision of the beauty that they bring to the eye, but they are too often used as punctuation or placement instead of the site owner. Most of the longer version seems to be on the screen just because it seemed good. <br /> <br /> I've been trying to actually sit down and watch the gate of heaven, using the fast forward button, but somewhere down the road I find that I can no longer hold it. I want MGM to hurt us and release a shorter version for both DVD and huge dinosaur. Maybe in two packages so we can see what the better version is, and whether Cimino was crazy or not. And even though they had done so, why not ever add a rumor of Johnson County Wari, which ran for 90 minutes. Supposedly, United Artists have tried to further reduce their money back. Regardless of whether it has ever been done or is still there, there is air, but it would be interesting to see.
