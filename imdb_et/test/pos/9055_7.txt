Man, whether it's nice to see a young and uneasy star Melody Thomas Scott as something other than the amazing Nikki Newman! A doctor with no brain less! And nice to see him with the wonderful Lorenzo Lamas instead of New York! <br /> <br /> Mel is a college professor of microbiology, who goes to the islands with his son on a spring break, only to find himself in prison on the island, who is infected with a rapidly spreading virus. It is convenient for him that Lorenzo plays a hunky character who has a daughter just his son's age. <br /> <br /> Mel shines, as does Lorenzo, who has a slightly younger couple. An interesting prerequisite in these times of chemical and biological terrorism. It's worth seeing, especially for Y & R fans.
