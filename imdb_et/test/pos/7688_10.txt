"Porgy & Bess" was the first film my parents saw me. Even with the age limit of 5 years, I dramatically made the call "Crown, PLEASE Bess!" I was lucky enough to see that "Porgy & Bess" is a television show so many years ago and now I have all the great memories (and recordings) to remember this wonderful, wonderful movie. I have waited and wished and hope that one day I can have a copy of "Porgy & Bess" - but it doesn't look like it happens. What's up? Of course, there is enough public interest in this film to justify the release. After all these years, I remember it and it looks like I'm not alone. This film is a human emotion - jealousy, lust, anger, bravery, determination. "Porgy & Bess" is a buried pearl that deserves to be enlightened by a new audience and an old audience.
