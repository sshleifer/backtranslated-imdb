On the way to the country house, to hear the new play that is considered the theater producer, his secretary and playwright will eventually mud. They make their way to a nearby house to reach only the playhouse groom's home. If you can't think of murder and chaos, then you have not paid attention. <br /> <br /> It's a good entry into the old dark house genre. Not only is this not a good mystery, but also some very funny liners that travel through it. The cast is great on the table and they are more than ready for good material with good time. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that this is one of the best genres, it should have been, but something happened to me that put me in a gradual step of ten. I can't tell you what it is, not sure. Maybe it is the feeling that I knew where it was going from the very beginning, or maybe something else, I'm not sure what was, but there was something I couldn't shake, which made me a movie like that, though wanted to love it. It just longed to be big and somehow dropped. <br /> <br /> That said I will let you know. After all, this is a very funny movie that will completely entertain, even though it is missing.
