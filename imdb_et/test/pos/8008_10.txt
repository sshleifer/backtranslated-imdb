Of all Bat movies, my favorite is Batman Returns. This beautiful, dark and funny movie is one of Tim Burton's best works. Although it is much more violent and darker, it is Batman, who created the creator Bob Kane several years ago. Michael Keaton reiterates his role as Gotham City avenger. This time he is against the cat of two deadly enemies, Danny Devito Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer. As a result of Danny Elfman's excellent casting and film, the film will lead us to the adventure of Batman struggling with the forces of evil trying to take over Gotham City. Christopher Walken is a great look, as Max Shrek, a clever businessman with his own sleeve with a sleeve. But of course, Michelle Pfeiffer is the one who steals the show. With all these components, you have a movie that captures you. That's why you go to the movies. That is all. It is really a shame that Tim Burton could not steer the others. If so, I think the franchise will be strong today. Batman Returns is a fantastic experience for fans who love cool movies.
