MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a fantastic movie that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time. You know that after the so-called "Gift from God" actually received the loan, these characters pay back the money and that everything is happy at the end, but how they are not so obvious there. Scenes are often funny and occasionally move when characters appreciate their lives and where they go. The majority of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip. Frank Gorshin, Shirley Jones, and Cloris Leachman prove they can do more than play Riddler, Mother Partridge or Mary's friend Phyllis, while Jill Eikenberry and Wendie Malick play different characters than our TV series. At the same time, Ursula Burton's image of the nun is as touching as the funny jokes of the nuns or the congregation. If you are looking for an amazingly cast movie, good music (including Shirley Jones' "The Way You Look Tonight") and an uplifting end, try it. I don't think you're disappointed.
