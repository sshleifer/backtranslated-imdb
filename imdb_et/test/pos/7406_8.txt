This film was my first acquaintance with Chris Cooper's talents. I was deeply impressed by what he was playing. I knew when I saw the film, that more talented things came from this talented actor. He plays the captain of the Union, who, along with a couple of men involved, feeds in East Kentucky. They happen on Sesech's wife's farm, whose husband has decided to go to the Confederation. <br /> <br /> The portrayal of East Kentucky and its severely divided feelings during the war are so precise. If you are looking for a war movie with a lot of blood and courage, it wouldn't be so. If you are looking for a drama that actually explores the psychology of wars and philosophical people, this is the best study of how shared loyalty influenced people's interaction in border states during the American Civil War.
