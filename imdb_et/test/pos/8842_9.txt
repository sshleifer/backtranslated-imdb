"The Thing" is John Carpenter's best film. Combining their talents for building tensions and decent production value shocks brought out a totally sci fi / horror movie. <br /> <br /> Filming in really difficult conditions, it creates a very incredible stand-alone research base that puts tension before something has even happened. The ensemble is poured well with Kurt Russell, proving a charismatic leading man even under his beard. <br /> <br /> Tensioning slowly with horrible horror (politely influenced by Master Rob Bottin - currently led by Freddy vs Jason) Carpenter creates a film that is rarely matched. Given that it came out the same year as ET, it couldn't be different! <br /> <br /> It's worth watching / rewriting. 9 out of 10 <br /> <br /> p.s. The DVD is great. Lots of extras and the best DVD comment (with Carpenter & Russell). Plus, it will be repaired in Dolby Digital for even lighter sound effects.
