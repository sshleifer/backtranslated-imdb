For those who assume that documentaries are objective beings, let me give you a little lesson in making American films. <br /> <br /> Documentaries are highly dependent on casting. You choose and choose signs that enhance the value of your movie drama and entertainment. <br /> <br /> When you take a ton of shots, you combine them to make a movie with ups and downs, turning points, climate change, and more. If you have problems with existing film footage, take a picture that makes sense, find some footage, or be wise with your story. <br /> <br /> The claim that filmmakers used film rather than film (favelas alongside beautiful beaches) does not diminish the value of the film as a dramatic piece, and a particular image is one that resonates enough to justify its non-real involvement. Anyway, you use the recorded material. So they didn't have the police's violent material for this neighborhood. Does that mean it doesn't contain it and just talk about it or maybe put some animation with animation so that the audience won't be "deceived"? Um, no. <br /> <br /> To the end of the hopes, why not? Yes, the Americans did it. Yes, Americans are optimistic bastards. But why should you stop with a note? Just because it is set to a large extent for foreign and foreign films at signing? Let foreigners portray life's bad prospects. <br /> <br /> Let the Americans think the future may be a happy end result. There may be one.
