As much as I hate to disagree with the original poster, I found quite good Asterix and Vikings, and a tremendous step forward in previous attempts to animate everyone's favorite holiday. <br /> <br /> Nobody knows the famous comic series that makes the show difficult to follow, but they know us, it's a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, animation is much better than previous comic adjustments. You can say that they took the time and effort to really restore the appearance and feel of the communes. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, there are other Asterix titles in the movie, and I can see how fans of these titles may seem to be confused or a little missed, but I actually saw one of my favorite comics that were faithfully represented on the screen. The small spoilers follow ... <br /> <br /> Asterix and his loyal friend Obelix travel north to save the nephew of the Vikings captured by the Vikings. The Vikings think that the son who teaches them for fear can fly thanks to some poorly worded advice from his village druid. In the process, the boy Viking Chief's daughter Abba and they fall in love, etc. etc. If my explanation sounds complicated, don't worry. The plot is easy to follow! Definitely a big buy. You can buy this DVD via Amazon France, but warn it. Your DVD player is unlikely to be able to play it. I had to change my computer's region setting to view it.
