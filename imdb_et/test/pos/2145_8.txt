I don't really know why this movie got such hostile reception when it was first released. Of course, it is too long and somewhat free in the images of sexuality and violence, but there are also many well thought out films. I do not think seriously that people who hated the "gate of heaven" actually understood it. "The Gate of Heaven", in its uncut form, such as "The Deer Hunter", shows greater differences in the livelihood of precarious and dangerous life (such as Wyoming immigrants and Averil) and lives comfortably and as a privilege (like the established Americans) in the "Prince and Epilogue of Wyoming and Averilis". Life is painful, but it can also be lively in comparison to the uneven life of the Averil epilogue, and since Michael Cimino took a big picture to make the picture historically accurate, it is exciting as an American (and possibly the prosecution) document in Old West Wyoming. Dialogue is often really smart and emotional, and together with great music and cinematography, the film works like a truly poetic artwork. "Heaven's Gate", which refuses to patronize the viewer, is not for every taste, but Hollywood turns out to be so much commercial every year that is so much easier to leave remind you of the senseless eye confusion (even if its example becomes blocking) that Gate and Cimino really deserve r Anyone should see the uncut version at least once and then they should make their own thoughts. <br /> <br />
