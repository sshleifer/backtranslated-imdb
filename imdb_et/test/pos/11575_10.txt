"I am deadly dead. This is the most prominent competition you can imagine. It will be an inconvenience that has nothing to do with walking, without around, without spectators, without bending, without reward, without much victory, a big fear of winning, slim thin skepticism, without greater faith in your own self and even less in your opponent. If such is the ultimate wisdom, then a greater mystery of life than some of us think it is. "Marlow Joseph Conrad's" Heart of Darkness "<br /> <br /> It's hard to make a lyrical death issue in every piece of art. But films have recently made bold attempts to humanize it to the extent that it is part of the cycle of all living beings and can be chosen rather than legislative. "Selected" is the operative word for Alejandro Amenabar Sea Inside, which is loosely based on the true story of the Galician seaman Ramon Sampedro. It is a drama about euthanasia, without prejudice to love, poetry, and friendship. If it sounds like a barbaric invasion (2003), where the cancer professor says goodbye to lifelong friends and loves before he takes his life, then you are right. In fact, the sea is better because it spends more intimate time with the protagonist before it goes, a remarkable none of those moments that are least dull or uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem as Ramon has expressive eyes and directs the voice to a romantic quadriplegic, a combination of harsh realistic and poetic sufferers. Belen Rueda plays Julia, a disabled lawyer, who turns to Ramon as an imaginary lover, accelerating her shine when her life degenerates into a disease. Almost soap operative situation is accompanied by Lola Duenas, who is Rosa, a blue collar, who initially tries to look for Ramon out of death, but quickly falls in love with her. Talk about disability romance? This man is an unbelievable happiness that attracts significant women and he cannot move his finger. But tell me that he can prove the ultimate argument about what women want: love that speaks, not just does. <br /> <br /> I do not want to mention a larger movie that is now designed for an Oscar with euthanasia at its peak in order not to spoil the first timer experience. It is enough to say that both films succeed in opening both sides of the disputed issue without forcing a particular position. Religious rights have the right to complain that the former film and the barbaric invasion are suicide; he has no right to blame the beautifully balanced inside of the sea. <br /> <br /> "Life in this state is not dignified," says Ramon. The irony is that he drives himself to the highest dignity that puts someone in doubt about his determination to end his life. The Sea Inside is a great entry to the 2004 Oscar nominations for the best foreign language film.
