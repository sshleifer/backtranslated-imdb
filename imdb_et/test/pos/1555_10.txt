Great story, great demonstrative, amazing product values ​​and cool, glowing, short and perfect twist at the end. What a great short film! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in Vail or Aspen at a film festival and won it. Then I saw it again at the second festival (where it won again) and was even more impressive because the fine touches appear a second time - for a short film it wraps a lot of smart layers for a short time. > <br /> AWOL is not heart weak, but it is very well made and absolutely impressive for a short film - for every movie. This is an interesting story that was very well talked about, and every scene moves a story that shows good movie choices for making a movie. The movie looks fantastic and David Morse is also stunning, with dynamic performance for every scene. Looking at his character's attempt to defeat the life of the Balls, this is a great viewing experience. evil can become very gray when rhetoric sounds and tries to make things black and white. AWOL allows the audience to decide for themselves what is the message that is real and what is not, which adds to the mystery. <br /> <br /> Both times I've seen, the audience was WAY more of this movie than others who play it, which says a lot. There are a lot of shorts right now, but few give AWOL an excellent and complicated theme that AWOL does. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the previous reviewer has been turned off from his rocker or has a personal agenda because it is really a good example of short independent filmmaking. I see a lot of short films, and I have to say whether all the short films that made the circles of the festivals were good, but the short ones would have some serious feet.
