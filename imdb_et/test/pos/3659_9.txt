The opening ceremony of the "South Asian International Film Festival" (SAIFF) in New York was an event many were waiting for. <br /> <br /> Finally, could I look at "Hari Om"? I was tired of looking at the "promo" loop and Nitin Sawhney's song for Angel's long taste promo, leaving me to beg to hear the rest of it. I had a visual impression? And the tremendously curious way to look at the rugged car rickshaw driver wins the hearts of amazing sophisticated French tourists! I remember the topic being quite interesting when I read it on paper or two years ago. Especially since I was personally very fascinated a couple of years ago with how Jodhpur's Rickshaws were! The snow and the crowds outside the theater are my only anxiety. <br /> <br /> When I was in the theater, I found that the SAIFF organizers only made a disaster. I was uncomfortable and embarrassing how bad the event was and found myself in a difficult place trying to explain and apologize to my friends (mixed nationalities) whom I invited to the VIP guest list. I was hoping to prove to them that Indian cinema was not always Bollywood? Finally, and ultimately, the film started our fresh air. Or so I thought? Hari Om ?? chaos and noise started. Autorickshaws honking, traffic and a lot of chaos. I found myself smiling, because I felt at home "at home". <br /> <br /> So did Hari Omi's journey begin? Car Rickshaw Driver In Jaipur? The director could not make a better choice of this character. Monsoon Wedding Brush Om? Vijay Raaz, in spite of her heroic appearance, carries this film only with the skills and character of her actors, filled with the nuances of Rajasthan rickshaw conductors. He's the winner all the time. But how and where he learned English even so smoothly is the question! But his character represents a beautiful sense of humor and sensitivity. I love his innocent portrayal of a simple shop in the village? who have great aspirations to be famous for a few days? and still knows when to cut the reality. <br /> <br /> Camille, however, enters the film to wear clothes that no one dares to wear in such a place. But it's funny that no one seems to be dressing too much for her. She looks very dazzling! Especially in the second half of the movie when he changes Indian clothing. However, his relationship with his boyfriend seems very vague. It probably adds to the reality of some type of relationship. <br /> <br /> The film takes us through the most beautiful parts of Rajasthan? The surprising part is that no place is depicted other than what they really are. You see dirt, you see primitive houses? you see Rajasthan exactly as it is! But ?? there is only one adjective that leaves you? "beautiful." <br /> <br /> This is the first director who probably knows how to portray India exactly as it is - dirt and noise and all the negative features that India has confirmed! ?? But it looks like one of the most beautiful places. <br /> <br /> Kudos! him for that. <br /> <br /> The only downside to the movie that I could see is the pace? I found that it is quite slow in some parts? You can be sure that you will never get bored. <br /> <br /> Nitin Sawhney's background points add a stylish international but very Indian flavor to the film. The song "Angel", which plays the movie at a very important time, fits nicely with the visuals. <br /> <br /> I have also heard that apart from the main characters, all the other actors are simply ordinary people. who has never faced a camera ever !! It is commendable, given that most of our so-called established participants? still can't display realistic characters on the screen. <br /> <br /> Overall, is watching this movie a beautiful experience? It's a pot of emotions. It got romance, humor? Realism? beautiful visuals and places ..., great music, great cast? PACKING OFFER! When I left the theater, I felt proud to be India? A few days later I asked one of my Bulgarian friends who had watched me with a movie when he wanted to watch another Indian movie? and his answer was ?? "Is it better than Hari Om? If that is the case, then I'm going, if not, I think I'd go. From now on Hari Om is the benchmark for every Indian movie." Mr. Bala, are you reading?
