The film follows the high school students of NYC. There's a black singer from Coco (Irene Cara) who does it up despite everything. He is a helping hand of Bruno (Lee Curren), a white musician. Then there is Doris (Maureen Teefy) who wants to be an actor - but she's shy and scared. She gets friends with Motgomery (Paul McCrane) - allegedly the only school student and is a novel by the novel (Barry Miller). Then Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray, who unfortunately died in 2003), is a homeless and a big dancer - but can't read. Then there are different teachers (Albert Hague, Anne Meara stand out) who are trying to teach children. "Fame" won), the dances are energetic and the young cast show many ambitions and talents. But this movie remains in the drama part of the boat. Many plot lines will end up completely at the end of the film and will end completely. Why did Coco porn? Did Doris and Raul stay together for the lessons? Was it? But with Montgomery - what happened to her? And did Leroy ever stop - and how? Too many long speeches (Raul has two) and moments that just do something. I expect the script to have cuts - I can't believe this movie was just open. <br /> <br /> Still, it's worth seeing and playing music again. Basically, not one bad song and dances go to full force (and one point to stop traffic - literally!). My favorites are "Fame", "Out Here ..." and "I Sing the Body Electric", which is a great closing song. So I recommend it, but I can only give it 7 - the script is really needed to tie open ends - and it wasn't. for performing arts, but did not get permission. The school dean read the script and said that the film swears too much. This is true - there are a lot of unpleasant languages, but this is how high school kids talk. Avoid the TV version that's abysmally overdubs.
