In a small, picturesque village of Sicily, someone brutally kills young, sexually curious boys. The local police force is trying to track down the murderer and list up to five major suspects, including the voyeurist retard Giuseppe (Vito Passer) and the towering backwoods of the voodoo doll called Maciara (Florinda Bolkan). There is also Don Alberto (Marc Popel), a beautiful young priest who heads the local boy's school, Andrea (Tomas Milian), a journalist who helps the police, and a beautiful Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet), a proud but seriously screwed drug addict who seems to be for very young boys. As typical for the giallo subtype, there is no full discovery of the plot until the last pair of frames, but if you hang it long enough, this film will cost you. The scenario (written by Fulci, Gianfranco Clerici and Roberto Gianviti) keeps the red herring to a minimum and keeps you interested, and the story is well supported by excellent location work, cinematography (by Sergio D'Offizi) and musical result (by Riz Ortolan). Functioning, especially Bolkan, is also very good. Fulci fans who wander away in the 80's, such as BEYOND and ZOMBIE, see more art and less gore than they predict, but they still have a particularly disgusting chaining in the cemetery (odd but effective, putting Ornella Vanon on the ballad for the singer) Quei giorni insieme a te ") and a long drum image that Fulci liked so much that he recovered it in his film THE PSYCHIC (1977). The scenes of the children killed are kept mostly on the screen (except for short strangulation), but the camera does not hesitate on its bodies. The film did not appear in the theater in America, and probably because some anti-Catholic elements were the story of a limited theater edition in Europe.
