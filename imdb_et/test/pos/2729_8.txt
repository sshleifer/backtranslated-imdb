15 PARK AVENUE is the address of "Mithi / Mithali" (Konkona) looking for movies from the beginning. "Prof.Anu" (Shabhana Azmi) is Mith's extremely caring and loving half-sister of Mith's mother's earlier marriage. The film moves around these characters and examines the life of a schizophrenic patient (Mith). The director is trying to imagine the imaginary world of Mith, constantly bluffing Anule and others. <br /> <br /> Konkon deserves not only thousands of prizes (which I am sure he will get) for handing over this Mith in this movie. From the first scene you can see the face, the face, the burning lips and the sleepy eyes. Rahul Bose has done a good job, but it has been reduced to half of the film, despite his importance in his life. <br /> <br /> Watch out for intense relationships between movie characters, between Mith Anu, Anu and Anu's mother and Anu & Sanjiv (Kanwaljit Singh). Shabhana Azmi, as usual, has done riveting to remember as a sister who sacrificed her life for Mith. <br /> <br /> Film may not be your usual Hindi potboiler, but can definitely help people look at patients with schizophrenia in a completely different light. <br /> <br /> As usual, Aparna Sen brings the movie to various ends, not to any clich√©s. Hats for him, for this great movie !!!
