The biggest tragedy of this thoroughly pleasant movie is that there is no spread in the US. I was lucky enough to see this movie at the Boston International Women's Cinema Festival and recommend it to anyone who can see it. The winner of this film is the excellent talent and thoughtful script and the excellent direction of the talented and funny Rose Troche.
