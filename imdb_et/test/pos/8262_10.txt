As you can see, I loved this book so much that I use the title of my online subject and I have more than 15 years. (Okay, so it had to be phonetically written to fit the BBS nickname restriction at that time, but what could I do?) If anyone finds this movie, I'd love to see it! Janet McTeer is big everywhere. I think he would have made a big Prue. And it's even the early Clive Owen - before the Chancer (big series himself). What not to love? I hope that the powers that are wise will make it available to DVD soon! Some of the real recesses they cast out are the time for well-executed productions to do so in the market.
