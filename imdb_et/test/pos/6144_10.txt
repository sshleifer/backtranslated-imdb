I saw this movie at night where I couldn't sleep, I loved it and was looking to find out when it was again, probably the best movie I ever saw, and even now most people are full I've never seen before, but it seems like a real biography based on NYC. It's a movie that enhances the joy of watching because you see it, hear it, and feel it, from the moment I saw Wirey drink beer and watching the game I imagined it should be like father growth, is so many lines from this film that I use every day like "personal time" in the bathroom with 7-11 drinks, GREAT FILM
