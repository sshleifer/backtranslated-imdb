What I got was better. <br /> <br /> Like many of the films I've recently commented on, I had to wait for a while. Especially after I saw one of Toshiaki Toyoda's other "Blue Spring", which is easily in my top 20 favorites. I loved the trailer for "9 souls" and I thought it sounded very good. I didn't hear anything bad about it. Now I know why. <br /> <br /> This movie starts as a comedy, but in the last half of the movie, it changes quickly. It becomes more dramatic as each character faces its tragedies. Each character gets enough time on the screen and you care about what happens to everyone. Although there are 9 characters that we need to learn and take care of in just two hours, Toshiaki Toyoda excels at it. <br /> <br /> When I saw "Blue Spring", I was hoping that the soundtrack would be at least a bit as good as it was in this movie. I got my wish because the "9 soul" soundtrack was also incredible. The music used in each scene, more dramatic, is simply wonderful. I loved every second of it. <br /> <br /> I wasn't sure if I wanted to see another Toshiaki Toyoda movie "Pornostar", but after I saw it, I'm going. Certainly. Also, because I read a plot for this and I think it sounds very good. I am waiting for it. "9 Souls" R1 DVD has two interviews with Toyota. He says he has finished another movie and wants to start writing his next scenario. I can't wait for both. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. You have to see it. Now.
