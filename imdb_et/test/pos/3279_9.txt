Thank you to Mr Van Peebles for informing us not only of the existence of black cowboys, but of providing a convincing story that was easy to follow. <br /> <br /> Plot, background, music, and talent were all top-notch. It was great that you used so many African-American artists to talk about a black cowboy. It was also good to see Billy Zane in this movie. Does he ever play a good man? <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to expand their mindset. It's a great movie and I feel like I've seen it. Hopefully you will feel the same.
