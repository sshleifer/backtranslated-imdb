Dirty war is absolutely one of the best political, government and well-written TV shows in 25 years. <br /> <br /> Actress is great, writing is remarkable. <br /> <br /> The Diry War reveals the true side of why we are not prepared to respond to a nuclear, biological and radiological terrorist attack on American soil. <br /> <br /> Dirty war should be a big movie - it's so good! I recommend this great drama to anyone who wants to know the truth. <br /> <br /> This television drama shows how British Intelligence (MI5 & MI6) attempts to disclose a terrorist plot and conspiracy to destroy innocent victims because England's involvement in the Iraq war. <br /> <br /> The scenes of the different parts of London in England are also remarkable. <br /> <br /> Dirty War is a must have !!!
