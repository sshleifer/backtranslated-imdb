I'm totally in love with this girl. let me tell you: I'm from Romania and here's only the sixth series that runs every other day on the US TV. I check the internet and download it from there, so I'm in line with the rest of the world. I can't believe how deep I am in this show. I know absolutely everything about them, which I watched on the Internet, what is Rory's car, what are their average names and other such things: Rory is also Leigh and Lorelay is Victoria. I don't understand why my boy doesn't like them and I try to see him how wonderful they are, but without success, but he understands me and lets me be with his "obsession" with Gilmore girls. I adore them. I really hope that if anyone sees it, it will give them a try: You won't regret it
