Jennifer Montgomery "Art for Children's Teachers" is a stunning, disturbing masterpiece. Montgomery's gritty camera work and cinematic work with brilliant unemployed performances, which she awakens, adds a shocking, crude sense of realism to attracting a 14-year-old Jennifer married school head counselor. Scenes of an amazingly unpleasant actor playing Jennifer (Caitlin Grace McDonnell) and Jennifer's mother (which Ruth Montgomery actually expressed) are some of the most intriguing and powerful I've ever seen on film. End lesson learned here? "Nothing is more dangerous than a boring man who creates bad art." Well, I would recommend this remarkable "Art" piece to anyone who is interested in a thought-provoking cinema.
