* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I don't care what anyone says, this movie is fun. This is a sequel to Jack Frost, a movie killer snowman. A snowman is created when a convicted convict is put into an execution chamber, but the truck disappears with a vehicle carrying DNA manipulation chemicals that change the human DNA bond with dirt or snow in this case. The first film was just boring and finally the snowman was destroyed by pouring antifreeze. <br /> <br /> Or they thought. <br /> <br /> This movie takes about a year after the second. Some scientists restore Jack Frost by mixing antifreeze with chemicals. There's no explanation why they do it, they just do. Meanwhile, the Sheriff, who first arrested, goes to the Bahamas. Unfortunately, the snowman comes along. <br /> <br /> This movie is everything. It speaks of carrots that can stand up, ice cubes that explode when you get stuck in their mouths, and killer snowballs. Yes, killer snowballs. They even say "Dada!" like children. I have to give those credit makers. Snowballs are some of the sweetest little things ever dreamed of. I wish I had one pet. Finally, the cold island freezes as if the killer snowman had the opportunity to influence the weather. <br /> <br /> Then there are actors. There's a Manners, the first movie FBI agent, except here, where he wears an eye. YARR MATEYS, OUT OF TIMBER, I am FBI AGENT! YARRR! And then there's a stereotypical British adventurer and a stereotypical black and black language with eyelashes. And finally, Captain Fun. Fruiti man in the form of a planet, bar not. <br /> <br /> This movie is not scary, but it is fun. I laughed at my ass all the way and recommend it to anyone who likes a good "bad" movie. <br /> <br /> *** out ****
