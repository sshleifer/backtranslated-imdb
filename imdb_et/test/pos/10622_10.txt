These films made me suffer and I loved it! LOVE YOU! It haunted me for days. I think Erika is the kind of character you shine at the same time. The most frightening sex element ever caught on film. This is Haneke's best job so far. He is the only living director to set the pace of Kubrick again. The violence of this film is proud. In short, the film itself is hate. The sentence is a movie to try to find love to stop hate yourself and find it a hopeless hope.
