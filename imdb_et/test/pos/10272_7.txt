The film is visually graceful, but the plot is mostly interesting. The film depicts the progress of zigzags in studying the inner sense of the main actor. Max, who has lived in New York for two years and plans to marry a girl with whom he met there, comes back to Paris and unexpectedly meets his former girlfriend, whom he is still very proud of, but finally finds what he really loves is his best friend . Nonlinear narration, so many setbacks and each section is articulated quite well. The three women Max has met, symbolize something we have to follow, although they have no clear picture of the underlying motivations. His groom is what he needs, not his love and hence the loyalty we see. He does not give him love but only stability. True love cannot be found in his relationship with a former girlfriend. Only fantasy to escape to him - many things he is very romantic about him, but almost nothing seems acceptable. The one who really revives Max's life is his best friend. The balance at the end is not identical to the initial balance, as Max has understood much more about his inner feeling. Nonlinear structure makes the search progress more complicated. Not as brilliant as "Pulp Fiction", but things look much more natural in "Apartment". Max is not the only character who undergoes transformation, and is actually also a description of Romane Bohringer. He also does good cinematography, and Monica Bellucci looks very beautiful. A good comment on today's love and no doubt a movie worth seeing. <br /> <br />
