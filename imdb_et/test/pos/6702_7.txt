Finally, I kept the Lifeforce DVD, which had a widescreen format healthy and astonished Henry Mancini's score to a maximum. After watching Lifeforce for fifteen years, I have to say that the "uncut" DVD version was both great and disappointing. The US version is so * much * better than the DVD (Europe?) Version. The US version of the vitality is moving much faster (DVD editing is terrible. It seems like an unfinished section). And many scenes that the American version does not see, add little or nothing to the final problem. In fact, one "new" moment destroys almost the whole movie when Caine (Peter Firth) meets a male alien in the cathedral. I still love this scene in the US version. On the DVD, male Cain talks to Cain and what she says is so fun. It's fun: <br /> <br /> "It's much less scary than you just come to me!" male alien says deep in the 1950s style of voice. I was on the floor when I saw it. It just doesn't belong to the movie. This scene is a pure camp otherwise a super serious flick. I'm glad that Hooper (or whatever) created this scene when the movie appeared in North America. There are a number of changes to the US version that make Lifeforce much better and want the DVD to have a US version. Editing is sharp and tiring without being annoying, and some of the places that were already boring in the US version are even more boring in the DVD version because it's added scenes. And the credit on the DVD is terrible. Much better in the US version. More subtle. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. It is basically an alien who makes a pit-stop on the ground and sucks as much Lifeforce as possible. The film has too many planar, uninspiratory sequences (talk, talk, talk), but when it comes to London, it's fun. The movie really looks like in these scenes. Finally, Hooper finally sees what he's great: chaos, wild, horror! Lifeforce should have had more of these chaos scenes. They are the best apocalyptic scenes for movies. It's also the best zombie movie. Zombies are hungry (life force, not flesh) and they are mad and brisk and terrible. Slowly moving cages from other zombie films. Many people have also criticized the end, but I love it. It leaves you high and dry, like one of the victims of draining vitality. <br /> <br /> And I think this movie came out cute and beautiful during the 80s when people got up on E.T. or Cocoon or other sweet and boring, you feel good in sci-fi movies. No wonder it was bombarded because it was ahead of its nihilistic point of view! <br /> <br /> To DVD, well, it's not good. The picture is muddy and grainy and has no additional features. But it's nice to see the movie on the widescreen. I hope they will release a clean and crisp US version of the DVD and comments from Cooper and Dykstra.
