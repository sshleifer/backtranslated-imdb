The runner Carl Stargher has kidnapped and murdered young women, letting them drown in a water-filled chamber. He's been detained by the FBI, but is in a coma and his last kidnapping victim is waiting in a cell timed to fill with water. <br /> <br /> See the above assumption and see that there is a lot to see before. The magic of Mark Protosevich's script is that he changes the old old chestnut to something quite different from what you expect. When I mentioned, the plot includes a machine that allows psychiatrist Stargher to enter the mind, then creates a completely different film. <br /> <br /> It wouldn't be enough to make CELL into different thriller classes, but director Tarsem Singh creates a visually striking, surreal thriller. Paul Laufer's cinematic art, in which opaque basic colors are at the forefront, is stunning, but Singh does not let that end, things like costume design where Stargher travels around his idiosynthetic universe, wearing joyful costumes, has a visual impact that makes it so much more than what The thriller is working for something <br /> <br /> What stops CELL from becoming a classic movie is that you will increasingly know that the whole film is rotating around visual images rather than the natural narrative. We see the third character, the FBI man enters the Stargher domain, but it seems more like a challenged plot just to introduce the audience to stunning but very disturbing moments. <br /> <br /> It should also be noted that this is a rather distracting thriller, with a very depressing atmosphere that prevents the film from being, if not enjoyable, engaging. One scene where the FBI agent talks about a case where a pedophile strikes a rap only later to cut off the heart of his victim will fill your heart with so much despair that can reach the off button. You will probably need to look at a huge amount of thrillers until you see another that is disturbing
