Not because "Harold and Maude" have used suicide as successfully as a love story. Acting, with the upper notch, is terrible. For a well-structured script, things are moving at a pleasant pace. Black comedies are moments, but I would classify "My Suicidal Sweetheart" as a unique romantic comedy with dark humor. The relationship between two psychologically challenged love is both touching and interesting. The film asks you what is the normal relationship? I highly recommend "My Suicidal Sweetheart". Look for it on the DVD under the title "Crazy for Love". You don't have to be disappointed. - MERK
