This film was only made 48 years after the end of the civil war - the 50th anniversary of the end of the war is most likely to come. In the film there are battles and people of the era who look quite impressive and realistic. It also gives a different and more balanced view than just its modern, NATURAL BIRTH - a clearly absurd and racist film. That's why this short film would be great for class use to discuss the war and tell the story of a very young man who drives a drummer. The boy does good and is a hero, although the film ends in a melodramatic way - a definite convention of the day. Not a big movie, but a decent plot, decent action, and a few top players you often saw in the movies of the other day. <br /> <br /> One annoying aspect of this movie was too frequent use of title cards to describe or set the stage for things that were really obvious. It got annoying from time to time.
