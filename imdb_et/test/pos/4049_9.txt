This is a remake of the 80's anime classics and it's even better. Sylia, Nene, Castle and Priss are all back as Knight Sabers in their heavy costume, fighting with robotic generations. The animation is crisp, the characters are well-developed and active stones. Priss is a singer in his usual work, so there are some great songs in the series. Violence is quite large, but most are robots and there are some fan services, but nothing else. DVDs also have many additional features, including comments that really enhance your understanding and enjoyment of the show. Must have any anime fan. <br /> <br /> Also recommended: Burst Angel, Armitage III
