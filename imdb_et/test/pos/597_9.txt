This film is one of my most pleasant memories of childhood. Seeing the Muppet (at the height of their popularity) toward Hollywood, singing and dancing, where Miss Piggy saw her beloved Kermit, Fozzie Bear's best, like everyone's leader, and the generous "extras" that offered the film that turned Kermiti's melancholy ukulele "Rainbow Connection "was nominated for the Oscar this year, but Norma Rae's" It goes as it goes ". I choose Kermiti song every day! Get the kids and enjoy this timeless fantasy ... one day they find it, rainbow connections, lovers, dreamers and me!
