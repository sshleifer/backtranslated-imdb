Pitch Black is a surprisingly good film. I was not a Vin diesel fan before I saw Pitch black, but after Pitch Black's sight, my respect for Vin Diesel has risen. He did an excellent job playing Riddick, who wanted many murders. His character is cold and makes many decisions that surprised me, as close as Riddick goes to the ship and rescued his ass, leaving everything to die. I like this film and how it deals with human instinct. This movie is a small budget, but this movie shows that you don't need amazing special effects and a lot of money to make a good movie. I think all the characters made this movie. I'll give this movie out of 10 out of 10;)
