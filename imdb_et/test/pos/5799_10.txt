It is difficult to understand this movie today and in the US. We have nothing to actually compare. Here's an attempt to compare: as in the last few years of the Saddam rule, the Iraqi filmmaker has somehow managed to make a film that for the first time showed life, as it actually was in that country. The life of a normal young girl with all the terror and repression. Then the film was freely displayed in Iraq. If you could imagine this unlikely event, you might have an idea of ​​what this film has been doing in the Soviet Union in recent years. Before this movie, Soviet cinema was highly censored. Soviet films would only show an ideal life in the employee's paradise. Then suddenly this. Alcoholism, casual sex, ugly wasteland that was a Soviet city, a suffocation contamination, a proletariat that sacrificed each other and itself, total hopelessness - that's all there. People were stunned. Soviet women wandered often during exhibitions. Many would say that this is the story of their life. It was a cultural earthquake that similar filmmakers only dream of achieving. It undoubtedly hastened the collapse of the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> Reading the opinions here I see that few understand this movie. One says it was groundbreaking because it contained real sex. For Soviet viewers, sex was a small event compared to the fact that it depicted reality for the first time in the Soviet cinema. Others compare it to current movies, such as "As Good as it Can". You can also compare Homer's Illia with the latest John Grissam novel. They just don't compare. It is not just a film, it was a social document and a changing social force. It has to be looked at or the movie is not understood. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers see it as a film about a Russian functional family. One even says it is hard for Vera to feel sorry for her returning to her family. The thing is that Vera and her family are symbols for the whole Soviet life. There was nowhere else to go because the family blocked and was in the next city. It was life in the Soviet Union for most people. <br /> <br /> This is a film that can be viewed on several levels: as a drama, it monitors the landscape of despair, as the social document shows the living conditions of that time as a political document that shows this people's attitude and the many causes and morals of the dissolution of the Soviet Union. the documentary evidences are the evil and cruelty of the dictatorship under control, which the victims practice with each other. <br /> <br /> Little Vera clearly shows the human tax that socialism will eventually take on the victims, even though the system has good intentions. In doing so, he helped to put an end to the Soviet regime, contributing to one of the major changes in modern history. This movie achieves what only a few films have ever achieved. It is not just a stunning story, but a force of time that has developed.
