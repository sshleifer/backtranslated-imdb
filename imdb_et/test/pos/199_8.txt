Looking at this movie recently, I had to keep in mind that it was made in 1957 .......... and in the USSR! This makes it even more remarkable. Many cinematographic effects in the film appear cliche in 2002, but in 1957 they were original. I saw this movie for the first time in 1963 when it first appeared in the US, and then I was hit by its originality. Now, having seen it 40 years later, I have no reason to think.
