Hey; Belmondo! Look to Anna Karina! Great American improvised New Wave (or Independent you want to call it), not as good as Godard or Truffaut and not flawless, but hey kind of realism, style, warmth and humor. I love this NY accent; "you don't know anything!"; "Forget it". Just like the new French wave, it's young; partying, falling in love or just hanging. Lelia Goldoni is so cute; he is divine; wonderful. Ben Carruthers is also good, reminds me of Belmond. The movie you don't forget. <br /> <br /> Persistent from 26.5 to 31 ;-)
