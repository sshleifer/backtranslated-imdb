Made in France in 1950, Utopia was the last film Laurel and Hardy. Because of its bad reputation, the duo has been waiting for this film to be terrible for its 1930s productions. Although it does not meet these "vintage" comedies, I was pleasantly surprised. It's traceable and partly really funny! And it certainly has the same standard as you wanted. Some gags are derived from their previous work, but when this film is their first five years after the last Hollywood movie "The Bullfighters", routines are carried out with confidence when you wait for those professionals. Some scenes are not many, but the value of this movie is that some scenes are funny and as such totally priceless. I especially liked before bedtime. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, I felt sad. Our heroes are left in their desert. This is such a real metaphor of truth in life. Hollywood and the audience of that time had sent stars to the island of memories in the desert, and it became the last picture they portrayed on the film. Ollie died seven years later and Stan died fifteen years later. In 1963, Stan returned to the offer to appear "This is a mad mad mad world". What a shame was - a color film, just two years before he went. But her health was probably not much. <br /> <br /> These guys are probably the biggest comedy performers of all time, and while the movie is far from their real potential, it's still an honor to watch them. appear in the last film and touch the echoes of these high talents.
