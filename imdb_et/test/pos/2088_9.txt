I looked at "9 souls" at the 12th International Film Festival in Athens (September 2006), with the participation of film director Toshiaki Toyoda and answering many questions to the audience. This movie is about 9 refugees, all very different characters from each other. They decide to travel together with their red van in Japan. Every time a commercial stops, we see these 9 refugees trying to escape from their past to create a new life or a dream. However, no matter how hard they strive, it seems impossible and their violent past follows them and leads them to final destruction. On the contrary, it is full of beautiful pictures, surreal elements and elegant humor. The Toyoda heroes cannot escape their "jail" and have "divine" punishment for their "crimes". These are the small pieces of the most beautiful painting, dominated by the inverted huge knife with the Tokyo Tower!
