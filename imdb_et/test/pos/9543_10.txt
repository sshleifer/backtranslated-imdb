I avoided this movie as a boy because I thought it wouldn't be a fight or a shot, policemen, robbers, cowboys or Indians. It was certainly not a pleasant movie. So I didn't see TRC until I was in my twenties and found it one of the most beautiful and exciting films I've ever seen. All actors give testimonials perfectly and every emotion is pulled from the scene of the viewer by scene. Filming and direction are foolishly simple, but they feel so natural and have a full story. My two favorite scenes are near Bobbie's birthday party and scene platform platform that are targeted and enhanced. The quality and wording of Jenny Agutter's voice when he calls: "Father! My father! take the emotions out of the viewer. Tears are good for me when I think so. <br /> <br /> This customization is not just a movie that is a precious art, it is also a perfect example of what all filmmakers should do. trying to create an emotional experience.
