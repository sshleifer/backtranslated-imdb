I had doubts about looking back at the Loneome Dove after seeing and enjoying the original. Without Tommy Lee Jones, who repeated his role as Woodrow's invitation or Anjelica Hustonina as Clara, I thought it didn't seem authentic enough. When I look at "return", I can honestly say that this is a worthy successor. Participants really show it to Jon Voight, Rick Schroder and Oliver Reed. I admit that the story may not be as attractive as the first, but "return" is definitely part of the excitement and captures the romance of the old west with some other movies. Anyone who still has reservations can be sure that returning to Lonesome Dove will succeed in capturing the "hours" of the original and will not disappoint. Do yourself a favor and check it out, Ol 'Gus would be proud!
