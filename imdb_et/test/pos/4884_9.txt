The gentleman has been the most annoying British sitcom to be on television and how a funny movie can be so bad that they have no taste, this movie will make you look again and again and still funny. /> <br /> it is surprising that it has done bad, but it is British, the cinema makes most of the time crap, but this time (in my words) the thrill of comedy giraffes over Lady's, this is the top British comedy and better than the Dodge ball so this and it doesn't prove that you are wrong because i really don't laugh through the movies, but this movie was amazing through comedy with the best characters but i was a bit disappointed how much Edward and Tabb wrote back there buy this movie and it will not cheat you.
