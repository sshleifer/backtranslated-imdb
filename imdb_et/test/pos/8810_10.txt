It takes a lot of time for the film to reach the already numb particles of my brain, which have not been used up because of the overloading of the films and the redoredoredocopy world. But this movie has made it to my "Magic Movies" list. To become a magic film, it must leave all its lines of descent into what I can only define as "bliss" and "total satisfaction". This film has used the fibers of how my mind thinks and if not deeply about the personal bond that my head and who made this share, it would look like the second "dead rave scene" movie when the 90s exploded Ecstasy madness. It's not how the movie came to me at all. It reaches me and pulled something that I thought would have died for a very long time and pushed me so far as to give it some criticism. I forgot how long it has been because I've seen something that left me feeling good. I strongly encourage you to see this movie.
