So well done. Photography, sound, music and performances were the best. It's also a fun story that brings smiles to every scene - I loved it and I'm a 60-year-old heterosexual man. Each sign seemed to fit its part on the road. This is the best result I saw from Mrs Capshaw - she has had more films than I thought, but it was a great achievement. I think it is a plus that you have a Spielberg money that would allow you to make a fat budget and all the best money you can buy technically. Two casts are successful in T.V. exhibitions now - it's easy to understand why. Tom Selleck does his usual good job.
