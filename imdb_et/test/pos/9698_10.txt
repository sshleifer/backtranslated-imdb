Everything you could ever hope for as your Jackass fan. As always in Knoxville & his team is risking life and limbs for our entertainment only. If you are a fan of the first movie and the first movie, you will not let you down like most of the sequel. The jokes they bring to each other are twice as funny, cruel, raw as ever and tricks and daring are twice as tough as all Jackass episodes you've ever seen. If your fan doesn't waste time, check it out, because Jackaass standards have 10 out of 10 movies just for opening credits, I can't get to know the spoilers in detail, but you have to see it.
