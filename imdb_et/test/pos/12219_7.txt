What can I say? I got up this morning and turned on sci-fi and watched half of the first season and thought of it. Weird, unusual and brilliant. It gives you all the possibilities and first thought it seems stupid. It must be the next best thing from X-Files, but as always, it never takes me down. I'm talking to you, it's scary and then fun and then juicy. After all, you have Miles a love puppy with a strange pet that is a new species. You have two people from the authorities. And the killer tsunami that will hit! Wow! And did I mention Miles pet as a potential killer (the rest of his species are). The surface is a brilliant show with twists and turns.
