I think several American baseball films are one of the best films ever made. When this movie was in production and heard it as a rugby movie. I read from the Highland team in the newspapers, but this film had no great expectations of sports that didn't interest me. <br /> <br /> Last night I watched it "on demand" and loved it almost as much as my favorite baseball films. Ryan Little and the cast and the team did an amazing job. Particularly convincing was Neil McDonough. As a "bad father," he showed a good choice and a subtle but moving character. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the Pacific Islanders. I've been happy to know many of these good people, and this film hits their wonderful spirit and culture. Back, showing how island culture became the main element of the Highland team, would have been an excellent addition to the film. <br /> <br /> Recently some pretty sticky films have been made in Utah. It is good to see such a high-quality film from bees.
