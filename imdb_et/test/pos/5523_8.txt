Haha, what a great movie! Wayne Crawford strikes back, or rather it was his first big strike, a terrible entertaining little ball of mania kitsch that masked a psycho-killer movie. In fact, it is a ** brilliant ** satire in post-hip American culture in the airline country, although the film was actually filmed in Miami independently. It violates any studio-oriented convention or plot device I can think of: SOMETIMA AUNT MARTHA IS NOT HIGH SCIENCES may not be a very technically adept film, but it is a great little part of America made by cheap people. honest, ambitious, imaginative and had steel balls. It took courage, nerve and guilt to make this film, which seemed to be a test of time. This film is fresh, vital, lively, unforgettable and charmingly strange to recommend to almost anyone with a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> I dug last year at the time I was fascinated by the "star" of Wayne Crawford (here pseudonym Scott Lawrence settled here), maestro of what can only be called a regional film, usually a B-grade. He is a writer, producer, director and actor all in one, probably the best-known 80-year-old apocalyptic favorite of NIGHT OF THE COMET. Here he plays Stanley, the trousers who wear half a pair of truly wonderful characters, probably homosexual laughing sheep after he knocked out some old ladies at Baltimore's jewelery. The legend of the Unsung screen Abe Zwick is absolutely convincing as Paul, who is the Aunt Martha of Stanley, a cloak of clothing, who has thought of Stanley that she has committed her loyalty. Martha looks as feminine as SOUTH PACIFIC's coconut bikini heads, but somehow it doesn't seem to notice - or take care? Because he's him, he doesn't have any visible sources of income, he seems to spend the whole day worrying about where Stanley is, and laughs around the neighborhood with his beef robe. Only in America ... <br /> <br /> As the movie opens, two of them have just arrived in Florida and settled in the old house of Ward Cleaver. the clich√© is surreal. During a memorable scene, Martha and an unwanted house guest sit on the couch, talk about Budweiser's problems and drink jars, which is one of the most amazing routine routines I've ever seen outside John Waters. Then there is Stanley, always in trouble, because he is a mop with a hippie attached to his vamp leading the psychedelic colored van, which is about as small as Batmobile, drinks his milk directly from cardboard, smokes drugs with a blonde bimba bimba . and keep the donuts in the old cigar box for a quick snack. Opposites attract, but I think Stanley also has something he does not like when young women he rocks are trying to remove his pants, and Martha's aunt always seems to have to get her out of trouble that inevitably causes her. The organs piled up, the nervous junkie leaving them in the flop of their house, Stanley's birthday cake breaks down and everyone meets in the local pizza shop before moving to the back of the wooden boy, where girls dance in their underwear. Things get out of hand when one of the neighbors tries to get a little strange with Marta, who naturally prefers to keep people in the hands when they invite themselves to a beautiful conversation. And this is a woman who carries not only a friable knife but also a charged .38. Finally, the strange duo captures the body, the baby and the place to go, and finally gets to the sheltered film studio where the technical team undoubtedly borrowed the equipment used to make the film. I hope they first asked politely for permission and cleansing. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Stanley and Marta / Paul must definitely be said, because dancing around that they are at least a homosexual couple would remain the primary content of the plot. We never see two of them being intimate, and although Stanley refers somewhat to a "ball", their relationship is more symbiotic than sexual. This is definitely not a "gay" movie with rich female nudity and 70s air that cannot be denied. Stanley & Paul never fills his indirect sexuality on the screen, even though the film would have been so important. It is not, the story is not their gender, it is related to the bonds they share, and how strange it is. Not their gay, but their peculiarities, who they are, who are the two strangest films ever to live on TV. <br /> <br /> The film is unique. It was made for just a few thousand dollars, which looks like borrowed studio kits, occasional placements and a few public places where they managed to get in the camera team when no one saw it. Dialogue is completely odd, secular and joyfully esoteric. This is a film that will take you by surprise, not everyone likes it, but for those with low budget tastes of American horrors / thrillers like NIGHT GOD SCREAMED, HELP ME! I'll take the blood and lace and the kids don't have to play when you've got it, then you're the winner here. <br /> <br /> 8/10: I would normally say something "worth restoring a DVD", but somehow I think it would destroy the sticky atmosphere of the movie, and Wayne Crawford, you, sir, rule.
