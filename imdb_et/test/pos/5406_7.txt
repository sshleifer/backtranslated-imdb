The second part of the darkness and denial that hides under American suburbia, the Imaginary Heroes crowns the life of the Travis family, all recovering after the suicide of their older son. <br /> <br /> A couple in the middle of the movie are Mother and Son Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) and Tim (Emile Hirsch), both of whom are differently acting as a result of death. Though Tim is testing prescription drugs and his own sexuality, Sandy retreats to his former self, smoking marijuana and reaching out to old infidelity. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Sandy and Timi is well researched, especially when referring to both that they have gone out of their family: Sandy because of her things and Tim, initially because she is always in the shadow of her successful older brother. Significantly less time is spent on Sandy's wife Ben (Jeff Daniels), who, in a devastating denial of desecration, assigns an additional food to Sandy for his dead son and put it on his old table at a dinner table. Michelle Williams' older sister Penny is guaranteed and can be easily removed from the movie. Despite her long hours of work, Imaginary Heroes doesn't see her many sub-blocks as much as individual stories, while some of the movie's black comedy doesn't come, and the writer / director Dan Harris liked it. And depicting the disrupted family dynamics is not as strong as many other similar ideas. However, despite some problems, the central performances of Weaver and Hirsch are stunning and the conclusions of the movie have been successfully reduced. <br /> <br /> Rating: B-
