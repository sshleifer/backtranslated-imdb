I saw this movie on television SCREAMERS and loved it. I heard an interesting story about this movie. When Roger Corman released it for passenger cars in the summer of 1981, his trailer department had previously sent a trailer that was not actually filmed. It was supposedly a shot of a naked woman who drove around the lab in a monster. When opening the movie while driving, Iranian clients complained that they didn't see the movie they saw. Theatrical owners named Corman and said their customers were feeling. So Corman was supposed to go to the cinematic copies and send a positive movie to the theater owners to tie them to the movie. Since the film was never negative for the film, it hasn't appeared in video, DVD, or TV shows. Has anyone seen this material? Anyone who saw this movie during the summer of 1981 remember it?
