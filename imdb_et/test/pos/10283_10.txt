L'Appartement is, in my opinion, a very purposeful film by Hitchcock. The plot had insignia (ie white and red roses) and a plot of twists that wrapped themselves properly. The look was very Paris and drew you closer to the story. I saw it in London and I very much regretted that it was not in the countries video
