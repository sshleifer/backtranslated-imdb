A young girl becomes a war zone for the sea and when she visits the end of the war, waiting for someone to be more accessible, comics are created. Ultimately, of course, everything works well, but not until all the people involved have thoroughly chewed the landscape. Errol Flynn's dead impression of Humphrey Bogart on "Casablanca" has been highlighted, as well as the diverse transmissions of his own ridiculous image (the popping scene in Forrest Tucker's kitchen is a rebellion). But Tucker, who "tucks" the movie under his hand, lowers the head and barrel on the goal line. He demonstrates a comic that has been fully developed in "F-Troop" 20 years later and provides the liveliness and energy that Flynn plays repeatedly to increase his activity. Eleanor Parker does a good job as she strives for a woman, and the little Patti Brady charmed Tucker's real friend. Exquisite, easy-to-come comedy for kids and romanticists of all ages.
