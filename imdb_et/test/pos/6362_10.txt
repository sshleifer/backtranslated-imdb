I would say that I do not expect much sitting to look at "The Couch Trip" as an understatement. I had no idea what it was - I thought it was a journey to sexuality when I heard that Chevy Chase played a condom and the title of the movie included the word "sofa trip," then I thought he had something to do with the escape of the mental institute and the patient. My expectations fell even lower. <br /> <br /> I was literally waiting for a smiling movie - the type where you once smile and you feel a little cheated. In some ways, it is cheap comedy - it doesn't have the biggest gags, the plot is ridiculous, but you know what? I had a big smile on my face during my sight. Dan Aykroyd plays in a psychiatric hospital, John Burns, who may or may not be spiritual. He gives Lawrence Baird (David Clennon), a psychiatrist, a lot of grief and misery that makes us believe he is a whole person. <br /> <br /> After a somewhat rebellion in the spiritual institute, the cafe at Burns is waiting for Baird when the phone rings. Burns picks it up, pretends to be Baird, and finds that the second line is calling, Harvey Michaels (Richard Romanus), wants the actual Dr Baird to fill a radio shrink called George Maitlin (Charles Grodin) with his wife Vera (Mary Gross). Michaels wants Baird to be so bad that she has even booked a ticket for her on the plane. <br /> <br /> Burns escapes from the institute with the help of the receiver and goes to O'Hare. He gets a ticket from Dr Baird, goes on the plane and finally takes the air like Dr Baird. His exhibition is a phenomenal success. "People love her!" one man says and another man says, "It's because he really cares for them." <br /> <br /> Donald Becker (late, great Walter Matthau) is a mental patient who recognizes Burns' clothes as maternity pants and shirts. To keep her quiet, Burns promises Becker a percentage of her income. The secret is closed. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Maitlin and her husband have arguments. He drives home to finish his holiday short and understands that his chat man is not really Dr. Bair, but no one believes in him. He gets a real Dr Baird, but unfortunately he has lost his ID so the police would take these nutcases and not listen to their story. <br /> <br /> Allow me to name just a few holes in the plot I watching this movie noticed: Burns is Dr Baird, but he is never asked for his ID, even if he is requesting his flight ticket (he was kidnapped, he says, but they would still be convinced that he is Baird). When Burns becomes so famous, how did Chicago's actual Dr. Baird never hear people talking about him? The word is driving. And finally, why should the police arrest Maitlin and Baird (real Baird, that is) without following their stories? <br /> <br /> Frankly, I can't care less. I went to the movie with a closed mind and it surprised me - I really liked it. It amused me. His ideas are basically ridiculous and not at all realistic, but Dan Aykroyd is truly a lucrative result as a half-loon, which makes The Couch Trip a trip worth taking. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 5 stars - <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
