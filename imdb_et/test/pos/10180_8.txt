Looking at the Superman shorts with animation of the 1940s, the plot's similarity can become a bit boring - the opponent is the most crazy scientist hidden in the headquarters, threatening Metropolis with some of the evil inventions - the Magnet telescope of deaths, mechanical monsters, the electric earthquake you have. <br /> <br /> It's refreshingly different. The bad ones drive in the car, shoot and bombard, but the focal point is the gold bullion (to which Lois Lane travels as the only journalist). Train films have their typical components, since the big train ramp of 1903, and quite a few of them are shown here: uncoupling moving cars, moving on roofs, withdrawing steam locomotives, fighting with engineers, turning the train on the track on the side of the train, dropping people (across the train) from the bridge. .. it's all within this few minutes. It is not a Superman movie if it did not make an incredible soul (including balancing and high precision layout) to eventually win. If you're a train movie fan, don't miss it. It is publicly available and can be legally downloaded from archive.org.
