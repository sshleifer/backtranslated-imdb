Zinc actor without penny. Who is better than Michael Caine to play this character? He's completely fun and fun, but like most of Caine's performances, he's making it real. The film seems to be Dylan Moran's show and she's brilliant with her double-act Caine. But this is where the script falters. Morani impersonations should have been connected in an organic way rather. They are too many acts on their own and make the plot out of the window of credibility. Do not mind. Get it when you find it. There's enough to make it a pleasant trip.
