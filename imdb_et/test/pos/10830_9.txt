In Paris, a few months before the Nazi invasion, the manipulating actor Viviane Denvers (Isabelle Adjani) uses her former sweetheart Frédéric Auger (Grégori Deràngere) to conceal her dead man's body. Frédéric strikes the car, the dead man is found and sent to prison. When the Germans invade France, Frédéric escapes with another prisoner, Raoul (Yvan Attal), and they become friends. When they arrive in Bordeaux, they meet on the train Camille (Virginie Ledoyen), a young assistant to the physicist Professor Kopolski (Jean-Marc Stehlé), who is trying to study his heavy water from France. In Bordeaux, Viviane met with his new lover, Minister of State Jean-Étienne Beaufort (Gérard Depardieu), and is led by German spy, journalist Alex Winckler (Peter Coyote), while Paris is falling and the population is confused. <br /> <br /> What a wonderful and wonderful romantic adventure "Bon Voyage" is! An excellent and challenging scenario is running, romance, war, comedy, espionage, drama, and the stars of many characters played by fantastic casting; the direction is stunning; The music score is great. I really loved this wonderful movie, and I have to finish my review because describing my language lines limits these qualities. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Viagem do Coração" ("Heart of the Heart")
