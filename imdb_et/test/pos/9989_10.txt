I thought this movie was incredible. I loved it completely, though my brothers didn't do so much. Special effects were outstanding and this movie is about my favorite sport; golf. The only thing that was disappointing about this amazing movie is that twice or more is hard to see. This movie absolutely draws everything I have ever seen. That was all I expected from the movie. I just loved it. It was also pretty boy-friendly. This movie helped me realize that if you put your thoughts on it, everything is possible. I would give it to the clean 10/10! It was better than the Baggar Vanage legend and two Caribbean pirates. Totally wonderful. I loved it.
