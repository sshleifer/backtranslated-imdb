I was happy that I saw this sequel before the original, because I am not sure I would have gone out of my way to see if the opposite was true. I found that Cléopâtre's mission is better than its predecessor for a variety of reasons, but the main thing is: it was almost literally the adaptation of one book, not amalgam as the first film. The physical similarity of some characters to their animated self was very funny, especially a bad guy (who is my name but he is another architect). I don't know how this movie was played in English; my first language is french, so I had no problem ... I think some jokes were not so easily translated. I've learned something over the years that it's better to watch a movie with subtitles than dubbing, maybe you don't understand what is being said, but you lose the rhythm and I think it's important. I recommend this movie to anyone who really loves "Astérix et Obélix".
