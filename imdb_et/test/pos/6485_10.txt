"... winning is too strong ... we are deaf mutants, now - like them", Rex Voorhas Ormine <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that this movie has started evenly. Let me be the first to actually talk about "The Beat" virtues and why you need to see this movie now. <br /> <br /> Don't make a mistake, this movie is a cheesy and "bad" in the usual sense: the story is unpleasant, the poem is stupid and the actor is inconsistent. <br /> <br /> But these are CHARMS - all of these ingredients form one of the most regrettable films of the 80s. <br /> <br /> If the reference to "deaf" didn't turn your interests, then maybe this is: What is "Rex Voorhas Ormine"? This is an unusual name (for the North American audience) I said: "even the characters of this frigg movie are foolish." <br /> <br /> Well, "The Beat" is so shockingly happy that Bart Waxman (the "wrong driver instructor you love to hate") "meaning" and "symbolism" behind "Rex Voorhas Ormase" appears not too finely. I'm not breaking the revelation behind Rex's name, but please don't be too excited, OK? <br /> <br /> In general, it is controversial (John Savage, who plays "worried teacher" Mr. Ellsworth is pretty good, as is Bart Waxman's player, but the rest is not convincing). This means that the actor does not harm the film. Why? In all of the actors' performances, SINCERITY is what makes their players enjoyable. So, while performances can suck, you still get the impression that the actors are really trying their best. As a result, the sincerity of the actors succeeds where their actions fail (which is quite common). <br /> <br /> Respect for the "poetry" of this movie is bad, bad, bad. But that's a good, good and good thing when it comes to entertainment. Do you really enjoy "better quality" or "respectful" poetry - especially in such a movie? People who would be CANCELLATIONS (think what horror they were reading in high school) -anitized to avoid "youth corruption", politically conservative and lack of critical analysis, etc.) Even if you don't like poetry or " artistic "movies (all" intellectual "posts that refer to), most certainly (and should) appreciate LUDICROUS POETRY WANNABE ART FILM !!!! How can you not follow the following: <br /> <br /> "Do you remember dinosaur rumbling? The woman's scottish floors on the floor bad scotty bad, oh woman's so sad she's washing her hands and then waiting for the door today, yes - today! "<br /> <br /> Yes, this is an example of some remarkable poems that were freely scattered throughout" The Beat ". But the story you ask? <br /> <br /> The story is unpleasant. But then again, this is the beauty of this movie. In addition to some clich√©s, stereotypes, and predictable plot points, the plot / story has enough truly unique elements to keep things interesting. Who is Rex? Where did he come from? What the hell is he talking about? Deaf mutants? Illegal Angels? Does Billy and Kate Really Understand What Rex Says? Should the audience understand Rex and his poetry? (I've seen the film many times and I've still not thought about it all.) <br /> <br /> Does bad poetry and high school talent really show END GANG VIOLENCE? <br /> <br /> I guarantee that you have never seen anything like "The Beat" - the perfect combination of superbly bad poetry, mediocre and sincere action, and "mythoetics conquer gang violence", which is NEXT TOWARDS > <br /> Bonus for classic NYC hardcore fans: Cro-Mags makes a rare movie like "Iron Skulls" and it's tough to see them in several songs to play. I want them to include more concerts, but maybe it's the "extra" included in the "Collector's Edition" on the DVD, which I fantasize. <br /> <br />
