This movie is great! Angel is Beautiful and Scamp is Divine! His little ones hit when his scared and funny parts are when: Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp sing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'. recommend this movie that will be released on June 20 for a special edition. The lid has a trash can and an Angel cover under the lid. <br /> <br /> I just don't talk about this movie more than romantic, charming, fun and divine. Junkyard scenes are funny, all junkyard dogs have something special. I was too funny smiling, kids love it. Buy it out when it comes out, it has new features!
