Dolemite is a blexploitation film about Dolemite and his army of kung fu killer women, led by Queen Bee. He struggles to get his club The Total Experience back from Willie Green using his kung fu abilities and dedication to him. I liked this movie because it was a witty dialogue and also Rudy Ray Moore's ability to preach to his brothers in rhymes.
