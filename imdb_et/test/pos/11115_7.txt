I was expecting FAME to be an uplifting film, but it was the opposite. A common plot that follows the lives of several specific students who participate in the performing arts school has a strong potential. But FAME builds her characters beautifully and leaves us with as many questions as the end. I was very surprised when the graduation scene appeared - we thought the DVD was missing or something. All characters have internal and external conflicts, and almost none of them solve at the end of the movie! You may think that there are too many characters, but probably too many scenes. Its obvious that the film was cut and shortened because it sometimes lacks transition. I think Laura Dean like Lisa Monroe is my favorite character. I am really concerned with the ambitions of his character and his heart. Boyd Gaines as Michael, a stereotypical poor student who cannot read but has a divine dancer, is also very good. I did not like the character of Irene Cara Coco in particular, but it is not Cara's fault because her script is weak and her character is not specified. Her voice is beautiful and listening to her songs requires watching the whole movie. In conclusion, the film can use many fixes, but high-quality actors and great music will make their place in film history.
