I watched this movie with my family during a long Thanksgiving holiday week. I'm grateful that someone demanded that we look at it, though I didn't pay much attention until the end of the movie, if head-on seems to be tolerated, but unfortunately it doesn't happen. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I watched this movie a few years later and loved my liveliness, absurdity, brilliance and just fun. I think the film has a female tone. They are not used, although I am sure someone can think that the film is a pure exploitation. I think the movie plays with the slings of that time. <br /> <br /> I think someone should do it. And specify some of the consequences for the original.
