When the hell is Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag)? Heaven? Hell? Parallel Universe? When a tedious man gets off the subway and meets the train, his next conscious moment takes place on the bus; riding a solo, the latest arrival in the dead network, where all suicides go. Being dressed as a physical biosphere leaving, Andreas welcomes an official man who processes and transports a man from poor plains to the city when the eyeballs are working, a dead ring. such a urban landscape he once lived when the memory serves him properly. Andreas preserves the look of a dream in a trance, a man who is alienated from people and objects, and who tries to find his camps; at home or, rather, in the apartment he has appointed; or at work where an uncomfortable man is randomly appointed as an independent contractor accountant. Havard (Johannes Joner), his boss, tells him that "you get used to it," which involves more than just numbers, we suspect that the world is the same as the old world. <br /> <br /> When life is meaningless, as French Existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Satre said, the same can be said about death. The sub-culture of office life can be in one person's sky, but it seems to us that "Den Brysomme Mannen" is a hell in the context of its operation. Working on the secondary market is essentially a job for the rest of your life. The social relationship between Andreas's office partners can be normal in the physical world, but death is a variable that creates alienation for the viewer because he now recognizes the work of the white collar that the white workforce is doing. Kill the lessons with these unreasonable small speeches and assigned jobs they perform during the day like automotons, every day seem irrational in their self-evident absurdity. In a speculative light of recurring everyday life, "Den Brysomme mannen" makes normal human interaction with a similar comedy, because the life of quotes becomes a performance that makes Karl Marx's "alienation" because here men and women in the office "identify" with their workforce, like actors who play fancy selves are real. But a terrible person never fully participates in the facade. He is always aware of the cracks. <br /> <br /> The wooden pitcher Andreas knows the jumper's consequences, falling into the iron fence, while people are walking on their lunch break, indifferent to his fleeing intestines. that create red splatters on a clean pavement. Andrew is confronted with the same uncertainty about his associates after he deliberately cut his finger in the hope that he knows the pain on a paper cutter. He's not. This is another feeling, in addition to being a delicious and scent that is lost to a lost person. This inability to take care of simple joy amplifies the need for powerful human love, where simple pleasures compensate for its loneliness in the physical world. The dinner party organized by his boss will meet Andreas Anne Britt (Petonella Barker). They hit it. She walks in her home. She calls her in. They'll be a couple. He's moving in. If they have sex, it will not be useful to Andreas or Anne, who seems to have more pleasure in interior design. Love is an abstract concept, another feeling that cannot be attained in this world, but love is a worrying person, so he tries again with Ingeborg (Birgette Lagen) who is a girl. "Den Brysomme mannen" deconstructs love by presenting its foundation as a series of gestures that require both male and female performances. If Ingeborg does not give Andreas the same delicate feelings after his hyper-romantic gesture that he is leaving Anne Britt for him, then this Norwegian film will reveal its secrets about a prosperous but odd city with an open solution that can be solved. several interpretations. <br /> <br /> With Ingeborg's apathy wounded against her love, a troubled man rides to the same subway station, standing on the same platform, the same pair of letters are aggressively out and jumping. This time he can't die. How can you die if you are already dead? After the train repeatedly struck by train, Andreas's face becomes ground beef; his body contrasts with the angles that were only seen in art before. When a cumbersome man realizes that love and death are not his understanding, he is looking for a man from the club who was willing to say what he does not say in the dead city of this city. What is: death, not life, does not mean any meaning. <br /> <br /> Moving north of the mystery to Andreas's location leads the narration and filmmaker's credit that this mystery is treated satisfactorily, in a scene that reminds Spike Jonze of "Being John Malkovich" when Andrew moves through the tunnel to go over another world, such as a newborn baby, who resembles the Malkovich brain portal that Craig Schwartz puts on people. Andreas's attempt to overcome the big gap is a fascinating paradox. Since heaven and earth are literally separated by a wall, this vulnerable border acts as an atheistic belief that "heaven is a place on earth". But at the same time the reality of hell proves from heaven; the place where Andrew is sent after the city of his destination has been expelled.
