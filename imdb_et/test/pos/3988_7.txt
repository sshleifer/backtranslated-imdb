I totally agree with the person who first commented on this movie. To me, this story is about a growth hormone man who is trying his best to look for the love he wants. Trying his best to fit into a society that didn't know him. <br /> <br /> Then he met someone who treats him with the best friend's love and showed him how to accept the love he always wanted. The man who created all this happiness got a huge amount of something important, which is family and spouse's love. <br /> <br /> and comedy, it's just a part of what makes the audience show some laughing problems. <br /> <br /> And I have to admit it's a little tear.
