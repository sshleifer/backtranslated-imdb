My mom is like the wind that can be. She has collectibles, Rhett and Scarlett Madame Alexander dolls, GWTW Christmas decorations, even a GWTW cookbook. My sister and I had only seen pieces and pieces of GWTW, but we know the whole plot from the heart. I was overwhelmed by my sister buying a miniature who thought my mother wanted it, and we had a bit of a novelty for that. <br /> <br /> Yesterday we decided to look at both winds and Scarlett. We started at GWTW in the afternoon at around 2:30 pm and finished at 6:30 am. We immediately started Scarlett. My mother usually goes to sleep about 10:00, she finished up to 1:30 with us to finish it! We were cursed! I like how the movie begins at the Melanie funeral, just where Scarlett continued, saying, "I mean it tomorrow." Scarlett will not stay in Georgia for a long time, he will run to Charleston to get him back. Rhett is not happy when he finds that Scarlett is at his home so he leaves the family plantation. Scarlett, being Scarlett, follows him, and finally, they agree to keep their quarrels for a while to leave the rumors. Rhett begins to enjoy his company again and takes him to the boat. There will be a storm and they will sink. It helps to swim to the shores of some islands. Frightened that he's dead, Rhett is worried until he wakes up. When he does, they can both sweep and love. The next day, Scarlett wakes up in Charleston, but Rhett has gone and writes that he thinks it's best if they don't see each other again. in this case, seeing Anne Hampton with Ashley alone sees her alone in the hotel room. Nothing happens, but his reputation is painted so that Scarlett goes to Savannah with his two spinster aunts. He will soon discover that he is pregnant and decides to wait for the right time to tell Rhett. While in Savannah, he meets many of his O'Hara relatives and grows like a cousin, especially Father Colum. Soon he will receive a divorce notice from Rhett and will decide that he will never tell him about his child to be accused of him. Typical Scarlett. <br /> <br /> He decides to go to Ireland to make sure that Rhett can never detect his condition. He meets many relatives and buys a beautiful ancestral home in Ballyhara. This time Rhett is through Anne. It's Halloween, when Scarlett gets the message that Rhett is getting married again, he's going to work that night. <br /> <br /> A year later, Scarlett is very pleased with her beautiful daughter Kat. Lord Richard Fenton, who is really an evil man, is striving towards him, forcing him to fall asleep with a young girl, Mary Boyle. Scarlett will meet Rhett and Anne again at the horse fair. After the accident, Scarlett talks to Anne and learns that she and Rhett have a child. Scarlett leaves again and goes to Dublin's Fenton. There he builds relationships with him, as I said he is doing stupid things when he is a heartbeat. <br /> <br /> Mary Boyle has discovered she is pregnant and goes to Colum for help. The priest calls Fenton to help the girl and Fenton murders her after Colum threatens to tell Scarlett. Fenton convinces Scarlett to go to London with him to escape the death of Colum. Mary asks her to go. In Charleston, Anne is dead under a yellow fever. It is clear that he never carried a baby to Rhett. <br /> <br /> In London, Scarlett sees Fenton's true colors after he hurts him if he doesn't sleep with him. Fenton rapes her after she tells her she doesn't want to see her again. He falls into consciousness, and when he wakes up, Fenton is dead. Scarlett is accused of murder. <br /> <br /> Rhett hears this and rushes to England with Sally. Scarlett has no choice but to tell Rhett about his daughter. Rhett is furious for him to keep such a secret, but to help him. Mary Boyle, a real killer, can't find it. Scarlett is guilty, but Mary finally arrives to proclaim innocence. After a promise to help Mary, Scarlett leaves with Rhett with Ireland, as she says, "It's time I came to know you." The scene in which she first sees Katit is absolutely beautiful. In Ireland, Rhett sees how much Scarlett has changed and two have finally agreed and admit that they love each other deeply. <br /> <br /> After seeing GWTW, I say yes, Vivian Leigh was better at Scarlett, but I liked the character of Scarlett in this film as the first one. The reason is that in GWTW you don't know why you like Scarlett. He's so cruel and arrogant to Rhett, but you like his lively spirit. In Scarlett you can see how much he has changed. Oh, he's still in the luxury circle, but he's no longer cumbersome. You will see how she becomes a real mother of Kat and a generous person for the poor in Ireland. Joanne Whalley does and is a great job of playing Scarlett's new side. Timothy Dalton is not Clark Gable, but sometimes I swear you will see his original Rhett. <br /> <br /> If you just sit back and don't compare Joanne Whalley and Timothy Dalton to Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable, you will definitely enjoy this movie. This is an opportunity to compare Scarlett yesterday, which he will "tomorrow".
