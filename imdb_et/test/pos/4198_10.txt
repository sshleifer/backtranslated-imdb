This is one of those movies where it's easy to see how some people don't like it. My wife has never seen it, and when I just looked at it last night, I waited until she went to sleep. He could have been a few small fragments of fun, but I know he would have had enough in ten minutes. <br /> <br /> The head is a normal story. The film is firmly in the psychedelic era. It can be briefly seen as a film-like surrealism or movie genre as a postmodern acid journey. If you are not a big fan of these things - psychedelics, surrealism, postmodernism, and "aesthetics of acid travel" (assuming there is a difference between them), you should probably stay away from this movie. On the other hand, if you are a fan of this thing, you have to run out and buy now if you haven't already. <br /> <br /> It is strange that the film has never received much respect. It probably has a lot of ideas. After all, this is the star of Monkees - Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork - and Monkees was a musical group of actors produced by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider together as a boy-friendly bubble for the haunting Beatles for TV series. In their era, they were as much respect as they say Menudo, New Children in the Block, Spice Girls and so on. Like the IMDb colleague who rightly pointed out, "Maybe people in 1968, Monkees, as a Beatles foolish factory-made pop band, refused (Head)". <br /> <br /> Monkees and Head have never been able to prevent this negative public perception. It is a shame, because The Monkees had a lot of talent both musically and otherwise. It is probably amazing that Rafelson, who runs here and compiles with Schneider, and Jack Nicholson (yes, _that_ Jack Nicholson) who wrote the script and jointly produces, decided to take Monkeys into this unusual direction. Just as the new kids suddenly blocked an album that matches Pink Floyd's Ummagum (1969) or Atom Heart Mother (1970). In fact, The Monkees and frequent co-authors, such as Good Songs written by Carole King and Harry Nilsson, have a Floyd-like quality somewhere between the Syd Barrett era and the post-Barrett era. This is much more important than the similarity of Beatles. Some people have complained about the music on the film, but I have all the songs in the gems. For this, some people don't like the Barrett's (or other) Floyd, which is just as difficult for me. <br /> <br /> But what does _is_ Head about? The principle is that Monkees travel through different movie genres - there are war scenes, adventure scenes, horror scenes, comedy scenes, drama scenes, western scenes, sci-fi scenes, romance scenes and more. With the exception of the reality of the film, it turns out that it happens mainly (if not only) in the studio. Let's see that Monkees is shooting a movie. Of course, in different genres, all scenes are something surreal and self-referencing, and they and the individual images on the scene tend to lead each other through a dream logic that is not similar to Monty Python's television shows. As a dream, the Head tends to lie between a good dream and a nightmare, often as a reason to make you laugh (something I often do). <br /> <br /> Technically, Rafelson uses many different techniques using the methods described above. There are scenes with large negative images, there are many very fast cuts (including a big sequence dancing alternately with Davy Jones and Tony Basil, with white and black space, wearing both white and black combinations so that from time to time swap forward and backward as fast as two shots at once), there are many odd blends, animated cow foot, odd editing devices, and so on. For my money, I want this thing not just a remnant of the psychedelic era. This is the artistic approach I love. Then it seemed a good idea and I think it is a good idea. I'd like to see movies like Life Aquatic Steve Zissou using (2004) this type of extended technique. Now that would make this movie surreal. <br /> <br /> Interpretingly, some people who are not in line with the aesthetic of a trip of acidity complained that it is basically b.s. provide meanings for something that is not meant to be. I disagree with such a pessimistic / nihilistic view; The head was meant to have a lot of meaning (s), and not just movies without conventional plots, which have multiple interpretations. Nicholson, Rafelson and Schneider have a lot of interesting things about Monkeys - a postmodern commentary on their status; pop-stardom - before Pink Floyd, Head directs popstardom and violence, from war images to fan images that can destroy their idols; and naive US-oriented ideas of international imagination and respect - well armed aliens who give the desert to Micky Dolenz just because he is an American, they later incite the coke machine (again in the desert) because he is thirsty and unable to gain access. The film comments on many other topics - from big industries to police, research, perspectives (especially in relation to tragedies) and on and on. Good ideas are full of enough intelligent and versatile things to talk about. <br /> <br /> The head deserves to be considered a classic - it's essentially the same look as the Beatles yellow submarine. Both were premiere in November 1968 and both were intended to combine psychedelic aesthetics. The yellow submarine was not quite successful. The head is all The yellow submarine should have been.
