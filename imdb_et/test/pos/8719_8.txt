Another "old-fashioned, but good" about the same time as "Out of Towners" is "Cactus Flower", with great pain: Goldie Hawn, in her first film (pre-facelifts), Ingrid Bergmann with her later. and always funny Walter Matthau. The story is related to a dentist who pretends to be married, to apologize for not having a girlfriend to marry, so it is necessary to prove a fictitious woman. He cajoles his spinster administrator (Bergman) into a role that leads to several comic disasters and surprising romantic turns. It's like Doris Day / Rock Hunter comedies. The fans of these films - like me - like this movie; if not, don't worry.
