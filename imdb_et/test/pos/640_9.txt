Billy Hughes is a quiet young lady who deals with cheap horror pictures filmed in Moscow by an American director. One night Billy locked in a movie studio. Later that evening, he hears someone can be in the building and go to it. This is when he stumbles across a woman who was murdered brutally during filming. After the clutches of the murderers escape, Billy informs the authorities that the men would show that it is red. Billy knows what he saw and soon his life will be confused with underground figures that believe he has something important. <br /> <br /> I don't know how this heartbreaking sleeping place was over, but I thought it was a much older flick. However, there is one thing that must be one of the toughest and most intense thrillers I've seen for some time. It's just a big break for the builder and most will click into place! On the first side of the function, there is a surprisingly gripping tense sequence that has your heart's throat and clouds with the unsuccessful alienation of the atmosphere. Underneath it is a humorous black curve. The error appears in the story because it loses the fierce grip it held so early, and the silly humor (or better insect comic relief) between Fay Ripley and Evan Richard's characters is a hit and a blow thing, being too vigorous. In the long run, it might have been done without it. Despite a few moments, this aspect did not prevent my pleasure. For me, the soft ending they decided to go was not as if they didn't feel right. <br /> <br /> An interesting mysterious premise was fear for the bone and packed some unpleasant items. Both the context and its excitement were so multifaceted, there was something fresh about how it all works, and the nervous shocks and intolerable tension are shifted to various sudden plot twists and turns. Indeed, they made great use of the novel idea of ​​this disability and made it difficult to place it in strange places where English was not spoken too much and so we are confused. Gentle Marina Zudina depicts the harrowing image of Billy, an American mute girl. How he can show irregular emotions through his eyes and actions gave him some bad and credibility. Director Anthony Waller lets you staple pretty stylish, well-timed and skilfully, without losing that rugged look that is steadily twisting from its rigid surroundings and vigorously airy music points. The only real name was Alec Guinness's small participant. The cast productions were all fine, especially the strokes of the nails of Oleg Yankovski and Igor Volkov as a Russian murderer. <br /> <br /> This riveting feature, which is mostly unknown, is better than your average dark thriller. Highly recommended.
