Midnight Madness is a film that is unfortunately very undervalued and unrecognized. With the flood of classic "nervous" teen / college movies, it was forgotten. As a child I would watch this movie over and over, luckily I had this video. This film shows a more regrettable but exciting part of the eighties. In the cynical society in which we live this day and age, drug abuse is the coolest thing, it's good to see, once for a while, a fun, innocent movie that's Midnight Madness ... that's when you find it.
