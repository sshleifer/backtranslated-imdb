In 1982, in the summer, John Carpenter's "The Thing" masterpiece appeared, criticizing the box and bombing the box. Viewers couldn't handle another "bad" alien, they wanted ET. Their loss in the long run. <br /> <br /> I'd kill you to see this big movie on the big screen. It's a movie that was ahead of time; now it has influenced the new generation of filmmakers, showing the trace of things like "Se7en", "Alien 3" and even "X Files" that pulled it out of the page. And the structure that reduces character development to incredible SFX is a common feature of today's zippers. atmosphere. Performances are fine and the end is terrible - still unique. <br /> <br /> A paranoid masterpiece.
