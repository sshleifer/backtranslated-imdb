"Coconut Fred's Fruit Salad Island!" is a fun show that is on Saturday morning at WB. He celebrates the island of Coconut Fred and all his friends, and every episode is their funny wrong. Mostly this is due to the problems of Coconut Fred, which makes it funny and at the same time other things happen on the island. Humor is great and no one on the island is very bright, adding that it is as much fun as it is. I don't think it would be funny. The talents of the characters are excellent and exaggerated, adding to the fun of the exhibition. If it's ever on a DVD, then I get this A.S.A.P! <br /> <br /> We strongly recommend laughing.
