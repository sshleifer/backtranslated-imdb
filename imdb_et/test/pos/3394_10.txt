Anyone who captures this movie was a genius, every character in it is perfect for them, and they do a great job in their parts. This is a good glimpse of what life was before and during the Civil War, the difference between wealthy, medium-sized and black people. The story will give you some insight into the real issues of the era and the difficulties of their daily lives. The story is convincing and drama keeps your attention throughout the film. There are signs you love, there are signs you hate, and you find yourself emotionally involved. <br /> <br /> Both my wife and I loved it and we look at it for a few more years, I'm sure.
