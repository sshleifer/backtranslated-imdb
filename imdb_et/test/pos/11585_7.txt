- Facts (I): "Mar Adentro" associates a well-known (at least in Spain) story with Ramón Sampedro, Galicia quadriplegic, who killed himself (with some friends) after 28 years of status. The judges denied several times their petitions on active euthanasia. <br /> <br /> - Facts (II): "Mar adentro" will become the Spanish film of the year. Everyone talks about it: politicians, singers, ordinary people ... Everyone likes it, even the opinions of critics are unanimous. The film wins many prizes (Golden Globe, Oscar, Goya ...) and irritates the Catholic community and life-lovers quadriplegics. A star is born. <br /> <br /> - Facts (III): The intensity and quality of "Mar Adentro" participants is simply amazing, and it makes me wonder how we must look at the young actors in most of Spain's latest movies. I don't know if Javier Bardem is a great actor or a great imitator (quite a big difference between one thing or another); anyway, his work is just impressive, as well as the work of Lola Dueñas, Belén Rueda or all the guest celebrations. This is (a choice of actors) a strong point in the Amenábar movie. <br /> <br /> - Facts (IV): Alejandro Amenábar learned his lesson in a cinema school, no doubt: he has a privileged brain. He controls all the technical aspects, knows what the viewers want, he knows how to touch the right chord, even if it makes him such a demagogue (like Spielberg is one of Amenábar idols)). <br /> <br /> - Facts (and V): When you criticize a movie like "Mar Adentro", you seem to have a moral question about the story. In such pictures there is a trap: you have to differentiate the film itself and the moral concepts. If you do not like "Schindler's List", this does not mean that you agree with Hitler's philosophy (or do you?). So it's a good movie and an extraordinary story (because it's a real story that makes it a lot more extraordinary). Grandiloquent, self-type and everything other than neutral (no matter what Amenábar or Bardem has said: those characters who do not come to euthanasia at all!). 50% hard / 50% too sentimental. <br /> <br /> -Pilot: "Mar Adentro" is by no means my best 50 year old Spanish movie. No one has a special favor in hope, but Ramon Sampedro himself. He's a movie. Now Alejandro Amenábar becomes an international Spanish director, maybe he's going to live in Hollywood; but some of us would like to look at him by filming a simple story without a little final twist, uninhabited dead or dying alive ... "Others" is still his best film. 7/10
