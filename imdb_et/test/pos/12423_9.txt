Great fear of comedy by Michael Davis. Eric Jungman is a good actor as a good man who saves the day and great performance of Jack Black-esquire, like Justin Urich's performance. He was just divine in this movie. This man deserves great stars. Aimee Brooks was also a girl in the movie and in danger, with killers resembling Jeepers Creepers. Gore was given in large quantities and I loved it. I hope they release a non-rated version. Great low budget horror comedy. The dead cat in the hotel sex scene is just funny funny! ***** Out of stock *****
