I'm addicted to TV shows, live shows and everything they do. And this was the last job they had done on television / film "The Gentleman". <br /> <br /> If you love this series, you will love the movie absolutely. This is a nice ending for your TV series. <br /> <br /> It's smart and funny. <br /> <br /> Although it does not focus on some of the most popular characters, it is good to see all the characters with the writers. Must look at any gentleman's fan. <br /> <br /> Look at it!
