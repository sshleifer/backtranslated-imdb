One word for that. Fun. I haven't been watching this movie for so long. At the point of the movie I forgot that it was a movie, I just felt like I was watching Viva La Bami or even looking to say my friend was going through something like that. It was realistic and I liked how Bam, Ryan, Raab, Rake and Brandon and the rest of the boys didn't try to do too hard. They just made me famous for their idiots. There were a couple of scenes that I more than others loved, like Raab in the shower, holy, I laughed so hard. He was honestly probably my favorite character after Bami. He really made my movie a bit more fun. This is basically a must see for CKY team fans:]
