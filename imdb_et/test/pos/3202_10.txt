This movie blew me away. I thought I knew a little about Rebellion Attica. After seeing it, I see that I didn't know anything. The story speaks through the relationship between a lawyer and a black prisoner. Both the personal story of the two men and the drama of the established courtroom were riveting. In the prison, the drawbacks were fantastic. It is hard to believe that this was not a documentary that was so real. It was not just a great drama, it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter in American history. I'm with Ebert and Roeper. I'll give her two thumbs.
