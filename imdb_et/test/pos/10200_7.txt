This West was created in 1861 and was linked to the creation of the first transcontinental wireless network created by Western Union. Although a nice boy Dean Jagger (many hairs) did his best to do this, he was a bad guy who just wanted to take it back with his own selfish reasons. So, it's up to Randolph Scott or Robert Young to save the day. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the best in the western 1940s I've seen, and it was almost 8 years old - it was so good. But for my life I have no idea why Fritz Lang was destined to lead this film - he didn't know anything about the West. His forte was a drama - and I think this film is a different kind of drama. Oddly enough, yes, but it seemed to work well, even though I don't know how this great German director felt the job was going to be. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the movie, it's extraordinary - a great location with vibrant colors and great action. As usual, Randolph Scott made another relaxed and realistic performance. However, I was surprised when Robert Young was also cast in the film, but it was a decisive decision - he had to be Harvard's educated east. When I saw Barton MacLanet in the movie, I thought he was "bad" and my thoughts were well founded because he made a career out of his career! As far as the script is concerned, it seemed mostly common, but the final showdown between Scott and Barton MacLane was much better than I had hoped - this movie ended up at a very high level.
