Anyone who appreciates a good functioning and ringtone dialogue loves this movie. <br /> <br /> In taking Ronald's "Exercises", it is funny <br /> <br /> and ultimately an analysis of the relationship between two "relatively" types. Albert Finney is sublime as despotic <br /> <br /> Shakespeare's actress who barely notices the robbery of the surrounding world war so he plans to crumble his theaters <br /> <br /> the company and his own psychological and emotional breakdown. <br /> <br /> Tom Courtenay is equivalent to Norman, the title of "Dresser," <br /> <br /> whose obvious commitment is to be anything but selfless. <br /> <br /> You really have to see.
