"The Man Who Knew Too Much" (1955) is the rewriting of Alfred Hitchcock's own 1934 thriller for a married couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) on a holiday in Morocco, where they received a nightmare involving murder, espionage, murder and worst of all Robbery of a 10-year-old son. The film that Hitchcock himself considered to be the original is a lot of fun. Stewart and the day are together with good chemistry. The film is full of wonderful comic scenes and dialogues and stopping scenes. <br /> <br /> Adding "Que Sera, Sera" turned out to be a hit on the gene, because the song rarely matches content and plays such an important role in a movie like "Que Sera, Sera". A man who knew too much. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock also treats us to Arthur Benjamin's "Storm Cloud Cantata" live music for almost ten minutes, while in London, Royal Albert Hall is where a very important politician was murdered and both, the scene and the cantata are just wonderful.
