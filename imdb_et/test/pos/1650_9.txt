The war did not go well with the Soviet Union, Stalin accepted volunteers from prisons and used prisoners as shock troops. This is the story of one such battalion. Police prisoners, soldiers kicked out of other units, White Army gray hair veterans plus some dangerous criminals. <br /> <br /> They will be thrown into battle with poorly equipped, untrained, and endangered NKVDs when they have cops or failures. <br /> <br /> Special effects are rudimentary and many smaller characters are one-dimensional, but the overall story is very human and riveting. <br /> <br /> I have not seen a subtitle or duplication version. Viewing the exhibition requires the liberal use of the pause button and the explanations of the Russian-speaking speaker.
