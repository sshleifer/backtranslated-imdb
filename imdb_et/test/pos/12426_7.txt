Adam (Eric Jungmann) and the reluctant best friend Harley (Justin Urich) drive to the wedding state. Along the way they pick up a sexy hacker Sarah (Aimee Brooks). Then, for no reason, the monster truck will try to drive them temporarily ... and maybe they will kill. Who does it and why? <br /> <br /> A pretty good horror movie. His energetic and full of darkening direction that takes you to the right. It's also a horror comedy. Most humor is infantile and really big, but actually somewhat funny. This movie sometimes also draws gore, but it's a good thing! Actress is OK - Jungmann is a bit of a joke about her role; Urich is left with the hopeless role of the best friend of the evil mouth and sexual obsession, but pulls it away; Brooks also has a limited role. <br /> <br /> IF I saw the "twist" end long before it happened, and the logic disappears (especially rescue). However, this is a fun, sometimes funny and sometimes frightening horror movie. I'll give her 7.
