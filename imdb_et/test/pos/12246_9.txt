Movie filmmakers often say that big films must have three memorable <br /> <br /> scenes that must be considered really big. Broadcast news doesn't have <br /> <br /> three, it's twice as big. This movie is extremely well written. James Brooks. Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks have never been better. I love this movie for several reasons. It's great because it makes you laugh and it makes you cry. Albert Brooks has several <br /> <br /> large lines and many unforgettable scenes: # 1 (laughs) "I can <br /> <br /> sing and read, sing when I read," with Midnight Train <br /> <br /> Georgia is playing in the background. # 2 (laughs) William Hurt's character, "You really blew the nookie cover," after you looked at Hurt's date-rape report. # 3 (Cried) When Aaron <br /> <br /> (A. Brooks) finally tells Jayne (Hunter) that he loves him and he can't finish the character of Hurt because he represents <br /> /> everything about journalism Jayne thinks it's inconvenient. Finally # 4 (laughs) who can forget about the event where Aaron <br /> <br /> confirms the weekend news .... fun. This movie could have won Oscar! It has everything I love in <br /> <br /> movies, great acting, intelligent script and even Jack Nicholson.
