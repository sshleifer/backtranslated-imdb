If you're familiar with Johnny To's work and his filmmaker band Milky Way, then you know what to expect from this last production. All the familiar elements are fixed: the reluctance between the two characters: usually the police officer and the baddie, the coincidences and opportunities that turn the dime and endlessly end up, and the humor that arises even the toughest Andy Lau plays a man who has 72 hours to live and decide rob an insurance company. Lau Ching-Wan (which is also great in other Milky Way films, such as "Longest Nite", "Hero ever dies" and "Where a good man goes") depicts a hostage negotiator / policeman who is at the robber's tail, even if the robber creates a lot of tricks and the tips he must follow to get his man. <br /> <br /> Funny, messy, cool, exquisite, "running" is actually one of the most fun Milky Way movies. Don't miss the two wire items esp. Andy Lau usually held an average actor who has rarely seen it as natural and fun to watch. This movie is one to go.
