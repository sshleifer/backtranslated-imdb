Has anyone ever read or heard about Scorses or David Chase (Soprano producer) comments on "Death Collector / Family Enforcer"? I bought a DVD after I haven't seen it for a while (like 20 years), but have seen "Goodfellas" and "Sopranos" run. Looking back, both men must have seen the Death Collector / Family Enforcer and swallowed the taste, perhaps inspiring the tone of their masterpieces, both of which are the polar opposite of the romantic godfather trilogy. Being a Jersey guy, it is interesting to see how jerks from Jersey have evolved since the mid-1970s. It is never a swampy land, though sometimes the body gets in the local waterway. It is also a small bittersweet to see the World Trade Center recently built by the river in the opening and closing fields. Who could have imagined?
