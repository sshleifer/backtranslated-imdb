This movie was quite enjoyable to watch, I mean, it wasn't great, but it was one of the later movie films. It seems to have been a low, almost budgeted size for a state budget, but it has its own charms, like beautiful women in it. The atmosphere was also good (this is what these days have a lot of hell films). Acting was your typical 80-year low budget issue when you didn't know it was "dud." But that is what Lucio Fulci's films were full of, they liked the movie that had the atmosphere they lacked in narration and money, and so on. <br /> This is just a typical low budget horror movie that can be watched, I watched it all the time and I love horror movies. I've seen movies where I just turn off for 10 to 20 minutes or sit and fast forward when it's on video, or skip the DVD between the scene. This movie didn't want me to do it, I sat down and watched it until the end without letting go of parts. <br /> <br /> I would have liked it to be a little more scary than a zombie-like nation if they were about as frightening as Freddy Kreuger as his babysitter. But seriously, if they were a little better, it might have been the perfection of a small budget. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie was top-notch stuff, perfect for horror music, so it was. I've seen horror movies where the music is good or average, but it could have been better, thank goodness, though this movie didn't have such metal music. <br /> <br /> I've been a metal fan since 1990, but in horror movies, it breaks the music, the film loses much of the atmosphere when it plays any other music score. So I'm glad that there was no music in this movie except for your usual score, which was pretty crappy, well done. <br /> <br /> It could have been used by Profane Grace - Epitaph Shattered Dreams. Because it is keyboard music, the guitars are nothing more than "really" horrible keyboard tracks. Like one "Forever Sleep", you hear that the wind is blowing through it and some goose bumps that cause the keyboard music that follows. This CD never has the same story, it's the best horror music best, it would have been perfect for this movie. <br /> <br /> The only movie chick I was interested in was the one who was killed / killed (or so we believe) and hung in the scarecrow to get free and try to escape later. Every other woman in the movie was really cute, big 9 out of ten, except what I mentioned above. <br /> <br /> I want Hollywood (mainstream stuff) to give money to Romero and the man who made this movie. As giving them movies, it is better to make a decision than to give him "living evil" minced meat called Paul Anderson. <br /> <br /> Well done guys, it's not bad, not bad at all, I loved the part at the end of the credit when they show you the clips of their movie (behind the scene). Not many movies do this type, which I probably added to the movie, as it showed You have some trips and it's always a good thing when you ask me. <br /> <br /> Rating for this movie 8/10, rating for nice ladies in movie 9/10, rating for the movie 9/10, rating 9.5 / 10.
