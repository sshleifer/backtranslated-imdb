Okay, it was just great. I want the rest of the 1st season to have been so strong. It really needed more such episodes. <br /> <br /> The cast worked great though they were all days ago. Writing was fantastic and so editing. Great work in all accounts. <br /> <br /> The episode was exciting, pausing and just keeping you away until the end. What are most of the MOTW episodes, but still failed. <br /> <br /> The first five stellar episodes for me. Really good, almost like a movie. I didn't even remember it was good. I think it's even better than a big horror movie called "The Thing".
