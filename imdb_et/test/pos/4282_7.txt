I just gave her seven just because it's good. And of course I mean Wilkinson. The other two directors were "decent". But the characters themselves ... what on earth was so bad as Wilkinson played (James Manning)? I didn't see him act like Martine Emily Watson accused her of being. Bill Bule, on the other hand, was an insecure jerk I prayed to meet with extremely brutal and protracted death. Who am I kidding? Tom Wilkinson is not Paul Bettany. So what did EARTH make Emily Watson (Anne) sign SEE on her theme ???? He himself admitted that in his treatment he had a lot of offspring. Why would he even want to be on the same journey as him to say something in the "room". <br /> <br /> I noticed some other comments, one person said he "shouted" at the end of a James tragedy. ??? WHAT IS A TRAGIA? What, do you mean losing imbecile, who finds someone like Bill Bule AMUSING ??? !!! Give us a break.
