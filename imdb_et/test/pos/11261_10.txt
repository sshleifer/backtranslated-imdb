This movie is about three teenagers who have been the best friends of the longest time and live the most confusing life. When the heroine becomes a city of choice for their city, these three teenagers find themselves in everything. This film represents the heroine's dependence very well, and that's something you can't see. MTV has never done the best for TV movies, but it has to be good to not watch it. I enjoyed this movie, at first I thought it would be the worst film I saw, but when it went on, it got better and I couldn't turn.
