This film was beautiful and touching. It touched me deep inside and I'm not sure why. I am a happy married woman and I have never had lesbian tendencies, but my film changed this almost what I wanted. Choreography, story, dialogue ... the film was a work of art. The synopsis without spoilers is that a woman gymnast does not satisfy her life and was looking for ... something, nothing. He's with a man who doesn't want a baby, but he does it. She doesn't mean her, but she doesn't treat her so she should be treated either ... I don't think she knows her. All these years have remained in shape and decided to go back to the gym. She encounters another woman and an intimate and beautiful relationship during her acrobatic training. Throughout the film he has another woman friend whom he trained in his younger years, and they have remained close friends. <br /> <br /> The relationship that is developing is .. I don't know quite a word, but very understanding, comfortable, intimate, but sexy ... something that could only be between two women. A relationship that would really mean meaning in your life. Someone who makes you feel special, exciting, beautiful, even confused. <br /> <br /> Relationships with your close friend are as beautiful as other ways. They have close and intimate relationships. Her friend showed me a real friend. Someone who is understanding, easy, REAL, have fun, someone who is for you, no matter what. Someone who is supportive, and you can talk about your deep secrets. Someone who shares your past but doesn't share your secrets. <br /> <br /> The story is simple because it was not superfluous but in no way underestimated. It leaves many moments to capture. Dancing and choreography were stunning. I can watch it over and over again. Thus, the artist's main character was feelings and emotions. Dancing and images were very dazzling and watching. What a cozy wonderful story! I loved this movie. If you have the opportunity, rent it and check it out!
