Eighth, and so of the other lasts of Animatrix, this is the only one. It takes two types of Matrix filmed entertainment inspiration and combines them incredibly well. This is extremely loyal to the trilogy in this sense. Animation is a proud, breathtaking animation. It's a comprehensive style of Noir. The plot is suitable and the story, as well as the music, is on the ground. In general, the sound is fantastic and really helps to strengthen the mood and atmosphere with drawings and designs. Voting is impeccable. This is one of two, where people in their films repeat their roles and both have Anne-Moss who is the only one. This is one of the best nine and one of my personal favorites. It's about ten minutes long. Stimulation is perfect. It won't slow down a lot, but it's not overwhelming either. The end was not more suitable for this. It shares nine and a half minutes of Kid's Story and is well done and informative. I warmly recommend it to every fan of the universe and to the two genres that it consists of. 8/10
