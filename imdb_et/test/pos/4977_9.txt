This is a classic western. Good, Glenn Ford, a scary hero, a former soldier, a man who didn't hold the gun again. Finally, he must erect a parade of evil land, Edward G. Robinson, who owns most of the valley and wants it all. Then, there is Barbara Stanwyck, the true ruler. Edward G. Robinson's wife, who doesn't let anyone get their way, even if Edward G. Robinson looks weak. He is so bad that all the others in the palace have blind ambitions and mercy in the valley and everything in it. Blurry in his eyes when he sees people facing death, he's nervous. Worth waiting. Young young Brian Keith and some others and you have your own drama. Needed stamps, shots, shelters, and close relatives and you have a western devil. If nothing is given, there are enough twists to make it not just a normal cowboy shoot-em.
