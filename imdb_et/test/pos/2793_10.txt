I love this movie (I don't know why it's called Pot Luck in England - what a garbage and a completely irrelevant name!), I spent in Barcelona for 8 months, not as an Erasmus student, but lived with other foreigners, so it seemed just the same. It brings back so many great memories of the fun I had with all my friends from different countries and the city. I really want to see the follow-up "Les Poupees Russes" (Russian dolls), I think it will be released here? My brother saw it in France and said it was not that good, but it was just as much (Wendy's brother is probably getting married). Anyone know anything about this movie? and can it be released?
