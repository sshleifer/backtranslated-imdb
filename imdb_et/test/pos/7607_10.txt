I love this movie. it focuses on both questions: reality and fantasy. reality because hey, we all wanted the date of this popular man Billy. and some of us haven't done it yet, right? be honest! <br /> <br /> Another real problem is due to the pain that people teased. and who, high school life. remember this? fantasy is finding your true love when you are 25 years old and still in high school. not quite fantasy but close enough! <br /> <br /> Although some parts are incredible, it was a great movie. there are no other words to describe such incredible work. and the story was wonderful. Drew Barrymore did an amazingly great job, like a fun David Arquette. The people who worked in the film are all wonderful. I never repeated it? <br /> <br /> Never been one of the movies that later generations should watch. it shows reality and some questions like you and me.
