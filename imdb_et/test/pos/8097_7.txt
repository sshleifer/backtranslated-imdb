It must be one of Chaplin's most ambitious projects; he throws practically everything from visual gags and blackout comedy, social significance, romance, even violence. The mix is ​​complex and intriguing, and the film has many entertaining and clever sequences (like Chaplin and four other boys trying to avoid finding a coin that orders their self-sacrifice), but the ingredients don't always click together and the blend (and tone) seems unreasonable. How famous the final speech, though unquestionably honest, today also seems a bit naive, because his hints "to a better world where a person crosses his hatred and cruelty, and his soul begins to fly". Jack Oakie and excellent Paulette Goddard excellent presentations. (***)
