This movie is a warning to all the people who sat on the Internet during the normal day at the office. My warning is, don't expose yourself too much, 2 Be careful who you baptize! , there are spies on the Internet. I thought it was so scary what this man and woman combination worked with poor Angela Bennett, I didn't know anyone could take one mouse click away. Angela I thought it was Jack Delvin and this terrible girl is my question, why does this computer work when it works? like a clicking sound mine doesn't do it or that. This movie also tells you that there are scams on this internet. Why couldn't Angela make a virus destroyer at CyberCafe? I also thought that like all computers, the speed of the disk was slow, which is correctly portrayed in this movie when you save the program to your floppy disk, where the bar only moves slowly !!! I also liked Angela's house at the beginning of the movie. Why didn't anyone believe Angela?
