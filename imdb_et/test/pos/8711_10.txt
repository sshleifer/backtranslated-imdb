Words fail me when I want to describe my feelings about this movie (and sequel) ... Does he have any mistakes? Of course it starts ... Starting with "subspecies" that were not effective enough for a special effect. So why do I glorify these movies? For movie mass-consumers out there who care more about quantity than quality, about cheap fun more than depth, crap like "blade" (it's not even worthy of a capital letter), "underworld", "dracula 2000", "dracula 3000" and so further, there are good movies for popcorn munching and drinking a few coke ... What makes subspecies a greater effort for anyone claiming to be a vampire fanatic, but it is obvious: Vampire himself is Romanian, the story is placed in Transylvania (scenes from the scene are more than convincing) and the atmosphere is not based on any "action package" or expensive orchestral music. Radu is the source of the atmosphere itself This is what a vampire should look like and how it should behave! Add a breathtakingly gloomy castle with dark passageways in Romania to include some of the typical vampire elements (like the shading movement on the walls when vampires fly) and you have a work of art! In short, if I, like myself, are fascinated by the Vampires and feel that their appearance and setting should be blind and blind, there is no better place to look at the subspecies ... Or in Vampire magazines, a former bright spin off ...
