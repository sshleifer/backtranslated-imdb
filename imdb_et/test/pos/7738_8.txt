I love this movie, even though it's just great. This is an adult entertainment that is filled with questions that a growing person can associate with. Action is great. It's fun to watch John Cassavets and Gena Rowlands as a medieval couple. Who knows how much this came from his marriage? Susan Sarandon has never been sexier or more attractive than her casual character, Aretha. Raul Julia is a terrifying guy. In Greece, landscapes are outstanding; The settings in New York make me hit by many shots in the world shopping center. A fantastic score by Stomu Yamashta. So many things, why isn't this a great movie? It's a bit terrible and too long, purposeful and uncomfortable between humor and drama. However, it is interesting, fun and deeply thought-out.
