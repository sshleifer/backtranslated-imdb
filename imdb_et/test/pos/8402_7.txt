I'm a big wind winder and I read "Scarlett" before it was a miniature, and I loved it. This is the result. As you did not expect, "Honestly, I'm not giving up the damn". Timothy Dalton was great as Rhett, though no one would replace Clark Gable. In contrast, Joann Whaley-Kilmer can give Vivien Leigh money for his money (although I feel almost guilty, even saying it.) His attitude and presence in the film is the nature of the road, changing your love and hatred at the same time as you feel most at Leighi depiction. The film moves slowly, mainly because it follows the book so closely and it was not published as a feature film. Excellent choice by the manufacturer. I think that this film deserves praise for the great story, the rebirth of almost 50 years of missing characters, and the fact that even Margaret Mitchell himself could have been proud.
