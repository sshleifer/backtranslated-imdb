Where do I start? I sat a little laugh and I was blown away! This movie is just perfect, it's indescribable. Jackass Number Two, frankly, were bigger, more inconvenient, more fun and fun than the first ones. That was just what I needed tonight. <br /> <br /> In this movie there are so many scenes that will make you say "Oh My! No Way!" or "Ouch!" All the events and scenes had been learned and built up in the past and made it even more perfect. I loved it every minute! I'm just saying that even a scene where it was necessary to censor a specific material to avoid the NC-17 rating! It was so much fun that they had to put it on! Amazingly good. <br /> <br /> 9/10 Incredibly funny, don't forget!
