this movie is, in my opinion, a decent story, very good fighting scenes, but i was a bit disappointed at the end of the movie. i think it was way better than lydie denier knew karate too or if she knew to use some guns, her character has also become more interesting and he was a decent opponent of cynthia. I think if the director made the final "battle" between cynthia & denier, he wanted to stop the movie before, so he didn't care how the end would be. I think cynthia rothrock fans are very pleased to watch this movie. It's not like "yes, madam"! or swear to justice, but it was entertaining enough and cynthia seems fantastic in this movie, so my movie rate is strong 8/10
