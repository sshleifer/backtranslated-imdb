I recently got this movie on Sci-Fi. In fact, it turned out to be quite decent for horror / temporary movies on list B. Two men (one naive and one loud in the mouth **) take a journey to stop the wedding, but they have the worst luck when the maniac is a nice, make-shift tank / truck hybrid, deciding to play the cat and mouse on them. Things are even more complicated when they take ridiculously the whore of the whore. What makes this film unique is that comedy and terror actually combine in this movie, unlike many others. Two guys are nice enough and there are some good chases / temporary scenes. The nice tempo and comic timing make this movie amazing for amazing astonishment. Definitely worth a look.
