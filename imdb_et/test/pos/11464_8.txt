Demon Night is a great movie and a great example of how good it is with a low budget. Of course, much of it is quite predictable, but somehow it is much more enjoyable than what we see these days as "Horror." I give gore a firm 9, and the demons of one of the liners are actually funny. I'm still out "Stop me!" The soundtrack is well done, I was surprised to hear "Stigmata Martyr" from Bauhaus! There is also a very nice R&D on the screen, as well as some cool, good makeup effects. The second film series is also pretty good, but avoids the lower third. The night of the demons can be dated, dark and low rented, but it still has many opportunities. It's definitely worth at least a rent. Give her tonight a chance to just stay away from old makeup! (understand what you see!)
