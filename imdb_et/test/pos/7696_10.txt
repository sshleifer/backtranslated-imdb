"Porgy and Bess" is an outstanding production of George Gershwin's masterpiece. It is tastefully made in quiet colors. Votes are outstanding. Although Sidney Porter's voice is dubbed for his song batch, he gives very touching results. Sammy Davis Jr. is remarkable for Sportin Life. There is no DVD yet to watch and this piece comes up. All the intelligent filmmakers who enjoyed it in 1959 appreciate the release of this masterpiece for the new media. The screen is full of dynamic presentations that compete with all other music, including Rodgers and Hammerstein. Be sure to ask your video supplier. Like Walt Disney's "Southern Songs", it may be a prerequisite for racial recordings that impede the marketing of this cinema.
