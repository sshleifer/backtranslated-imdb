I don't know how I feel when I live in the United States. I'd look at some of the preview scenes, ads, I know, Sidney Pollack drove it, Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott starring Thomas. I watch this movie as soon as possible, reading any bad reviews. Do I have to be disappointed? <br /> <br /> I read a lot of what has been said about how bad this movie was: it's a boring, long film that has no lucid effects and it's not interesting. Harrison is wood, cold. The sublots must be cut. Too serious, especially for Harrison Ford. I am interested in the subject and I like Harrison Ford in movies that are not activities. I also like Sidney Pollack and Kristin Scott Thomas. So I read the reviews of the IMDB website on other sites, then in February, I was wondering and wondering what the film was about in Hungarian film magazines. Anyway, there are movies, directors, stars, with whom I look, no matter what. <br /> <br /> I understand people who think this movie is boring and cold and who has no passion but I feel different. It is true that I liked the Sliding Doors, The Forbidden Woman (this is a French movie, I don't know what its title is in English or French). The essence of these films is the development of love. <br /> <br /> I think Random Heart is a nice and interesting movie in its own way. <br /> <br /> It may be that sublots are congressional elections and police investigation after a corrupt policeman - not well written, not elaborated in detail, but adds something to the leading character of a woman and a man. jobs. She is suspicious and almost lost her best friend (then a woman). The film has two ways to survive the tragedy: the death and cheating of our wife / husband. One of them is a woman: it is a tragedy, but life continues. He doesn't want to mourn forever. What she wants to know - what her husband's lover-police woman - she thought she would never learn. He is forced to behave in this way. Elections come and something about his wife can become a scandal. She wants her daughter not to be her father's disappointment. The man is the cop. He suffers because he was wrong. He wants to know - maybe everyone would like to know in this situation - when his wife started to cheat him. How long did he love? She needs a woman's help, but she doesn't want to, but the man is stubborn and persistent / persistent. She can't tolerate her because she always goes to her life and she can't forget. Their relationship is initially tense and slowly develops into some kind of silent compassion, which is a preferred alliance against the outside world, a tragedy. (I said this despite being loved in bed). But the policeman, unable to stop the investigation, is unable to close and can not let her close, but she starts "love" and the woman wants their relationship to continue. But it can't. The woman understands this. The end is a bit sad but logical and at the same time nice. <br /> <br /> I was pleased to see Peter Coyotet again - I like this man's face - Sidney Pollack. I hardly knew Bonnie Hunt, but he was good. <br /> <br /> I think Harrison Ford did a good job. Her earring is unusual, but at first I finally believed that she liked her company despite her temperament. He was sorry he had no fun. But Ford has a good sense of humor. The observer noticed (in Hungary): "Ford is charismatic in his hairstyle and ear drops and we are waiting for his presence and we would like to smile at us and forgive the irony. But he smiles at the end and that's so good. I agree with the rest. in a role - He's good for this behavior a bit tough, cool, but somewhere his sage is a clever policeman. really a woman who becomes indecisive and finds support in the police. Two bays, reserved - people find each other. <br /> <br /> Maybe the script is not good. It's full of common, banal sentences, but the woman and the movement are especially some humorous phrases - this is a good movie, but not for everyone, not for the general big audience.I watched women under the age of 18 and men over 45 loved this movie better. by Sidney Pollack made this movie for her age group, which doesn't go multiplex. Anyway, I advise people who like energetic plots that only have scenes that just like Ford movies don't like this movie.
