Owen loves her mom ... only she loves her on the right six feet in the dark ridiculous comedy that both stars are celebrating and directed by Danny DeVito, and with great help from Billy Crystal and Anne Ramsey in the title "<br /> <br /> "Throw a momma train" is a terrible comedy, even if it's not a big movie. Partly it is too low and the end is less organic than what is applied, but this is the most intense gut, Crystal and DeVito use the big screen chemistry. working with his own comic book, accepting the character of a fighting writer (DeVito is eager but unbelievable; the crystal is blocked and bitter). br /> <br /> Professor Donner of Crystal believes that his former husband stole his book (unfortunately titled " Hot Fire ") and can not write more than the opening of his next book, which is not easy. says Tom Clancy-type fiction, but he doesn't know what that submarine captain is saying; and a upholsterer who wants to write the story of his life. Mr Pinsky is probably the funniest character on the laugh-minute-screen, ascot-back, who sees literature as an excuse for writing his opus: "100 girls I would like pork." <br /> <br /> Then there is DeVito Owen Lift, who calls himself "Professor Donner", although the teacher does not read his class work. Owen is a somewhat unusual character in the movie, a man-child in the late 30s, who lives with his arrogant mother, Anne Ramsey, who calls her "lardass" and other love. In other films, you are asked to excuse yourself for Owen, but the "Throw Momma Train" piles to the cruel laughs of life and expect us to go. This is one big reason why this movie probably loses a lot of people. <br /> <br /> For those who enjoy the humor of this character, even by identifying him and taking the rest of what we see here in Lark, it's not that big a stretch to go with a bigger gambie, this comedy takes us asking us to look for fun, if Owen supports Professor Donner's help plan to kill her mother. In fact, he first goes to Hawaii to kill Donner's hatred, then the professor says his time is to kill Mrs. Lift, "to exchange murders", as seen at Hitchcock's "Strangers On A Train". <br /> <br /> The director, DeVito, not only complements his actors' performances with a scene that puts emphasis on dialogue, but does some bold visual statements, throwing a bit of fun into an unreality to keep the audience from their toes (and taking things too seriously away from taking things too seriously) ).) <br /> <br /> Help is also provided by writer Stu Silver, who keeps laughing at his ridiculous laughter. "You have rats with size Oldsmobiles here." "She's not a woman ... She's a Terminator." "One small murder and I'm Jack Ripper." These are all Crystal words, but some of the funniest lines that only work in context but completely kill are DeVito and Ramsey. Apparently, Silver has never written a second scenario according to IMDb, and it is a shame because it had a real talent for it. <br /> <br /> The best scene in this movie, when Crystal meets Ramsey, was actually used as a whole as a "future attraction" theater, the only time I've been advertising such a movie. Owen introduces the professor to her mother as "Cousin Patty" and when Momma says she has no cousin Patty, panicky Owen loses it. "You lied to me," he yells out, composing the tip of the professor in the pan. <br /> <br /> Of course, the professor is not really funny on the floor, but "Momma from Train works effectively at moments when he plays his Looney Sensation vibe for all of his value. Of course, DeVito's movies have not disappeared, but it's a mystery, why he has not really followed the guiding promise of this film. Maybe it is because, as "Throw momma on the mainstream of the train shows, his vision is not for everyone's taste." It's too bad for those who can look back and enjoy it over and over again.
