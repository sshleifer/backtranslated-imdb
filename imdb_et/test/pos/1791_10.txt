As Margot "Fear of fear" falls victim to his ambitious wife, such as Fox "Fox and his friends", his boyfriend who took all his money committed suicide, such as Xaverl Bolwieser "Stationsmaster's Wife", who goes to prison to give his a cheated spouse can get rid of him, like Hermann Hermann, who is looking for a craze for madness to escape from his foolish woman and bankrupt business, so that Hans Epp is also the victim of the German "Wirtschaftswunder" after World War II "Four Seasons Merchant". Just because Fassbinder played a social abuse between men and women and heterosexual and homosexual couples, it should be clear that he does not favor sex. <br /> <br /> Hans Hans is a woman who drives her into despair, sickness and finally death. When he returns from a foreign legion where he flew because he could no longer stand his mother's pressure, he complains that he is still alive when his neighbor's good boy is killed. Then Hans becomes a policeman, but is surprised to attract a prostitute. After losing his job, he works as a low-income fruit merchant who goes back to the backyard with his "crying". Her mother, one of her sisters, and her husband are ashamed of having a "street keeper" in their family. "The love of her life" (she has no name in the film) refuses to marry her because her job is incompatible with her social status and origin. She marries Irmgard, whom she does not love and does not love her. With his constant pressure, he flees to drinking. One night, after pursuing his wife, he explodes and strikes. He flees to his family, for which this event was just what they expected. When Irmgard calls a divorce lawyer, Hans suffers a heart attack. Imrgard decides to stay with him, but he is no longer allowed to do heavy work and drink alcohol. So he gets more and more redundant, becomes quieter and quieter and more depressive. When he discovers that Irmgard is deceiving him, he decides to end his life, but not like Hermann Hermann, traveling in the light of madness, but drinking himself in the face of Imrgard, his little daughter, and his rushing friends. Fassbinder said in an interview that Hans knew what he was doing. The question, however, is: did Hans kill himself because he could no longer stand his unhappy environment, or did he make a self-declaration?
