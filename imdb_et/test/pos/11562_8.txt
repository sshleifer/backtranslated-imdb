I haven't seen this movie coming out in the mid-1970s, but I recall this as a very realistic picture of the music industry (just here with Paul Simons "One Trick Pony".) <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel does a great job as a producer trying to and the "suits" of the commercial theater want it to work. <br /> <br /> Since I spent my entire career as a composer / organizer / producer in a music company, I can really guarantee the uniqueness of this film. <br /> <br /> If it ever came out on a DVD, I'd buy it!
