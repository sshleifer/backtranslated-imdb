They don't make such movies anymore? although some may say it is good. Although it was one of the first Disney PG-rated movies, G-movies are more in their 70s (ie "Freaky Friday", "The World Greatest Athlete") than the movies that came out in the early 80s (ie "Watcher in the Woods "," Tron "," Something Wicked That Way "). With the support of Disney, Midnight Madness was clearly a big budget. There are a lot of choices and lots of different places to show it. But the zaniness, the crazy catcher's crazy visual style was not enough to record the movie from a huge flop ... Lack of office, most of us introduced to the movie at the beginning of HBO? In the 80s, while the same movie was shown 29 times a week (Oh, wait, they still do it!). Basically, HBO did what CBS did for The Wizard of Oz for this movie? they created a huge public audience for the sugar-sweet mega-flop. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem that makes this "bad" movie is that too many characters and very few of them are obese? Eddie Deezen's "team" doesn't even have names! The blue team, though they are villains, are the most enjoyable and have the most work in their characters (except for a girl who can't act and do not have enough to do). Harold, completely played by Stephen Furst, is the only one whose character has been fully realized in the film. Another standout character is the Melio game currently played by director Andy Tennant. Though - dr. Pepper's spokesman David Naughton was supposed to be a star, his character is often reluctant, especially when he was accused of brother Adam, Michael J. Fox. Although everyone has favorite characters, I don't think anyone who loves the movie can agree that Furst and Fox are the only two characters you really know. <br /> <br /> Despite the many shortcomings of the movie and the bad players (most of whom fell off after the movie), it still works because the actors seemed to be fun - and the fun in the set equals the fun on the screen. Come on, what college jock did not dream of swim around in the beer bar and what the zoftig girl does not dream of stealing local discotheque ... er ... I think it would be a rave nowadays. .. Campy, a nervous-clean fun for anyone who was young in the 70s and 80s, it's just suitable that it has finally got a huge video release that it deserves. But where the hell is the widescreen DVD with comment, trailer and the full version of the song that plays the disc?
