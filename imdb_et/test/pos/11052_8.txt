78 years ago ... "Anna Christie" premiered by the slogan "Garbo Talks!" The film lasts 16 minutes and the audience gets to the top of the curiosity: Greta enters the bar and goes through a long-awaited silence of silence: a few seconds she closed her quiet era and finally Greta Garbo says historically, "Give whiskey, ginger and do not chew, baby!" <br /> <br /> "Anna Christie" (1930) is a Clarence Brown film that introduced the great silent star Greta Garb. Nowadays, we can only imagine what a serious transfer was to the actors and actors. Many had to end their career - something we hardly can see at all. And it wasn't a coincidence that Clarence Brown led the first speech with Swedish beauty. Garbo trusted the director for his two silent productions FLESH and DEVIL (1926) and WOMEN'S RIGHTS (1928). But we are in 2008 and this fact about the film, which is now purely historical, seems to be of little importance. The question of today's viewer is not what Garbo's voice seems to be, but if the film is still traceable in 78 years. In other words, we are all trying to answer the question of whether the film has tried over time. Is that so? <br /> <br /> When I looked at it recently, I came to the conclusion that, apart from some minor technical aspects, including the static camera, "Anna Christie" is still a lot of fun. On the one hand, this is a great story about life, the reality a young woman faces (based on Eugene O'l Neill) and, on the other hand, the artistic manifestation of true excellence in this area. Let me analyze these two aspects in separate points. <br /> <br /> TABLE OF CONTENTS: Chris Christopherson (George F Marion), a heavy drinker, lives on a seaman's life, on a ferry. is full of sorrow, comforted by a letter from his daughter Anna (Garbo) whom she has not seen for 15 years. He says he's coming back to him. the daughter is no longer a child without experience, but a 23-year-old woman who has gone through a variety of things at the Minnessota farm where she lived and worked, and she also forgets that she has the right to accept the love of other men in her life ... This brief presentation of the content not from the main chara's point of view cter, but what we were previously introduced to as Anna (her father Chris) makes you realize how universal it is. After all these years, the entire text that seems to be alive is not deleted from the text. The cases discussed here in 1930 are still meaningful and valid ... <br /> <br /> RESULTS. There are not many characters in the movie, but there are two roles that really look like. Of course, Greta Garbo himself, who made a remarkable presence in the 15-year-old phenomenon that marked the history of early cinema (something I have already discussed in many of my earlier comments on his films). But here Garbo is a little different. I admit that there are moments in this film when it doesn't know its role very well. This seems to be due to his new experience in English; however, his performance, as always, is genuine and unique. But that's what everyone has been waiting for Garbo. The real surprise of the film for the 1930s and for us is Marie Dressler Marthyna. She is magnificent in her facial expressions, in her accent, in the image of all the drinking woman who looks at life from the "bottle-hit" point of view. Her best moments are a conversation with Anna Christie at the bar, preceded by her fun talking to Chris. The remaining support cast is fine, but not large (here is the German version). Especially Dressler, except Garbo himself, is a perfectly flawless choice. <br /> <br /> If you asked me what I like about "Anna Christie" nowadays, I'd tell you this is a classic movie. However, there is another thing I will finally mention. It is humor, a wonderful mind that is noticeable throughout the world. Although the content is quite serious and "Anna Christie" does not carry the comic spirit in any way (the only Garbo comedy was NINOTCHKA), such moments are when you share. For example, don't miss Anna and Matt's visit to the amusement park, especially in the restaurant where she orders milk to think about how strong and innocent she is, beer for herself, and suddenly Marthy joins them randomly ... <br /> <br /> " Anna Christie "is the perfect film for classical buffets and must see everyone at least a little bit interested in the real magnificence. If you have a lot of these modern stars, look for such movies and you have to be happy. Very worth your search! <br /> <br /> Scale Greta Garbo! Scale Marie Dressler! Drink a toast for the great work you did in the movie! Scale after all those years when wine tastes much better and your spirits are in a different sense to us ...
