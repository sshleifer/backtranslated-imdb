"Saturday afternoon" is one of Harry Langdon's well-known short topics and with good reason. It's one of her funniest and best movies. The plot - as it is - is an old stapler: a chicken pecked husband jumps overnight with his ball and another girl. This is a solid and well-used comedy plot, but the difference here is Harry Langdon himself. Her slow, ineffective, innocent, innocent character has somehow split her marriage with a woman who feels she has to be led by all people from the iron fist, and she is only the driving force behind her because she can't say "no" to the hairy Vernon Dent and the girl a pleasant incipient lash. <br /> <br /> This is a very adult problem that has to be pushed to such helpless, childish character. Harry doesn't want to cheat, but he can't do anything about it. An excellent comic business can't blow her into a new girlfriend. He pushes the kiss to his base and destroys his hand with shame to break it. The film is a triple comedy, ten minutes longer than two relatives Harry Langdon, who had previously been to Mack Sennett starring no longer in the plot. Maybe it was even meant to be two reelers. It works beautifully because it gives it as much time as it needs slow reactions and puzzled glances and semi-operations where so much of his comedy lives. <br /> <br /> He is here the best and the show is really Harry Langdon's curious magic and the ability to spin almost nothing comedy. His little smiles, his appearance under the people he's hidden under the rug, childish attempts to get into the fight at the end. I think his comedy makes us admit something that is completely innocent and confusing in itself, which makes us feel that the whole world is too much for us, but at the same time, enabling us to understand what Harry is not doing (for example, the fact that women the one he wholeheartedly brings to his friend to rejoice when he thinks that the date is blown is actually whores) he is forcing him to understand a little sad that we are no longer innocent. His comedy is just as capable to say "Awwww" to us, because it often makes us laugh, often at once. <br /> <br /> Here, Harry wants to refuse his wife's cheating, he wants to talk to his wife, whose boss and relationship is withdrawn, he wants to fight against two violent men. The movie, but he just can't influence his surroundings so much, and sometimes we know it. <br /> <br /> The film is headed by the very frequent Langdon director Harry Edwards; it is moving at a fast pace and never stops while making time and presenting Harry Langdon's still reactive comedy best. Vernon Dent, a frequent foil for Langdon, plays a role here, where he becomes an almost comedy partner in a very effective engagement with Harry. The gags are positioned so as to have maximum effect, and Harry gets his Lloyd or Keaton style stunt to the end. Here, the comedy Harry is not in danger of sitting between two moving cars in his big reactions, but to slow him down. <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie and a great example of comedy. one of the most unique talented humorists I ever know.
