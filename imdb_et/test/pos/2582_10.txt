I knew as soon as I saw the first Black Snake Moan trailer I could see. I wasn't disappointed with the smallest film written and directed by Craig Brewer, the creator of Hustle and Flow. It tells the story of a broken blues and nympho, which she is trying not only for her but also for her own ... but it is so much more. It is complicated and rich, and it succeeds in dramatically deepening your sudden, sticky and smooth blue Memphis without feeling the bath. <br /> <br /> Characters are (mostly) versatile and well written and executed. Accents and dialogue were flawless. But there was one weak link in the chain: Justin Timberlake. The best thing I want to tell her is she can cry ... this is a rare male actor who can convince me cautiously. Justin was Ronnie's flat, but he acted very hard as an actor. Certainly I would give her another chance. <br /> <br /> Lazarus and Rael (Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci) have great chemistry and great respect for each other. This is one of those movies where it is not important how good one actor is when the other is not in the task and, fortunately, both parties were performing the task. <br /> <br /> The music was very little as good as you'd expect, especially when Mr. Samuel L. Jackson sings on the blues. Phenomenal. <br /> <br /> Technically, everything was when I saw it. It was well edited, well photographed and well blended ... everything was great. Character and set designs were just right, casting supportive characters (even Justin Timberlake and especially Kim Richards) was on the spot ... Loved.
