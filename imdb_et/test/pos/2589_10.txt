Having just received "Loony Tunes Golden Collection" (which I highly recommend, by the way), I will try to comment at most, not all cartoons separately. As such, a starting statement may seem superfluous to those who read several reviews because I apologize. <br /> <br /> Rabbit seasoning is the short short of the short trilogys with the same thinking (the other two are ""). Rabbit Fire and Duck! Rabbit, Duck) Bags and Daffy claim who should be short for Elmer Fudd will make me laugh at one time !!! The DVD has a comment, featurette, & selection only to play music <br /> <br /> My class: A + <br /> <br /> DVDs: Disc 1: Chuck Jones Introduction, Termite Boy Part 1 ; movie clips "Two men from Texas" and "My dream is yours", both with Bugs, "Bugs Bunny show" episode, Astro Nuts audio recording session, 2 vintage trailer "Blooper Bunny: Bugs Bunny 51 and half day" writer Greg Ford and Photo Gallery
