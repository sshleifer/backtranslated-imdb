I'm not a fan of this comedy brand - stereotypical characters that move over the police and robbers farce. But there are enough pleasant signs to preserve interests. Michelle Pfeiffer is divine, but the person who actually carries the film is Dean Stockwell, who steals every scene as the main player (called Tony, not less). Stockwell's performance is why I write this review (and the only reason I would recommend it). You're talking about your screen time. He plays the mob's master perfectly, comedy touches in the right place, avoiding becoming a frightening cliff. In fact, Stockwell has the full pleasure of watching - a twin champion and a real spectator in these stylish suits and fedoras. <br /> <br /> Meesa says: A good movie to watch when the laundry is washed or left behind.
