Valentine "Dogkiller" Dussaut and Joe "Judge" Kern join forces to clean the middle streets of Geneva! Thrill when they put kiboshi into international heroin drivers, Polish refugees, ridiculous dances, philandering girlfriends, renegade dogs and litterbugs who are too lazy to recycle. Don't be fooled by the misleading Miramax advertising campaign, which color it as a fictional, art house flick. This movie is a 100% action!
