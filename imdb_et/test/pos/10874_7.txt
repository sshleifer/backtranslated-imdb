I do not know if I would go so far as to say that this film belongs to the Aussie trash, but it is fair to say that there are no candidates for the Academy Award here. It should be taken into account that most of the participants in this film were not really actors, but children who had nothing better to do. There were many others who had roles in the film, but turned to surf the coast; all the things that were taken into account were not really a bad film for this time. In some ways, this is not really different from today's times, where reciprocal pressure is still alive and strikes without the mobile phones, computers and other similar gadgets that the children lived in, unlike that generation. Anyway, I have to rate this flick as an old fave, which I look at once in your month and never take it too seriously ...
