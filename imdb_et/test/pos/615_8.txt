Francois Ozon's "Robe d'Ete" is not a dull moment. It's surprising how much this short film is packed. While leaving the abandoned beach after naked swimming, the young girl turns to look for her cigarette light. He invites him to love the wooded area near the beach. Returning to the beach. they find that all his clothes are stolen. She lends her a dress that covers her nudity in the summer and asks her back the next day. She rides her bike back to a resting room dressed as a girl. His gay companion is sexually excited. At the beginning of the next morning, the young man returns to the sea and says goodbye to the girl whose holiday is over. She recommends that she keeps her dress as a remembrance of her summer romance. This is a light-hearted film that captures the spirit of summer holidays by the sea, but perhaps not for those who are embarrassed by nudity or homosexual issues.
