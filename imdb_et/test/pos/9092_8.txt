I've been planning to review this movie for some time, but only now have I been able to get to know my thoughts. <br /> <br /> I never had the pleasure of seeing it on the "big screen" movie, which is shameful because it is often visually stunning, but I've been reviewing it many times over the years, enjoying it enormously every time. This is definitely on my personal favorite movies list and more than just the starring of Kiefer Sutherland and Kevin Bacon, two of my "actors." <br /> <br /> Maybe I appreciate this movie so much that it complains of a bit of a relaxing taste of entertainment. I like my movies in the middle to the left - unpredictable and fresh. And do you believe the story of the movie, you have to admit it is different! <br /> <br /> Everyone has different tastes and opinions, but I have some negative comments about it, the movie is that the viewers never saw the surface of the film. They came to technical tasks: "Why should the subway have green lighting?" or "Why should medical students carry such a fool?" and did not see the artistic and psychological depth of the work. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some medical and technical aspects that do not make sense, but if you are willing to stop the unbelief, it can be a very interesting movie. <br /> <br /> Firstly, a note about the artistic quality of the film. Some have complained about the illuminating nature of illumination and kits, but I have been using innovative lighting techniques, plastic and leaf-draped sets, unusual settings in old buildings and plates, dripping tunnels, shape usage, rain and flat curtains - all add poetic taste to this film, haunting beauty that fits the questions asked about life, death, and forgiveness. <br /> <br /> I focus on just two examples; In the alley scene, the illumination will allow the elements of a particular element to focus, then disappear when the lighting returns to normal. It is an innovative tool that allows you to change the reality of the current situation and work beautifully. We are also allowed to see the interior of the character apartments - contrasting with warm wood, bright colors, golden lighting and the serene comfort of the Labraccio rooms with the nuance of Nelson. Both reflect the characters themselves. The absence of Nelson's "objects" reflects our knowledge of our past. and her carefully designed mask that keeps her companions away. His past, learning, is chaos and conflict. He has decided to leave it behind empty void. Unfortunately, emptiness also reflects his relationship with others, the understanding of what he has come to his personal discovery in this film. <br /> <br /> Flatliners is not your typical horror movie. Nor is it a typical drama or a temporary film.it is rather the unification of all, because the best elements of all genres are intertwined in a complex, intermittent plot. <br /> <br /> This is a piece of the ensemble and the casting makes the breathing life of the excellent work its own individual mark. Your direct impression is that the characters are the representatives of every well-established "stereotype": a female queen, a slightly neurotic "doctor", a playboy, and a socially aware "nice boy" and so on. characters are improved, they take a number of dimensions and depths. <br /> <br /> The most interesting is Sutherland's Nelson character. Nelson is not just a pleasant character - he is a bit b ** tard, a master manipulator who definitely puts self-interest above all else. At the same time, Sutherland plays the uncertainty that gives him a certain complaint. As the events unfold, you realize that a large part of Nelson's unpleasant personality is a smokescreen, a protective mask behind a very insecure and vulnerable young man who is burdened by a terrible secret. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> The complex personality of Nelson throughout the film will lead you, writers, directors, and directors to progressive understanding and compassion. A person who started with "jerkina" becomes important and valuable in his own way - if you learn to give your previous behavior in the light of new information. Your discovery with Nelson reflects the characters' own journey towards self-consciousness, because they also understand that everyone has value and "everything we do." What leads to my final comment. While many of the posters here have taken the death penalty, few seem to have touched upon what I see as the main prerequisite for the film - the importance of forgiveness and the need to be aware of everything you do because it is "important." <br /> <br />
