This movie offers a lot of joy and surprises. When Achille and Philippa sing beautifully the "Don Giovanni" duet that perfectly describes their situation in the film, you appreciate the fine layers of this great film. The story begins with the 18th century The use of music played in Jutland and during the period is another fine touch. You share the exciting joy of Loewenhielm when he was in Cailles en Sarcophage, though you are just watching a movie - but you just want a little sample to taste. <br /> <br /> Babette is an artist whose media are food. Perhaps no other art form allows the artist to share his work so directly. <br /> <br /> The main theme of this movie, the potential that food sharing needs to change, how people see each other and how they see the world is much like the "Chololat" theme, but the "Babette Party" didn't hit you with the message head present. The townspeople are conservative Puritans, but not too oppressive. You come to understand and respect them and finally appreciate your humanity. <br /> <br /> Many topics have been raised to think about: the nature of art, the way of thinking and unused roads, the mental and physical connection, the impact of the environment on behavior, taking life to give life, among others. <br /> <br /> The only disappointment for me was General Loewenhielm's speech, given to the top of the meal. I waited for deep heartfelt observations, but I got some vague mystical ramblings. The speech had such a small effect that I could hardly remember it. <br /> <br /> But this underrated movie leaves a lasting impression. The heat it produces is the opposite of its strong background. You leave the theater, who wants to go under the stars and dance.
