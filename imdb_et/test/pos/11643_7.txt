This film has two new features in relation to the message of the equally good films of the death penalty and executions. They are also an emphasis on drama suffered by the parents of the victims - without hiding the hate and the desire for revenge that they feel or diminish the horror represented by execution - and the Christian vision of all the issues involved. We must also note that in this film, the convicted person is not a normal innocent person we see in other executions, which does not allow us to give up the idea that punishment is just a legal murder. Last but not least, we must mention the extraordinary emotional body weight that has been placed on the last moments of the executive course, with the catharsis shown by all the last words of the convicted, and the detail that looks at the act of exercising in parallel with the cut images. murder scenes in the woods, emphasizing that we are facing another murder, which is somehow ruthless but took place in a cold and supposed "legitimate" way.
