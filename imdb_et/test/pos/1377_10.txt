OK, so maybe it's because I'm in the north-east of Scotland and I'm just talking about the guys in this movie, but I found it very fun. Cheap fun to be sure, but a lot of effort has been made to make the film very good and the actors definitely all give. I was actually dead. Partly when the captain finally fell. Script? Well this is a two-party game. The opening side of the film is well written and sharp. The last half hour is not so big because many questions were left unanswered. This undoubtedly disturbs others because it bothers me. However, Sturton is a fun and very smart first feature.
