I'm a long-time fan of Luc Besson's work and I've been looking for this movie for a long time since I knew his name. I tried to search this movie in California for over four years. last summer I took a trip to Europe, one of my travel tasks was at least watching this movie. a short story, I bought it and watched it in France! I was blown away, completely made my trip and I finally know the content I've seen in Luc Besson's first work. completely amazing character formation, very meaningful provocation, great acting and ultimate concept film. If you are a fan of the movie, it is one of the most original and classic. I feel it is rare to see a movie like this, its risky, unusual and ultimately unique. If you are a fan of Luc Besson, it must, however, actually see if your Besson fan or not is definitely an important work that makes a great contribution to the cinema's immortal art.
