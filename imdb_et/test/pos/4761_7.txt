**** SPOILERS **** Under the hill of buried medical bills and his funeral that cannot appeal to him, subsidiary Vito Lucia, Tony Lo Bianco, presented a plan to encash cash with the help of his wife Moon & Bo, Richard Lynch & Bill Hickman. <br /> <br /> Vito goes to his boyfriend's buddy Buddy Manucci, Roy Scheider as a mobster to win Buddy's trust and let him say Vito, which is a mob for mobile activities on New York's streets. Buddy is a policeman who works in the NYPD, the seven Ups alps, making things "his way" to cleaning off criminals in New York. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Vito gets information from Buddy and says to Buddy that he really gives him tips on the mob and what it is and uses this information for his hood. Moon & Bo. mobile users capture and hold their weekly extracts and robbery for ransom. <br /> <br /> Vito & Co are all fine until mob decides to receive and mistakenly rob and abduct seven Ups Anseli, Ken Kercheval, who was secretly thinking he was one of the hoods that kidnap and hang take them away. Later, the Moon was killed to kill if he broke the car body Ansel was locked in, thinking there was a suitcase full of cash, a ransom, in it. <br /> <br /> Fast paced and exciting movie New York's sharp and grimy photography, which was so effective in the movie "French Connection", which also celebrates Roy Scheider & Tony Lo Biancot. The incredible chase of the car, which began in the center of Brooklyn and reached the wildlife of New Jersey, is about 15 to 20 miles away when Buddy almost finished his heroic efforts. <br /> <br /> Roy Scheider, who is not a big man, is as harsh and efficient as any big player I think Clint Eastwood would have been in the same movie. Scheider reminds me a lot, he even looks a bit like him, a former steel head and master weight giant, Gene Fullmer, who won a big sugar Ray Robinson for the medieval championship in 1957 and also works in his film: tough tough and destructive. <br /> <br /> Tony Lo Bianco is very good at being a Vito entrepreneur who is a small-life hunter who plays Buddy and on his mobile that leads Buddy's partner Anselin. Even if he's in the trash, you can't help Vitot apologize in any way, because he only wants the money he's ripped from the attackers to pay his sick woman's Rose hospital and medical bills. Even the fact that Ansel was killed because of his actions never wanted someone to get in, but as they say when you play with fire, you have to burn. Finally, Vitol has many explanations for not so sympathetic and caring mobiles. <br /> <br /> Bill Hickman has made dangerous tricks by driving a car and acting in the movie "Seven Tops". Hickman was also a stuntman in both great films where he traveled on the streets of New York and San Francisco and on the "French Connection" and "Bullitt" highways.
