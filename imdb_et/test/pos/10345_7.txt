Nynke is a stylish film that has the same style as the Oscar winning film Character (1997). But this comparison invites me to add immediately that the latter was quite exciting ... <br /> <br /> Of course, Nynke is a beautiful historical and costume drama (fantastic acting by Monic Hendrickx!), Where you see "Nynke van Hichtumi" personal growth with his married Pieter Jelles Troelstra. The subtitles for this movie are "Love". So it starts and ends with their marriage. <br /> <br /> But this is where the director makes a big mistake! Nynke's exciting and independent life began when the marriage ended. He wrote several children's books and traveled around the world. What a great life he has lived. But Pieter Verhoeff puts Nynke back into the Convention trams that pushed him down and fought out: the idea that his life only extended his marriage to Troelstra, not the other, but the mother of their children. <br /> <br /> Let's hope Nynke II!
