Meatballs work in conversations like no other film. Especially in the summer. Whether it's a story of CITs (advisers in training) or sections or inspirational Rudy rabbit, or it just doesn't mean speech ... it's up! Poor Mickey / Morty, who knows where he wakes up the next day? Such a great moment of the seventies and a cultural icon for my generation who realize that non-PC is really funny, no matter who you are! Wheels and Spaz are favorites, as well as the hot dog food competition with the famous "what ..? Mustard?" How many times have I repeated this line and I'm the only one who laughed! Thank you for the writers, actors and leaders! Applause, applause!
