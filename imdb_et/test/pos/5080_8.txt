Imagine you've been on the airplane for 18 hours. You've been on a business trip to South Africa. You are a highly paid professional. You've been living in the US for 20 years. You're in your thirties, you have a woman, a little boy, and another child. One thing, even if you have a green card, you're still an Egyptian. In transit, you are asked to come with 2 security guards, the next thing you know is that you are overcrowded, hooded and chained and after a brief (but still reasonably civil) interrogation, you must give! This happens with Anwar el Ibrahim at the beginning of the film. He is the story of pain and (literally) torture. This is one of several stories. One monitors his wife's attempts to get more information. One follows the (cold) bureaucrats behind the transfer. The second story is about the family of the person who leads Anwar el Ibrahim. There are also some other stories, and finally they all came together properly. While the most famous actors, such as Reese Witherspoon (like the failed pregnant woman), Jake Gyllenhaal (CIA rookie forced to look at the interrogation in North Africa) and Meryl Streep (CIA hotshot Corine Whitman), are really more unknown actors who carry the story and give it to heart. For me, in the heart and soul of this film, there was an actor playing the regrettable Mr El Ibrahim (Omar Metwally). His depiction of a man in trouble was shockingly well done. It's almost the same as being tortured! The Israeli actor Yigal Naor was also very impressive, as some were concerned about family members and, in part, extremely cruel torture. Hard to watch and not quite fun, but still very useful.
