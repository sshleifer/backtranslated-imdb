I loved this movie absolutely ... So many emotions in so little time. I loved the beginning and how it keeps you in complete control. I love this story and the deer that have been introduced. I know if I think deer I think innocence and well-being. In Psalm 42: 2, the Bible also says, "As the water-borne thorns, put my soul upon you, O God,". What could even combine the last minute when a woman says it's okay. Like he knows he's going with God. Maybe I mean a lot. But sometimes it is interesting to see what is happening in people's minds. Thank you for sharing your masterpiece with viewers everywhere. I live in Texas and I was playing this cableâ€¦ I really liked the music used in the background. Music can sometimes make or break a movie. It definitely determined the mood. Very nice choice! <br /> <br /> Thank you again. <br /> <br /> Laetitia
