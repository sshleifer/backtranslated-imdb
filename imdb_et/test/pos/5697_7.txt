<br /> <br /> Since I'm a teenager, I've got about a hundred years of movies. I am trying to see a mix of classic, mainstream, art house and other films. The 70s is one of the most important decades of films: it is when the average, classic classic films became full of messages and antisocial behavior. It became something that nobody has seen before. What effect of the decade will have a major impact on the importance of all the "The Graduate" to Star Wars. <br /> <br /> Richard LaGravenese and late Ted Demme are the main interviewers in this documentary, interviewing people like Dennis Hopper, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman and Jon Voight, among other things about how they were for a couple of years cinema forever changed. It is a very professional, polished documentary and is even funded by IFC films. But because it is very professional, I think they would at least change the camera's female noise. For me it took a lot, like a clean and clean thing. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is a very interesting documentary about the film by its makers. Of course, they are not their films or the like, but they represent honesty about what they were about movies and what they meant. I don't know much about the movie (but I want to be involved when I get into adulthood) so I feel like this movie, this movie is a huge asset. I've seen a lot of movies they mentioned, like Chinatown and One flying over the snout, but a little more pictures of these movies were very informative. <br /> <br /> The main reason, but I couldn't love Influence is so slippery as it was delivered, it seemed that it took time to start and is quite relaxed, so it doesn't have enough time to get everything they wanted to show. They created Star Wars and Jaws in just a few minutes when they were the two most important. It seemed that they tried to show too many clips, and that is good, but some of them were irrelevant, such as the extended network. <br /> <br /> In general, Influence is a very attractive, informative documentary that helped me at least learn more about the second 'golden age' in the American cinema. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> R rated for images of sexuality, violence and drug abuse.
