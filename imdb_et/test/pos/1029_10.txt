Amazingly well-designed mini-series. I would like to remind you that most of them are seen twice when it is shown in PBS on American Playhouse. It was strengthened at that time. I believe it could have been one of the very early mini-series shown on the PBS outside of the Masterpiece Theater series. <br /> <br /> With full-length production I showed that I believe only once during my first transmission. In total it was 6-8 hours. This length was edited to just under 6 hours. Cut some interesting but slow scenes. <br /> <br /> I very much hope that people with current rights will monitor and restore a full, not edited version of the DVD. This is not worth the VHS version. <br /> <br /> Very well suited for mini-series or dramatic history.
