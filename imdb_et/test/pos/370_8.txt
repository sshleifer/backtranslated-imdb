In my endless endeavor to see as many high-quality films as possible during my lifetime, I bumped into this cable. I tried Hitchcock three times before, and I never felt the man's work lived up to his praise. I've always felt that he was good, not big (what I've seen) It was the best of his films I've seen. Robert Walker is completely chilling, his production takes a movie where Hitchcock wanted to go. Even average performance damages the entire product. My favorite scene was his obsession with how to get more easily drained (how exactly does he get there?) Bruno is quite convincing, but I also loved Patricia Hitchcock's performance Barbara. The rest of the Morton family and the Guy were a bit dry and boring, but he added a bit of film and some better lines in the script. <br /> <br /> Finally, any temporary movie, you live and die at your end. It has water, unlike other Hitchcock movies I've seen. I wasn't sure how it would end, which kept me on the edge when I looked and waited.
