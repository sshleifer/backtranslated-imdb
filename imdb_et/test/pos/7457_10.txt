Duckman was an exhibition that had been in the past hour before it was time to sleep about ten years ago. It was a contrast that was a lot of child-type animation that I was watching at the same time; I was still a little Disney and Looney Feeling Junke, and most of the Saturday morning cartoons were still on top since Ninja Turtles and Batman's Day. But also around this time I began to admit that the more terrible, mature, surreal, obscene, and (although I didn't know the deadline), satirical comic exhibitions were more creative than the things I used to do. Beavis and Butt-head, Ren and Stimpy, and even Maxx strikes TVs via MTV, the US set two examples - one of them was Weird Science and the other was Duckman. I've always shown some key bits, and some lines are very quoted to those who haven't forgotten it completely. Luckily, I recently found a tape with about six episodes that I had been recording for a long time, and the jokes were very fresh. And the delivery of jokes is a faster fire for a lot of time in better episodes. In the Voice Department, talent choices are the most important story that is usually just an excuse for pop culture, politics, movies and TV shows, exciting music, exciting parodies, detective mysteries, and an uncertain family. Jason Alexander is a great choice for Duckman and his performance is a comedian of 180 on his day in Seinfeld (even though here and there are some similar qualities). Also Gregg Berger's voices as unmistakably monotonous and dead Cornfed, Dweezil Zappa as fun intuitively Ajax and Nancy Travis as sex-hungry, reluctant sister Bernice, all contribute in full. Together with excellent writing - even if the joke is not sure, it is compensated by hiding - animation style, while far from some of today's modern, computer-based products is inventive and often abstract. It has home-made, sharp quality that Beavis and Butt-head or South Park will get later. And as they show, if you're a little boy, I mean a little younger than an exhibition, you may not understand most of the jokes (ie there are enough strippers and VD references to complete two examples). But it's ingenious to catch it when it's on television late at night and it works pretty well in that time bank. Only a DVD box set can be counted. So, someone who has barely or even heard of this program has a general remark: think of this example of Dashiell Hammett having met Walt Disney and decided to go to Slum as Vegas with a free minibar and in collaboration with Luis Bunuel and the Simpson vein. Not to mention this is the group that made Rugrats (strong) A
