The scams on the plane had such a well-hyped film that it was so inevitable as well as a little crazy to try to release another movie in the same year with almost the same title, not to mention the same week. Reading other comments I see results. Many people are crazy. Mad, because he doesn't have the best special effects. Mad, because he has no stars. Mad, because they wanted Samuel Jackson to say, "I'm their M ^ * and * &% - Er F * ^ (^% - Ing Snakes its M ^ * and * &% - Er F * ^ (^% - on the train "! <br /> <br /> Well, this is definitely not the Samuel Jackson version. And maybe it is good. Family films and bloody fearsome death films laugh on Saturdays, while Jackson swore enough to cover grandmother's ears and children go to violence <br /> On the Snakes train, you knew exactly what it was. It was a cheaper horror film made on the train, but they certainly had snakes and sure many of them were scientifically harmless garden snakes whose sound effects were fake. in a plot or intent where the "on the Plane" version had fallen out of the first scene. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the ultimate fun that Snakes on the Plane had to offer and admit that "... is the Train version was a little dry, but hey, in trade, it was a cool and unexpected story. ud go more wrong than it was. <br /> <br /> This is from 7 out of 10 people.
