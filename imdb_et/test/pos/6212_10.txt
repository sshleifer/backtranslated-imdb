In the later part of the 1980s, the supercar had my favorite movie when it came out. My father recorded it for me and I looked at it all the time, until my step-mother stuck over Opra and my heart was torn. I would like to know if or where I can get it. I've been looking for it. I believe they even came out of Supercarrier 2. It wasn't as big as the first one, but I would like them all if I could find them. I don't think it's all a bad movie. It was a very interesting movie with a lot of activities, but it had a somewhat love story. The actors / actors were big. It also helped me to understand that this is not just a man's world, but it is also the world of a woman and many women can do the same things, if not more than what one can do and women deserve their responsibilities.
