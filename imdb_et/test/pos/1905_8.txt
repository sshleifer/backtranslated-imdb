Surely this movie is not for everyone - but for anyone with a sense of humor and a period of love √ê - buy it now! Where else will you get the 70's timing, the period of vocabulary, the karate-trained whores, the crime, the rape of the Titanic rape, the shootings and the queen of Bee (see her moving crying scene early) in the observers' office! / Dawn of The Dead / and Car Wash, you can't go wrong. This is the one to look over and over again.
