As the previous reviewer said, Travolta stole every scene where he was. Recognize this character? It was Vinnie Barberino, everyone grew up and were still small but still enjoy it, oh yes! The disappointment was William Hurt and Bob Hoskins, perhaps because their characters were badly written or they just didn't care. I saw one of Baldwin's (never remember what) in the role of Hurt, so that Hurt's incredible talents were not wasted. <br /> <br /> Andie McDowell is expensive but not very plausible; partly in writing. The feature of this film was not just a big development. Just look at Travolta, sit and have fun.
