<br /> <br /> Like Harold Lloyd's fan, I agree with other reviewer's comments, SEE that I feel "Movie Crazy" was his best soundtrack; "Cat's paw" is another. (But that's just my opinion). <br /> <br /> This movie is from the beginning to the end "hoot" and in many scenes George Barbier (who is his chosen mayor) almost steals the show! (Especially at the end of the movie). <br /> <br /> One wants Una Merkel's character to be more sympathetic to Harold, especially when the movie is progressing. Only in the last few minutes of the film will we explain to him his true feelings. (And even then "romance" - kissing, etc.). <br /> <br /> It's a must-see movie!
