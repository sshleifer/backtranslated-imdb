I didn't know Karen Carpenter or Richard about this person, so I have to go to see how the movie was portrayed by him. I think a better person for this accuracy would be his brother Richard. But from what I saw and learned about Karen, I felt his pain, shared my sorrow and was a very special person for me. I know I wasn't born before 1965, so I didn't know him as much as some of your older fans, but I've definitely grown up listening to my music and have nice memories of my music.

I feel his warmth and love every time I hear one of his songs and he's very much left.
