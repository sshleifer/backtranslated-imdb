Agree that this was one of the best episodes of this exhibition. I remember the series as well as I was on the Florida Keys when the show was on their debut. I was looking for old VCR birds that were "keepers", and I found two with about eight episodes. I finished a part of Christmas Eve (and next) watching these exhibitions. The singer was Bankie Banx - saw the credit of her name. She is from Anguilla and has a beachfront bar The Dune Preserve. He is Jimmy Buffett's long-term friend and Bankie's classic song "Still In Paradise" is featured on the latest Buffett CD / DVD combination "Live In Anguilla". Also, I would like to see this short series one day on DVD. Don't lose faith!
