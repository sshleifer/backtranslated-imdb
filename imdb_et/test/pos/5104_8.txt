Yes, 1939 / The Robert Donat-Greer Garson version was the best ... Perfection..Donat won the Oscar in a very harsh year. GWTW & James Stewartis won Mr Smith. were two of his competitors. .wow was this tough year. Most NY critics hated this version. so.didnt see in the theater! Finally I saw this A.M. TCM and Pleasures..Peter O'Toole was great and happy to have been named by the Oscar, & # x201C; glad that Oscar gave him a special award over the past year ... Petula Clark was good when Mrs. Chips, but her character, felt that she was badly written ... Some good songs esp. You & I ... sang from Ms.Clark and later many others recorded, including T.Bennett / S. Bassey & Carmen MacRae .... b & w version was more authentic .. but it's a good movie that is beautifully captured in color and panavision ... enjoyable and worthy of note & Bravo, Mr. O'Toole!
