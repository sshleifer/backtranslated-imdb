Warning: If Coen Brothers or David Lynch define the taste of the film, ignore this review and move on. <br /> <br /> Yes, I borrowed a series of summaries of President Ronald Reagan's book, but among other virtues, this film emphasizes the role that character plays in the lives of respectable people. This film is full of honest, decent people and has honesty. In short, they have a "character." <br /> <br /> Little Nitpick: If you don't know the history of World War II, you probably don't know it, from Captain Correll's arrival to the island until the fall of Mussolini for 3 and a half years. The average viewer may think that romance was a "twist". It is not like that. Romance develops slowly, giving it dignity and meaning. The intentional pace of the film may be the time of the director. <br /> <br /> Some reviews have criticized Cage's Italian accent. My family's Italian-speaking members assure me that his accent is pretty good. <br /> <br /> History was a sign. Yes, the Germans turned to their Italian allies, who were mostly reluctant allies from the beginning. If you find this shocking, remember that the French Mediterranean fleet was blown up by Britain in 1940, just after France's capitulation, so that it would not fall into the hands of the Vichy government, or worse, the Nazis. <br /> <br /> The Italian as an educated and cultured representation was a compliment to educated and cultivated civilization. <br /> <br /> This movie was beautifully photographed and its story was lyrical. The script was neither thought-provoking nor wise, but here was a situation where there was no need for confusion and intelligence, nor were they suitable. <br /> <br /> The story is gentle and the message is exaggerating. The characters are honest, brave, serious, sympathetic and enjoyable. This is a nice little movie. 8/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
