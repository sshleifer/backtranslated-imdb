This movie was played for 7 days at Lexington KYs. I saw it on the last day of my race and regretted that I could not recommend it to others because it is a film that cries out on the big screen experience. An aerial image, where an overcrowded ship pulls out equally out of a crowded dock, is a masterpiece, as well as a scene where two tags appear on the deck - almost ballet and sexier in their recommendation than so many explicit films these days. I just dare to think that most people don't have the chance to see this beautiful movie in the theater; DVD experience is not the same. Here's an idea: if you live in a college town, see if you can show it at the Campaign Film Festival in the lobby.
