It is a classic film that dramatizes the situation of a man who is unable to adapt to the changes in society and is increasingly experiencing alienation leading to violence. Joe is an employee, and he is pleased and angry, and all he needs is an excuse to tie out what the story is. Alone, Joe is quiet; with someone else, he becomes deadly. And what makes Joe's character even cooler is that he rationalizes his violence so that he is not only bad but necessary. For Joe, he designs his violent trends for those he sees as "enemies", and therefore sees himself in war and depicts "generation gap" as a war. But it is war only in Joe's mind, because "the enemy" is his imagination in this case. No one wants to fight Joe, but Joe feels he has to defend himself. Although this film was released in 1970, this message is as important as it was when society continues to undergo major changes that lead to an intensive alienation that the film effectively dramatizes.
