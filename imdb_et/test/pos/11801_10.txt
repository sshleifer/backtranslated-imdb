Let me start by saying that I was very surprised at the value of producing this film. I managed to show early and I have to say that this is the best (if not only) Christian film that hits the theater from Passion. <br /> <br /> Don't let the PG-13 rating scare Rating is relevant because this movie deals with serious problems (divorce, teenage pregnancy, drug use and suicide), but there's nothing free on the film. This is definitely a film the younger group of young people saw without disturbing most of the parents and the message is wonderful. The best part is that it's not a movie for Christians, it's a family movie without cheese. <br /> <br /> The laughs exist and many times everyone in the theater laughed, humor was natural and did not seem like a script or forcibly, and it made a good pace with such a serious film. Teenagers and young adults, both religious and otherwise, are able to detect many, if not all, of the film's characters, and I was surprised to find such films in such films. The plot is not predictable in any way and will eventually get closer to home than many admit. Fortunately, Christians are not being shown, because all the powerful know all that is "Word", but people are just trying to understand life. People make mistakes and nobody is perfect, not even in this movie ... not with a long shot. <br /> <br /> The actor is top-notch, writing on the spot, and you won't hit over to lead all the preaching Christian rhetoric. This is a great movie that makes you and your teenagers think, talk and maybe doubt about their morale (or lack of it). If you want to see a high quality family movie in January, check your local listings for this movie and learn something about yourself. <br /> <br /> And I'm a 25-year-old guy who just wanted to see a free movie.
