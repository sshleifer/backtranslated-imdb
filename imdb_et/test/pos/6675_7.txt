Prot (Kevin Spacey) is a psychiatric hospital patient who claims to be a local K-PAX. His psychiatrist, Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) is trying to help him, of course, trying to understand Proti and find out if he really is K-PAX. <br /> <br /> This movie will not be lost in any genre. One big part of K-PAX is drama / science literature, another part of fantasy, plus, add a dash of comedy and get what K-PAX is. The story (as you can see above) is not too complicated or deep, but it still offers some good twists and plots that may still surprise you. No special effects or graphics have been added to this film, and they are not needed, but the music in the movie is great. The techno soundtrack with a dreadful piano game makes K-PAX sound sci-fi and makes some scenes intriguing. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is the heart of the movie and plays a very convincing alien (Prot) K-PAX, emotional with great facial expressions, makes Spacey a good job. Jeff Bridges is Dr. Powell, who helps and tries to understand. Bridges are also excellent. Bridges and Spacey fit very well and they should both have a lot of experience. Dr. Powell's wife is Rachel Powell, played by Mary McCormack. McCormack plays his part well, showing his disappointment that his wife is lost and committed to his patient. Alfe Woodard plays with Dr. Powell's co-worker Claudia Villars, we don't see Claudia too much, but generally he does well. <br /> <br /> K-PAX is a highly rated PG-13 for violent images, short language and sensuality ‚Äù. As for "violent images", we don't see too much. Some people who have quite a bit of blood but it is all. The language is as follows: 1 "f" word (wow, only one!), 11 "s" words and some useless Lord's name in vain. Not too bad. The part of "sensuality" has been just since Prot explains to Dr Powell how reproduction on K-PAX, something terrible, just something like "has nuts on the contrary." It's not too bad about the content of the PG-13 movie, it could have been a lot worse. <br /> <br /> All in all, K-PAX is not a bad film. It won't hit you, but it's enjoyable and fun to watch. It has some funny parts, sad parts, really sad parts and well what you know. This is the mental hospital patient story you expect? K-PAX is a good movie, a good game for a good drama that can be played back and relaxed. <br /> <br /> Bonus! If you've already seen this movie like it and you think about DVD, I highly recommend it. It has many accessories to review and even alternative end and deleted scenes. 8/10
