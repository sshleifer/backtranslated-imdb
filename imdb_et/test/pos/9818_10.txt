Ettore Scola's masterful epic ministry of the heart deserves a much wider audience. It is worth the successor to the successor of risorgimento, like Vischonti Senso and Il Gattopardo, as well as Rosselini Vanina, Vanini. The 19th century is indeed a fruitful source for Italian filmmakers. Period settings and traps are nicely realized here, but the story is timeless and can occur at any time. This story is so intriguing that the hero gets stuck in a claustrophobic situation where he finds himself a strong object of aspiration, and he is quite impossible to free himself from anxiety. Handsome and callow Giorgio (Giraudeau) is disappointed by his inability to visit his charming but slightly thought-out mistress (Antonelli) and fall victim to the fallen Fosca (D'Obici), his stern superior's ugly and sick daughter (Girotti). The resulting anxiety and the resulting tragedy that this unlikely couple passes will make them both understandable, merciful and extremely sympathetic to the viewers. Bernard Giraudeau's stars bless and leave a lasting impression. Must not be skipped.
