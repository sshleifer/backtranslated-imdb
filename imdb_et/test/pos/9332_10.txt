I'm not a big music video fan. I think music videos remove personal feeling about a particular song. In other words, creative thinking goes out of the window. Similarly, personal feelings aside from MJ, drag aside. It was the best music video of all time. Just wonderful. It was a movie. Yes, people were. Brilliant! You had a fantastic actor, an awesome choreography and an awesome song. It was remarkable. Just a beautiful young woman who is looking for a man, plot a plot, but was she a man or something ominous. Vincent Price did his thing for songs and video. MJ was MJ, enough to talk about it. This song was a video that Jaguar offers for cars. Upper, PERFECTO. Even better, we got real MJ without thousands of facial expressions. Although it is ironically enough, there were more than enough makeup and costumes. People go to Youtube. Take 14 minutes. out of your life and see for yourself what a wonderful work of art is this video.
