Dracula (John Carradine) visits Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens), who believes that everything can be treated with science. He wants Edelamn to treat his vampire - Edelman agrees. Then Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.) will look for treatment to get his werewolf. Thr Frankenstein's monster is discovered too, but doesn't really do anything. <br /> <br /> A very ambitious plot for the 1940s universal horror film. In an attempt to cure monsters by science, it is actually an interesting idea. This film also has beautiful sets (LOVE for a doctor at the palace), tons of atmosphere, is very well targeted (great use of shadows) and has pretty special effects. <br /> <br /> Everything is fine, except Carradine - he's trying, but I couldn't accept him with Dracula. Also, Lionel Atwill plays (as always) playing police commander. It's pretty much forgotten and stupid as a stupid movie, but I think it's very good. It is also the last time that universal monsters were taken seriously - the next film was "Abbott & Costello Meet Frankensteen" in 1948. It's a great movie, but the emphasis is more on comedy. <br /> <br /> The only real mistake here is a lot of plot for 67 minutes and some gaps in logic: Why is Dracula trying to pamper Miliza (Martha O'Driscoll) when being treated? And why (and how) does the doctor get his castle to Frankenstein? However, these are small complaints. Recommended.
