Ich danke Herr Hacke f√ºr den Filme. Mein Deutsch ist nicht gut. Enschuldigen Sie. <br /> <br /> First of all, I did not know how diverse the Istanbul sound is, despite the fact that I live in Turkey. Faith Akin and Alexander Hacke have taken a different approach to Turkish music. saw the music of Istanbul and Istanbul from an alien point of view, giving the true meaning of music. <br /> <br /> In this film, I found how different our (Turkish) culture is to our performers, and how much respect they deserve. Unfortunately, no one has previously served this documentary.
