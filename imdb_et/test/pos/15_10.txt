Like others who have commented on the web, I am 130 pilot on Coast Guard. Having said that I am a skeptic, I was expecting the factors of over-cheese. There was cheese, but there wasn't much .. and the movie was pretty accurate. <br /> <br /> I looked at the trailer again today. After seeing the movie yesterday, I realized that the trailer had the impression that the movie was nothing but salvation after the rescue scenes. It is not like that. <br /> <br /> Film is really more of a character / story that is run as an action. The internal struggles both Costner and Kutcher deal with. Kutcher is being portrayed as a movie as Costner. <br /> <br /> Of course there is a little love story. But to a large extent, the film speaks of two lives that come together, and for some time to help each other treat old wounds. <br /> <br /> Like a girlie like it sounds, Costner and as much as I try not to like her, Kutcher really works quite well and compliments each other very well in the movie. <br /> <br /> As critics have said, you've seen it before .. Top Gun, Officer Gentlemen, and so on. But what's not a million times the movie. <br /> <br /> I only remember one spoken word. Film <br /> <br /> Some people may tend to end a bit long. <br /> <br /> You laugh, you can cry, but I can honestly say it was worth $ 4, which I paid. <br /> <br /> I hope you enjoy the movie.
