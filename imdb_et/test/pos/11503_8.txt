This movie is fabulous without stories. It is a pure experience where music conceals a visual impression. - Words, of course, are not enough to express what should be expressed, but it is a requirement of preaching classes that speaks of what has been entered into the production lines of mediocrity and thus necessary to express some sensible thinking or opinion about what should not be broken. Therefore, these detailed opinions are presented to satisfy the empty thoughts that have to be filled with noise that you can't find when you try it out in the movie.
