Work Girl Kitty (Sothern) works with Bill (Kelly), who leaves her careless in her garage for long hours to save money on her marriage. After her birthday, Kitty will continue her double date / blind date, where she will meet with the department store successor Bob Hartwell (Hamilton). She falls in love, but leaves her when her love protests seem to cover her desire to be her lover rather than her wife. The believers Bill rally around to comfort him, and eventually give his repeated prayers to resume his engagement, partly pushing Bill's support for his family after losing his job. But when Bob returns, but is convinced that she wants marriage, does Kitty follow her heart or conscience? <br /> <br /> This movie was much better than I thought it would be. At the beginning of Bill, it appears as a loud comic Irish man who was so often played by Jack Carson. But Kelly (and the script) puts the character in real compassion and love, and Bill turns out to be the best in the group. Viewers can find him caught up in the revelation of Hartwell! But the tone of the film is between the dusky romanticists and the much darker side, especially when depicting the dance marathon and the rather terrible accident in Bill's garage. <br /> <br /> Cast has been rounded by a trusted Jane Darwell, the mother of Kitty, an unpleasant but not yet very reluctant Mickey Rooney as Kitty's younger brother, and Spencer Charters, like Kitty's non-parent father.
