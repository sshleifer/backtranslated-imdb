This is one of my favorite "Capra-esque" comedies. This film is simply meant to be enjoyed, not deconstructed, microscopically analyzed. This is not a religious comment. This is fun. It's fantasy. Surprisingly negative comments (IMHO) reflect the level of expectation that professional film critics have led us to think it must be part of every film. <br /> <br /> Others have described Travolta's role (this is why you watch the movie over and over) and a great backlight (including Sparky!). <br /> <br /> Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar; sometimes the movie is just fun. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
