Hehehe. It was one of the best funny traffic movies! I laughed so I fell out of the chair. Many Norwegian and foreign celebrities play with themselves. Harald Zwart is a producer of well-known films such as Agent Cody banks and of course one night on McCool's. <br /> <br /> It is about Norwegian crazy fans who go to the world of football football in Germany in 2006. Crazy fun that comes with it. It was fun. I couldn't finish laughing. I have not had such an age. Rumors say it's another, but I don't know. It's hard. <br /> <br /> Recommended for everyone! It's a movie's sight. I thought I could see it in the cinema, but I had a job at the time it was shown. And you tried to rent it for a month, but you rented it all the time. I got it today on DVD. Well worth it.
