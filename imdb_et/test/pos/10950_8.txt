Lotsa action, cheesy love story, unexpected actors and general fun. A special effect is acceptable / decent, some struggles are fun with some interesting acrobatic moves. The general story is moving along and there is enough cheesy that you don't know when the inevitable happens though there is a bit of twisting (just a little). The overall naivety of the film makes it occasionally vivid. Also cute enough chicks, the more you want. PS. When you look at such a movie, try to watch it by the category that the movie falls (not necessarily if it was down). ie don't bombard good hair movies!
