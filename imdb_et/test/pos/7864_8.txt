Combining the Western and Gothic Death Conventions, and often targeting it as an art film, is one of Siegel's and Eastwood's best collaboration. <br /> <br /> Eastwood plays a Yankee soldier who, after being wounded during the Civil War, is staying in a segregated southern seminar for young women. Get out of the world, women design their romantic fantasies for her and react to frantic, male manipulation. But jealousy and resentment raise their heads and they find themselves cruel in the world of revenge. And the boy is a brutal revenge. <br /> <br /> Bruce Surteese beautifully captured and carefully paced, "The Beguiled" is a haunting, elegant work that seems to affect Eastwood's own "Play Misty Me" and "Tight". <br /> <br /> Film is an appealing imagination of gender-based battles and dreams of horror and sexuality. All the characters are ambiguous, showing both good and evil qualities, leaving us the opportunity to choose who we should root. <br /> <br /> Don Siegel left a very fine legacy of movies. Everything from "inviting body snatchers" to "dirty Harry". But although his early black and white images are well outdated, most of his color films seem sharp, dated and poorly captured. His sharp "realism" must have seemed fresh and kinetic 40 years ago, but today, I just don't think they have stood the test of time. <br /> <br /> "The Beguiled", but in a different league. Mature, ambiguous and harshly fired, it's a shame that it's no longer known. While evolving technology and technology have transformed most of Siegel's harsh, masculine thrillers into obsolete, "The Beguiled" is now entering its surrealistic atmosphere and unique theme. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10 - Better than the "Black Narcissus" themed, I think Siegel is the best movie. Part of the horror, part of the drama, part of the sexual odyssey, "The Beguiled" is a surprisingly beautiful movie (especially when considering that Siegel looked at his films, quoting, "meaningless"). Much of the film's artistry is due to Clint Eastwood, who from that moment on tries to choose mature material.
