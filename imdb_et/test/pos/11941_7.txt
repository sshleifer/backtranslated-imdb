Peter Coyote was the only name I listed on the list, so I didn't see it despite the movie. The only comment on IMDb was positive, so I watched it late in the T.V. I recommend this movie as a good late night. It's better than this genre. The plot is great, it's not brilliant, but it's not bad. I usually don't like a setback, but in this movie they work. As I have said, I didn't know any of the cast names, but I knew Michele Lee, who gave a decent and reliable report as a woman who wants her husband to lie to her. Anyway, he wears it very well. Note: You can enjoy it more if you forget your credit in the first few seconds. I did and it helped me. When you see the final credit, you get what I mean by a Wayne Kennedy character who is really weird, it takes 7, not 6.
