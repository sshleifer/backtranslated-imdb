Ignore the bad comments here, this movie is awesome! Just before Dawn is a great example of what can be done with a minimal budget film if you have a dedicated team, a decent script and a cool movie idea. This is great fun for hell. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it more than most of the 80 slashers because the killer is so unique. "The wrong move" ripped out this movie harshly! There's a lot of blood and scares. My girlfriend was overwhelmed and she looks at me almost everything and doesn't hit me. It's terrible for that. <br /> <br /> I would say "Just before Dawn" is the best creator of the early 80s. I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 kids.
