I have to say that this is the best movie I've ever seen. I know that this website has only received negative comments, but if I would like to be a good person who gives the world a good overview of the best film. I think the film is extremely funny and has the perfect mix. it makes me feel all kinds of emotions when I look at it, and I don't get enough of it. the tracks are great. I love it, I understand why people may not love it as much as I do, but I don't understand how people hated it. The film is 100% shiny. The dumb is amazing. I have never realized that Aussie films could be so good, and I didn't think I could watch one movie, so many times in one day without getting sick of it. I think everyone should watch it, whether it should know what life was on the younger days, or if it sees what it is for you when you reach the end of the year.
