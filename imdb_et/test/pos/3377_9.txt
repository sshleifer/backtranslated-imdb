I wanted to look at it to get an internal look at the show. That's the story of Robin Williams, then Mork & Mindyst. However, I thought it was great. We have to see, Robin is always "on", no matter what. Diamontopolous performance was fantastic. <br /> <br /> Introducing the main players seems so real to me. Roebuck as Garry Marshall was wonderful. He was so charming in it that helped me get the whole Williams energy through. Behind the scenes was the pieces of his other exhibitions (Happy Days and Laverne & Shirley). I also thought that Richmond-Peck Harvey was a nice stone in the pond. (It's a good thing). <br /> <br /> This movie talks about the age-old story of Hollywood people going through stardom highs and lows. It kept me glued to my TV, and I learned to love Robin, well in hell, mostly it seems that everyone is the super people I sometimes think of for Hollywood. Go to the figure. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you don't know why people in the network have always been idiots. We never saw an ABC manager. I just heard him like Charlie Charlie from Angels (I don't know if it's so planned?). It looks so sad that Exhibition 1, which may be so destroyed by your network. <br /> <br /> I think this story could tell someone's life when they climb any ladder of work. So many people always love or hate a movie and a TV star to grow up, just want to get back to your past to remember your past. I remember watching the viewing and always wondering what would happen in their personal life. <br /> <br /> Mork and Mindy are always my part and I saw some of them. It may not all be the truth, it is not all wrong, but in the end he told me a strange, happy story.
