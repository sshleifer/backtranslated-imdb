It was an exciting story that was expected. FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY takes us to the trials and the attacks of heavy groups, where American top scientists gave a lofty task during World War II: to beat everyone else on the atomic bomb. In a heavily guarded New Mexico community, brainstorms are slowly turning from the idea of ​​an ambitious concept to a huge reality. <br /> <br /> FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY is one of those films that needs your attention. This is a true film of the human being, not only in the seemingly impossible scientific aspect of weapon development, but also in the moral consequences of contributing to mass destruction. There is a constant storm between this reality and the American war time commitment. The film will never be talked about, leaving us the freedom to admire the enormity of the inner confusion of these men. Performances also deserve a special reputation. Paul Newman performs one of his great, underrated performances, such as General Pattonesque, who is responsible for the alliance's attachment to the extremely high. <br /> <br /> When FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY lose much of their traction, it is an unnecessary romantic component. As a research team leader, Dwight Schultz fights for his love for his family and his relentless obsession with his big project. Apparently, director Roland Joffe felt the need to study the more human corners of this story, but the romantic recordings are primarily disturbed. Moreover, it is the communication between scientists and their military hierarchy, which gives us the greatest insight into the thoughts and feelings of these wonderful men. <br /> <br /> However, it is hard not to recommend FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY. This is largely a forgotten pearl that makes one's face one of the most intriguing stories in human history.
