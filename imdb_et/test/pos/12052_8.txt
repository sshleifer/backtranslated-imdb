I've never seen a Bollywood movie, but I got it for the first ten minutes, I laughed foolishly and pressed the Sky + button R. I'm glad I did! I hope I do not blame anyone (because it is basically BF and I loved it!), But we didn't get it as seriously as the actors - especially obsessed (who I understand is a big Bollywood star because we've seen him on many DVDs -d on the cover since I saw him today in Hamleys! BF continues with this hat - I'm gonna think he's obsessed! Traditionally a good look is the hero of the movie! But then we're movies that aren't predictable for your stock Hollywood Price). <br /> <br /> It was completely up but really fun. If all Bollywood movies are such, let's look more. I've had this Bloomin song all week long and I can't speak Hindi! PS recommendations would be appreciated!
