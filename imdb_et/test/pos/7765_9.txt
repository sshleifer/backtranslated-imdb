This is my favorite film that depicts African Americans in a completely different light. because it shows the different sides of African Americans that it is not shown in films. it is not about gangs, ghetto ghettos, or dealing with deep racial problems, it occupies the very essence of youth and tries to be successful and has problems with shooting its guards and coping with someone's life and the whole bohemian atmosphere gives this great touch that does all this great, great a script for a great dialogue that will fascinate you and you just do it. perfect casting with great chemistry and great performance and i still haven't seen any other black characters that are portrayed in this format, but one that is near is "sprung" but since his comedy loses it very quickly i give this movie Of 10 out of 10, I wish they would make movies of this type of attitude to African Americans
