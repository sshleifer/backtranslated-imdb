Driving The critically acclaimed film writer, Mr Brown and Charlotte Gray, bring Jeremy Brock to the heartfelt driver, featuring Julie Walters and Laura Linney, Academy Award nominees, and the Rupert Grint series by Harry Potter. The beautiful portrait speaks of the story of Ben Marshall (Rupert Grint), a 17-year-old boy being held in the heart of his religious neurotic mother Laura (Laura Linney). After the end of her school year she decides to work wisely, freely in a strange and "heavy bottle" retired actor Evie Walton (Julie Walters). The couple starts the fun adventures of camping to walk around the block in simple conversations about life. Competing with the dominant mother, as well as on each other's way, make two beautiful ties that revolutionize their lives. </p>. Brock uses her unique style to create the infamous and loving nature that the directors only dreamed for the first time. Leadership comes naturally to Brock when he builds stunning that covers the surfaces and puts the viewer behind a surplus of worship and creation. Even the fine results of the unknown composers Clive Carroll and John Renbourne reveal the tone and the way Brock had no problems with the generation. <br /> <br /> Laura Linney always makes her own movie characters when she does it "Laaks". Dear and overwhelming mother is sometimes unbearable and at Linney we are with this person. The complexity of his character could not be imagined by anyone else. Rupert Grint interrupts "Ron Weasley" and tries someone new. His performance is more sensitive than lush, but Grint gives us someone who is brand new to enjoy the child's performance and viewer. But this is the Oscar-nominated actor Julie Walters, who gives Evie her own life. Although the role is clearly leading, Walters organizes a better support category where I believe he can just take the prize home. "Evie" is a mixture of "Clementine Kruczynski" and "Mrs Laura Henderson" with a free spirit and a loving person. Hopefully his prize will not help this prize season. <br /> <br /> Driving is not an experience from "this world" but good, enjoyable, which every viewer could simply capture and learn a little about life, love and friendship, in the most beautiful colors and sizes. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** / ****
