The plot of this film has been adopted in the history of mankind for the most terrible war: the violent clash between Adolf Hitler and Germany and the Soviet Russia in 1941 - 45. <br /> <br /> The western part of their country has been extensively destroyed and 20â€“30 million Russian people died, and this conflict can be felt in Russia until today. Not to mention in 1957 when the memories were still very fresh and painful. <br /> <br /> This very black device is very inconsistent with the fine and uniform style of the beautiful images of Letjat zhuravli. Its simple story deals with human behavior during the war: bravery, love, patriotism, weakness, reasoning, and corruption. Everything is beautifully connected to the toy-squirrel. <br /> <br /> Give it a really great performance and it's easy to see why this movie is so famous. Really, one of the best ever made. <br /> <br />
