In some scenes, Rain People, Francis Ford Coppola's predecessor on his 1970s anniversary, is a sign of a similar situation with the 1969 Easy Rider, but not exactly the same reference frame. Here is the drama of people separated from society, in some ways alienated by choices or with one or another meaning of boundaries. This is one of those rare original dramas where some scenes are separated. Even with such a low-string budget and a very free-to-film attitude, Coppola can capture everything that needs to be compared between their clearly defined characters and curves, unexpected single-digit degrees. without other helplessness or vice versa, or both. And, as can be seen, it is very much the splitting of the suburban life of the 1960s, it has the above mentioned escapism of the film, but more specific, almost timeless quality with drama and the underlying problems. . In a sense, if Bergman were a quasi-guerrilla 20-something filmmaker on the route to get the strange truths of outsiders, it might be so. <br /> <br /> But with all the very direct and sometimes all the participants are self-conscious with photography (albeit with a more documented approach, sometimes similar to undefined characters). Shirley Knight, an actor I do not know, has a complex and divergent role in running a pregnant woman, a sort of existentialist way of living there. There is some frightening action on her side, and one of my favorites (if not my favorite) is when she's on the phone for the first time calling her husband. Such a tense scene at both ends and in any small gesture and so much talk about him is so little. It's extraordinary in a way that reflects others in Coppola movies. Then James comes to Caan's "killer" character. It is also a dangerous nature to take, as it is a combination of childish confusion and fun memories. Think of Forrest Gump if he doesn't do it with football and spirit. It's one of his best, being the most minimalist - a boy who usually plays tough guys in movies, here's one story and part of Knight's character. Robert Duvall as a policeman with a tough side and a squared past is also a very good supporting role; a sort of early sample with other defective characters, which he later plays during his career. <br /> <br /> So the characters, and what Coppola is risking about creating their inconvenience, is actually a movie, just like any story, it is certainly not solved in the usual way you might think or expect. The last ten minutes are similar to others in Coppola's work, where specific tragedies on all sides are subject to their emotional and psychological consequences, which it leaves to the principles to be sublime and sad. It is brave for its time in what is trying to be represented (both in freedom and in defects and ambiguities). The style of the picture adds to it all the fragmented views that have quick setbacks that are graphic and independent, in contrast to longer shots in some important scenes. This is the film of the film, but its work was much more than that of another filmmaker who had less chance of accepting the nature of these side effects. One of the best films of 1969.
