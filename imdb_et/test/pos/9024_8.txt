It's a great movie of pure entertainment, nothing more and no less. This is an enjoyable and dimly sensitive film. <br /> <br /> A minor, yet irritating, film is that we don't know why Justine and Chas broke down. Okay, most of the first relationships don't work for one reason or another, but they seemed more or less a pleasant couple. <br /> <br /> In short, it's worth watching out of reality.
