I also saw this movie when it first came out. I was a teenager at the same time and I saw it with my girlfriend who later became my wife. I remember that the movie made me feel that the winnings could be won. Cinematography was very well done when the memory serves me right. The boy was a little much, but the girl was very interesting. I thought it was very romantic and it could have been my girlfriend for the first time. I have not seen this movie and I wander why he's gone. I'd like to see it again to see if it was as good as I remember. Elton John's soundtrack was great.
