It would be nice if the debate on this medium-length film was to start a short story about the hypocrisy of Hollywood people. It was in 1988 when Chuck Norris saw this film at Cannes International Film Festival. He made a silly remark, saying that meaningless killing in Dekalog 5 is much more effective than the killings filmed in his Hollywood movies with him as a strong stadium. He spoke of an innocent taxi driver whose face in Kieslowski's film is a cruelly disgruntled psychopath who is brutally hit by a big stone. Violence and its perpetrators should not be fully justified in a dignified human society. This is why Chuck Norris's statement seems to be a cruel joke that protects violent means in a society that is growing troubled. An honest reviewer does not make a mistake when he claims that Kieslowski's film "Decalog: Decalog, Piec (# 1.5)" has universal connections. The events shown in Decalog 5 can take place anywhere in the world. The best lesson Kielowski gives us is about the levels of violence acceptable in a fair society. This is why the brutal killing of an innocent cab driver can cause a feeling of reluctance in us. We do not feel the same hatred for killing when it appears in films with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris and Jean Claude Van Damme as they seem too artificial. easily understand that special effects and modern studio techniques can charm only toddlers, but there is no point in serious film enthusiasts.Kieslowski also crafts helpless man to rescue fellow creatures from ties to death and misery.It is particularly interesting because time and time again is proven to be strict laws and capital sanctions have failed to prevent killing.
