finally, a film that deals with the likelihood of aliens visiting a suitable depth and loving warmth. just in case we are not alone, I believe these visitors are just too tourists who take care of us or give it a whole lot of anthropocentric graves as a stable proof of their existence. we would not interfere in the battlefields of some irritated desert tribes, unless we don't want to confuse our travel insurance, hey? <br /> <br /> anyway, the film depicts the transition of a tired spirit. by a higher unit. it happens to be quite remarkable and rather unknown, but we are dealing with the film here, right? So prot's hospitalization is just a trigger plot. <br /> <br /> Jeff bridges work perfectly as usual, but spacey is fun. it seems the role is customized, convincing and lovingly "crazy". eating unripe bananas, sitting in a tree, giving your doctor a hard time, wisdom and (most importantly) stunning. they made me thoughts and philosophies for hours. <br /> <br /> This is an encouraging movie, at least to say, and the Edward Shearmer soundtrack is just beautiful. just go and get a copy. catch a ray of light. now.
