I don't think I've ever seen a better movie parody. Mel Brooks is crazy. Every time I watch it, I find something new and it makes it even more fun than before. Cary Elwes is perfect for Robin Hood's role. It has a huge and unexpected end that will leave you bursting. Every person is small from John and the Will of Maid Marian and Broomhild. I laughed all the way and never get tired of it. Check it out! <br /> <br /> If you liked Cary Elwes in this movie, be sure to see The Princess Bride.
