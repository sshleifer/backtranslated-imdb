I believe that the story has two angles, first, it is a satirical view of the world, presented in a clear way in Kafkaesque, emphasizing a striking vision behind some of the most common but also pleasant or comfortable moments and elements that are usually enough to keep people in society . Like: good job, good home, good woman, good car and even good lover. In addition to this so-called ordinary bliss, some have no help with uncomfortable issues such as where they come from, or the weather where they may have some other bliss, the weather may be the reason they are or the weather may be something they are missed, or even more unhappy, the weather could be something the system itself adheres to. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the most interesting aspect of this movie, I believe, is that it is attacking this natural compulsion to unfold the world around us, questioning it on the basis of our personal judgment and usually condemning it because it doesn't not better for us because it is not tailored for the person we are looking for. <br /> <br /> The insignia behind the train accident believe that our own will can be overcome by destiny or any other universal power, even in our so-called power, to decide when we want. Instead, one can trigger a person because of this greater power (we call it the SYSTEM because the authors clearly avoid being called God, perhaps further emphasizing that the SYSTEM is made by MAN and therefore man can manage it differently from FATE. a concept closer to religion under its own conditions, not by killing him, but by showing him that there is a place for a person who asks / wants too much, assuming that true fulfillment does not come from outside the world, but from within and when the outside world "decides" to give Uncomfortable, but it makes you transform into some existential issues that have become the mainstream of the last century, as one can make in an increasingly drained, consumer-oriented world where one can switch without without changing the larger image, but only as long as it has some for the system good luck.
