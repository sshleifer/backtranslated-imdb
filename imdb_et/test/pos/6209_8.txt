Preston Sturgis' POWER AND GLORY was invisible to the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it appeared again and even appeared on television. Meanwhile, it became famous because Pauline Kael's CITIZEN WOMAN proposed that Herman Mankiewicz-Orson Welles' KANE manuscript be based on the Sturgis scenario. As mentioned at the beginning of the movie thread on the IMDb website, Kael reviewed his case. <br /> <br /> There are about six narrators involved in the life of Charles Foster Kane. (represents the Ralston - Henry Luce clone), Thatcher's memories, Bernstein, Jed Leland, Susan Alexander Kane and Raymond. Each of them has its own slopes in Kane that reflect their faith or disappointment or hatred. And, of course, everyone also has their own shortcomings when they speak the story of Kane. This method also leads to the duplication of the same incident. <br /> <br /> It's not POWER and GLORY. Yes, like KANE, it is a legendary business leader - here is Tom Garner (Spencer Tracy), a man who came from below to lead the country's most successful rail system. But there are only two narrators - they are Henry (Ralph Morgan), the right-hand man of Garner, and his wife (Sarah Padden). It limits the almost three-dimensional view we get in Garner at Kane. Henry, when he tells, talks to his superior and friend whom he honored and loved. His wife is like the voice of a skeptical public - he only sees Henry's mistakes. <br /> <br /> A typical example: While he was working his way, Tom will become more anti-labor in later years. Trade unions are worrying and they do not care that their relatives slow down. Henry describes Tom's confrontation with the union on a great walk and how he made him worse at home. But Henry's wife reminds her of how Tom used the stroke and violence to end the strike (apparently bursting the headquarters of the Union - killing many people). So we have two views of a man, but one is pure white and one is pure black. <br /> <br /> I don't really hit POWERI AND GLORY to repeat KANE's success (some movies - including all the authors of Orson Welles' other films), but I am aware that this story is well presented keep yourself in the interests. And thanks to Tracy and Colleen Moore as his wife Sally's performances, a few earthly successes bring the tragedy home completely. <br /> <br /> When they get married, Tom wants to (part of) do well. Give her husband and their family the benefits she never got. But in America, big business is a successful price. Tom is closely involved in the management of the railway empire (he is expanding it and improving it constantly). But it takes her too much away from home and loses contact with Sally. And she also notes Eve (Helen Vinson), a younger woman who gets her mistress. When Sally learns about her unfaithful behavior, she destroys her. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Tom gets a shock (which makes him a martyr in Henry's eyes). Eve marries Tom and introduces her to her son - but Tom's son Tom Jr. (Philip Trent) is Eve's son. Detecting this bleeding causes Tom to be. <br /> <br /> Film is not a complete success - the action jumps from time to time convincingly. However, this makes the business real (mark the scene when Tom tells his board about his plans to buy a small rivalry, and he will discuss the use of bonds to finance plans). Sturg came from a wealthy background so he could bring such a detail. So it's usually a first-rate film. Maybe CITIZEN KANE is not interesting for film students as a business reality test with social commentary on Depression in America.
