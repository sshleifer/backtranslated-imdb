A film such as Crossfire puts another movie that is spreading around this social consciousness - the recent film Crash - almost shame. Not necessarily because both of them make their message of intolerance much more important (although I would make Crash throw it much thicker than a hammer), but because storytelling and races never get much like Crash. Perhaps they need not be compared, as Crossfire is all in the heart of a deep noir vein as out of style. In fact, it was interesting to see what director Edward Dmytryk said in a DVD interview where he stated that the budget for photography was much lower (by purpose) so that participants could spend more and the schedule went through a very fast and fast pace. But what then becomes incredible in the picture is that you think you are looking at the many lighting devices you needed to do a lot. Just for a small scene, such as when Robert Mitchum Keeely first goes to Captain Robert Young, the contrast of shadows in the room is smooth. The fact that there are many other illumination devices that go so little further marks it as something important for the appearance of the younger period. Just look at the picture of the staircase, the bars depicted against them, and see what I mean. <br /> <br /> But back to the movie's content - it's really a story that consists of a mystery of murder, but what we don't take as an audience takes a lot of time. It is then something other than a sense of murder and a soul that is not found in a common criminal image, because the film does not contain 'criminals'. This is a very calculated risk that the characters may be too thin to support the (worthy) message of anti-Semitism. But with Dmytryk's uppermost shelf, along with John Paxton's truly fantastic script, marks the characters, at least what they shouldn't be too thin next to the message. And what about a noir without it to go with it? Mitchum even helps in this, even in the scenes between him and Young, where it is largely based on the current state of the story (i.e. in detail on the plot), injecting some of the dialogue somewhat secretly. It may already be on the lines, but it helps to change the character of your scene on the right side. <br /> <br /> Then there is Robert Ryan, who is a prominent man at Montgomery, whom you know, like a lot at the beginning, just his bs behavior, but you're not entirely sure. When it begins to show ironically the subjective point of view of the suspect Mitchell (George Cooper) in the soon-dead Samuelside apartment, his performance becomes a great balancing factor, full of crap and also frightening in his dark direction. This is a good result if you also fight with Cooper, who has real personal issues with which he faces and condemns and humiliates. It really is after the movie ends up thinking a lot about it and while watching a movie it is more about dialogue and scene flow, and sometimes in the tough surprising cameras the participants are moving, so the message is different. Not that it does not matter, especially during the time period (coming immediately after WW2), but years later we saw actors, even those who do not get a big customer status like Gloria Grahame Ginnyna (femme fatale if she had time for it) what he has not done) and William Phipps as Leroy ("hick") who work out of each other, which sticks to a strongly compressed scenario. <br /> <br /> Dmytryk is also very wise to limit the musical score, because in the case of very long stretches, there is nothing to hear and most of the time, when it occurs, it is characteristic. He could have done just as well with some musical notes about some dramatic scenes that are particularly important, especially to the audience of the movie. With this in mind and getting the right attitudes and nuances in the camera and casting, it raises the standards of genre materials to a very subtle, memorable level. My favorite scene probably goes to Finley's story of an Irish immigrant to whom he speaks to Leroy, where all such elements are well-placed. It may not be very high at the top of my favorite characters - and I would still kill the murder of My Sweet as a director in such a picture, but it is definitely a higher quality than anything in B-level.
