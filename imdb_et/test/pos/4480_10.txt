The truly strange short story of Honore De Balzac, on which it is loosely based, can be astonished, albeit incredibly filmed, as treatment for banned love flowers between man and beast in the early nineteenth century. Thin and very blonde English actor Ben Daniels plays a role as a young soldier during the Napoleonic Wars, who is lost when he sent out the (?) French painters in the desert of Gobi. After literally circulating, the two men never give up trying to get back to civilization, so that everyone decides (against better case law) that they will go their way with the promise that both will return to the exact place where and when the water source is actually found. This is, of course, how Daniel's character arrives with a creature (a wild and untrained female leopard) and eventually forms a seemingly unbreakable bond or rather a love, so that both save their lives and almost destroy this film. Amazing cinematography, a minimalist dialogue, a somewhat demented story, supposedly suggesting potential creativity in about three scenes, is what leads professional critics to put the film in contempt and for a long time. Although it is a movie that is not quite pleasing to everyone, I find it a fine, albeit firmly left-wing blend of fantasy and surrealist atmosphere, highlighted by the fact that more than half of the flick actor Ben Daniels is forced to submit a reverse wild animal (four leopards were actually used, not just one), which common sense and small theater theaters dictate that it must be crazy and very hard work that he managed to pull out quite brilliantly when you ask me! In general, I think "passion in the wilderness" takes time to warm up, but if you are a patient ready to give him some time, it will actually give you a unique original spell, despite everything; and unlike most of the platonic relationships between humans and animals, he does not have to talk about a pig, a monkey or a shaggy dog ​​to keep in touch. (***** out of *****)
