This is a beautifully filmed film that questions the future of all indigenous peoples, especially the nomadic tribes. Focusing on Tibetan Saltmen, the film is moving at a pace that can make some Western viewers uncomfortable. For some people, life will continue at the same rate that has been for thousands of years. This film follows a group of tribes in an annual two-month search for salt. Their tribe lives their lives traditionally (slowly according to modern standards) and always takes their many gods into account. This is a remarkable film that retains part of what may, unfortunately, change from history. It takes time. Don't hurry when you see it.
