I appreciate it on the film's curve, in other words, it's not the biggest film ever made, but it does exactly what it anticipated. This is a great T&A film. I have no idea how many T's or A's in this movie, but I saw one picture that had 16 naked T's at once to give you an idea. Everything is all topless girls. There's a wet T-shirt competition. And the climax includes a football match between two football teams and each time a score drops the entire opposing team, losing one of the fabrics. I don't know why this is so low here. Perhaps the people who gave it thought they saw Citizen Kane. I love this movie and hope to find more similar. If you are looking for a good campy R&D movie, I would recommend it.
