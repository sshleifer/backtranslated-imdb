Much has been said about this film and its importance for film language design. If you are interested in film history to truly understand innovations, Eisenstein brings to the media that you might want to try to look at Potemkin over most of the films made before (good contrast to D. Griffith). It should be allowed that Eisenstein was not the only assembly theorist and that the principles of editing editing would probably have been discovered at another time. However, even today, some leaders have turned to the skill that Eisenstein, with a combination of images, brought to mind in the evolution of the center at such an early stage. <br /> <br /> If you don't want this sort of thing, Potemkin is still one of the most beautiful and moving movies. You should see, buy and dance on your chest.
