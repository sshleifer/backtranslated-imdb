After visiting the Kimbell Museum in Texas, the United States, Forth-Worth, enjoying art and architecture (including the neighboring contemporary art museum) and enjoying a pleasant conversation with a professional bookstore, did I buy the expectations of this rather high DVD? and it was not the least disappointed. <br /> <br /> The thematic approach, dramatic tension, exposing interviews, archive material, and stunning architecture are also blended into unified health to explore the late iconic life of Louis I. Khan. . <br /> <br /> The documentary begins: contemplative playing of classical music, archives scanned on a reflective shady face, blurred letters that refer symbolically to a train window that passes through the background landscape? journey, focus and focus, the search ends with an article in the newspaper. Nathanial Khan reads from the New York Times front page, where her father is praised at the same time for the best American architect and her death was announced. <br /> <br /> "When I first read this obituary, I have to admit that I was looking for my name. I was also his child, his only son. I didn't know my father very well. Never married to my mother and he didn't He lived with us (?) He died when I was eleven. "<br /> <br /> So many years later, this illegitimate son was still haunted by unclear fragmented thoughts and feelings about his father, who seems to be a great professional and public figure but who secret personal life escapes from him and affects him at the point where he intends to do something about it. <br /> <br /> "For years I tried to be happy with the small pieces of my father's life that I have been allowed to see, but it was not enough, I have to know him, I need to know who he really was. what was left of him, would take me to the other side of the world, looking for a man who left me with so many questions. ‚Äù<br /> <br /> The documentary is two - in case of a slow systematic discovery of a world-class architect, we know: 1) his idea , buildings and architectural perspectives; and 2) his families, co-workers, people's life and human perspective <br /> The DVD also provides an overview of the writer / director Q&A and additional material containing such great quotes from Louis I. Khan as "All what everyone is saying is the truth. This is their truth. It may not be factual. "And" A good idea that does not happen is not at all thought. "<br /> <br /> This movie is a discovery trip. Detecting and discovering a person, a great person, but a human being imperfect, like all of us, we feel him in the eyes of a adorable and slightly bitter son, but with openness and objectivity to really explore Without a simple conclusion and undecided. <br /> With the main interviews with people with different abilities, we have slowly put some pieces together until this final interview with this man from Bangladesh, who really seems to bring it back with domestic and reasonable comments. /> <br /> Great architect, brilliant documentary.
