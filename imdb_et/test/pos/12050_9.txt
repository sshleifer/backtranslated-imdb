Pertty Kiran returns home after graduation. He has a nice charisma that always drew men to him. Sunil Malhotra, a daring fucking naval worker, is one such guy. She loves her deeply and even deals with marriage. Another person who is crazy and loves Kirrrran is happy. Kiran has never met with Pleasure, but Rahu would kill anyone coming between him and Kiran. So when it comes to knowing that Kiran is in love with Sunni, what does he do? Will he kill him or he will be punished for the devil himself.
