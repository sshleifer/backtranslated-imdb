It's the ultimate and I mean ULTIMATE, ADVENTURE CLASSIC! The plot is good and bad. There have always been numerous films depicting gray areas, and not enough basic good against evil to take into account real good evils in the real world. Only recently have filmmakers tried even probability. In real life, more than half of the situations are black and white, but only a fraction of the movies seem so. This film is the best example of back and white appearance. This is best seen in black and white. The hero is in a worse situation. He is in the territory of the person who wants to kill him and the different enemies. The film gives the feeling that it is hopelessly a surplus and cannot guess the aid. His enemy (number) has many resources. The woman of the county was married to her and she knows from her early history that sooner or later she will kill when she does all her wives. He and the hero become allies and fall in love, which could win everyone by looking (if that person just doesn't want to be the opposite brat). Anyone who helps them is killed. They have no escape. The situation is hopeless. Will they finally survive? You don't think if you haven't read the spoiler. The film also has a lot of good atmosphere, adventure and intrigue with Lon Chaney as a bad man and Boris Karloff in his best role as a decent man. Usually Karloff was the best guy when he presented such more complex roles as this one. Chaney was rarely given a difficult role, though he put a couple of films on his stuff, such as "Mice and Men." It's a little more than his pulpit. However, there is no tension ever. Everything is intercourse and danger. Perfectly written, completely cast and perfectly targeted. That is what should be a pure escape, pure adventure.
