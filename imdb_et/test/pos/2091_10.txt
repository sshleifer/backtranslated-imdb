When a bomber, a patriot, a pornographic, and a mad cyclist, along with various other social contaminants, have experienced enough of their ** infected cell, they mark the rat and look for a hole. Escape from the waste water group of 9 groups, take advantage of your new found freedom and lead civilization. What will soon follow is not surprising. Followed by total chaos and terror. It seems everyone has some unfinished business to take care of. <br /> <br /> Of course, the great escape is based on 9 SOULI, which is still 5 of the best films. Driving right for about 2 hours 9 SOULS brings the story so powerful that it literally breathes. The beautiful but subtle uses of the sides of the bright countries add to the anticipated realism of this story. The vision of the director Toshiaki Toyoda (blue spring, Porno Star) is completely outrageous when he applies damage to the characters. As soon as each character grabs his dreams, it is as fast as they are torn. Now, not only should the director's shoulder be responsible for the success of this film, but props should also go to the actors. This movie was full of great, top down. Ryuhei Matsuda (son of Miyuki Matsuda of Audition) gives a stellar performance and seems to bring some of his mothers on the screen. <br /> <br /> I also need to support Artsmagic DVD. This is the sixth movie of the movies I've seen now, and it looks like every DVD is better and better. Sound quality is perfect and picture; clean and crisp. It's very annoying trying to look too dark for a movie, so their feline discs are nice. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that the movie will soon become a masterpiece status for viewers around the world. Keep an eye on 9 SOULI in 2005; this is really an amazing movie.
