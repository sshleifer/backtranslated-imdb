It's hard to find in a fast-food society that we live in such a way that a man named Hitch is required to help men to love women that they are extremely in love. his rules are that he only helps you to find love and not just some random sex that seems a lot, but soon begins to spread the word and people start to get the wrong idea of ​​what he is doing, which makes it difficult for relationships with a woman just met that he is crazy in love. <br /> <br /> - I have to say it's really nice to see Will Smith in a movie that doesn't try to save him from aliens or robots. There are no jaw falling effects and it will not show off your polished body. He is just a normal person in this movie, which was really nice. He may not stretch his muscles in this film, but this story is not needed yet, but it was nice to see him relaxed and not show his ripped body to make us without six packs of envy. His character is like all his character pleasing, witty and very charming, something that almost all the characters of this odd love story share. The character of Kevin James is just an ordinary man who needs help with his dream girl, who really feels to him and to the root of every journey. the only sign that was a painful place for me was the character of Mendez because he was so cold and calculated that it was hard to believe that Smith could fall for him. He must love the challenge I think. <br /> <br /> - This is part of a survey where I make fun of how I should never need Hitch because I am such a player, but I just got about 16 comments on another web site plus I'm still working a little project so i'm a little jaded right now. The films are packed with enough charm and pleasant characters with funny lines, but it falls slowly but surely for the crazy romantic movies, where after a great scene where a terrible secret appears, everyone is forgiven and the relationship is even better. But hey there is like a 4000 movie subtype to overcome accidents, so I think another movie with a predictable ending that is almost fatal won't cause much harm. I also like the message of the movie, because at last you don't need to get the right girl, but be yourself and everyone starts playing, what is the theme of the movie and why it works so well. I am sure that if it became clear that the character of James would become a girl after following what Smith's character said, it would be a pretty blank film, but as it is, it really works well. - Although it's predictable, it's a PERFECT movie. It's sweet, it's funny, and it's romantic that anyone who watches this movie on that date should get some after it ends. and I mean sex
