Who can ask more? My two and four year old children were dangerous, I admit. But worth it. They were tempted by credit and their parents. <br /> <br /> I am mixed with results before making movies: too scary, too boring, too complicated, no matter what. However, with this film, I was glad to see a smart movie that is hidden, stylish and passionate on the screen. Every movie that takes 5 (!) Years of production, good or bad, deserves some respect for bravery and the patience needed to film such a movie. <br /> <br /> O.K. I'm going a little. And again, why wouldn't I be excited? Looking at the movie list, I was reminded only of the poor quality of the films being distributed. At least for now, the W&G movie is well done. Maybe the originality was not the most inspired, but well, and well paced. <br /> <br /> Too Much Adult Humor? Too many sex references? Maybe. Although my children did not hit them enough. Too young. So, in my case, I didn't really notice. <br /> <br /> Of course I liked it.
