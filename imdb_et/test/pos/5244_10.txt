A heroic youth trace leads to a great adventure party along the west to the west, India's attacks, natural disasters, and romantic complications that are part of the adventure. <br /> <br /> Like the consecrated and wonderful story, Raoul Walsh THE GREAT TRAIL is a great movie that is entertaining because it was more than seven decades ago. Very good acting and excellent product values ​​live by their reputation as the first epic west of the talkies. <br /> <br /> John Wayne, drawn from the vagueness of his first important film role, seems to be a young man, but he immediately impresses with the natural charm and masculine power he brings to the hero's role; he is quietly dominating the film's attributes, which would make him a huge star one day. Marguerite Churchill pulls a pleasant southern belle who slowly warms the Duke's attention. Dialekt's comic El Brendel is very fun as a Swedish immigrant surrounded by mules and mother-in-law woes; his appearance in the scene laughs at the viewer. <br /> <br /> Looking and sounding like a human grizzly bear, Tyrone Power Sr, makes a huge and relentless, wonderful villain. Slick cardsharp Ian Keith is a complex bad guy. (His famous physical resemblance to John Gilbert is very obvious here.) The silent character of the film actor Tully Marshall is impressive as an old mountain man who helps drive a wagon train. Corpulent Russ Powell, as a friendly fur, makes his vocal performance well for useless noise. The sharp-eyed movie mavens sees Ward Bond as one of Missouri's settlers. <br /> <br /> What surprises many modern viewers is that THE BIG TRAIL has been filmed in an early widescreen process called Grandeur. More than its name, the picture looks amazing, Walsh shows the mastery of new technology. It performs the action of the screen, every part of it. Notice during crowd scenes how everything is occupied with real work that adds so much to the blood similitude of these sequences. Walsh deserves great credit for being one of the first directors of widescreen use. Luckily, the film also features free rear projection photographs that capture so many older films. It should also be emphasized that it is natural that the soundtrack sounds a little primitive; the talks were still in their cradle. The fact that Walsh was able to use the microphone at all, most of the scenes are out of the door, is much more for him. <br /> <br /> Great TRAIL was not successful. In 1930, William Haines' comedies were big money makers and the public was looking for fares other than the intelligent western countries. Most cast slipped into the shade, including Wayne. Until 1939, when John Ford rescued him to STAGECOACH, John Wayne's legend would start seriously. And despite its big and wide-ranging prospects, it would be 25 years before Hollywood's widespread screen, mainly in response to the economic threat of television.
