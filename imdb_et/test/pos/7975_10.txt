This is a great movie and I would recommend it to everyone. Mr. Drury's action is top-notch, because it is always and it fits well with other film actors. The intercourse or drama in the film cannot be given away. Hell has to be a movie! The plot was very tense. I watch this movie over and over, because it has all the elements of a great Western movie. It was very authentic how they showed the components related to the film that contained weapons, horses and clothes. The soundtrack is enjoyable and adds to the movie's taste. James Drury has the right to touch when choosing a movie. This is another winner for the Western genre. !!!!!
