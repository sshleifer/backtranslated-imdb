Richard Norton really illuminates the screen in this masterpiece of martial arts in Portland, Oregon. Aussie heartbreaker Norton plays the evil Mr Milverstead, who manages successful import / export activities in both arms smuggling and female meat trade. Usually, women are killed in their favorite dance club, where one of the biggest people is Bolo Yeung, who plays Ice. The problem with Milverstead is when a new police officer, John Kim (Britton Lee), gives up the death of his dead partners from the Milverstead organization. If you have time to see only one martial arts movie this year, don't forget this classic.
