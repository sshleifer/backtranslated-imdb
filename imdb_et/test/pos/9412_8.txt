Interestingly, someone made a comparison of "Fifth Rocket" with the Star Trek episode. It should be noted that the original Star Trek TV episode in which the Company's team passes the madness of space in the Si 2000 orbit is called "Naked Time", not "naked now". "Naked Now" refers to the first ordinary episode of Star Trek The Next Generation, in which Enterprise-D encounters a researcher. However, this episode refers to the original "Naked Time" series. <br /> <br /> Now, for Firth Missile. Although team reactions to Star Trek episodes were based on similar causes of alcohol poisoning, the crew's condition on the Montana board caused a more serious situation, namely the vapors of discoloration from the defective septum. There are few places where such a reaction can have more serious consequences than a team with such a serious responsibility as the ballistic missile submarine team, and this will naturally make the film a tense and thriller. The plot is very plausible. At the same time, this film, along with "Crimson Tide", "The Day After", "Dawn's Early Light", "Red October Wolf", "Ice Station Zebra" and many other similar films give us a lot of insight into how things can go wrong and how easy it would be for nuclear weapons to begin. Fortunately, no such event has taken place and (God wants) such an event will not happen.
