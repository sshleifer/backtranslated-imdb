Okay, so Ghoulies 4 is bad. And it doesn't really even ghoulies in it. And the behavior is bad. The story is stupid. But I forget to mention how fun this movie is. It's so fun and so ridiculous that it's not too much fun. There are only 2 ghoules in the movie and they don't seem to be really involved with another movie, Ghoulies. But they're pretty funny. And the funny thing is that Jonathon Graves returns for that. When you first saw, he was in that sign. I think it's better than the first. There are some classic scenes and some classic lines, one in the grocery store. "Attention K-Mart Buyers!" See if you have bad movies. It's so bad that it's good. And did I mention Barbara Alyn Woods is hot?
