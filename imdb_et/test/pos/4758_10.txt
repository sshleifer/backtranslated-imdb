Having grown up in New Jersey and spent a lot of days and nights on the shining streets of New York in the 1970s, always watching a movie like "Seven Ups" or its sexual spirit, "French Community", always attaches to the memories of time and place in some places. would have been a darker hour for NYC, but for me in the early twenties, it was always a fun adventure after another. I really stayed between these times. As one reviewer said, "This film hits the NYC's harsh, cold, factual sense of the winter season at the same time. At the same time, it reveals the time and culture of the infamous crime and the underworld of the police." Characteristics of the film and the city. cast, characters, and, of course, car chasing - have been thoroughly described in many of the reviews here so that I do not go into it except to say that one of my favorite moments is during the chase of the car when the camera focuses on Richard Lynch's attack on manic Bill Hickman. The appearance in the form of Richard Lynch, with the methods of protection, is so characteristic that the actor is much better known as a source of terror than the object that it is actually a comic look.
