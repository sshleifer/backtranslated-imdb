This early Warner Brothers talkie "The Son of Gods" (1930) deals with the racial intolerance shown by Anglo-Saxon Americans towards China. Chinese-Americans are treated like second-class citizens, and the white people only hold them in contempt. <br /> <br /> Prolific Screenwriter Bradley King based on his scenario Rex Beach novel, young, impressive Chinaman, Sam Lee (Richard Barthelmess "Only Angels is Wings") who experiences racial prejudice first when girls who bring his college boys along, show their racist feelings about Sam when they learn about his heritage. Sam goes to his father Lee Ying (E. Alyn Warren, "Gone With The Wind"), a wealthy Chinaman whose offices are not only in New York, but also in San Francisco. Sam feels deeply wounded in racial slowdowns and wants to leave New York and go where the Americans can't injure him. His patient's father warns him that racism is a fact of life and the only solution to racism is tolerance. Sam hasn't learned this lesson yet. He refuses to take more money from his father and catches the ship to London, England, peeling the potatoes on board. <br /> <br /> During her trip, she meets British playwright Bathurst (Claude King of "Arrowsmith") who needs some help writing Chinese. Sam and he will bring friendship and Sam will provide him with cultural information about the Asians. While they are relaxing in France, Sam meets a beautiful young woman, Allana Wagner (Constance Bennett, "Two-Face Woman") who deliberately loves her. It seems that Allana and her wealthy father are resting in the same motel. All motels know that Sam is Chinaman, except Allana. Sensitive to his racial legacy keeps Samana at Allana's hand until she persuades her that nothing can change her thoughts. They fall in love with love. Allana's father falls to him when he discovers that Sam is Chinaman, and all the memories that live in San Francisco and are cool, provoke Allana's mind. He rushes to the motel's dining room and openly jumps with Sam in a riding culture room full of pictures. <br /> <br /> Of course, it will ruin the turn of events terribly. He thought Allana loved her, but she didn't. About this time Sami's father, Lee Ying, is tragically ill and Ying's secretary Eileen (Mildred Van Dorn's Iron Man) sends Sam's telegram on Ying's illness. Predictably, Sam spits home in New York to be on his father's side. After his public humiliation, Sam has promised to show that Anglo-Saxon Americans are not good. Eileen is an Irish Catholic and probably one of her few white friends. Lee Ying dies and Sam controls the company, and he uses his white racism until he learns he was an Anglo-Saxon who got a San Francisco policeman victory for Lee Ying and his wife. The police forgot that two white, busy social workers wanted to take away Sami Yings. Sam learns this revelation while Allana comes to New York and becomes ill. During her illness, she repeatedly speaks her name in her dream, and her dedicated father goes to look at Sami and requires Sam to visit her to help her recover. Sam's not famous Sam visits him and he heals, but he has no memory of his visit, but of fog. Finally, Allana learns the truth that Sam is not Chinaman and they marry and live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> This socially conscientious Warner Brothers / First National Pictures Release claims honestly and uncertainly that in the first hour or near before the revelation that Sam has no Chinese blood in his veins, he and his audience will be surprised. The reconciliation of Allana and Sami stretches credibility, despite their self-esteem that they are against each other. But in the name of a happy ending that will erase all the negativity that came before it, they will end each other's hands. <br /> <br /> Capitulation to revelation that Sam is not China is damaging the moral power of the film. Incredibly, the "Son of Gods" is a pre-code film that seems almost dummy; for example, Sam is American, not Chinese! Constance Bennett delivers an excellent result when beautifying the beauties and keeps your attention when she whispers Sam with her riding culture. Claude King is good as Bathurst and E. Alyn Warren are convincing as Lee Ying. Interestingly, Warren made a career in depicting Asian characters. Richard Barthelmess is flawless like Sam; it offers very subtle results. Despite his age, the Son of God is the son of a good movie!
