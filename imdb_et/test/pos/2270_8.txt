Actor Jonathan Safran Foer, author of the director Liev Schreiber (the sum of all the fears) turned over the novel "Everything Is Illuminated" to the average version of the screen. This ensemble and self-discovery are spoken by strong performances by the ensemble and a sharp trend of enriching and enlightening the soul. Jonathan Foer (Elijah Wood) is a young man who has seen Grandpa, Safran, go away. Jonathan has a peculiar habit of taking small items and life with little monuments and closing them in plastic ziplock bags to show them on his wall. Safran gives Jonatana an old picture of a young Safran standing next to a beautiful girl who saved her life years ago. So Jonathan starts a long journey to find this secret woman in Ukraine without knowing whether she is still alive. He supports the assistance of his wife, young traveler Alex (Eugene Hutz) and his grandfather (Boris Leskin) in achieving his goal. At first, a trip ends up with dead ends and wrong drivers, but when a group approaches its target, men find in the dark chapter of history a shadow and a memory of past ghosts of war and the city of the past. There they find their respective destinies and become forever what they learn. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to have been led by someone who knew how to get the best out of their participants. Sometimes the film is spoken in Russian and it seems to be a foreign film. The title itself is a game of self-discovery. It is a man's thoughtful trek to his past and his past includes his companions; Jonathan's obsessive journey also turns into an emotional way for Alex and his grandfather. It is a story of interconnection on long distance and guilt must live. At the end of the film, these characters are events that change the lives of those who are constantly interacting with their lives. This proves that memories can be a powerful traumatic and also soul cleansing. It also concerns the legacy and the way others view the event or person in the past. Alex finally sees his grandfather in a completely different light. Even our understanding of these individuals has become the end of the film, which is a respectable, well-spoken story. <br /> <br /> The story is deceptively simple. It works as a journey movie (like The Straight Story) with an interesting mystery. Indeed, it includes many emotions and sub-blocks that extend from the past to the present. The end is a bit surreal with his déjà vu. <br /> <br /> The Elijah Wood (Sin City, Spotless Mind's eternal sun) has chosen a large number of roles since its splash in the Lord. The Trilogy of Rings. Here he does a fine job, which is essentially a minimalist role, not much to show. Eugene Hutz and Boris Leskin appreciated better than Alex and his grandfather. Even Grandpa's Dog Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. (that's right) is funny as a furious loyal companion. <br /> <br /> Paul Cantelon's free music score is a spirited compliment to the thoughtful nature of the movie. Editing is effective because past and present images are interlinked and easily modified. The art of Matthew Libatique (Gothika, the Requiem for Dreams) is harsh and lifeless with some impressive war images and consequences. <br /> <br /> The coincidences of the last half of the film are making a good drama, but are a little too casual. We never understand Alex's grandfather's background and his motivation. Likewise, Jonathan's empty letters and the lack of visible matter and depth do not give us much more than the sketch of a unique man. Sometimes the film seems somewhat weakening and frustrating because the brightest revelations are discovered. But these are small criticisms of what is a good, introspective story of good performances and interesting remembrance and closure issues. This Schreiber is not only focused, but has adapted the scenario to parts of this valuable history for its talents and promising potential in the future.
