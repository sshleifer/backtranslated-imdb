I remember seeing this 1978 comedy on one of the more favorable matinees I took when I was looking for an attack on my college courses. Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson make some effective Tracy-Hepburn-style thrusts and parries in this trusted Howard Zieff-driven romp. It's all blazing fast, especially thanks to the smart script by veteran scriptwriter Julius J. Epstein ("Casablanca") with Alan Mandel, Max Shulman and future director Charles Shyer. <br /> <br /> Dr. Charley Nichols has just returned from Hawaii after his wife's death. Upon his return, he becomes aware that he is an instant kitten for all single women in LA. He works in a hospital run by an increasingly senile senior manager, Amos Willoughby, whom Charley needs to reassure him to live. Enter Ann Atkinson, an implanted English woman who cooks cheesecakes for living and has some specific opinions about the medical staff she expresses freely in PBS talks. Of course, the Charley exhibition center and sparks like they say. This leads to standard complications of how serious Charley is ready to become Ann. At the same time, the hospital has to deal with a possible abusive death penalty for a widow widow of a rich baseball team who died in a hospital under the care of Willoughby. <br /> <br /> It is just refreshing to see a mature but glowing love story between two characters living by actors delivering lines of surgeons using scalpel skills. Matthau is his usual worshiper in the 1970s and quite prominent in his wealth of hands. Out of his difficult, award-winning Elizabeth roles, Jackson is sharply sardonic and charmingly vulnerable as feisty Ann, who thinks all doctors should try to be Albert Schweitzer. Art Carney plays Willoughby with a predictable blow, while Richard Benjamin offers friendly support as Charley's colleague, Dr. Solomon. It's all very compact with some cute puppy in the medical profession. There are no extras on the 2005 DVD.
