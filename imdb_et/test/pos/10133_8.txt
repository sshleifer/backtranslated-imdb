It was unusual: today's movie that was very nice. In fact, it was as nice as limiting it to be too hard to believe in some. When I look at this real life story, I thought, "Nobody's nice, it's tolerant." I mainly referred to the role of Ed Harris in "Coach Jones". I think they went a little bit beyond their character, but it's better than the opposite: showing him worse than what he was in real life. Strangely enough, Harris plays a role because he has long disgusting, profane characters. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm not complaining about a nice, good-looking movie and it's nice to see a lot of good meanings, kind people. These people direct their friendship, love and compassion to "James Kennedy", better known as "Radio", a mentally slow high school boy who plays Cuban Gooding Jr. The story takes place in the mid-1970s in South Carolina. Gooding also does this role. But, as Sean Penni's role as a person with mental challenge in "I Am Sam" is an hour and a half of that sign. After that, the boys' loud sounds can be heard. <br /> <br /> Note: In one of the documentaries on this DVD, it was interesting to know that in real life it took years for the radio. Make your transformation, not a month, as shown in the movie.
