I saw Cold Mountain and an English patient again this weekend. The first is a civil war on melodrama Inman (Jude Law), a confederate soldier who disarmes the army to return to Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) whom he barely knows. Both films were lovingly led by Anthony Minghella, who does extraordinary work. Although Cold Mountain is very good, it could have been a great film with the right casting and less popular, back-ground dialogue. <br /> <br /> Romantic epic needs a convincing heroine. The English patient was Kristin Scott Thomas, who was perfectly cast as intelligent, appealing and beautiful Katherine Clifton. The main problem with Cold Mountain is Ada, who feels silly and dimly eye-catching, and that this quality is missing, you would believe that Inman may become obsessed after one kiss. As actor Kidman has a limited choice, he usually plays women who are facing sterns and are facing stoicism. Kidman was too old to play the interest of ing√©nue and law of love. The film needed a young actress who could play charming, warm and vulnerable. Someone who was supposedly going through difficulties and hunger seemed ridiculously well fed and overwhelmed. Kidman was so well-groomed that he seemed to have spent three hours for each scene. Michele Pfieffer would have played this part perfectly on his younger days. Even Natalie Portman would have been a fix. Jude Law was in the role of Odysseus in his quiet movie, but he played his part well. Ray Winstone was an excellent London / Southern villain. <br /> <br /> During the Civil War, people probably were not well educated according to today's standards, and maybe they talked about monos. But if you look at the BBC's adaptations from Dickens, Austen or Mrs Gaskill, then everything is formulated. Maybe it is unrealistic, but it would improve my entertainment.
