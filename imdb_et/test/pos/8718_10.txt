Recently, I was fortunate to see that Ingrid Bergman's name has been added to a film I've never seen (or even heard of) from AMC. What luck strikes. <br /> <br /> To admire your flawless and seamless performance, the only reason is to be late and watch this movie. Writing is wonderfully comic and the performances are great. <br /> <br /> Walter Mathau (not my favorite) was almost perfect and Goldie Hawn (surprisingly) was fabulous. Offer from time to time, demanding, then just buggy. There are times in the movie that even the most hardened film viewer starts to grab the story and forget that it's a movie. The parents were amazing to watch. He returns to the screen (54 years old). The support cast was great and the lines ... the lines are fine. <br /> <br /> Top 5 romantic comedies all the time.
