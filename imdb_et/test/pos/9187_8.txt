This film was not really about stereotypes, dance movements or picalines. This film concerned the vulnerability of people's hearts. It was hard to believe that Kevin James could play a convincing role that Will Smith would be unable to act and that such a hackneyed film genre would succeed in this way. I'm not going to worship this movie too much - it wasn't "revolutionary" in any way, but it was a movie that was worth watching. Was it credible? No. New York could not be so simple and there was no man in the history of mankind with Hitch Hutzpah. Of course, there are bar-studs, but not the ones that get the chick at any time, except the ones that are of course seven. What worked best for this film was its actual focus on the dramatic side of things, not just comedy. It was undoubtedly funny for two hours. But it was also two hours that made you sit in your seat, symbols and smile.
