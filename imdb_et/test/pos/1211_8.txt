In the 1980s, world wrestling was easy. Hulk Hogan took the chronicles of Roddy Piper or Bobby Heenan, or Ted DiBias, and often came to be the winner. Sometimes he was an ally in 1988, like Randy Savage, but it was usually a question of Hulk Hogan and Bobby Heenan, and that should be the case. <br /> <br /> But this evening, which was supposed to change, a new champion, was crowned by a man who thought WWE for the 90s. It didn't work. But WWE was one thing right: Hulkamania was ready and a new order had to be created. <br /> <br /> This historic Wrestleman, the first to take place outside America, began with Rick Martel, who won Full B Ware. Ever since Wrestleman was not happy and it was taken down in a short order. <br /> <br /> The next colossal connection, Andre Giant and Search, put their label team titles in a burst against Ax and Smash and disappeared. The new team team masters were crowned. <br /> <br /> The next game saw an earthquake defeating Hercules. Hercules was another companion who had no real happiness in Wrestlemania. Congratulations to Brutus Beefcake when he ended up with Mr. Perfect's hit. Well, I think someone had to stop it. <br /> <br /> Roddy Piper and Bad News Brown fought a slow but fun game with a double count. seconds. Unfortunately, it doesn't really fit. Barbarian then won a short game of Tito Santana. <br /> <br /> Dusty Rhodes and Saphire of American dreams then won the confused confusion of the king of Macho Randy Savage and Queen Sherri. It was the only women's wrestling that actually took place at WWE. <br /> <br /> The next was a fun game when Rockers Marty Janetty and Shawn Micheals won the Orient Express at a fast pace. At this point there were many good tags for the teams. Jim Duggan beat Dino Bravo in no way. Roberts was confused by Virgil and thought that Ted was able to maintain his title in an entertaining game and one of the longest competitions. <br /> <br /> Next, the twin towers collide because Big Bossman strikes Akeem for a short while followed by Rick Rude, who won a short game with Jimmy Snook. <br /> <br /> Finally, we will reach the main event where Hulk Hogan won the WWE title for the Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior. This is an entertaining round-trip match that was won by a warrior after Hogan was left behind. The crowd was extraordinary and the race was a great sight. <br /> <br /> And the torch was over, but is the ultimate warrior a champion, in the hope of WWE?
