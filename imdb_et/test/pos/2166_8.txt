Black Scorpion is Roger Cormeni Batman. What is cool and there are many cool things in this movie. As Breathtaker is the cross of Doctor Doom and Darth Vader, it's cool. The mind-leading gas in the inhalers was worth Mad Hatter. The Cormen B-film style is the whole puppy that's not always good. There are lots of tricks and hot babes to make any action fan happy. This movie, good looks out of bad. But if you are not a comic book, I would recommend not to look at Black Scorpio, but if you like a comic book like movies and don't care if it was ever a comic book. Then look at the BLACK SCORPION because I give it 8 stars.
