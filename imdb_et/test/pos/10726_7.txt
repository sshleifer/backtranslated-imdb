I remember going to the inn with my parent and sister. I was in the 5th grade and still a child, and drove off 4 years later, but the film was still in my memory. An adult film that the child finds fun. This is a peak. Hoffman is one of Hollywood's best actors and this movie proves it. I like Billy to put an ice cream scene, and I remember the SCTV version out there film I factory itself. Remember, Joe Flairty is crying. Please send me an email if you want SCTV. It's not a bad movie at all, it's a story of a father and his son. Touching and grabbing, I love the part where Hoffman talks about Killroy and how the streets are changing. Worth another clock. 7/10
