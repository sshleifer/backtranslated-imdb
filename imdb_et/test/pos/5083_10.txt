I saw this movie yesterday and it was shocked, but still shocked by some of the comments I read here. One person wrote that the victim of torture was guilty or not - so one person wrote that because he was not an American citizen ... Some people comment that people in the Middle East are hating us and want us dead ... So let's say that you have the right to torture someone who is guilty of a crime? Are we saying it is right to torture someone who is not an American citizen? Are we saying it is right to torture someone who hates us and wants us to die? Are we saying that, as written in the Geneva Convention, the Human Rights Declaration and the United States Constitution, "torture is wrong, but some torture is less wrong than others?" When will it become a "torture" right? That's why this movie is powerful - it's unclear, but not torture. Torture is always wrong and, if we want to do it, even in the name of justice and national security or freedom and democracy, we are wrong and we are evil; we do exactly what we blame our enemies (and we call them "false" in the same breath.) My favorite line in the movie was "if you don't want to compromise with Amnesty International." Exactly.
