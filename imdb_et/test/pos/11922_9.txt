This is what you should look at, although it is sometimes cheesy, it's nice to see a young Sean Astin and it's a fun and humorous action movie. I looked at it many times when I was young, and now I still enjoy it as old vhid machine (if I have a copy). So sit back with this movie, let the reality go for a while and you have a good laugh and a nice one and a half hours.
