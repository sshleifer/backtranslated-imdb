I went to the cinema in 1973 when the film was released, then I was 11 years old. I remember how much I enjoyed it and wanted to live in Shangri-la, so I was naive and young. Recently, I met a video I had recorded on television a few years ago. I looked at it again and I'm not ashamed that I still enjoy it as much as 29 years ago. I also like listening to the lyrics of songs because it makes me think that one day we could live in a place where the sound of weapons does not return to our ears and when we look at our reflection - we should be satisfied with what we see. I call it "feel good" because I feel happy after watching it. Maybe I'm still naive, but it makes me happy and I'm sure it will make you happy if you look at it openly and enjoy it for what it is - a good family movie. I have to be one of the few people with this movie on VHS PAL video and DVD (made by myself). I recorded it on a DVD as the recording of the video tape from the TV began to wear thin. I look at it from time to time.
