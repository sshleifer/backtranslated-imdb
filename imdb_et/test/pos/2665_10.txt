A review that I've been too long for ... <br /> <br /> 2001 is one of the best films ever made, if not the best. Stanley Kubrick was a filmmaker genius and one of his best works. And while many have misunderstood and underestimated it, it is considered to be one of the best films of all time and I have to agree. In 1968, no one had previously done anything like that before, and no one has ever since. It was an admiration for the breakthrough of special effects and how the effect is today, no wonder why. The film still looks amazing after almost forty years! Take note of CGI people. With the help of large miniatures and realistic lighting, Kubrick created some of the best special effects ever put on celluloid. This aspect alone created almost one space space cooling space, which is also attributed to music and realistic sound effects. I can't think of another movie where you can't do anything in this room, as it really is. The lack of sound effects in the room is not realistic, it is used cleverly as a means to identify the mood and it works flawlessly. <br /> <br /> Apart from displaying outstanding special special effects, there are other factors that play a role in creating the film's sense. Music played, all classic, congratulates what the eyes see and make you feel the importance of the human journey through evolution from a monkey to a space traveler. <br /> <br /> The story, although it seems easy, is deep. Sequentially, several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and basically trigger certain events that are an integral part of the film. What are they? Where did they come from? What are they doing? These are all questions that one story asks when looking at your story and is asked to find your way. While most people come to the general idea of ​​what happened in the northwest, every person has to decide what it means to them. In some way, it is decided to answer these questions, a thorough solution will be created. This is not fully interpretable, but in some respects. Experience more to explain it. The end result is quite chilling, no matter what your personal solution. <br /> <br /> Although it is a long film and sometimes slows down, it must be to accurately portray a person's journey. It is not a subject that is well covered with a shorter movie, faster pace. Those with short attention need not apply. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, the HAL 9000 is a computer that has been removed as an antagonist. Never has such a cooling screen on the machine. What reminds me that with such a deep ambition and performance film, there is surprisingly little dialogue. Another sign of the Kubrick genius. <br /> <br /> All in all, one of the best films ever made and one of the best science fiction movies. A personal favorite. Everyone has to see this movie at least once. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
