I loved this movie. Not as big as "50 first date", but it's definitely a repeater, especially on a rainy day or with groups of girlfriends. Yes, the plot was "cute" and maybe even unbelievable, but what's so bad when you know a good movie. Drew as Josie and her romance teacher are so cute and brother baseball wannabee adds a good feeling to the movie. The whole junk that is so bad for a good movie can enjoy the whole family? Embarrassing without watching your children! Drew is a fantastic actor who seems to be mostly unacceptable. This is definitely one of his best roles!
