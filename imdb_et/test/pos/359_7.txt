Being the second of Chaplin's Essanay films, CARMEN is also called Cecil B. Demille's drama parody. It is obvious that Demille's acclaimed film did not impress the comedy he later admitted in his autobiography. <br /> <br /> Parodies were not a new attempt at Chaplin. He had already done several of them, namely HIS PRE-HISTORY and his NEW JOBS, and continues to do so until the end of his career in films (eg A KING IN NEW YORK). > Chaplin is a very good description of Don José and Edna Purviance is as good as Carmen. Don't act as we are used to; Charlie is not a lovable Tramp, and Edna is far from being an innocent little woman, but it wasn't Chaplin's intention either. FISHING EFFORT CARMEN has a somewhat strange Chaplin film that is very different but still contains good material. Don José loves Carmen very much but is not alone in this field; "Carmen, Carmen, (beautiful) Carmen (all), loved by all men under the age of 96," but has the great advantage of being an officer and there we are; it is a famous story of rivalry, love, greed, and glory, seen in a humorous perspective. Thanks to Chaplin's and Purviance's performances and George Bizet's great and wonderful music, which I would admire very much, it would have been almost a comedy masterpiece, a time taken into account. It could have been. But unfortunately, although it is a good pretty good comedy, you don't feel it is fair to blame people who claim that CARMEN CLOSING is far from being a masterpiece. But it is important to keep in mind that it is not related to the lack of any talent, but rather to business conflicts. When Chaplin refused to sign Essanay's contract again after the latest company film, POLICE, they retaliated, reversing all the scenes that Chaplin originally replaced from CARMEN. Thanks to this, the film is somewhat confusing and has a number of meaningless scenes that are more annoying than funny, and the film turned out to be Ben Peat --Turpin played Remendado as a Chaplin short. Of course, Chaplin was desperate to find out what Essanay had done and had to stay in bed for several days. <br /> <br /> Despite the obvious mistakes, we recommend Chaplin fans and admirers of beautiful music.
