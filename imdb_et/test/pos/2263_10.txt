I saw this movie for the first time on Alaska Airlines and saw it two more times. It's just - and it's just - one of the best movies of the year. I found myself enjoying the first sight, but a little blurry what happened. After a few weeks of seeing again, things started to go. It was not confusing, just deep. In fact, the depth of the film may not be appreciated for some time. For example, it was only after my third visit that Sammy Davis Jr. (grandfather's dog) was more than just a pet - maybe he'd stand for his dead wife. Recognize how fiercely he protects him. There are many symbols and none of them are cute or caring, but real. The adventure of your journey keeps the story in real motion, and even when they arrive, you're not sure if it was the destination. If the film continues, then the adventure and I got the feeling that the destination was just a waypoint. The soundtrack is fun, the landscape is compelling and both are decisively east. I could go on to the deeper meanings of the film, but I'm not sure I have discovered all the nuances yet. Besides, it is more fun to throw them out. Like all movies, "Everything is Illuminated" has turned out to be a fine wine that sleeps over time. I recommend seeing it - twice.
