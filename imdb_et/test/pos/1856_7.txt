Non-Judge Imina is not going to comment on the great man's theory that changed the world 150 years ago. Safe to say, science is based on evidence, religion is based on blind faith. Nuff said there. <br /> <br /> The movie was created by the BBC and, quite frankly, it would be quite easy on television. Although the actor is great, the film itself is not really worth the full blown cinema. This means that if it reaches a wider audience, then be it. But I have seen many period style dramas on BBC TV and they were well prepared. Just don't expect the budget to be too excited to see it. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I found the movie almost out to apologize for religious fundamentalists. Although it reaches the whole tension well, I couldn't wish that it would come out much faster than the fact that it actually happened (you're waiting for it to end). And it seemed to be much more than I ever knew about Darwin's struggle with myself and his wife Emma, ​​depicting him almost like some crazy mad spot - which is hardly true. There are also many other errors and facts related to the absence of the actual story of publishing the original, but the whole premise of the film is almost entirely focused on how difficult it is for Darwin to come into contact with the book and a small part of his beloved daughter Annie's death. This gives the film the most moving scene where Annie goes away when she asks Darwin for the last time to tell her the story of an imprisoned orangutan who died of pneumonia. You probably feel a greater connection with the primate in this scene than Darwin's daughter. <br /> <br /> An earlier controversy that probably surrounds a movie in the US works well to promote it and many more people can see it. But to be honest, there is very little in it that offends any mythical Deity. This barely headline news about the theory that has been around for 150 years. But like the main Christians (and many other religions we all know well) want to release a poster or two, if possible, I think this film is just as good an excuse as anything. Personally, I don't see all the noise. But maybe they just tempt ...
