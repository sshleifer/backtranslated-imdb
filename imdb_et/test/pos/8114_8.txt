I loved that the mood was light and airy. I loved that the wizard would want guarantees about his future and that his roommate puts him in "people" straight. I loved them to deal with the dynamics of how men in the group interacted with each other, given that it was led by a lesbian; What makes a man? What makes one straight, gay or bisexual? You are not quite sure if our leader has decided who he really wants; he lives at the moment and throws the wind gently. These and other reasons make me love this movie.
