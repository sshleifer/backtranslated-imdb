It comes quite a bit ... horny. MacDowell's inability to act is sometimes painful and Hurt needs money to take such silenced roles, but I still enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Why? In a word, Travolta. He's great in this movie. However, I can't give the movie a high score, but it definitely deserves a better result.
