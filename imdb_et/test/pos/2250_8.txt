Let me start by saying that Liev has received a lot of respect from me after seeing his director's debut "Everything Enlightened". Anyone reading the book knows if the story is pretty pointless and fun with Alex's vocabulary with countless setback scenes and crazy sequences. Liev took it all and made it work. The film itself is great - soundtrack, performances, cinema - it all works. There is a lot of story about the city and its inhabitants, but only so much can be done with indie, so this part didn't bother me too much. It's just a disappointment that many people don't see this movie or even don't know it exists because it didn't have any advertising. I didn't even know it was in theaters. I didn't know when the DVD came. You think that since Frodo Baggins was one of the main characters, SOMEBODY would be at least a commercial area. I had to see my "Paradise Now" DVD (published on DVD '06 in the spring) to even find out that it had the date of the theater's "Fall of 2005" release. Haha - sad really. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you stumble through this review somehow, because one of your friends reads a book and loved it or saw a movie and suggested seeing it - see my advice and see it. This is a very good experience. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
