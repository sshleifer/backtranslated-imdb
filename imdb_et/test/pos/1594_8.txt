CAUTION: SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Though this film is sometimes a bit slow, brilliant landscapes, riches in characters and powerful themes make Morte a Venezia a satisfying experience. I have not read Thomas Mann's book, but I am sure that Visconti's visual glory, musical result and powerful resurrection of conflicts and desires must make it fair. Gustav von Aschenbach's study refers to a person's tendency to rationalize and quantify our emotions, behaviors and passions. This trend is shown in Alfred and Gustav Germany when Alfred describes music as mathematical - ie. measurable - and emotional. This conflict arises again in a scene where young Tadzio plays alone in the lobby "Fuer Elise" and Gustav recalls his visit to the brothel where he is led by a prostitute playing the same song. After having paid a prostitute, Gustav clearly prevents the consequences of his actions from the repercussions of his actions. This reaction reminds us of the moral reaction to the temptations that Tadzio represents. <br /> <br /> Finally, Gustav is forced to make his biggest decision: stay in Venice and leave his lust and temptation? Or escape from Venice to save your life? His early attempt to escape from the Venice railway station caused voidness and showed how long he had to stay. <br /> <br /> The praiseworthy nature of interaction, Visconti's powerful landscape (especially the Dawn in Venice and the last scene) entering Tadzio into the water and moving to the horizon makes this movie a real masterpiece.
