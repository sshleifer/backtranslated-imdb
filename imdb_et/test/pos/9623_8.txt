"Five Fingers of Death" is the classic class of the 70s kung fu cinema. Like a movie that "broke" the HK cinema west, it must be a serious fan of every genre. It is also a fucking entertaining film with hard-hit, non-stop action, firm and mostly believable choreography and great duplication in the 1970s. HWAA !! "". "" Five Fingers "is the eye-catching story of eye revenge ... and I mean literally eye-catching! It is nice to see that Lo Lieh is a hero. so many big crooks, including Pai Mei's classic WHITE LOTUS FISTIS, which was one of the signs of Tarantino used to create KILL BILL's Pai Mei. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that I want better DVD quality - My vision is to be a VHS transfer, in general it's a great movie - don't miss it! <br /> <br /> Bart Blackstone Movie Club - Hollywood, CA
