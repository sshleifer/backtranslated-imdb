I saw this interesting movie back with a Chinese / French film "2046" at a recent Dubai film festival. Both were intelligent works made in the same year (2004/2005). Both had the main characters who lived in a "hotel". In both movies, the hotel is rather a refugee metaphor than a location. Both dealt with love between man and woman. Both had excellent music and riveting performances. What coincidence and how do these two films differ in the way the subject is treated? Somewhere in the beginning of the film, the man walking on the sidewalk looks at the woman and hits the bullet. The audience invades the innocent laughter of the laughter. But will it not let the movie summary attract you for 2 hours? The film is an excellent blend of black comedies (for example, using a stethoscope to listen to a neighbor's conversation), based on the film Buster Keaton and Jacques Tati introduced earlier in the cinema - stoic faces that bring comedy quite the opposite of the intelligent world of Robin Williams or Danny Kay, a warm-hearted heart. Sudden inactivity changes the otherwise stoic character, while money from the hotel to the bank resembles Tati's works. An anti-automation statement (counting cash and responding to statements from bank employees, a dummy that does not respond to a speed transmitter, a reference to "Moulimix" as a fictitious "company", etc.) has several tips that the director offers to the comedy laden with the viewer. Laugh, yes, but think about it and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The strength of the movie is a short, staccato script (directed by Paul Sorrentino), which offers a comedy mixed with philosophy ("The truth is boring," "Father is dead, but no one told him," "No luck - it is the invention of the losers and the poor. "You can't sleep through this lecture. <br /> <br /> Sorrentino offers entertainment related to a topic that Italians know best - mafia - this is an existential mafia movie. <br /> <br /> "Truth is boring", the director gives the dessert a great actor (Toni Servillo), good music, smart camera work (Luca Bigazzi), beautiful, mysterious actor (Magnan, grandmother), big Anna) and a powerful script that is for the viewer to find out if what was before the film was true. f it was, wasn't it?
