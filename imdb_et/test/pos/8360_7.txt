Being a fan of time travel, I was surprised that there was no device to send Russell Johnson's character over time. He just appeared in 1865. It was an episode of disappointment. I liked the premise that changing the past involves the danger of changing the future. Other Twilight Zone episodes about time trips, such as "No Time Like the Past", "Uncommon", etc., were, in my opinion, greater due to the use of "travel" equipment. Perhaps, if Russell Johnson's character had been the same as he played in "Fulfillment," it would have been more like myself for fans. As sci-fi fans know, no character ever has to travel over time. Any kind of "twisted" plot can be used for this type of story. It was the only mistake I could comment on this episode.
