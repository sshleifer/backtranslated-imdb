I loved this movie, which was a great idea of ​​a family who had this part of the ups and downs, but eventually they knew the special love they had for each other. I've seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith, but my god was one of his best, although it came out 12 years ago. This movie contained an all-star cast, and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other participants I've never seen before. This movie was long but I enjoyed every minute. This is a film that you can sit down and watch with your family, although we should cover the eyes of the children a few times, because we have discretion. In general, I appreciate this from 10 to 10 on the film. Life does not breathe enough, so if anyone knows which store sells, let me know because it's black.
