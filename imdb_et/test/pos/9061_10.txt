Who would have thought of suicide that could be treated as understandable to everyone? I saw the movie in SXSW's premiere and it turned out to be the best movie there. Yes, its twisted and odd, but there is a logical filmmaker (Michael Parness) in the world. If you don't laugh (most of all), you just don't get it and it's a shame. Especially noteworthy is that Guillermo Diaz as Hector steals scenes and Natasha Lyonne and David Krumholtz chemistry is intense. The film resembles one of Harold and Maude, but not really, it takes a spin one after the other, and they all have a sense of confusion in the world where we all live. Later, and what was great, it was heard that the same things I thought about my head, why things "happened" were the reasons they did. I don't think you can say much about the movie if you didn't get it. I think I got it and it seemed like everyone else. The film is called suicidal comedy, but it got a lot of heart, a lot of laughs and a lot of hope, but it does not lose the horror of suicide. A nice little movie that should get attention when it is released, which hopefully will happen sooner rather than later.
