- A surprisingly enjoyable movie <br /> <br /> - The group of thieves led by Mark Wahlberg robs golden security in Italy, and fortunately he has succeeded and has no problem. Before the group can be celebrated, Steve played by Ed Norton decides that he wants gold for himself and pulls the group Cout De 'He and one member. He and his companions think the group is dead, but fortunately the group is not dead. A year later, we come back to a story where the group has been watching Norton and decided to steal the gold and spend the rest of the movie, which is about to steal his gold and score. <br /> <br /> - It was a surprise to me, he had all the usual forgotten summer screen, but it was really memorable and very fun to watch. I like how smart and thoughtful film plans are and how the film looks realistic. Watching a trailer would make you think it was a meaningless action movie, but in fact there are only two stages of action in the film and they are all really well done. The last activity is very long for 20 minutes. A scene with one of the best cars ever made. I like how real chase is and how everything happens in the old school style without the help of CGI. Personally, I enjoyed this car chase more than the "Matrix 2" CGI-filled chase. I remember watching the music video by director Gary Gray and I always noticed how well they were and thought he was a great filmmaker. Can't wait to see what he's doing. <br /> <br /> - Participants also do a decent job with Seth Green, who is my group's favorite. Another thing I loved was John Powell's excellent score because I've heard his "Robots" score this year, I was his fan and paid great attention to his music and the man is really good. She does a great job of avoiding all the usual summer music videos and giving a very good score. I haven't seen the original that it is based, so I can't really tell you how well it collects on each other. <br /> <br /> -Yes, it's a great popcorn movie that actually has a brain different from most of the selected summer movie rings. He has big characters, is funny as hell and has an amazing score of John Powell. If you love hero movies, then you love this one <br /> <br /> - do you know if I was in a group I am called a beautiful mike
