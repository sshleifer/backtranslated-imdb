I saw a London merchant last week in London. Major are Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Finnes and Lynn Collins. Compare to other movies based on Shakespeare's game, making the game so easy to understand and follow. Bravo Michael Radford to lead such top performers. The costume and scenery are great and, as it was filmed in Russia, it gives the film and authentic taste. I had read the game over 30 years ago at school and the emphasis was on the anti-Semitic behavior of the Jews and the cruelty of Christians. I don't know if this film is controversial, but in any case I'm sure he'll get a few Oscar candidates.
