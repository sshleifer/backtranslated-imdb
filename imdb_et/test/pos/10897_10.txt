GoldenEye is a masterpiece. The story is stunningly depicted, the characters are decorated and the weapons are annoying. The story is so interesting, even if you complete each individual mission to get more levels you need to beat harder. And the multiplayer mode is so complex. You chose the weapons you want to play, then play. Me and my three friends with my brother always play Goldeneye. If you don't have this game, I suggest you buy it.
