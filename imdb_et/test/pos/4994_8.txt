I am a big fan of Lonesome Dove and all the books in the series and I love the movie. I was pleased to see that they finished the month of Comanche. I've been a longtime fan of Steve Zahn and wanted to see him in a serious role. Personally, I think Steve Zahn has done an amazing job of recreating Gus. I can't think of another actor who would have been better. He has voice, exhortations, pronunciation for T. Well, nobody could ever consider Robert Duvall a candle Gus, but I think Steve Zahn has done a good job. Karl Urban works in the same way in all the films he has been in, so he is well suited for Woodrow Call. AS a movie for yourself, yes, it's a bit daunting, but can you really win the Lonesome Dove? No, I don't think so.
