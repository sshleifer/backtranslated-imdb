Bloody birthday plays the presumed innocence of children and shows them as bloodthirsty monsters. Steven (Andy Freeman), Curtis (Billy Jayne; Billy Jacoby) and Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy) were born the same day in the shadow. In addition to sharing their birthday party, they share the love of murder (and they don't choose who will kill). Young Billy, Elizabeth, and Andy play the parts of these emotional monsters fairly well, but they know when to put the charm. But they can't fool anyone. It's a general good nightmare, not too unrealistic, a few good moments in the break, and the kids played the roles well (adults are pretty hammy). I'd say it deserves to be viewed (I'm a copy myself).
