Alexander Lou, the star of the classics, such as "The Super Ninja" and "Mafia vs Ninja" titles here at this fun martial arts festival. <br /> <br /> The plot includes evil white eyebrows at the abbot Abbott White (who is proud and honest), with the help of ninjala to overthrow the Shaolin temple. <br /> <br /> The goal it achieves, and moreover, sweeps most of its members, though you don't have to say, one or two will be able to survive and quite predictably go for the exact possible revenge on the miscreant Abbott. <br /> <br /> Ok, so the plot doesn't raise the envelope exactly from the point of view of creativity, but does anyone watch a movie titled "Wu Tang vs Ninja" or "Ninja Hunter" really takes care of such an insignificant for a factor like a plot? Of course not! - It's fighting these films and gums - you get your money here! There are some wonderfully choreographic martial arts for everyone who has participated in it, and rarely seems to go out for a minute without a fight. <br /> <br /> If you ever participate in martial arts movies, you have to see it!
