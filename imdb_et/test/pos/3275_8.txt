Ok, maybe Posse can't be compared to other popular cowboy / western movies. But because this film did not have FINANCING. Obviously, if you want to focus on a story like this, focusing on African-American historical engagement (and NO, maidens, and mammies are not historical), Hollywood is not too supportive. And believe me they weren't. Producers and actors sacrificed a lot of "outward" costs to make "Posse" so the story could be said. I think that alone is commendable. Posse may not be Oscar material (and they don't like black media too), but that's the beginning. It's entertaining and it introduces us to the black cowboy most of us don't know.
