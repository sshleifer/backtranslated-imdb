It was sad that the DITTES theater had a total of only two weeks. I thought this movie was a lot for it. The script was funny, full of fine emotional shifts and had a good message. Operation was great. Everyone did a great job, especially with the nuances of the script. Heather Graham has not only beautiful eyes, but * expressive * eyes. For this, all the participants were attractive! Why it didn't work well in theater publications, I don't know that there wasn't much pressure behind it in the studio. But it was deserved, and I hope it works well on video. This is definitely one of my favorites in the first half of 2000.
