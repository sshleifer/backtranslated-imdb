In the first season, much was talked about how all elements of the Marine Corps would function as a team (i.e., land, air, helicopters and jets). This is the season I give high ranking! (True, there are still plenty of "freedoms" in the first season, but the stories were more plausible.) <br /> <br /> The following seasons were a Melwose Place gawd-awful test that meets Top Gun! <br /> <br /> I was at sea at that time in Miramar and remember they shot the show around the San Diego area. I could talk to Rod Rowland and James Brolin. <br /> <br /> Rowland's character was good to go. <br /> <br /> Brolini's character was only good in the first season. For some reason he shot off after the first episode of the second season. <br /> <br /> If you want to see how the sea air team works, one season is what you look at. /> <br /> If you are a Melrose Place and soap opera like plots, trying to connect them to Top Gun, check out the last two seasons.
