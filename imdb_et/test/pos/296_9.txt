I've seen this movie 4 times in 5 months and I never get tired of it because it's perfect. It has also become the best film music and the best supporting roles ever written on film. I mean, you just have to love Robert Duval, Marlon Brand, Martin Sheen and Lauerence Fishburne in this movie, but especially Duva. I can't believe Kramer vs. Kramer won Oscar instead of this amazing war film. So this is my conclusion when you take the director of the world's largest film (The Godfather) and the best Hollywood actors you can successfully achieve. Now I have to write something for this preview so don't read it except for the last line. This movie rules !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
