I loved this movie and I watch it every day. I think that although it's not that big, it's really just a bunch of fun with the script. I had been looking for this movie for almost a year and when I found thirty dollars I just had to get it. It's now my favorite movie all the time. It deals with the failure of the relationship and at the same time makes it fun. I loved all the parts of Don Vito, especially where Valo asks him about the grapes when they sit on the porch, and He tells him to eat the veranda rolling. It actually depicts him as he really is. Part of "doing" really touched me when they addressed Brandon Novak's heroin addiction and how much his friends and family tried to help him. In the new film, "Dreamseller", there is a production that talks about Novak's dreams that have broken his addiction.
