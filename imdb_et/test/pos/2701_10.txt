Need for fans of any dead wood industry! <br /> <br /> Cynthia Gibb makes KC's role as a huuuuuge set of justice, and while the "story" is not 100% factual, it is still a good overview of both Richard's and Karen's life and is worth watching for just the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Always makes me cry !!! <br /> <br />
