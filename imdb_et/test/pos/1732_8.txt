I've just been watching Doctor Who's 2nd season finale and, in addition to a couple of dull episodes, this show is fantastic. <br /> <br /> It's a sad loss to say goodbye to the season's final season, but the show is moving on. The BBC must increase the budget for the exhibition, and there are so many things that can happen in London and the surrounding areas. Also, some special effects, though in the very best of the best cases, have to be slightly more polished when odd. <br /> <br /> The BBC was a huge game to restore an exhibition that lost its way long ago and must be congratulated for it. <br /> <br /> Keep your Christmas special at Christmas 2006, with the best Christmas 2005 show.
