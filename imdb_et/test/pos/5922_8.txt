Billy Wilder continues his strong film racing in the 1950s with Charles Lindbergh, a young American pilot who became the first person to fly by the Atlantic in 1927, with the biogas. Jimmy Stewart plays Lindbergh, and although he may be too old for his part, he still brings the necessary sincere warmth and confidence and a brand of sub-to-earth goodness that makes him an iconic movie star. Wilder steers firmly, balancing the background story with humor and drama, to give us a clear description of what Lindbergh opposed when he decided to challenge. This is definitely not her or Stewart's best work, but it is the pearl of the film. It raises your spirits by plane and makes you proud to be an American. In general, it's just good.
