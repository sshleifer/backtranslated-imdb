Comcast On-Demand. <br /> <br /> Every time I see this music, I'm surprised by the songs ... with one show cap after another. <br /> <br /> This interpretation is magical for me. Songs shining ... vocals, orchestras, and choreography are amazing for a movie made for "movie" ... better than many seen versions. <br /> <br /> Discussion about Bette makes no sense. He's Mama. His voice is brilliant and still full of the story of a mother who lives through her daughters. I still get tears at the end when he finally has the moment of his glory, no matter how brilliant this glory is. <br /> <br /> The Tulsa / Louise duet / dance is now on. Fabulous. <br /> <br /> Stephen Sondheim is the king of musical theater. His lyrics just roll the tongue like silk ... Styne music is perhaps the best ever penned stage / screen. <br /> <br /> Thanks to God we have this masterpiece captured in the American Musical Theater.
