My girls 4 and 6 love this example. We took it to the PBS station and they always ask when it is now. It reminds them of their grandmother who takes care of them every day in the summer. His funny and sometimes they can't talk about one scene. I strongly recommend this example to all young children. It is very clean and shows you a slowdown and not watching television all day long. When Nana reads the story, it's slow and she talks about each page on Mona. It reminds me to slow down when I read the next book for my girls before going to bed and talk about the book instead of quickly reviewing it just to sleep.
