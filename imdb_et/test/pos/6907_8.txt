I sell dead, the convicted tombstone revolves around Arthur Blake. Blake's friend and companion robber Willie Grimes has just been killed and Blake follows the next morning. Although he is sitting in his cell, waiting for him to be filled, priest Duffy comes in and asks him if he's telling everyone he's seen as a kid. He then gives his father Duffy a quasi biography of his most interesting works. <br /> <br /> The plot is largely derived from several incidents that are only related to chronology. This prevents the viewer from falling forever forever, but also makes events less important because you can easily add or remove a lot of scenes without noticing it. Though it was faulty, I thought this method added a fun loving character to the movie and kept it very fun. Most of the different stories are good, especially alien, Murphy and vampire, but others were not so big. <br /> <br /> Actress is not amazing, but I didn't find it bad. points. Dominic Monaghan had a good result as he was able to be serious and played the comic parts of the movie very well. <br /> <br /> The characters were not very deep, but all were interesting. I also liked how many crooks were made almost in the comic book. The part of Murphy and their gang attacking is invaluable. <br /> <br /> So, I Sell the Dead combines great success with horror, comedy and sci-fi fun and excitement. This is one of the most interesting and original films I've seen for a while, and it's unfortunate that such independent movies are no longer appreciated.
