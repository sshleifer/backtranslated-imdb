20 years later, this film still has its own size. The film has never crossed Valley's incredible soundtrack. The film was completely encapsulated in the 80s so perfectly that it could only be realized years later. Nicolas Cage is his best. A film with just enough character to make you realize how sad Hollywood has changed (as far as quality goes). The special edition DVD is loaded with tons of extras and is worth it to buy because you have a lot of materials that need to be screened. Certainly.
