The story of Sweeney Todd creates memories of the works of classical writers such as Charles Dickens and contemporary writers such as Edward Gory. Naturally, it becomes a musical Les Miserables. Both deal with the serious effects of poverty in the industrial revolution and the breakdown of organized society. But this music is very different from Les Misis: Stephen Sondheim, a songwriter who can adapt to any style. Certainly he has his successes and failures, but one of his exhibitions can always count on: They are something unique. Who should have thought that someone is writing about a hairdresser who cuts the throat of people and makes them meat pies? Sondheim did this and she did it wonderfully. The exhibition is set at the factory, which refers to the catastrophic consequences of the misery of the northern parts of society and serves the needs of the exhibition perfectly. To show streets and sidewalks and bridges, roof railings and guards are moved. Techniques are borrowed from Kabuki and Noh with visual stages and changes. Then, from the top down, throw a great Angela Lansbury gruesomely in practice and humorous Lovett and George Hearn with your operative baritone voice, like the murderous Todd, and you own a star musical vehicle. The rest cast smoothly through the story of love clichés, except Johanna and Pirelli, who sounds a bit too forced. If Johanna and Pirelli from Broadway show could be here, it would be perfect. Hearn acts when he sings more than in Len Cariou's OBC album, and the accents don't sound forced here. Through this, the Sondheim score never emphasizes the darkness of the story. As I said, he can adapt to every style. Folliesis imitates the style of the '30s' 40s styles, in Pacific races he hits Asian fine art, Into the Woods captures 32 bars of Disney style songs and Assassins covers American music history. Here, however, he does wonders to make his score clearly from English, from the songs of the salon to operative duets and soliloquies to society. And yet this exhibition is deadly serious, although it calls more laughter than any musical comedy. It's still a grim warning of revenge for evil. Here is where this film makes a mistake by cutting the judge's solo, where he punishes himself for the crime. Without it, the judge is just a normal villain and the idea of ​​the film is that there is no straight villain. Both Todd and the judge learn too late to be responsible for their actions, and Todd loses all of his obsession. This is also highlighted by the cooling of Sweeney Todd's re-rolling ballad, which finishes with an exhibition where Todd and Lovett rise from the grave to tell us that the end is the same: in a world full of Sweeneys, an easy vengeance revenge. "Take part in the story of Sweeney Todd. He served a God who is blind and revenge. Finding revenge can lead to hell, but everyone does it and rarely does Sweeney, like Sweeney Todd, the Fleet Street Demon Barber."
