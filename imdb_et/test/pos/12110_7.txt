The Rare Long-Term Role of the Kinski Function as a Crazy Johnny Sex-exhausted Legacy, Wanted in San Francisco. Kinski's character is obsessed with rape of women, a sexual predator in the western western part, who has nothing more than stealing, rape and killing him. This film can be a great disappointment for many western friends, but not for many fans of Klaus Kisnki. All in all, there were two things to do - this is a great result of the excellent music of Klaus Kinski and Stelvio Cipriani. <br /> <br /> Another story that needed a lot more work to be powerful but still fun to watch! <br /> <br /> It would be nice to see this movie again in the future. Because most of the old movies are being made again today.
