Paul Rudnick (Jeffrey, Addams' family values) wrote this awesome story about a mild wise school teacher (Kevin Kline), who has been awarded the Academy Awards by a former student-turned actor (Matt Dillon). The rest of the film deals with this setting with reversing absurdities - the impact on the city, its groom (Joan Cusack), himself and the climax all-loves-all finals. <br /> <br /> If you are an angry gay rights activist or naive youth who are looking for a precise image of a man to fight out or portray a gay life as "real", then save yourself in trouble and rent something else (or a beautiful thing) or read a book (Giovanni Room). If you can understand that this film is inspired by Tom Hanks' academic prize, when he won Philadelphia and had fun with Hollywood culture and small town ignorance, and you are fond of the 30's screw-up comedy (Holiday, Palm Beach Story) then enjoy! Far from being a biting satire, the movie Preston Sturges strives for the greatness of the farce and goes near the devil. No, it's not "deep" or "powerful" - neither Romy & Michelle, 9-5 nor Young Frankenstein - and it doesn't pretend; it keeps your tongue firmly in your cheek. It goes too preachy and maudlin to its end and sure some jokes are a bit hidden (there is also a dressing room scene that could have been cut), but after countless comedies that failed, it's like breath of fresh air. <br /> <br /> Kevin Kline and Tom Selleck are great at playing while Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley are adding good support. Great Joan Cusack's award-winning show is a star and big Bob Newhart is well Bob Bob. <br /> <br /> The fact that In & Out has been offended by many is just as absurd as the urban mindset that it amuses; Personally, Philadelphia was more offended by me. I take safe flames against holiness at any time.
