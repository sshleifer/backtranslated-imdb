The last underestimated film by Alberto De Martino ("The Antichrist", "The Killer is on the phone") is a truly intense but incomprehensibly neglected giallo that contains quite a lot of brands that make this Italian horror sub genre so excellent and addicted to fans. There are some very troublesome topics (child abuse, false priests?), Creepy moments, the plot's turn left and right, outstanding music and ?? last but not least? a handful of really sadistic murder sites! Especially the starting sequence, which is a prologue, a powerful fear! What is it with ordinary kids dolls that make them so horrible? When an anonymous man dressed like a priest attacked a little girl and his doll's broken head, pulled down the stairs, he really sent a cold shade through my back! Years later, a young girl from a prologue is an adult woman with a wheelchair. He made a lot of money, but uses his fortune to encourage people with disabilities to play sports and stay positive. He is? Joanna ?? falls in love with his personal trainer and they get married right away. Of course he is only for his money and is starting to terrorize Joanna, making him the trauma of his childhood that makes him exhausted. Recurring images of the priest of dirty stories and dirty views led by nursery schools provide "formulas for murder", where there are many real fears and the leadership of Alberto De Martino is very decisive. The action is quite competent, David Warbeck ("The Beyond", "The Black Cat") as a greedy greedy. Due to some plot holes and lack of originality, this film may not be able to compete with Italy's best horror efforts, but it certainly deserves more attention. Many previously hidden and unknown Italian gials got great DVD releases and hopefully the "soon form of murder" will be given as soon as possible. Meanwhile, luck with watching this child down!
