Slasher's films started 30 to 35 years before this movie, but I believe in the pearl that will last longer after turning on the TV. Especially if you are a person who just scares you, this movie is for you, for which you wouldn't be full of belly. Even after so many years, the film has not lost its charm and excitement. <br /> <br /> There is no blood, but the excitement will certainly cool your back. the movie starts with a bang and stays at the same pace until it finishes. BGM is a fracture of nerves and I remember that it was copied on many Indian films these days. Kings Favorites? No wonder why ... this is the only reason I wanted to see it and it didn't let me down. "Don't turn the lights off" ... if you can't find Enrique, but there may be a smiling doll who sits behind you! be careful. not lite with heart ... <br /> <br /> Two bumps and I'm going to 8 out of 10, which is quite low, but I still keep Dramas' ratings ...
