All those who call it "Elephant" under simple hanging - are there any other comments you can make about the film as individual films (regardless of its obvious similarity to other films). <Br /> <br /> All those who have doubts about the validity of a movie - stereotypical characters (mandatory gay, jock, disabled child, etc.) - I'm not sure how long it has been for school - but no matter how entertaining it is to act The events that go in one are surprisingly close to what can actually happen. <br /> <br /> And all those who ignore the movie as simple as that: only six young regular teenagers angst, pushing one edge ... no one stopped thinking, and note that the girl who took her life was not really one of those six !! As one comment suggests, he had a screen time of 2 min max (except for the last scenes). I think the idea of ​​the film is not only a question of teenage angst, but also how far anyone can take it - but also that it is not obvious who is always in danger of doing such an act (suicide) ...
