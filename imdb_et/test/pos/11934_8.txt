I saw this movie for the first time a year and a half ago and I loved it, I decided to get a DVD last year for my birthday. That's the right amount of money, action and drama. Regis School and it's full of rebellious children, where one child, William Tepper (Sean Astin), finds it difficult to adapt to previous rejection by other schools because they could not control their rebellious behavior, and now the school is randomly hit by terrorists due to more riots in Regis school Day and this is the real reason, because the head of Luis Cali (Andrew Divoff) has been sent to jail and the driver does everything, including killing pupils, bombs and so on to get back to his father. <br /> <br /> William Tepper is his rebel friends at Regis School, one especially Joey Trotta (Wil Wheaton), where he has a turbulent past living in the Mafia family and sending him to Regis School because he hates his father for Who is he and now he has to deal with the terrorists who take over the school, so William, Joey and his friends are together to prevent these terrorists from violent acts and dangerous tactics. /> <br /> This movie was really fantastic and I believe people should notice it more because if people think about a good hostage movie, they would say "Die Hard" and even if I had to agree with them, they must admit that Toy Soldiers was a good thriller, it was sure my heart was beaten because the students are my age and I'm afraid they would respond to the terrorists when they take over our school ... But in general, this movie is worth 112 minutes of its time and if I would have had a decision to rent or buy ... I'd buy it! I recommend that much leap! 8/10
