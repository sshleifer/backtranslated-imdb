Semper Fi! I saw "The D.I." Two and a half years later I joined the housing. <br /> <br /> The web and the company got it right as they could in '57. The boot, '59, was mostly exactly the same as the Boot Camp, which is shown in "Full Metal Jacket" - Yes. Black recruitment, at my training site, was called "snowball". I was called "Stick" because I was skinny like a railroad. Every recruiter had a nickname, some of the whistles he had with him in the Corps. Trapped or knocking on his ass was SOP. "Drop and give me fifty," I need to be ho. Then it changed "Drop and give me two hundred!" We are silly in MoFos when we win. In this "sadism" and all that D.I. it was or said it was aimed at his mission. <br /> <br /> Bad D.I. can be killed killed. A good DI, although it seems to be the world's biggest asshole, keeps alive. You can't kill an enemy if you're dead. If you don't know, Marine Corps has one primary task: to kill the enemy. PFD. <br /> <br /> Everything else is pure bravo sierra. <br /> <br /> MstGySgt WHT, USMC (ret)
