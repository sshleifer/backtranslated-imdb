I looked at Love Life on vacation when it was filmed at the Florida Film Festival. It was a lovely surprise to find a British film that was neither derived nor exploitative. A beautiful romantic comedy for change that captivates the audience's pants, ready to film and enjoy the delicate pace of the movie. Transitions between scenes I found a little disturbing, but I think Love Life is a dust ruby. One for the whole family. A pleasant change to see a British movie for teenagers who aren't full of four letters. Try it and see it.
