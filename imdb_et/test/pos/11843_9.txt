Joe (Wes) and Jim (Adam) will once again introduce us to the "most birds" beauty, isolation (both psychological and physical) and complete fear in the southwest of Navaho. Testimonials, settings, and plots are constantly being built. even if sometimes personal outsiders leave us "more". interesting alternatives "who did it?" Returns (eg Peter Fonda ... good to see him) give clues, but they don't go where you think. Comics (such as the preacher) are light and fit. When "Skinwalkers" and "Coyote Waits" start to drag. "Thief" grabs the clutch and quadricycle around the next corner, never quite sure what's there. Do not agree with Joe Leaphor's manic commentary on Jim Chee to "slow down" the wells. Wrong ... there are no wells in the plot, but watch the stories. In the next episode! Great photography (as always), appealing characters and more!
