I've seen this movie a couple of times and for every viewing, I still feel excited about going on a journey and frustrating trying to overcome obstacles that stop the way. It's more than just a desire to find a home; it is about the human spirit to find its way in the world, overcome despair, faced with fans of ours that hinder our goals. These people's aspirations are based on a review of the origin of life. Although this film is thoughtful with serious ideas, it has just enough comedic features to let the viewers leave. It's surprisingly funny. Realizing the story is great! It's all packed with visually engaging animation. A must see. <br /> <br />
