Having read and followed Gone With The Wind, it was very difficult for me to compare this movie with the original. Although I thought the novel Scarlett was great, it didn't add a movie. It was a completely different story. Of course, Leigh and Gable never have another Scarlett and Rhett, but the new actors did a good job. I loved how the book and film hit the story of Goni's wind, because after reading it, I was disappointed because it just stopped and left the readers thinking what happened. Scarlett finishes this story very well, and Alexandra Ripley did a great job with this book. I just want the film to follow the story even though it is big in itself.
