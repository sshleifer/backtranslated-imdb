Lackawanna Blues is a poor story about Nanny, a woman who gives everything to those in need. It has been said from a boy's point of view that Nanny took when his mother is not a real task. <br /> <br /> I have three main reasons for this movie: 1) it touches, but not gentle. It is said in a very real way, without much aggravating Hollywood storytelling. And the end is pretty good (tearful but not up). <br /> <br /> 2) Although it is clearly an African-American film placed with Lackawanna, New York, a post-segregation-black community, it does not carry its sleeve to its ethnic origin. The story is about the strength of these characters and the drama (and comedies) surrounding their lives. It's not preaching, it's just good. <br /> <br /> 3) It has a great soundtrack (you can't win an old school R&B and Chicago blues). <br /> <br /> Generally it works strong but not generally. Some of the performances just don't hold on to the characters the actors should show. But given that it was a TV movie, it is expected. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. Incomplete, but pleasant, good rainy day movie.
