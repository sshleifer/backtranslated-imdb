Shame on Fox to destroy this movie. It was a complete rebellion and I only hope he finds another life on a DVD and cable. <br /> <br /> It's a fun satire. It takes the "What if" situation to extremes and it does not pull any bumps (or swells into the groin). It makes you think ... what will become of this empire when we are completely lazy and stupid? Everyone can hit it. a number of big corporations and even Fox News are taking a hit (which is probably why the movie never had a good release - beyond the marketing department's campaign and not knowing how to market it), so we just give up! ") Some may find the movie sophomoric, thanks to flanking and farting, but the film is much more, you take what Mike Judge says, or you don't, most of the negative comments I read seem to come from people who just can't get it or there are movie shots. <br /> <br /> It probably plays for one week in selected markets, so if you forget it, stick to the DVD, it is worth renting and I finally have it in my collection. > <br /> Good work Mike judge, it's a shame you screwed, but you made me laugh out loud and look forward to the next movie.
