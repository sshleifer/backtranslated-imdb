Twins Effect - Chinese Action / Comedy - (Charlene Choi, Gillian Chung) <br /> <br /> This vampire comedy is one of my favorites because I was thoroughly entertained throughout the movie. First, the characters are memorable, giving a lot of classic scenes. Charlene and Gillian are, of course, cute, charismatic and humorous. This movie was my first contact with them, and all I wanted to do was get on my TV screen and gave them a really big layer. The remaining majority worked well in their support roles, including Jackie Chan, Karen Mok, Duke, Josie Ho, Edison Chen, Anthony Wong, and vampire bad guys (one of whom is familiar to Will Ferrell). Even the amazingly terrific Ekin Cheng was good in this field. Of course, good characters are important because they avoid the feeling of boredom by keeping things between the factors of interest. <br /> <br /> Speaking of action, this film has a lot. More importantly, the emphasis in quality choreography is on quality. One aspect that helped in this respect is the main character's weapon? sword with retractable rope. This weapon in itself opened up various moves that would otherwise have been impossible. In particular, Josie Ho and Gillian Chung are using some of these aircraft maneuvers using these devices. <br /> <br /> In addition, the sword game is great and is highlighted by two big sword fightings? one takes place at the train station opening and the other at the finale of the church. In fact, the blade-like maneuvers in this movie are disgraceful other highly valued fan choices and I really feel sorry for those who quote terribly choreographed garbage seen in the ashes of the time, storm bikers or invited man Hero with well-planned, precisely executed sequences that are seen in The Twins Effectis. It's not even close. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why this film criticizes. I am sure that hard hard apologists for the "golden age" of Hong Kong will hate it because it does not fit into their narrow-minded views that Hong Kong should have. We should learn from John Woo's fall - one trick pony who has never learned to reinvent himself. We don't need another clone. We need something else. Twins Effect is one good example. <br /> <br /> This movie was so good that it made me disappointed with other Chinese actors with the same actors and actors. This is especially true for Ekin Cheng, whose other films almost always suck? and yes, it includes the obscenely overrated and exploiting wuxia crapi mentioned in the previous paragraph. Even the twins have never been able to match the value of this film when both were the leading actors in the film, although they have succeeded in capturing some good movies when one or the other takes the lead (eg Beyond Our Ken, Good Times Bed Times, Fury) or if one or both support roles (eg color of truth, new police story, just one look). Twins Effect 2 should have been a direct sequel to family fantasy. I'm still longing to see Charlene and Gillian's team and defeat some butt in another movie, but the fact is that The Twins affects the hit on all cylinders by optimizing their charisma while avoiding going into resentment (like Protégé de la Rose Noire) All in all, this film has everything to attract. And let me remind the reader that this is the case? ENTERTAINMENT? which appreciates the size of the film, more than the artistic dramatic elements or the meaningless awards from the academies of established critics who usually have no idea what they are talking about. <br /> <br /> Finally, the Twins Effect CLASSIC must not be missed. <br /> <br /> Rating = 5/5 stars <br /> <br /> PS? Hollywood execs decided to kill this movie when it was released in the US, renaming it to Vampire Effect and cutting out 20 minutes of movie material, including some of the action scenes. However, the final version of the US version has a better sound than the original version. That's why I bought both versions that allow me to look at the original up to about 1:20 and then change the discs to see the final struggle in the US version.
