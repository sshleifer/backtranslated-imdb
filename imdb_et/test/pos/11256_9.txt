This movie was amazing. Never before have I seen such a film that brought me to such a harsh reality as drug use. There is no glamorous, sugar coating or glorious heroine. This film shows the real struggles, pains and losses that people undergo when dealing with this drug. Good movie, decent emotionally packed actor and great story. A lot to watch! <br /> <br />
