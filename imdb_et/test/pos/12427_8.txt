I saw it in the horror of Zone and waited for it to compete like most of the movies they played, but I was pleasantly surprised. The film revolves around 2 friends and a maniac monster in a truck that traces them (I know it sounds nasty, but actually it's pretty good), the movie is horrible when it wants to be and laughs out loud in funny parts (and not inadvertently it's well paced and very fun and very gentle, it is also a very funny black humor, who is not the most original film, but what if it is after Shakespeare then if you had a good movie then it should be good
