Satisfying fantasy with boats that crush the clouds through cannons, evil potters, strange landscapes, time manipulations, amazing sets, the nonsense of reality, maybe like an endless story or some Merlin stuff. If you like it, you love it. Christine Taylor is beautiful. The sword fight is confusing. The music is nice. Good wins, they can, everything is fine and the chef is happy.
