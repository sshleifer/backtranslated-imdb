A touching documentary that puts a human face on the tragedy of September 11, showing how a small community tied two of the missing high school friends that day. In the film, Chris and Tom intertwine life with interviews with families and friends and fragments of old photographs. Through our memories, we look at two tragically short lives. The film also documented how, through random series, an inspiring memorial building was brought about by the efforts of many people, both known and unknown to the victims. Through laughter and tears (and sweat) we see the power of hope and glory and love. These films evoke many different emotions, but the last feeling is the admiration of a human spirit that is trapped by tragedy.
