Wow! My mother bought this movie for me because it was really cheap for sale in a shop in my town and she knows I love scary movies. First I looked at the cover and sighed, thinking it was a normal B movie that was trying to be scary. I was so wrong! I made a big mistake, watching it alone, my parents and my brother slept and it was really late. After I saw a movie that was so scared, I shook ... I didn't even dare to take out a video camera and take out a videotape! I slept with lights ... <br /> <br /> This movie's main story is some teenagers who drive off the road and have to spend the night in the woods telling horrible stories ... The first story is really scary, and it makes you hug a pillow very hard when you look at it alone. The second story is also scary, but not the same as the first one. The third story (my favorite) is really very scary. It scared me most of the stories. It's about a man who rides a motorcycle across the country. One night, when there is a storm out there, he goes to the nearest house and hits the door. The girl opens and she is silent. Don't want to tell you more, but you get chills when you look at it (I might add that my heartbeats were really abnormal when I watched it). The main story of "Campfire Tales" is a really interesting and surprising end. I know some guys said they were sucking, but I, my boyfriend and my friends, loved it, and it was a long time when we scared it. Rating: 10/10, by the way, it's not like Urban Legend all, it's so much more terrible.
