When I first saw this movie in mid-January (2005), I didn't like it. I thought it was too weird and thought some of the parts that the head star, Judith Light, were doing, were so different. (What of course is true) And then I watched this bit the next day, when it was re-incited and I felt quite the same. Then I looked at it two more Sundays (March 20, 2005) and I really started to enjoy it, and this time I stuck the whole thing. I even called the first 2 times, but mainly because the actor was actually crying and I'm his big fan. <br /> <br /> This is a very well done and made TV movie. Judith Light is one of my favorite actors and I think she's doing a great job in this movie! I look at it over and over again. This is a sad film, but very good. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie, I'd definitely recommend it! It's not usually my movie type, but I enjoyed it! A +++
