The surface was fantastic, I don't know how many Mondays I lived in school, but I was thinking about a new surface episode. I loved it, sometimes I had to call home and tell my mom to paste it for me. I was quite upset when I heard it was canceled. So, they may have their new Tina fay comedy (you couldn't look at it, I think that seeing the ads made me sad). I miss my Surface on Monday night, even if my sister is funny for me. although the kidnapped doesn't look good and still has L&O: SVU (I think I still have to check) (I wrote only two lines above because they said I needed ten lines).
