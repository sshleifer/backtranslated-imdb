This brass EYE special PAEDO-GEDDON was the subject of complaints (later on) when it was transmitted in 2001 after a national debate on a possible "Sarah" law after the abduction and murder of a school girl Sarah Payne. In fact, this schedule is late, while Phil Collins took legal advice when he discovered that the exhibition producer Chris Morris is cheating on this campaign "Nonce-sense <br /> <br /> it is said that this exhibition is probably more reminiscent of contradiction than content , which has a very bad taste, but I testify that I laughed out loud.Publication focuses on pedophiles and how society treats them and their victims. Chris Morris plays a speaker who tells the audience that the infamous pedophile is being opened into space, and admits that eight A year-old child is randomly placed in a capsule with a pedophile ... Cue a child's frightened screams Like I said in a very bad taste <br /> <br /> Other highlighted events are Dr. Fox, who gives a scientific lecture that pedophiles share a system identical to crabs ("Someone does not know it, but it is a scientific fact ") MP Barbara Follet gave a public warning about the pedophiles that made their genitals surf the net ama, and Kate Thornton warns viewers that pedophiles can send gas through the internet, which makes toddlers against sexual predators, including one victim "Who was once a shy innocent child and now has 60 years of colonial sexuality. Morris also shows the police officer a serious photograph of the child protection system that wants to know whether they are classified as nil. The photos included the image of a Barbie and a young boy's head with a marriage aid, a dog's body, and an erected penis that could only belong to John Holmes. Hey, I've never said that this show was tasteful? <br /> <br /> It is impossible to mention PAEDO-GEDDON without the hypocritical fall that surrounded the politicians, children's organizations and policemen rushed to condemn the exhibition for a very serious issue. The show was a bad taste despite the fact that I smiled through it, but it is a biting satire. Perhaps critics should look into the mirror for a long time, when a liberal elite allows mourned pedophiles to walk through the streets of Great Britain before they simply criticize TV programs for increasing tension.
