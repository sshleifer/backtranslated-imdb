It is a multifaceted, incomprehensible and bold story about the life of a patient with schizophrenia, their (and our) perception and reality. Although the main theme revolves around a deceptive young woman, this story fascinates with physics, medicine, religion, and even politics, because it doubts our understanding of what is true and what is real. Konkona Sensharma beautifully conveys that the world of Mith is alive, as real as her own. In this world he is logical and his thoughts are internally consistent, not the ones that seem to us in our world. <br /> <br /> Here are some outstanding scenes to watch while watching a movie (don't worry, they are not spoilers). I absolutely loved how Aparna Sen made these comments. <br /> <br /> - References to quantum mechanics and relativity mixed with a witch physician ("ojha" in Hindi) who performs his religious rituals that he believes drives "ghosts" that sit in Mith's brain. <br /> <br /> - The doctor who prescribes shock treatment as a "credible" solution. <br /> <br /> - Perception windows - A scene for reviewing Anu's book. <br /> <br /> - A reference to the illusion of a director looking for "maya". <br /> <br /> - George Bush's news that tells the world that "undoubtedly" is that there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq (now it is not so much about Bush's perception that I suspect it's true, like a gullible public perception of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.) <br /> <br /> - One of the best scenes in the movie is where Mith tells Anu that "Charu sent this man to beat me" and Anu leaves it back of course. Konkona did a fantastic job of unraveling the strange thoughts of schizophrenic brain when his world and the real world clash. <br /> <br /> Aparna Sen was brave, but not brave enough to raise one big question: Are almost all humanities mistaken to believe in God? He could have added some scenes from "normal", "healthy" people who prayed and sacrificed to the creature that no one has ever seen or heard all of human history (the ritual / exorcism scene does not go far enough). That would be the final question: what is normal? Who are reality, believers or atheists? <br /> <br /> IMHO, this film is a much more complex study of schizophrenic mind than "beautiful mind". It looks not only at the sick person's thoughts, but at the whole, and it does so from many different angles and illuminates our understanding of our thoughts and world. If the former got 4 Oscars, it deserves more - At least one story, scenario, direction, Konkona and Shabana Azmi. Watching this movie was really worthwhile and I am happy to have bought my collection for the DVD. <br /> <br /> It was a very good story.
