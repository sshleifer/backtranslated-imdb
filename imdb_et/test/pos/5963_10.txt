Wladyslaw Starewicz was a Russian-speaking animator who lived in France, making incredible things with stop-motion. I've seen a couple of these movies and have their favorite objects - insects, frogs and different animals. They are extremely realistic and viable and even today it is amazing to see - the quality is just fantastic. <br /> <br /> This one stars many and many frogs. They turn to their god, Jupiter, to give them a king. Why they need a king, Jupiter admires - their lives are now perfectly good. So, to teach them a nasty lesson, he makes Egret King and one by one he eats his subjects! Then the frogs turn to Jupiter, who claims the obvious moral that it is best to be content with what you have! <br /> <br /> While the quality of the animation is incredible, it is a very creepy film for children. I think it scares them when the animals are real, as well as the story itself that is not with a weak heart!
