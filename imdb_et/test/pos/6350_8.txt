The story of a teacher who has a relationship with a student is spoken finely, which distinguishes it from most of the films in this plot. Mr. Lam (Jacky Cheung) communicates with Choy (Karena Lam, who was also "Komas" so good), which at first seems to be an inexplicable situation. She's been married to Ching for 20 years (big Anita Mui, last role before she was brutally taken), and it seems to be a loving relationship. When Ching takes care of himself, and Mr. Lam's former teacher, Choy and Mr. Lam can be together. What makes the film so good is director Ann Hui's pace. It takes some time to discover Lamsm's secrets, and it's all reasonable. The film is very dramatic and touching. You do not feel any setback to the teacher / student situation that raises this film with one of the same plots. It moves slowly but stay with it. Also enjoy the wonderful, strange but beautiful action of Mrs Mui. He was and is really special and you love him in this movie last time. It is worth the time to witness and just be with him.
