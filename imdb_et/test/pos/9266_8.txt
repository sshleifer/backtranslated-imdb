This movie is so different from anything you could have seen before. It is an honest and cooling report on the whole family, related to a terminal illness. <br /> <br /> "Closer to it" captures a very unique style. Craig Oulette's films are very different ... using different perspectives and perspectives, which I think are very prominent (perhaps due to his photographic experience). <br /> <br /> His style provides such a clear picture not only of what the patient is facing, but also of those close to them. Very sad, but very interesting and unique film. I would definitely recommend a look.
