I don't care particularly about Michael Jackson. In addition to the pedophile, I really don't like his music except for some songs from his landmark album, THRILLER. This is one of them. I like this video because it is one of the first and most important music videos ever made. <br /> <br /> This was led by John Land, who is the most well-known fan of American America's WEREWOLF IN London. This music video is not just a music video, but a more or less short horror movie. M.J. and his date is in the werewolf movie. When they leave the film, they are attacked by the horde of bloody zombies when Michael Jackson makes his famous "Thriller" dance. <br /> <br /> You know it's a pretty good song with good synthesized shocks. This and the "Beat It" are probably the only two Michael Jackson songs that I do more and more. I especially love Vincent Price as a narrator. Her special voice is perfect for horror-themed music videos. Even if you don't like M.J. music, you must see this video at least once. By the way, she was good before she became a horrible nose with a horrible white woman.
