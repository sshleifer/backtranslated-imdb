Just cute. It's long. No climax. Don't expect anything to happen. Great on a rainy day. A person who lives in the midst of a crisis in life, bringing his family to a single area on the Greek islands. I saw it in my teens and still love it 20 years later. I have not found it in video stores, however. Molly Ringwald is a lovely middle-aged teenager who basically wants to go home and then get to that place. There are no phones, TV, boredom that a person with such silence must be bored and then reflect. And every character does it. Susan Sarandon plays a beautiful woman who wants to be sexually related to John Cassavetes, but she doesn't know well. Gina Rowlands, this is a woman who loves her but has almost to give up marriage. He's demanding and frustrating for everyone. There is another character in the film, a Greek who talks about sex inappropriately with Molly Ringwald, but about the things she is interested in. But he is irritating and horny and I didn't like that character. The film's location is so good. It wouldn't work if filmed elsewhere. I recommend this movie and give it 9 on a scale of 1 to 10.
