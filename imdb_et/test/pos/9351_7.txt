** SPOILERS ** In fact, the novel "Brick Foxhole" is based on a gay man who was killed because of his sexual orientation on vacation. Crossfire is a violently anti-Semitic GI who, due to his failures and life's frustrations, pulls them to persuade the Jews. Who he probably feels threatened with. <br /> <br /> Equipping your local ginmill with DC-barley US military Montgomrey, Robert Ryan, takes Joseph Samuel, Sam Leven, and is getting a little bit more sarcastic, friendly with him. It seems that Montgomery has noticed Samuels slightly because he talks to his best friend and friend Arthur Mitchell, George Cooper. Samuel is also going through what Neanderthal Montgomery does not get, for sensitive young GIs who have entered the art, he is an artist and painter, a war, a war that ended in World War II. If this is the dawn of a nuclear bomb, and what is trembling peace, it will now follow this very dangerous and unstable world. What really makes Montgomery more than anything else about Samuels is that he is probably a Jew. The fact that more than anything else is a good reason why racist Montgomery wants to make Samuels. <br /> <br /> The mules who invite Mitchell to join her and her lady Miss Lewis, Marlow Dwyer, have a couple of drinks in her apartment and continue the very deep and stimulating conversation they started at the bar. It seems very jealous and feeling injured and Montgomery rejection with his compassionate but somewhat unsuccessful Montgomery plans for Samuels, friend and fellow GI Floyd Bowers, Steve Brodie, later that night to Samuels. place. <br /> <br /> When the party was over, Mitchell and Miss Lewis went into two very drunken GIs terribly. The fact that Samuels was Montgomery ill and anti-Semitic, stole Mitchell away from him to whip him into a white hot crazy. Montgomery and Bowers invade Samuel's home, where he attacks his good stacking cabinets with Montgomery, taking a few flights against Samuel's strong objections. Montgomery is used to getting used to. All of this will soon lead to an angry psychotic and drunken Montgomery violent and brutal attack on Samuels, where Bowers pulled out all of his consumed fluid that overcomes the death of a poor and innocent person. <br /> <br> The Crossfire movie goes long and tedious, since it is obvious from the beginning who is the Samuels killer, investigating why Samuels wounded and adorned a WWII veteran who had a purple heart in the Okinawa Battle who acts as he is really interested, certainly find the Samuels killer, which is actually himself. This so-called voluntarily acted on the part of Montgomery to throw in suspicion that he might be the man who killed him. <br /> <br /> Montgomery is so ridiculous and even that somebody who thinks he's very smart is constantly open to him and opens his big stage and forcing anti-Semitic and racist epitaphs and murdered on murdered Samuelside! It only casts doubt on yourself and someone else. I think this guy just couldn't help. <br /> <br /> It is not enough for Montgomery to murder Samuels, who was one of his ill-minded people, who even killed his friend by death, accusing him. Samuels murder, Bowers! Who in Montgomery's Racist Mindset is one of us! Just because he was afraid, Bowers would talk to the police to rescue his regrets and thus focus on the death of Montgomey Samuel. <br /> <br /> It doesn't take so long for a detective in Capt Finlay, Robert Young to see Montgomerys' obvious lies and deceptions, and then he has created a new GI friend with his Leroy (William Phipps) who was joking about all his foolish and racist jokes, he made a lofty slip. This is where Montgomery returns to the scene of his crime, where he murdered Bower, where he had a trap. It was all Captain Finlay, who had to go to Montgomery panic when Montgomery saw the spider was up, and do it right in the cross-section of the police attack. <br /> <br /> The date is a bit now, but in 1947 when it was released it was very difficult. "Crossfire" dealt with the horrors of anti-Semitism when it was kept under cover and invisibly at that time, in almost every post-war Hollywood movie about the evil of racism in the US and Europe. Even after World War II and what happened to the Jews. If he had to give the public film a very full and honest exhibitor, it would have been so well served.
