Like many movies, my non-Catholicism became my understanding. The Church has rules that have been assembled over the centuries. We have a short time to learn and accept them at face value. Then throw some bad guys out for revenge for their long distant acts, working according to these rules and trying to circumvent them, and you have this book and movie. I found myself thinking, "It's pretty cool. Why did they do that?" The character of Robert Langdon has this random thing, where there is no question what it is that he always makes the right first move. I think it's like looking at the CSI, where they solve incredibly complex cases within a few days. They know the layout of the land. There's so much land in this movie and so little time to really understand what's going on. But when you create Robert Langdon, you have to put him to work. This is OK because the heroes joke as he has saved the day forever. I thought the movie was fun. I thought the Da Vinci code was fun. Interesting and not as bad as people thought. It's admiration to watch and never stop.
