With Army !, this is one of Pauly Shore's best movies, if there is one. While the whole West Coast meeting - Midwest-Cultural Collision is nothing new, this film proves that the story is a bit more fun with the fresh Shore's natural and unpredictable manifestations. Although the change in values ​​would probably have gone to the other side, the whole concept was quite fun. Not only was Shore's family interaction fun, but also Carla Gugino and Tiffani-Amber Theissen (she's always in Amber's book) in two enthusiastic and early roles. In one of these films I have no problem watching TV.
