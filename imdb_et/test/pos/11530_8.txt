It's 1969. Phoebe (Camilla Belle) is an 11-year-old girl who is growing up with an ideal vision of her 19-year-old sister Faith (Cameron Diaz). Faith is the maker, the search for truth, the fixer of all lies of the world. Then one day Phoebe and his mother Gail (Blythe Danner) will say that faith is dead. Faith has killed itself. Both Phoebe and Gail are puzzled by this news and, sadly, Gail is mourning. Phoebe can't get this. Phoebe decides to go to Europe and find out what happened. <br /> <br /> It is now 1977. Phoebe (Jordana Brewster) is 18 years old and decides to go to his mother's objections to Europe to discover the truth. When in life Faith was an integral man he called "Wolf" (Christopher Eccleston). Although Wolf claimed that he didn't know anything about the last days of faith, Phoebe persuades him to talk about everything. Within a few days, Wolf understands that he has not let go of the past, and he joins Phoeb with his pilgrimage to Portugal. <br /> <br /> Finally, Wolf is able to talk about the dignity of religion in drug abuse and his own guilt for suicide prevention. Though it is angry, Phoebe finally understands how human and fragile faith really was. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. I'm old enough to remember the Red Army bank robberies and I was in 1969 for ten years. This story was familiar to me. I still remember young men trying to decide whether or not they should go to Canada to avoid a draft. <br /> <br /> The story is simple, but it probably happened several times in real life. Camilla Belle was enjoyable and fun to see when she portrayed the excitement of a young adorable sister around her. Jordana Brewster easily slipped into the role of parent Phoebe. Blythe Danner was still a supportive mother, who unfortunately has a familiar role on American television. I would have wanted him to work with a stronger material. Cameron Diaz played an immature anarchist perfectly. Sometimes the presentation of his 1960s activists seemed out of the news reel. Of all characters, Christopher Eccleston's wolf grew the most. When we introduce the sign at the beginning of the film, we see that he is a man of reputation. He is a patient and kind person who is full of anger for the injustice of the world. Finally, he understands the direction he and his faith have erred and begins to "grow" in deciding that he should fight injustice in his own way. Faith refuses to join it and eventually leads to his death. Eccleston's wolf is the most realistic of all characters. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. It was enjoyable and thought provocative. "The Invisible Circus" is rated TV-MA, but it has very little passion, sex or violence. The theme of the film is the reason for the rating.
