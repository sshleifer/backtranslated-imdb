At the end of the 60s and 70s, I grew up, but I couldn't get a fiction fan. The American Space Program's top-notch move, sci-fi books, movies, TV shows and comics boosted my imagination and opened up my mindset to the possibilities that exist in the universe. Farscape is so different from other sci-fi shows, but it has all the ingredients that show like Star Trek, Battlestar Gallatica, X-Files and Deep Space Nine. One of Farscape's criticisms is that a casual viewer can't just jump and watch one episode and understand what's going on. There have also been other very successful exhibitions using several episode arches and complex signs. This is one of the charms of the exhibition for me. I don't need or want this story to be properly linked at the end of every episode, as has been done by the different Star Trek incarnations. All in all, Farscape has wonderful and funny characters and a running story that says that although people in the universe can be the least developed or developed intelligent species, they still have unique qualities and abilities. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, short-sighted people on the Sci-Fi channel have canceled Farscape's 5th season. They have said that cancellation is based on falling ratings. But only a few years ago, it was the original series of their highest rating and a critical favorite. It is a disgrace that all the artists who are helping to create this exhibition are unable to continue their work of love because of the fiscal problems of the channel / company that made it possible first. <br /> <br /> Hey, don't take my word, look at the show, look again and do your mind. Help save Farscape!
