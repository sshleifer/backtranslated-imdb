I've never been a great fan of Oliver Stone, often because I've found that his films are forced, preaching, and generally flawed. The two stone films I really like are JFK and Talk Radio, but Talk Radio takes the stone's best achievements. Stone is a director with whom you are a fan or you are not, it is safe to say that before talking to Talk Radio, I was not a guy and did not consider one of the most appreciated companies in the film industry, although some of my ideas have changed since Talk Radio. Talk radio is an amazing and amusing attack on what is now called a "reality TV". <br /> <br /> Talk radio follows a self-conscious, distracting, determined, hysterical, outrageous and puzzling radio station called Barry Champlain who hosts Dallas's controversial late night. Quickly becoming known for the presence of his bold and peculiar air, he becomes late at night, causing the junkies, criminals, racists, sociopaths, sick, pervers, and mores to incite ridicule. The film shows the rise and fall of a man's career, making a careful picture of freedom of expression. Originally staged, the film itself plays the theme of the theater, which was originally rebuilt, perfectly transmitting the film's acute character. <br /> <br /> Talk radio with fierce energy and non-stereotypical air brings all the funny media. It is even more enjoyable today than in the late 1980s. The film goes deeper by studying the similarities between arrogance, self-obsession, offensive behavior, contradictions, hypocrisy, and ignorance. The film shows in a controlled way how good it is to have personal opinion and freedom of speech, but that is something that should be used wisely, not disgracefully blunt. Stone is trying to show how freedom of expression is crucial in life, but we should be careful and cautious. The film asks: "Is our main protagonist the same as the sad people who present the exhibition?" Stone fabulously creates a movie with a key set (radio station) in an ambitious and cold atmosphere. He then succeeds in capturing the isolation, fear, ambiguity and dangerous emotions built into the radio station. Eric Bogosian is a perfectly cast isolated, self-absorbing and complicated genius, Barry Champlain. He fits his role, leaving his lines behind with enthusiasm, urgency, embarrassment, brusqueness and the bitter fun of his offensive nature. There are sparks in the performance that apparently were abducted from an Oscar candidate. His voice fits the character, being that the primary element of the radio network and its ability to act with tragedy and comedy work perfectly. <br /> <br /> Stone's films have strong use and Talk Radio is proud of some of its purer, most rhythmic edits. It uses a beautifully managed camera technique that differs from a calm and sudden turbulent change. Behind the film is the lively energy that the raw and wonderfully delightful script works in the middle of the film's size. The striking and virtuous cinematography stands out in the studio and beyond, the most impressive at night in the city. Do not forget the forgetting heartbreaking and still darkly funny "downfall" of climate is ultimately a remarkable cinema. <br /> <br /> Talk radio is an important contemporary masterpiece, I'm sure you'll be surprised at how big it is. I recommend Talk Radio to all people interested in the media or movies. Talk radio is a good example of cutting-edge, intellectual and insightful entertainment that still offers a well-earned wake-up call. Finally, if it wasn't for Eric Bogosian, the film wouldn't be such a fun, pleasant and enduring masterpiece that is today.
