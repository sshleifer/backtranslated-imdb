In 1982, on television in Los Angeles, this is probably the best example of the music of the filmed production you are likely to encounter. It was released on DVD in 2004 in remastered digital broadcast. Hearn and Lansbury give their lives and the rest is obviously in power generation. Of course, this is Sondheim's music and words have done it. If anyone doubts that he is one of the "bigger" musical forms of America, listen to it. Sets are harsh, like a primer, and smart to enable a quick change of scene, and the cameras strive for action without losing the stage. The central, moving and rotating platform is in the shop of Mrs. Lovett's, where there is a hairdressing shop upstairs. Around it are various lifts and moving stairs that allow the rest of the activities to take place. The brutal story of injustice that brings revenge, murder and chaos is freely spiced with dark humor and comic. For hairdressers, Sondheim does what Hitchcock did in the shower! An important performance of the American music theater is an electric performance here.
