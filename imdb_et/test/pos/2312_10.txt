I've lost sight of this movie, but I love it and find it very funny. Facial expressions, sloppy humor and the timing of jokes make it great. The stars, especially "Nitro", "Sonar" and "Stepanik" are fun. I thought Kelsey's grammar, Rip Torn and Bruce Dern did a great job. In fact, I think this film was completely cast. I think it must be released on DVD before VHS is removed.
