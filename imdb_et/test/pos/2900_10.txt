I bet I'll watch this movie 4 or 5 times a year and do it more often, now that Hollyweird's moguls have seen the DVD fit because it is a classic with the capital C! This movie is timeless! How can people now pay $ 10.00 to see JUNK coming out of Hollyweird like Egyptian movies; TRANSFERS; BEN HUR; CAPTAIN NEWMAN on MD tape; DVD; and cable film channels; I could go on forever, but this movie is so big and, for the relative unknown, Edmund Purdom carries a film like Atlas wore the world. The story is wonderful, the actor is first-rate and the graphics at the end are so powerful that you sit for a couple of minutes, just trying to let the words sink! Indeed, crowding out the movie. I'd give that 15 stars if they let me! They don't make them any longer, but they should !!!!!
