This movie was advertised as a comedy, but it was much more serious than the trailers. Don't make me wrong, I enjoyed the movie, but waited more to laugh. Great performances by Robin Williams and Laura Linneys. It's worth noting, but don't wait for me to run on the floor. The film left me thinking what would be like Robin Williams's character who was in front of the president. Would we choose a comedian? Unfortunately, I doubt. Such harsh honesty today is largely inadequate. This is a movie that I will add to my DVD library as soon as it appears on the DVD. The film has a heart.
