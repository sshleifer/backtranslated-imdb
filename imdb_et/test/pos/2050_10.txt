It's a movie that's actually my all-time favorite. I'm not a fan of Renny Harlin because most of his movies are sucking, but TLKG hits his mark from time to time. TLKG is about a woman named Samantha Cain (Davis) who suffers from amnesia. she is married to a child and when she qoutes "I'm a fucking member of PTA." and then his world falls down when the pieces fall over their previous identity. Samuel Jackson plays the artist's policeman who performs PI concerts, is dragged to solve his identity and pay for money. along the way we learn that Samantha is really Charlie Baltimore, a secret spy that has been dead for years. The plot is big, making this story real and Jackson is doing a great job for Davis's second five. explosions are endless, the action is intertwined with a memorable scene. a pretty impressive visual visit, even though the child got to his nerves at the end (watch out for cars!) I'm tired of having kids to save the movie, but still, this movie is worth it when the child adds to the movie. Again, this movie is really good, I have never understood why he didn't do more at the box office, but if it was a man starring in the movie, then I'm sure it would be hundreds of millions. the good thing is that over the years people discover this movie and give it good signs because the average of this movie has risen on this site over the years. I hope it will continue to rise because it is one big movie. and i love action movies
