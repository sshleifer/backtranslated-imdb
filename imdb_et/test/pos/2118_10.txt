I loved this movie. My daughter is 3 1/2 and her girlfriend is heartfelt. There are no movies for babies. I loved it because it was the worst thing when one of the boys said "stupid." I thank them for taking out and making a real family film. I rented it for the first time when we saw it and we know we want to add our collection. My daughter can't talk about it. It goes with our lifestyle. We live in East Texas. I hope to see more of these family movies. He even named one of our calves "Hokey Pokey Keen" !!! I can't say enough about this movie. Look forward to many movies like this.
