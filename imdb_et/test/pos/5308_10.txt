Leland USA was an amazing film. I left it on the instructions on my TV without knowing what it was and who never had the opportunity to sit there and get there. Then I saw one morning when I woke up early to see that it was beginning. So I decided to look at it. I had the time and interest to see it. When I saw Ryan Gosling in the movie and being the main character, he was sucked in and could not move on his couch. The struggle that Leland goes through is such an inspiring story. Everyone needs to deal with the same type of thoughts throughout their life, be it a small little detail or something as big as it goes through. I have to sit and watch the movie to catch all the things I missed for the first time. As a general comment ... I recommend this movie to anyone who is a Gosling fan or someone who just loves a good movie with a real good story. The fact that there are so many other big stars who all had great performances has just added BONUS! So take the time to watch this movie, I can almost be sure it's not a waste of time.
