I was able to see the MTV premiere of this movie last night and I have to tell everyone that this movie was a thunderstorm. Apparently, this movie's fans of D will enjoy it because it has a lot of fun for those who have seen HBO series and who have more than enough for new fans and soon convertible masses. Music excels with new songs "Kickapoo" (which is much better than it sounds), "Master Exploder" (perhaps the 3rd best song in the world) and "Dude (I miss you)". There are many great scenes (car chasing, rock-off, meeting) and cameos (including Dave Grohl as Satan!). I really could go on to the lesson, but I don't want to give the film. Look at this. You don't have to be disappointed.
