I like. Steve Zahn like Gus, part of the nail, copies Robert Duvalls' motifs, making him more comfortable for fans of Gusi. (some other participants also copy the style of their predecessors to this series). Karl Urban, looks gloomy and harsh, but can also break the jokes and smiles that T.Jones made in his original series. Gear, weapons, clothing, all accurate or very close periods. I'll never forgive Costner and Duvall for having an open-loop nylon cover. Comanches, they actually sail bareback, instead of concealing a modern saddle under the Navajo decks. And they have not been painted as politically correct pastoral pastures for peace, but as proud warriors. There are some foolish scenes, but it wins the cage with another variation to make a fool to win a million dollar reality game.
