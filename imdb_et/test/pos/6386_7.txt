An unusual film that begins with the classic assumption of a hooligan marrying a girl who loves her to escape the country. But the twist will soon be reversed soon. Most of the film hits the better buttons: the story is progressing smoothly, functioning is certain (Sienna Miller's pulling is invaluable, she can really act!), Chemistry of both leaders works and making American landscapes and peculiar side marks makes a good time. A mood that starts lightly and romantic sometimes sometimes gets darker and even brighter. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the pace slows down just more than we'd like, but don't let it stop this unusual little cinematography. Alexandre Montin, Paris
