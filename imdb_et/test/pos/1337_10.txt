Hey, what are you waiting for in a very low budget movie!?!? Although I haven't seen "Dahmer" (2002), I can say that what the media put on Jeff is quite accurate. I have learned the case of Jeffrey Dahmer and learned everything you can do about this man. This is a low-budget movie, but it shows the serum killer mentality. When you get past and see what is the underlying story of the sick spirit. I loved this movie! Just keep yourself low on budget and blood. It is the story we saw through the killer's eyes and his actions and thoughts from childhood to his arrest. My favorite line is: "If they were bothered to look back, he could have saved a lot of lives" Enjoy!
