Valentine, a model in France, is separated from her lover who is abroad, planning to meet in England, but seems to be farther away as the film progresses. One evening after the collapse of his colleague's passport he hits a dog named Rita. The dog survives and returns to his owner, a hostile retired judge who lives in a hermit and eavesdropper, listening to conversations with all his neighbors. He becomes interesting because of this person's nature and often visits him, often being part of his interception games. One conversation that the two listen to, however, is extremely important, the conversation between the young people will soon be a judge and his wife, which we find in parallel with the life of the person they are listening to. If we learn more about the couple, the man will reveal more of his story, then continue his story and explain whether the two men will continue the same fate. Valentine does not know how her life, this meeting and the fate of a young judge come into contact. The dog on that day strikes his fate, the divine sacrifice that the dog gave to his owner, allowing Valentin to be the savior of a younger judge who travels the same way as his dear friend to prevent him from such a gloomy future full of loneliness and loneliness. After all, the old man's dream seems to be true and he can smile in his day with his smile. <br /> <br /> AMAZING finale, which can be the best trilogy of all time! Kieslowski won't stop me anymore. He is one of my favorite leaders and one of the most talented directors in cinema history. The use of French flag colors in three films was not incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art. Three visually more attractive films I've ever seen. And his fine connections between the three films are awesome. Typically, a penis break or a late focus on a scene is marked, to see if you can see some on the spot. I have to mention it and it's a big SPOILER, I loved the end of how the characters of the three movies were the survivors of the ferry catastrophe, along with Valentine and the young judge and the old one who watched it on TV, securing their happiness for the many years of suffering. I couldn't think of a better way to finish the movie, but with a smile, a great way to cover amazing movie and trilogy! I recommend it to anyone who loves a movie, a movie, something ... Artwork! 10 for 10 movies and trilogy.
