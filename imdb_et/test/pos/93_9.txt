A boy who adores Maurice Richard from the Canadien of Montreal gets a lot in his horror by posting a Toronto Maple Leaf sweater. Recently I watched it in a class where few students were interested in ice hockey, but almost everyone knew Maurice Richard and the Toronto / Montreal competition. Very fun, fun and accurate.
