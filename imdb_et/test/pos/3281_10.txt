Trey's favorite since the first race of the 10th season and also one of my personal favorites, Manbearpig includes Al Gore's adventure before global warming, and before the movie was a similar adventure, Al Gore also tried to make the world aware of something that could change Earth, something very dangerous , this time, something that is half a half bear and a half pig, Al Gore had only one thing: to make all Manbearpigi aware and kill! Al Gore here is more than fun, anyone who sees him feels unhappy and yes, he can do childish because nobody believes in him, but he's just f ******. Basically, Al Gore's fourth child is trapped in a cave, but he's definitely not that there is no room in his mind for any other topic, just Manbearpig, which concerns Al Gore. These four children are Cartman, Kenny, Kyle and Stan, basically Stan felt sorry for AL Gore and four boys were just playing in Al Gore, where Gore could not kill almost when he tried to kill Manbearpig (a fun scene). they are just kids, damn manbearpig ") So in this respect we have, on the one hand, all things related to rescue workers who feel sorry for Al Gore and on the other hand we have little but extremely fun Cartman episode and Cartman attitude not Surprise after finding her treasure in the cave, sure all this treasure is awesome and great because you can see the sick Cartman in both minds, she is really sick for the boys and very sick for us. And finally kills Al Gore Manbearpig! Amazing fun in this episode, tremendously observable
