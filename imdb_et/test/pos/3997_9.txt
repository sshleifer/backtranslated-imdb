Not sure why the second comment about this movie was so negative, but I loved this movie. I am an Asian art student who especially loves Korean art, culture and history. I thought this film was very controversial and interesting for life. Jang Seung-up is one of (perhaps) the most famous Korean artists and continues to be a champion. Given the time he painted, and his own contradictory nature, it is amazing that he did so much work in so many styles and skills. This film respects his talent by looking directly at his uneven and somewhat self-destructive personality. In my opinion, cinematography was beautiful, many of the outdoor panoramic images looked like Korean landscape paintings (which I found rather cozy, not "too artistic"), and I think Choi Min-jan depicted Jang Seun-up with the necessary intensity and unpredictability. I would recommend this film to both art lovers and film students.
