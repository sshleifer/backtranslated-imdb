I don't know what the last reviewer is talking about, but this show is pure entertainment. Basically, two clubs put the club in the competition to pick up the girls in 3 different scenarios. They interfere with each scenario so that it is not the same every time. A panel of four judges is not afraid to summon people or admit they admit it. They break what the boy did wrong and what they did right. Some competitors are weak, some are strong, but what happens is always fun. If you are a man who goes out, you can communicate with it. I've seen a weak game, I've seen a strong game and this show is real. No doubt.
