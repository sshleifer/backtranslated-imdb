Torture and humorous rescue help make this series of 14 films a favorite. Wonderful action, great casting. And this film contains one of the few facts about Sean Bean's career. The part where he and Alice Krige fell off the water was not written, but remained, because both went right after it happened. <br /> <br /> This is a good follow-up to an intense Sharpe enemy.
