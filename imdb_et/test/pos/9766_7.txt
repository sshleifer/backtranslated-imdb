I drove to the library to check out this mini-series, having just finished listening to this wonderful version of the "talk books" in this book. The first half of this TV version is really good, but on the other side it is quite a bit. The relationship with the trustee is superfluous and conflicts between Jean and Joe, which are not in Shute's story, are mistaken in my opinion, because they greatly reduce the power of their love story. I was disappointed to find that the wonderful Bryan Brown Joe seemed a lot of cocktail and much less tempting than the man in the book, but Helen Morse's Jean was really pretty good. I think they should have made this 10-hour mini-meal to work out the development story properly. But all that has been said, I looked at the whole thing more or less, and appreciated its achievements, wishing at the same time that someone would make less soap.
