It must be one of the earliest titles in the title. A title that destroys the film because it does not create a plot or a sign. Such a title makes the film a flop, even the French title is not much better. Too bad - Truffaut & Deneuve had to sell it enough. <br /> <br /> This is a long film, but it's worth a lot. Obviously, Hitchcock influences the inter-continental story of a personal advertising bride, her rich husband, theft, an identity switch and obsessive love. The plot here is actually very good and leads us to an unexpected trip. <br /> <br /> What works for both film and film is a focus on relationships. This is an interesting study of how these plot developments with these two people in "real life relationships" are played. Unfortunately, this is what the film strikes, and it is finally dissatisfied. We like movies so they have a real sense of finality, and that's not here. <br /> <br /> It was in many of his films, which Deneuve received as a canvas for managers to play his fantasies and this time it doesn't work. The dirty thing here is that the director just wanted Deneuve to take off his top a few times. Deneuve is an actor who always seems very deliberate and thoughtful, so these attempts to make him spontaneously fall. Basically, the script had to be better developed before taking the picture to make this film tighter and shorter and snap. But Truffaut didn't click, right? So - it moves a little, but remains interesting.
