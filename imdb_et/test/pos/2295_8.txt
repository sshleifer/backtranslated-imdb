WRONG. BASEBALL is a paradox movie. Written and filmed "lightweight, sporty comedy" is truly a heart warming heart as human and universal as some of Capra's best. At the plot level, you have a baseball paradox, a good old American game, as it is played in Japan - turned around, American values ​​are gone, and Japanese values ​​are printed on the game. (Some superficial "sports comedies" result from Jack's incomprehensible disbelief about how "basa-boru" is played in Japan.) You also have a leader who is presented as a mountain, an aging baseball star, but who is actually quite immature - a pro ball allowed him to postpone. And you have a leader who is heavily opposed to the changes in his life that he is forced to by refusing to accept what life has given him in the midst of a new state, a new leader, a new team, and a new girlfriend who has welcomed him and tries to accept him. . Sound like a hard thing? Not quite. It is a charming "clash of cultures" that takes place at national, sporting, romantic and professional levels. But if you look at it sensitively, you will also find a great story about a man who has to give up his immaturity and grow too late in life (causing a certain amount of personal pain) and find success in places he never expected. I love this story, but I also have great honor for Selleck's results; he displaces his slip (literally) to portray an ugly American, offending people and letting the public tantrum, then let us understand inside that character to feel his fear. Nor does it hurt if you are Takakura Ken's big fan like me. WRONG. BASEBALL is a surprising "loss of innocence" story.
