I was a little worried about the actors and those who worked in Italy when they came to "Le conseguenze dell'amore" and Toni Servillo. It was a long time that I didn't see a charismatic actor on the screen. Paolo Sorrentino has created a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the unforgettable characters seen in recent years. The film is not completely perfect, but Titta Di Girolamo will stay with you long after the movie. Toni adhere to movies, you're definitely the coolest actor nowadays (and not just in Italy, his result deserves international recognition). I appreciate this movie 9/10.
