The train-owned soldiers transport $ 300,000 of gold with the banker Clayton who is there to see that it reaches the destination, but the bandit Monetero suddenly kidnaps. But Bahunda gives up the gold and hides it, but when Monetero tries to get him out, he kills the soldiers. The only clue is the medallion, but Monetero is caught and will soon be filled. A stranger dressed as a priest arrives (who after the Monetero ball) and offers half his gold to save his life. In return, Monetero gives him a medallion, but Clayton notices it and discovers something. Soon, all three gold will pass through each other, but the bank's insurance company and the Monetero gang will look, waiting for their chance to hit. <br /> <br /> Just looking at the opening order you know. return to spaghetti with western language, having language-in-cheek style and addictive sprinkling with many references (some nicely realized) to other movies (mostly dollar trilogy) in their sub-genre. The bright direction of director Enzo Castellar is sprawling and mostly light but in many of his large, expressive sets and smooth rhythms he has the potential. The great number of fugitives, fist struggles (and many acrobatic stunts) take place in comparison to all the nervous ones. But most of these tricks are very well done and very enjoyable, and when the weapons are blazing, it is burning energy. The traditional story remains close to the usual details, but because there are many riders there, the spontaneous nature is sure you are never quite sure how it will finally play between the three. This brings many effective alternating moments, smart twists and lots of eyes, eyes. The humor of the starch script is pretty nice. Giovanni Bergamini is a dynamically tight frame and a Francesco De Mas impulsive music score. The performances are very well adapted and form a prominent report. The George Hilton's nervous and scammed move is sure to be a vague stranger. Gilbert Roland brings class and intelligence to his huge Mexican bandit Monetero. Edd Byrnes gives Clayton a readiness that keeps it well. Kareen O'Hara can't do much but is a worthy viewer. Gerard Herter, Pedro Sanchez and Ivano Staccioli offer strong support. <br /> <br /> Funny and worthy spaghetti parody / tribute that throws one curve to another and many fruitful zeros.
