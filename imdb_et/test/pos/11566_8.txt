I looked at this example when I grew up. If I mean, I remember it very well. When you asked me it was a good show. The two things I remember very well are the opening order and the theme song. In addition, everything was ideally cast. Writing was also very strong. The performances were also top-notch. I hope some networks will bring it back so I can see every episode. Before licking it, I would like to say that I always remember this memory forever, even though I haven't seen every episode. All in all, if any network ever brings it back, I hope you get it one day before it gets in the air.
