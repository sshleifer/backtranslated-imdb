This was the second big episode of South Park's 11th season. <br /> <br /> Cartman's fakes with Tourette's syndrome to tell you what he wants without getting in trouble. He is able to swear other children in school. Kyle tells the principal that Cartman kicks it. But he doesn't believe it. Chris Hansen plans to have Cartman in Dateline to talk about Tourette's syndrome alive and uncensored. Later, Cartman becomes so addicted that he would like to say what he wants, that he will accidentally start saying embarrassing things later. It was a funny episode of Cartman's Counterfeiting Tourette Syndrome. I recommend it to every South Park fan.
