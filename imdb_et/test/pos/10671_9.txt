I'm a big room buff, and for nearly 44 years I first discovered this flick. I came to Space 1999 with a roundabout then UFO. I drove with other Anderson creations and found it was their first live-action. What's going on at home! I actually heard this movie many years ago, but I never knew what it had called, so I'm happy it was randomly found. <br /> <br /> These Andersons were not strange in writing, filling models with a completely credible and realistic look, quality of operation, and so on. <br /> <br /> I don't think it seems dated. Let me tell you ... I am taking good old models over the false test of CGI today. Seriously, most rocket scenes seemed pretty real. They got to this science! If you decide to think about what you are looking at as real, it's hard to believe. <br /> <br /> Also detailed plans, beautiful photography, all look. .. man, I wish I could go back to this time! They knew how to make great movies in the 60s. Personally, I have lost interest in Hollywood movies today. Anyone with a budget can do CGI. I hate it! Get the models back! Think of all the people who use this style! Anyway, I'm talking. :-) If you like sci-fi, which is very well done, you do this by looking at it.
