This is the biggest movie if you want to inspire your heart and not dream about your dreams. Elizabeth Taylor is Velvet and her main (at least in her childhood) is Mickey Rooney's cynical friend, who finally becomes her trainer and goes to the Grand National's steeple, her beloved "Pi" - a short "Pirate" - just to get Velvet to the thrust would be a chance to win. For those who haven't seen it yet, I don't give it an end, but you should see it and if you love it, I love it. Note that very young Angela Lansbury is Velvet's oldest sister.
