The best years of our lives are great for their youth and the feelings of this time. The cast was equally wonderful. It was probably Dana Andrews's best role in her career and she should have applied for the Academy Award. There are so many wonderful scenes in this movie that it is almost impossible to list them. Film is one of the best films. This film is a time capsule of what was like in the 1940s. A must see a movie for any true movie fan. Some critics have said this film is outdated. I disagree. The theme of human desires is timeless. And the obstacles faced by veterans returning from war are always with us. It's just a great movie that can be viewed over and over again.
