One man from John Leguizamo shows that Mambo's mouth showed his intense testimonials and great timing, but the material was average, as well as the former Spic-o-Rama, but this time it was funny. his disappointing sex-o-holic. But his stuff in Freak introduces his genius and when he's in focus, he's without peer. <br /> <br /> Freaks' semi-autobiographical look at the young man's journey is power and resonance that I don't even know you knew. Leguizamo gives us the opportunity to see our souls, giving us the opportunity to prepare our lives for our project, and there can be no greater gift the performer can give. The willingness to lower the "Wall", uncover and share is too scary for most of the participants - they use characters to hide behind, but JL goes full with gas and strikes every pretense. Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor were our best cultural observers / comedians / actors because they spoke of what they noticed in society, and the truth was given by dragging humor. Combine this with a great actor's mimicry gift and being in-the-moment (not to mention humanity's feeling) and see that John Leguizamo has the right to do the same. At least in Freak he does it. <br /> <br /> From birth to his first major break and every life's changing moment, the viewer sees our master and other symbols in his most private moments, experiencing pain, hope, and humor. Looking at the drained and lean muscles of the intense JL, the evening will end up in the evening, offering the audience its crazy life. Spike Lee's liquid camera work hits the actor's nuances until the last lip curvature and slow flash. The scenarios range from a drink with his mechanical fuel to his father (when he was 9) to see his choral line with his gay, deaf uncle; her first girlfriend funny humiliation when she naked but wants to have sex. A difficult and first sexual encounter with a great German woman behind a fried chicken in Kentucky has been an unsuccessful attempt to become a "drunken Catholic" at St.Patty's Day Bar. A serious exhibition with his mother and father is that he shows his true genius: he plays the scene between these two characters and himself and his brother with such a dramatic / humorous intensity, forget that you are looking at only one person. There are no costume changes, bad wigs, lighting requirements, or makeup. Just an actor who gives everything. It's just amazing. <br /> <br /> The other actors / comedians that are currently appearing are Eddie Izzard and Chris Rock, but they don't dive as deeply as John Leguizamo; it is not criticism, not long-term. I love my job, but Freak is different. It moves in the no-b ******* way. This is the best man who looks there and no one can touch it for a long time.
