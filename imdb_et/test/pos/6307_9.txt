Stylish, thoughtful, cool and thrilling? there are only four aspects of the film that will remain in the mind of the viewer for a long time. <br /> <br /> The slow pace may be at the beginning, but the director comes up with beautiful camera work, sophisticated compositions and elegant editing. The story, not so much a narrative line, but a revelation of the inner revelation of the characters, is masterful. <br /> <br /> Olivia Magnani, who plays Sophia, is a hotel administrator who finally breaks down the reserve of the former consiglierie Titta di Girolam (Tony Servillo) is beautifully beautiful and shows short but deep depths and personal honesty hidden in deep relationships with Girolami. <br /> <br /> A disgraceful man in the middle of the mafia, forced to live an empty life, which is a torture by a Swiss hotel, has fallen into the life of a refined older couple, who was previously owned by the hotel, but is now forced to live there after when the husband plays his resources for years. The man constantly dreams of restoring his lost wealth and makes the world a great statement. His wife realizes that it's just a pipe dream. This is in contrast to Girolam's resignation, who does not see the exit and does not look for it. <br /> <br /> The short-lived town of Girolam and Sophia has consequences that no one could foresee. This allows him to escape his prisoner without bars, but to pay a huge price that he gladly accepts and gives the older couple a redemption.
