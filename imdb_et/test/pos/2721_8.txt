After Ms. and Iyer, this is another very good film by Aparna (mainly in English). In an earlier film, he addressed the modern political environment and its impact on individuals. In this film, the impact of family members with mental disabilities and their impact on the family. In parallel, he is dealing with the philosophical concept of "reality". This is a film that leads to thinking about watching a movie. <br /> <br /> The younger sister (Konkana Sen Sharma, daughter of Aparna Seni) suffers from schizophrenia, which is taken care of by the dominant older sister Anjali (Shabana Azmi). After getting married with Jojo and his separation, he believes he is still JOJO and his five children in the 15th Park of Kolkotta. (There is no such address in Kolkotta - there seems to be one in New York) and he is intense in his faith. It is almost like a strong religious faith. Ultimately, is this reality? In one scene he tells Anjal when I tell you that you are not a professor, but imagine you are a professor. The open end shows this reality. Supposedly to search for his home in the park, Mithee is gone. The penultimate scene is Mithee, who looks at a group of five children and looks at them to return to their family and then she's gone. This concept of reality reminds me of one of the fifty-fifty films, HARRY, with James Stewart. The competitor believes that the big rabbits (?), Called Harry, are always with him and he is always in conversation with him. At the end, even a doctor believes that maybe Harry is. What is reality is what the protagonist believes or what others believe is that Shabhna Azmi dominates the film with his wife's performance as a strong parent's sister who is disappointed. Konkana Sen Sharma gives the schizophrenia an equally suitable result. <br /> <br /> But the film is not as dense as Mrs and Iyer. There seem to be some loose ends. And maybe there are too many signs. Those who want a closed end may not appreciate the open end here. But the end ends with the theme of the movie. <br /> <br /> Another good movie Aparana sen.
