The most intense and powerful film I've seen for years. There is nothing emotionally compared to a movie close to the heart of Vietnam before the Vietnamese veto, as in 1972. The typical American suburban family, the seams separated, reveal the scars of Vietnam that have left our entire collective. souls. Cast A ++++ is fantastic with all four players (along with Kathy Bates), which gives riveting performances. It is wonderful for this film that you do not take any sides but understand all four characters and understand them, although all four have different views and needs. Here are scenes that are as powerful as family secrets and feelings (such as the confrontation of sons and mothers) that emotionally empties you and the tears of torment. I really cried this movie, which I rarely do. The shocking end is stunning! A lot of unnoticed film that should be seen. I appreciate it for the 10 / 10th film of the 1996 film. Especially recommended, especially today and age again, our country got into terrible warfare, our headlines shouted cruelty and again, our young men and women who return with deep psychological scars, for the deep pain that has been committed in glory. Must see a movie.
