Talkshow with Spike Feresten is one of those that will definitely polarize the audience. Do you like it or not. Personally, I find most bits fun, but it has some "huh?" a moment. <br /> <br /> Staples like "Idiot Paparazzi" are always good at laughing, but my all-time favorite bit must be a one-time "Hollywood Douchebag". "Comedy for Stoners" is the only regular bit that leaves me confused (which is part of the point!) The team of Spike and his writers from time to time can peel the burden of fresh comedy, so the exhibition never feels obsolete. Feresten's sense of humor may not be for everyone, but it is definitely worth a try. <br /> <br /> Masses are spoken! We like this exhibition and want more. Please note that I am not a friend or affiliate of Spike Feresten, Talkshow with Spike Feresten, or Fox Network and affiliates in any way. It's just funny!
