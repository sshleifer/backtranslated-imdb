When you get over an Italian soldier playing Nic Cage who loves opera and believes in love rather than war, you can enjoy this beautiful movie. It could be used to promote Mediterranean tourism. John Hurt is great and Penelope Cruz is not bad as you think. The character of Christian Bale is somewhat one-dimensional, which is disgraceful. <br /> <br /> The main disadvantage of this movie is customizing the book - after being told about the differences between the book and the film surfaces, I feel cheated by a much better and more convincing storyline.
