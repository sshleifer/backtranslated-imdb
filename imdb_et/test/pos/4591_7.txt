There's a lot of wrong with this movie. I do not lie. I say most of the problems seem to be due to the budget that was cut down, and some bad hacker editing. <br /> <br /> This is not an Office space. Don't wait for the office space comedy level. However, it is very funny. It's crap, but at the same time very funny. The movie's funny mess. Just like Caddyshack is funny. Unbeatable, funny scenes full of scenes that are filled with some very annoying inappropriate scenes. <br /> <br /> It works as a whole, and it definitely deserves widespread release. This is the best comment for the Wal Mart / Starbucks / MTV people you could hope for. The fact that the film explores the idea that thoughts people have intelligent speed when intelligent people are not is great in my book. Not very politically correct, but at least some discussions.
