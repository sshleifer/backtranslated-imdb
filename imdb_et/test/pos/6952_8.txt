Kingdom County, Vermont, 1927. Noel Lord (Rip Torn) lives with his Indian mate Bangor (Tantoo Cardinal) in an area where a large oak is being built. However, Noel is not ready to give up her land, and she has to fight with an oak company to avoid the possible destruction of the county. <br /> <br /> "Where rivers flow north" is a thrilling, contemplative story supported by Rip Torn's memorable performances (recently seen in Louis XV's small but succulent roles of Sofia Coppola's undervalued "Marie Antoinette") and Tantoo's Cardinal ("Dances with Wolves", "Smoke Signals"). Director Jay Craven (who also wrote a script with Don Bredes based on Howard Frank Mosher's novel), and Paul Ryan, who created this powerful story with a unique, thoughtful pace / visual, reminds me of the best moments of Terrence Malick and John Huston. It is an undervalued independent period of the first (electric) 90s of the 1990s, which is usually seen as the rise of the Quentin Tarantino burlesque (indeed "Pulp Fiction" is a masterpiece, but the man suffers from Orson Welles syndrome), the annoying suburb of Todd Solondz, Danny Boyle a dark vision from the UK (don't mention that "Beach" duplicates DiCaprio, though ...) Jay Craven should also be on the list of big indie filmmakers. He has pursued a respectful and discreet career and is always happy to see a talent like him. <br /> <br /> My voice: 8/10.
