Seven places have been compared to Bullitt's chase scene, but it doesn't come close to Bullitt anywhere. Bullitt has a start that builds builds. When McQueen leaves a visiting hotel, he gets to his Mustang, parked under Embarcadero Freeway (now broken) and notices that the Loader is sitting close, you know you see something remarkable. From the moment McQueen starts to start this car, the best driving cycle ever begins to be filmed. Adding it is a great Lalo Schriffin. It has been going on for a long time before you hear the first tires open. This McQueen Mustang's sudden appearance in Bill Hickman's rear-view mirror is unbalanced for visual impact. Hickman's surprise and double appearance actually adds to the effect. Then, of course, San Francisco is the setting up of cars up and down the unmatched mountains and around the curves. The Bullitt was also filmed in the 1960s when the cars were still "Hot" (Mustang GT and Dodge Charger), which was made for better wheels and two boring Smog devices for adult Pontiacs in the 1970s from Seven Ups. Bill Hickman was the leader of the bad cars of both films. I saw her sitting in the insider movie preview once on a universe party when I made movie reviews on paper. They gave him a good try in seven places, though with a chase scene. Seven companies had a few hills with a few "jumps" (Yawn), but of course they were not in the San Francisco mountains. The seven Ups, where they really move fast, are longer than the Bullittis. However, the scene of one shotgun full of Schuters Pontiac hoods is absurd. I would say strictly to Hollywood, except that it was filmed in New York.
