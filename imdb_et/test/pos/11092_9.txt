Based on the true story of Christopher Boyce (Hutton) and Daulton Lee (Penn) and their involvement in selling American secret government documents to the Soviets in the 1970s. Boyce works on behalf of the government and is tasked with overseeing the specific documents that end up exhausting his country's affairs and practices. He then publishes sensitive documents to his drug dealer friend, Daulton Lee, who has become a winner. Lee enters the Russian Embassy in Mexico and connects to Alex (Suchet) and both will play the espionage game. <br /> <br /> Lee's interests are purely for money, while Boyce acts against anger, he believes that Lee is the interior of the American government. Things are getting massive when Lee's drug and careless behavior in handling the courier position compensates for both Alex and Boyce. Lee becomes more paranoid and the initial espionage game becomes more deadly and a consequence for all involved. <br /> <br /> This is a real spy thriller without being cheesy. The motives and analysis of the nature of the real topics are sympathetic, but very well written and intertwined with real events and the underlying political issues related to the predatory behavior of people. How bigger people use their political power to control smaller countries. Well-directed and intense parts, especially when the protagonists become enormous over their heads in spy games. Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn give amazingly ripping performances in a film that questions the authority, but there is no simple answer to the political message or the complexity of this system. The main situation of the characters becomes the message behind The Falcon and the Snowman and makes it a smart political thriller with a nice element of society, interpersonal and American system. Great movie! <br /> <br /> **** 1/2 *****!
