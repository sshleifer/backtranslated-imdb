Only the British could make such a movie and be so charming! Betty (Brenda Blethyn) wants more, but she doesn't know what she understands to be in love with her childhood friend Boris (Alfred Molina) who owns a local funeral gallery. Meanwhile, the American (Christopher Walken), who "wants to put the fun back into the funeral" with his little Welsh community with his help (Lee Evans) and wants to give Boris some fun themed fun for his money. (Star Trek funeral, anyone?) Brenda and Boris decide Brenda's death and fun with fun results - a very enjoyable movie - if you are a fan of British comedies, like "Waking Ned Devine" then you love it.
