The story of a young shop, Dexter (Joseph Mazzello) with AIDS, who is a friendly and tumble boy (playing Brad Renfro) in his exact opposite, The Cure is sad when a little bit of soap, pull his emotions into the "message" of the movie it's heart to the right place. For this fact alone, this is the recommended view. Highlighting can be just looking at their friends and hanging out with each other if no one else accepts them. <br /> <br /> But as the actual story focuses on the boy's AIDS - things will rise when one day in a local supermarket, Dexter's eye catch checkout tabloid magazine, claiming that a New Orleans doctor has discovered a cure. Both of them, obviously naive, make it a plan for New Orleans in any way. Which firmly pulled me in two ways. It's a flounder of heart warming and I hate nit-pick, but I found a plot of wanders in melodramatic, predictable terms, and the procedure is layer glossy on them, just like movies can do. I couldn't escape the idea that I was looking at a film about self-discovery, illness, and growth. For example, I know they are young, but I found it a real challenge to believe what these guys do. Like boiling tree leaves and hot 'tea' drinking or experimental diets for chocolate plates, because they believe it is fighting a destructive disease. Nothing about making cross-country trips because they have no legal or scary consequences. Still unsuccessful are the film arrangements you expect, a story worth seeing especially with your family.
