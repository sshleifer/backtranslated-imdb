Spanish director Luis Buñuel's career lasted almost 50 years, from 1929 to 1977. His best films were alleged to have been in Mexico during his exile - from the forties to the early 1960s. There he had to deal with very cheap budgets and to work in an industry that was mainly interested in commuting commercial films to more sophisticated audiences, but somehow managed to make interesting, thought-provoking films that are under the test of time. This film is based on the novel by the Spanish writer Benito Perez Galdos - and adaptation is quite faithful, even though at the beginning of the 20th century Spain is not Mexico at the beginning of the 20th century. Chief Specialist Nazarin is a priest who tries to live a life that is as faithful as Christ has appointed. The question many would ask is whether such an endeavor would be possible without the hostility, misunderstanding and mockery of your fellow human beings. As it happens, he suffers a lot of indignation, but he remains stubborn about this goal (until the final disputed). I think Buñuel wanted Nazarin to be somewhat ridiculous, but maybe inadvertently (at least for this viewer) wanted to be admirable. In any case, it's a great movie.
