Strange but wonderfully original film. Truly scary, horrible and ridiculous in equal measures. Setting a high rise red brick apartment is the ideal backdrop for haunting activities. The secret idea of ​​a closed space of such a place is good enough, but if the leading naive couple begins to cleanse the old bed they find in this room, the scene is assigned to some classic cold color. The cast is fantastic. Tanya Dempsey can really chew the landscape after being undervalued in other full moon movies. Joe Estevez proves why his brother Martin Sheen is so much in Hollywood - his running eyes while making a bed scene are very fun. Charles Band compiled with Stuart Gordon and is really an exceptional Full Moon / Darkwave release. Danny Draven also led Dempsey to hell.
