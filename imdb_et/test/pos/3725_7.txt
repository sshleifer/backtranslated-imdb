Luc Besson's first work is also his first fiction in science fiction - a genre to which he returns 14 years later with the "fifth element" (1997). Even though this movie has been heavily influenced by the Hollywood cinema, it is still very enjoyable. In 1983, Le Dernier Combat reveals Besson's own scientific fictional approach. She takes back the hard subject and her efforts are visible to make a stylish job. With a widescreen and black and white picture, the disaster has destroyed almost the entire population of the country and we never know what the disaster was and why men can no longer talk. Some barbaric hordes were formed. In parallel, a man (Pierre Jolivet) lives independently and arrives in a recognizable Paris where he receives a doctor (Jean Bouise). <br /> <br /> There are no words in Besson's work. Character activities and events go through the look and gestures. Although the starting point and background are irritating, the film never has any despair. It seems that the man and the doctor are trying to reproduce the gestures and activities related to humanity before the disaster. The movie opens when a man has an inflatable doll. Later, the doctor tries to talk to him and he is a painter in his spare time. More interestingly, these paintings come from prehistoric times. Based on this justification, it can be argued that the bearded giant (Jean Reno) embodies evil and threatens the efforts of a man and a doctor to restore man. Ditto for the bad gang at the beginning. </p> <p> </p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> > <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> The pessimistic fan that such a movie can convey is not really in the forefront and gives a boost to hope. Personally, the film could be obtained without music, except what one can hear with his tape recorder. Luc Besson had to make such films better and still appealing, as well as increased Pierre Jolivet's career as a director, leaving in future uneven work: "Force Majeure" (1989), "Simple Mortel" (1991), "I Petite Entreprise" (1999) or "Filles Uniques" (2003).
