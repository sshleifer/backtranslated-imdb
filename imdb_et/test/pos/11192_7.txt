yes, I do not agree with the critics, but I was not really what this film brought. I was a little hesitant to rent it because I go through some of the same things that the protagonist should experience. yet, I rented it, I thought I could experience some catharsis or at least understand that I'm not alone. even though I realized the protagonist's irritation for his careless cousin, I didn't feel as much as I would have wanted my inner struggle. I felt that much more emphasis was placed on his disturbing cousin's superfluous expectations. it is a beautifully filmed film and I really appreciated the use of silence to bring out the feeling of isolation.
