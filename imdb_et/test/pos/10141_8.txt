Certainly, this film is a true ring because it is based on the actual events on the seabed. It deals with the coverage of a local seaman's attempt by seafarers to behave in an unacceptable manner, resulting in the death of his former girlfriend, Marine Captain. The man and the woman were lovers, but the captain tried to break the relationship when he discovered that his boyfriend was married. He continued his stalk, driving so far that his side branch out in his direction at the same time. Eventually he broke his home, attacked him with a knife and was shot twice with his pistol and killed. The civil prosecutor decided to kill self-defense, but the Navy decided to kill the captain. Great, you see, was a hero and an old colonel friend on the seabed decorated in Vietnam. The captain had also made some enemies at the command of his pool, rejecting some of the male advancements in a very butch style. <br /> <br /> There is a significant psychological carriage that motivates and controls the activities of the main actors in this drama. what a very capable majority can do well. However, the director and editor seem to be sure to hide events as much as possible with depressing setbacks and changing views. You're lucky if you know where you are mostly. Include them; this is a worthwhile story when the captain's trial is opened and it seems that everyone's hands are against him, even his lawyer at times. <br /> <br /> Decision? After all, it is a temporary story, so you have to see yourself. The film has a message of "pacifist", but forget about it. Of course, "war is hell", but sometimes it can't be avoided. Then we need these naval forces, even if they are not always the best masters in the fair game. As Kipling says in his poem "Tommy Atkins": <br /> <br /> "It's Tommy and it's Tommy, and Tommy is waiting. But it's space for Mr. Atkins when the army is on the rise."
