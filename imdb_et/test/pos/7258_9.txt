I don't want to write too much about the movie, but basically it's an act / comedy that has a little romance thrown into about two men who come in unlikely situations and become one of the highways. A fantastic performance by Robert Carlysle and all the others. Excellent "bad" who really hates you. Some great comic strips - actually laugh out loud, amazing action and a big plot. The choice of music and atmosphere is fantastic, basically brilliant and written in diamonds. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good British movie or good activity, I don't know why the film never went, I thought it wouldn't have so much appreciation if it deserved it. If anything else, check out this film for the biggest ever finale of the movie. Nothing to give away, but it really is beating your heart!
