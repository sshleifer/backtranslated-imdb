This movie is great with some of the best songs that Bon Jovi and the kiss have prepared. The film is about a man named Chris (Mark Wahlberg) Who is the biggest fan named Steel Dragon. The singer of his world is turning upside down. With Jennifer Aniston's great work, this movie must be for rock lovers !! <br /> <br /> 4/5 stars
