This short has all the elements of a great movie. Every time I show it to friends (on the DVR), they also love it. The dialogue is "real". Action is great. Although the effects / props were not so convincing in themselves, taking everything else with the picture, they are expertly positioned / used. The music is so strange, suitable for such a "moment" movie. People who have dear beliefs and thoughts are shaken by what they see in this film. Most of them go "it's?", But eventually they bloom with a new understanding and leave one word in the movie to describe it: <br /> <br /> Beautiful. The beauty of the film is also deep in the skin. I love the absence of contradictory views, no other voice and voices that you hear are disagreed with each other. there is no conflict, but at the same time there is one. And the end ended with love! The harsh reality is sometimes more of a movie that is worth than any plot device or twist. <br /> <br /> (Wasn't Joshua Leonard who was the man of the Blair witch project?) :) The fictional dead man ... big!
