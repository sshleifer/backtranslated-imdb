"The Couch Trip" is one of the foolish comedies they made in the 80s. In this case, Dan Aykroyd plays a psychiatric disorder with a mental disorder and goes to Beverly Hills for Charles Grodin. Most of the humor in the film comes from their satirical look at Beverly Hills and the empty lives of the people who live there (the woman has a powerful fight with her servant). <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you look at in a good time. Don't expect any religious experience. But you probably laugh a lot about how Beverly Hills people show off their wealth. Also starring Walter Matthau, Donna Dixon, Arye Gross and Victoria Jackson ("UHF").
