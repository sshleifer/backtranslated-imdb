As a little garbage expert, I'm a little bit of a little treasure. Activity, romance, crooked policemen, violence. All of this here and none is pulled right. I was in love right now. Then the funny thing happened about the second time. I got addicted. I thought it was a movie of a rent and a laugh. <br /> <br /> Rudy Ray Moore knew what he wanted to see in the movie. He had no money to look good, but he did it anyway. This is very commendable. It also shows that he made the film for himself. I don't know how many of you have heard Rudy Ray's music, but if you don't, he's got a whole number of albums dating back to the fifties.
