To be absolutely honest, I didn't expect to get into the soul at all, even after I read the heap after it was praised, but saying that I was surprised would be a big discount, in short I was totally off. <Br / The main plot is as simple as nine prisons, from the push of drugs to the escape of several killers from prison, and looking for a secret stronghold, which is assumed to be counterfeit money, hidden by a tenth of prisoners who blamed and dragged shortly before flight, but this is the direction director Toshiaki Toyoda takes this simple story that is so brilliant and original, completely mixing drama, comedy and violence, creating a truly solid film that deserves to be seen not only by Asian cinema fans but cinema in general. <br /> <br /> Superb action, emotional, funny, violent, and at times very surreal, it's a movie that has everything.
