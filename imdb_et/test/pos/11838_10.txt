This 1931 comedy improves due to every viewing, because Marion Davies gave his comic and the awful performance of C. Aubrey Smith. Smith plays a terrible old man collecting his grown-up children (from his younger days as a rake) in his declining years. One of them is American (Davies), one English (Ray Milland, who looks around 18) and one Italian (Nina Quartero). There are some surprises, as the plot moves with Ralph Forbes (there was no complaint at all) that fell on Davies. <br /> <br /> Davies and Smith are just wonderful together and very touching. Davies also does some dances and makes some "big" entrances. And of course Davies is just proud. Halliwell Hobbes, Doris Lloyd, Elizabeth Murray, Guinn Williams, Edgar Norton and David Torrence. Had they supported the Oscar in 1931, Smith could have already been put out. He is very good in this great precious.
