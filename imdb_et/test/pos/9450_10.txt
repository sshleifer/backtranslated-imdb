Well, I'm not a film critic or something like that. But I have an opinion on this movie. I think Amanda Bynes was the best in this movie, she played her roll very well, I've been watching a lot of movies, I liked it the most! When you watch this movie, you can simply relax, come down and watch it. You don't have to try to find a subtext or something like that. You just look at it. The movie is really great. Maybe I liked it for an actor, maybe for all landscapes, but I liked it. The whole atmosphere that was created. At one point, I felt like I was in that university, in that room. This is not yet another drama movie to win an Oscar, it's just a nice movie to watch in your spare time.
