Freely, on the basis of actual events, the River's Edge, a lot of David Lynch's, is about a group of young people who are aware of the murder of one of their friends, but no one takes a long time. When Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper are top-notch, we are able to give all other people in the film an average score. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a young boy, Tim (Joshua John Miller). doll next to the bridge (murder # 1). Tim hears someone shouting when he sees that Samson (Daniel Roebuck) is standing by the river with his girlfriend's dead naked body behind him (murder # 2). Samson finally shows his body to his friends. All these are frightened not only because of the murder, but also because the victim, Jamie (Danyi Deats), was their friend. Nevertheless, no one goes to the police. It may be thought to be unrealistic, but it happened in the real story. If you know the story of "Alpha Dog" (2006), you know that the same thing happened there. Through all this, Layne (Crispin Glover) works to keep Samson safe, even though no one (including Samson) seems to be caring for her. As time passes, we learn that Feck (Dennis Hopper), a medieval who is closed to dealing with local teenagers, has also killed a woman before (murder # 3). Here, things start to close to Samson and his friends, and finally everything comes out, but not in the way you can expect. <br /> <br /> In this movie, we learn about three murders, each with a different cause, a different reaction, and a different impact on those involved. When Tim falls next to his younger sister's doll bridge, we are never aware of our motive. But we see the reaction of the younger sister. He shouts and screams as his mother console. Later, his older brother, Matt (Keanu Reeves), helps his child in the yard to commemorate his child. Jamie's murder scares everyone (except for Samson, who is apathetic to the whole situation, and when Layne asked why he did, Samson replied, "He spoke * t.") But they don't smell or scream, escape and continue on life, trying to forget what happened. In Fecki's situation, he didn't kill his girlfriend's hatred. We never know why he killed him, but we see that Feck is not proud of what he did. He even mentions that he is sorry, and that he loved him. From this we can see different ways we can affect death. In the film, we can easily identify teenagers because they do not know what they are feeling or how they should know their friend's death. Much the same way, we, the audience, don't know how to feel because we don't know Jamie. We are fatally exhausted and realize that Samson should be arrested, but we do not know Jamie as an individual. <br /> <br /> There are many similarities between River's Edge and Twin Peaks. (1990-1991), especially in the general knowledge of the film. I don't know if Mark Frost and David Lynch thought of the "river edge" when they created their series. After all, Tim Hunter went to "Twin Peaks" to lead the three episodes. <br /> <br /> Crispin Glover as a hyperactive, frantic Layne is worth the Oscar. Layne is always in a hurry and always worried that Samson is trying to hold on, which is an intense character that seems to be at a speed. If you've seen Crispin Glover in the movies, you know that he can provide a line like someone else. She's always treated to see her. Another great force "River's Edge" is Dennis Hopper. His idea of ​​Feck, a drug dealer with one foot and an inflatable sex game, talks to Elly, reminded me more of a toned and humorous version of Frank Booth, Hopper's character David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" (1986). <br /> <br /> River's Edge is a great movie and I believe it shows us how easy it is to be apathetic when we really have to speed up and talk about the evil of the world.
