The title that appears on the screen tells us it's the Caribbean, May 1891. A small lifeboat travels into the sea, which includes six convicted shipwreck ships and doctor Claude Cassinelli. It's at night, the strange stream takes the boat to a strange, unnamed and uncharted island. The boat hits some stones and is broken. One of the prisoners is killed because it seems to be a slim mutant fisherman. The next morning morning, Claude wakes up on the beach. She thinks there is white white bubble water and one of the prisoners. Claude warns another surviving prisoner, Jose (Franco Iavarone), that he won't drink water when he kills him. Both meet with other survivors, Peter (Roberto Posse), Francois (Francesco Mazzeri) and Skip (Giuseppe Castellano). Francois travels independently to try and eat the animal's food, he finds and kills large water birds. But in turn, he kills one fisherman. Claude, Jose, Peter, and Skip continue to explore the island because they put Francois's death into an animal attack. Soon after Skip is killed when he is exhausted at the bottom edge of the hole. Now only Claude, Jose and Peter are left. They stumble through the cemetery, where there are many empty tombs and signs of recent black magical rituals. Claude stabs a snake on a nearby rock, suddenly a picture is heard and snakes collide. The female horse named Amanda Marvin (Barbara Bach) is the savior of Claude. He tells them to leave the island right now because it belongs to Edmund Rackham (Richard Johnson) and he doesn't like the visitors. Claude, Jose and Peter decide to continue, but in the end they find Rackham's big house where they are invited to stay. This evening, Peter goes after Amanda and tries to rape him in rape, and Peter is quickly changing to fish workers. And the Voodoo priest, called Shakira (Beryl Cunningham), who lives with Rackham, fills a black magic ritual that involves the exhaustion of fish throat. The next day Claude and Jose decide that they should leave the island because they feel very calm about Rackham and think he is lying to them. Jose rides on the horse and is gone. Claude has been rescued from one fisherman by Amanda and is told to leave again. Claude wants to confront Rackham again. Rackham shows that he has a scientist and Amanda's father, named Professor Ernest Marvin (Joseph Cotten), whom he has to keep alive. Rackham says that the longer Ernest lives, his chance of survival increases. Rackham tells Claude his plan. Rackham has found a lost city at the depth of Atlantis over 2000 feet. He uses fish men as a means of accessing the lost treasures of Atlantis and needs Amanda and his father to control them. He claims that the fish are the descendants of the original inhabitants of Atlantis. Rackham offers Claude some of the treasure when he helps him keep Ernest alive. Later, Claude remembers the name of Ernest Marvin as a scientist condemned for attempts to transplant animal organs into humans. Finding the secret labs of Ernest he discovered, Rackham had lied to him and the fish men were not descendants, their actually genetically modified people became amphibious with the Ernest Grotesque experiments. Finally, Rackham had enough of Claude and decided to put an end to his confusion when he put it in a large tank and slowly filled it with water, because the island volcano would break and send the lava to fly everywhere. Rackham wants to leave the island with his treasures, and Amanda, if Claude gets almost deadly to save Amanda and get out of the island before the erupting volcano tears it? Director Sergio Martino I liked this film that mixes different genres. The Sergio Donat script is fast paced, interesting and fun. The plot appears a little bit, which keeps me interested in watching all the time. Here I have to say that I have seen the original version and not what has been added to the scenes that have been added to release this US from Roger Corman. Barbara Bach is an incredibly attractive leading lady, but I hated how she was introduced when the stomachs were shot, I thought it was more than a little terrible. Richard Johnson makes a great villain and a pleasant hero for Claudio Cassinelli. Fish-men themselves see little fake if the camera stays too long for them, but their cool look and I'm worse. Some miniature effects also look a bit poor, but in general I am much worse again. There's no real trap, no violence or nudity, but it didn't really bother me. Giancarlo Ferrando's photography and Massimo Antonello Geleng's production design make for a very nice looking film. Periodic costumes, props and kits such as the Rackham House and the Ernest Laboratory with old science equipment. The lush green jungle settings also add visual glow to the exhibition. I liked this movie and I was entertained throughout this work. I'm not sure who I would like to, because it interferes with different genres, I think somebody who may be a bit different and generally well done. If you find a copy, I like to be happy.
