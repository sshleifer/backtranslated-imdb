Wicked Little Things were really a good movie. I say in some parts it seemed really unbelievable, and others seemed to have just had not enough thoughts to put the characters into action, but in general it was exciting and fun. don't understand why this movie's rating is so low. I don't understand why all Afterdark Horrorfest movie ratings are so low. These are B-Movies people and nothing else. They offer great entertainment and most of them don't have much flaws at all. It's definitely worth a look because you don't have to be disappointed with the results. Wicked Little Things is one of the best 1st Annual Afterdark Horrorfilms and compared to many other series of movies. this is one of the best overall.
