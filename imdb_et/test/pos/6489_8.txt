I bought it a while ago, during a massive martial arts stage. Although this is definitely not the best, I love this kind of filmmaking and there was a lot to be entertained in this entertainment. Leung Kar Yan is one of my favorite martial arts stars, and I always appreciate the fact that although he did not have any formal martial arts training, he usually gave more than a capable combat. He also has a good beard. This film has a good, heroic role and, although he doesn't hit as many ass as some of his films, he still does well. The early appearance of Cherie Chung and Chow Yun Fat is also nice, especially because Chow Yun Fat takes bad guys without their brand weapon. He may not be a great fighter, but he does OK. Eddy Ko is as big as a bad boy as he ever does, he fills the same villain as many of his other movies and does it perfectly as usual. Also Bu, who plays Bu is good, I don't remember his name, but he is a great butcher. Although the fight is not as good as the other films of the era, the postman fights a lot of imagination, high-quality cinematography and a nice atmosphere. Hong Kong's talent collection has some very nice scenes, good characters and a good eclectic mix. All in all, I would recommend this to kung fu and general Hong Kong fans. It may not be a stylized classic like Shaw Brothers movies or a crowd that is pleasing like Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee, but it's rock-proof entertainment.
