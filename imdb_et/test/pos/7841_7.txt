"The Beguiled" is a strange work between Clint Eastwood's work. By 1971 he became a famous film star, not only the West (genre in which he made his name for the first time), but also war films (such as "Where Eagles Dare") and police choppers (like "Coogan's Bluff"). "It happens during the war (American Civil War), and it was Don Siegel, who had previously led Eastwood's" Coogan's Bluff "and was later led by" Dirty Harry "in the same year, that this is not a feature film in the traditional sense. but his role is largely passive - his character, Sergeant John McBurney, is a wounded refugee who is forced to rely on women's charity to survive. Even in his service, McBurney did not play an active role in the conflict, he is a Quaker whose religious principles prohibit his weapons Bear and serve with the Union forces in a medical manner. <br /> <br /> The film is at the end of the war in Louisiana and begins with the injured McBurney, whose av a young girl named Amy stepped back to her school. The school is small, only two teachers and a handful of girls. Although some girls are enthusiastic supporters of the Confederation and want to hand over it to the authorities, Director Martha Farnsworth decides to hide her and is afraid that her injuries will be fatal if she is sent from one of the Confederate harsh prison camps. Although McBurney closely follows the teachings of his religion in relation to pacifism, he is not as careful as he follows his teachings about sin of sin and when he begins to recover, he fully exploits his ability to perform his charms for both employees and older girls and he wins them , including Miss Farnsworth, her husband Edwina and Carol, a senior girl. Even twelve-year-old Amy looks like she's a kind of child-breaker. In a sexually repressed atmosphere throughout her school, her presence causes jealousy and hatred, and Miss Farnsworth, who is pushed back to Slutish Carol, prints a terrible revenge. (Interestingly, one woman who stands against McBurney's delicacies is Hallie, Miss Farnsworth's black slave, although she tries to win her round, pointing out she is fighting for the free will of such people). <br /> <br /> The Beguiled is described as an anti-war movie, but it seems to me to be a misconception. The film does not really deal with the general rights and lies of civil war or war. The only acts of violence that we see are committed by non-combatants and motivated by personal revenge, not by zeal for the Confederacy. It would be more accurate to see the drama of the film about the psychological tensions that may be caused by the special circumstances of war. <br /> <br /> At first, the school in the beautiful old antebellum mansion seems to be a peace island during the war. The building is housed in a classical style that is connected with order, harmony and restraint, but the story that opens in its walls is a disorder, passion and violence, characteristics of Gothic written school that were often seen as opposed to classicism in the 19th century. The film can be considered a "South Gothic" tradition of American film and literature. <br /> <br /> The film was not a big blow at the cashier, probably because Eastwood was casting so much against the type. This is probably not his best film, but it showed that he can expand his choice and play anything other than the activity. (In the first film, directed by "Play Misty for Me", he again played a "passive" character next year, sacrificing a woman). Cast female members are especially good, especially Geraldine Page, Martha Farnsworth, a respectable middle-aged spinster from outside but a strong woman from within. (There are tips that he might have had a relationship with a man he's gone as a brother). Elizabeth Hartman also has good bets as a shy, repressed Edwin, who falls in love with McBurney and rejects retaliation and the young Pamelyn Ferdin as Amy's idea. (Amy is an animal mistress - the main moment of the movie when McBurney kills her pet turtle - so it's interesting that in later life Ferdinian became an animal rights activist). One sign I was less interested in was Jo Ann Harrise Carol, who seemed too modern, like a 70-year-old chick dating back to the 1970s. The film is remarkable for the emotionally intense "hothouse" atmosphere that Siegel brings. It's not a movie that's nice to everyone; some find it too burnt and melodramatic and some have found it atypical. (Judith Crist called it "the movie of a woman's wrath and sadists"). Others may, however, find it in a massive psychological drama. 7/10
