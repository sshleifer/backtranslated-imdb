Well, I've been watching this movie for over 25 years and it's still almost as interesting as I saw it for the first time. This is definitely one of the most unique films ever made. <br /> <br /> I think Martin Sheen also took a long time to settle. He dominates the film, but receives less billing than Marlon Brando, who only appears in the last 30 minutes of this two-hour, 30-minute movie (theater version). How is it unfair? <br /> <br /> Sheen is fantastic here, especially her narration that lasts all the time. This is one of the best narratives, if not the best I've ever heard in the movie. His voice is simply haunting, because he ties his thoughts to this incredible nightmare adventure. I can never evaluate my work in this movie. Another thing that strikes me over the years is the number of memorable scenes, the ones I've never forgotten, like ... .. <br /> <br /> Escaping loses this in the hotel scene in the first scene; Robert Duvall and completely out-of-the-box surfing, followed by an attack on the amazing dramatic classical music of Wagner's helicopters; Playboy rabbit, who entertains soldiers; Frederic Forrest is nervous near the tiger when the tiger goes; strange scenes on a long ride; the hippie journalist Dennis Hopper's appearance on the team in Cambodia and then the strange character of Brando. It goes on and on with strange scenes. <br /> <br /> That doesn't mean I enjoyed everything. No, there are some very unpleasant scenes, like the one where the ox is sliced ​​in half (can't see it anymore), the innocent family is killed by a small boat by the Sheen's young stones and the team is sometimes too funny. Then there is a tremendous amount of fear that is controlled by too many f-words. One thing for sure: it's a movie you remember!
