Jolene (Heather Graham) runs a nightclub in NYC and lives with her husband Carl (Luke Wilson), a photographer. About 500 days after marriage, Jolene comes home to find Carl's remark that he needs "some room" .... and a bundle of browns for his pet. Jo puts daisies in the blender quickly and pushes the button. Soon he will start his journey to find Carl somewhere in the West, because he is finally committed to Carl. But when he finally knocks off from Texas, Jo starts away from home, hoping he'll find the clues for his decision to leave. He meets his magnificent sculptor-neighbor (Goran, can't write his name!), But Jo discourages him from his interest. When he learns that Carl has a new girlfriend, he decides to consult a Mexican-American mystic (Alfonso Arau). Jo's committed, but does that mean to Carl? This is a very imaginative, rather humorous look at the promise of marriage. This is a peculiar script and the spooky style is infectious. Graham is just great as a hit woman with a hard time to go. Wilson does not give his best results but is sufficient as a mixed husband. But the rest of the cast is pretty nice when Goran is great as a sexy neighbor. The landscape, both in New York and Texas, is very cute and the costumes are fresh and fun. If you like romantic comedy and an independent film, then it's ordered for you. It walks to a different victory, which is the most attractive, but still offers the ultimate happy end category.
