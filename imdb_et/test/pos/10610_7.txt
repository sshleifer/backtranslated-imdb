Note that Bollywood, for anyone with a familiar genre, and the images that are usually surrendered, are sticky, the top musical number held in a costume that makes Vegas seem a conservative bastion. This notion is not helped by self-expression, which passes through most of the films that are approaching Boliver's foreign policy perspective. But Marigold, a romantic comedy by Willard Carroll, is different. This is not a nudge-nudge eye-eye look at these foolish people and their shameful antiques, but Bollywood sincere thanks to its vitality, irony and lack of self-awareness. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the director has a tremendous affection and respect for Bollywood, while being confused with his kitschier aspects. And if you are familiar with Bollywood, you can appreciate what he's doing here to make the true hybrid of Bollywood and Hollywood movie conferences. From one opening frame, the Salman character's setback at sea, telling your grandmother (played by Helen! - how many Salman films will start from the same premise)? The film that Marigold and Prem have filmed is known to all those who have seen enough Bollywood films. The story itself includes both Hollywood and Bollywood tried and true conventions? fish outside the water correspond to the personal family at the expense of personal fulfillment. The film's structure follows the usual line of the Bollywood plot, which is a more comical first half-year, giving way to another more dramatic resolution. Ultimately, the sensitivity of the film is Hollywood's sensitivity, its undervalued, funny humor, and the story of a woman who learns to believe in self-confidence. <br /> <br /> You could not have been a film inspired by Bollywood when there were no musical numbers, and this movie doesn't speak of seven. Unlike Bollywood, however, the songs are nowhere to be picked up and transported to Europe or Goan Beach; they exist as musical numbers, which are part of a film that reminds us how musical numbers were justified in the Busby Berkeley films as part of the show. Or do they come out of a situation where the music already has a reason to be? a sexy nightclub scene where Prem teaches Marigold a dance or a beach event with musicians (including the singer Shaan in the playback). Everyone reflects the emotional state of the film's main characters. Often, music from one genre takes the usual song and turns it around. So, in one film highlighting where Marigold gets his own, is shooting a song quite typical for his genre? female star singing and dancing female line? but in this case, this is a blonde Ali Larter like a natural Bollywood movie star, emotion and lips that sync with Hindi words without subtitles. <br /> <br /> The Bollywood synonym is also a gorgeous visual and Marigold fills this aspect beautifully with today's Bollywood top professionals. The filmmaker is Anil Mehta, who was also the director of Lagan and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. Choreographer is a Vaibhavi merchant and production designer Nitin Desai, both Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Devdas. Can you really see the influence of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam on this film? In fact, the illuminated floor of a single number was originally from Dholi Taro Dhol, which incidentally has a built-in marigold pattern. <br /> <br /> As for pain, Carroll is obviously confident to act as a talent, as shown by playing with the heart? one of the first films for both Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe. And in this movie, he hits Ali Larter again. One of the main reasons why the film works is Larter. She makes a funny, unappealing character sympathetic and her further transformation credible and she's smart, funny and sexy because she's smart and funny. He and Salman have excellent chemistry and are one of the biggest aspects of the film. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan plays the role of Prince Charming here, filtered through his iconic role in Premina. It's an old school Prem, but so wait for the quiet, restrained Salman - those who are accustomed to his usual remover avatar may be disappointed? or released! This is his sincere and sensitive result, which is only due to the poor pronunciation of his English. <br /> <br /> The refreshing lack of cynicism and romantic love in the film is a letter of love for Bollywood and Hollywood movies yesterday.
