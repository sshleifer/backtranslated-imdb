Larry Donner (Billy Crystal) is a crazy life: his wife (Kate Mulgrew) stole his book and left him, has a new Buddhist romance with Beth (Kim Greist), he doesn't know how to start his book and his screen-writing class students there are strangers than most. But one student (Danny DeVito) is very strange. She lives with her evil mommy (Anne Ramsey) and she can't have the courage to kill her. So, when he goes to Larry for help, making his life mad mad is extra crazy! <br /> <br /> Stu Silver should have done more! Dialogue, characters, the whole script is almost perfect! And Danny DeVito has proved to me that he is more than a great actor: he is a great director! His child's film, Matilda, is one of my favorite family films and now it's one of my favorite comedies. <br /> <br /> This is a black comedy, most jokes are murder, but it's fucking funny! All actors have their full potential, whether they are the main characters (Billy Crystal) or just one-bit smaller characters (Olivia Brown). <br /> <br /> If you like comedy (who isn't?) if you like it! 8/10 stars.
