Feeling the brilliance of this brilliant Dan Finnerty and his "Dan Band" in Bravo, this is the most enjoyable time I've ever seen on TV. This young man (Dan) is such an incredible talent as a singer, performer and even a dancer. She can go for the most exciting ballad pop songs all singing for women, hip-hop, rock, and songs written for women. This man can do something. I've seen her live at least 11 times, so I didn't expect her show to fit on a TV or movie, but all the reservations went as the show started thanks to Dan's overwhelming star quality. benefit and look at it or better yet, buy it.
