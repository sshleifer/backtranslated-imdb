The details of The Big Trail were so incredible that I felt the film was made while it was representing it. I've never seen wagons that were so real! They were large, equipped with accessories, and even felt that they were filled with details under the canvas that had never been intended. Any dirt, every scratch, every splinter was there. Today's computer technology can never create scenes for many wagons when they move across the ground or around to displace Indians. The wagons were all real, single vehicles, each with its own real team of horses or bulls. <br /> <br /> The clothes of the actors couldn't be real. Except for John Wayne's buckskin clothes and Marguerite Churchill's nice dress, the clothes were very ordinary, split or dirty with the authentic look. Many actors and actresses were born before the electrical and interior finishing was normal and they must be satisfied with the surrounding environment. All the Indians were rather real Indians than the white annexes that were dyed tan. <br /> <br /> Women from the old west had to be strong because there was a lot of work. In every scene that shows the work of people on the train, women are shown as splitting timber, grab beams, and so on. survival fact. <br /> <br /> Revenge and romance are played well. Nothing is overestimated or over-played. <br /> <br /> Hollywood lost something in the 1930s. As much as I love fake beauty and the controlled environment of old films, the Big Trail can feel real. The more I see big budget films from the quiet era, the more I like them. I can think of the few films of the 1930s I've seen that it is the best of the 1920s. If a home theater was made during the train wagons, the Big Trail would look like.
