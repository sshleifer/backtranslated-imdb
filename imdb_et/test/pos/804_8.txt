Just after she moved to her new holiday home in England, Hercule Poirot is invited to dinner at Sir Henry and Lady Angkatell, who are the owners of a nearby large mansion. But the next day one of the guests is found near the pool and his clumsy wife keeps a few steps away from the revolver ... <br /> <br /> This mystery of Agatha Christie is somewhat thin, although the killer's plan is still very clever. This is a subtle filming and cinematography that will bring the story to a higher level. This episode mostly preserves the "Five Little Pigs" and "Sad Cypress" tone, but contains more dark humor than these. There are also two of the most famous actors who have worked at this point in the series, Edward Fox (butler) and Sarah Miles (like Lady Angkatell), although the extraordinary performance is played by amazingly beautiful Megan Dodds as their first time - Henrietta, his one-time confrontation with such a spark of Suchet. is the highlight of the movie. Oh, and because in England the police inspector is involved, I think they could have brought it back to Philip Jackson. (***)
