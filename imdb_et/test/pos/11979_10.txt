This film deserves what I give. <br /> <br /> But that's not what you would give to movies like "The Godfather" or "Goodfellas" or "Psycho". It's the 10 you give to a movie that just laughs, over and over again! This is the most terribly written and directed movie, but it doesn't work. It has the most amateur effects, but you enjoy every moment! I saw this movie on television today and I didn't want to go away! Read the following dialog to find out why! <br /> <br /> (The whole college is standing around Manisha, who has just passed the rape attempt and the boys who tried rape have applied for forgiveness) <br /> <br /> Bad Guy 1: Please forgive us! Bad guy 2: Yes, we don't do it again. <br /> <br /> (Manisha's no answer) <br /> <br /> Akshay: Come on, forgive them! <br /> <br /> Manisha: I don't know ... <br /> <br /> Akshay: You are a beautiful woman and even dead men can awaken you! And these are living young men! Don't blame them! <br /> <br /> Pancholi: Yes Manisha. <br /> <br /> Manisha (Sunset): What if they were trying to rape their girlfriend? <br /> <br /> Suniel: I would break my hands, feet and kill them. But anyway, just give them ... <br /> <br /> Akshay: Yes, if you don't forgive them, it's as if you are too arrogant about your beauty. <br /> <br /> Now this is a real masterpiece of dialogue! This movie is never entertaining, mainly because there are so many goofe and unrealistic situations! A bad guy (munish) can do something basically .. He can blow his mouth into a sand break or he can get a motorcycle on the back and just do it disappear. Every actor speaks repeatedly. One row from Akshay, then Suniel, then Arshad, then Aftab, then Niging. This is the main rule that the director follows, so that every man is given an equal screen time. And then there's a powerful pendant that can even cause a speeding car to go between you without damaging you! All these things make it an enjoyable movie and I can watch it over and over again. I think this movie can go to the comedy hall if it exists. The only problem is that he didn't try to be funny.
