Some less than inspired by music from open music, but we know somehow that in the case of the word "go" it moves straight into the "great fun" drawer. By the time we observe Monica Dolan (genuinely genius casting), who is happy at the beginning of Cora, we are already hooked, but only later, when she discovers her wonderful screen-making rap,, a malicious queen who is murder and fraud the shadow that is hidden in the shadow of Miss Gilchrist, that he not only steals the entire telemovie for himself, but just blows away anyone who is close to him, including always a well-measured David Suchet who himself seems to be somewhat puzzled by his acting talents and very gentle, allows him to be central. Dolan is the true engine of the movie and his Miss Gilchrist in this Christie rendition of a truly rounded character, helped by a scary script and a dirty pace - and the rest of the lead led by Geraldine James and Dominic Jephcott, all showing sympathy for the material and playing it pleasantly. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are on the spot as usual, and if there are weaker links, they may be in the relatively poor music score for most of the later Poirotesi and perhaps the absence of a true Italian-born actor for Cora's spouse's role. In addition, it is one and a half clean television joy that is as self-confident and entertaining as it is lovingly put together.
