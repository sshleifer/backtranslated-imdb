I hate vampire movies. it said it was very interesting to me. I want to point out one thing. "Bakjwi" literally means Korean skin and we all know that in many classic vampire stories you can see that Dracula reads vampires that turn into bats and fly away or wuheva. We also know that bats are mammals that can fly so many categorize them as "exceptional". As I watched the film, I realized that the topic of bats was deeply embedded in this movie as just a bat-vampire connection. <br /> <br /> Dual Human Nature = If you ever read Aesop's fables, there is one fable where mammals and birds are fighting and the bat just doesn't look like and doesn't try to play both sides as an advantage. Mammals and birds discover what this bat has done, and hit the ground at the end. <br /> <br /> Two contradictory human beings are constantly in battle for the whole movie. sang-hyun, a friend of the blind priests, sang-hyun efforts to quench thirst and his sexual desire, playing with both sides, his dull life vs. his excitement with vampire adventure, etc. (do not destroy too much, watch the movie) and this the theme is nicely presented on a disc with delicious romance, sex, violence, religion, dark comedy, tragedy, revenge, names! <br /> <br /> I feel many would find this movie boring and too long, but this movie is very fresh and new, something I haven't seen yet. I wouldn't say it's CW Park's best job, but it's mos. def. Strange to understand yet in the dark intriguing!
