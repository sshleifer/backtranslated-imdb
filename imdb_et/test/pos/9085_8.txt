Nelson is a medical professor who wants his four students to put him to death and then bring him back to life to prove he has a biography. So they do, and soon all the medical students will know if there is life after death. The afternoon is not about the gemstones and lights at the end of the tunnel, but a little bit heavier. <br /> <br /> Earlier ghosts come back to worship and certainly this movie worships anyone. It has some pretty frightening moments that can translate into real life, and it makes people somewhat strange what happens when you die. This is a good movie to see when it rains and you feel down. It's also a little weird. <br /> <br /> Look at it with a haunted past.
