Probably the best comedy for a long time. keeps you laughing! the actress is good and there are lots of fun fires like Ben stiller guitar store guy. The plot was not as good as I had hoped, but comedy does it. I can only count on another reason that still seems to be so much. Although it was 1 hour and 40 minutes long, I wanted to end up :) :) After the credit, there is a scene that is actually one of my favorite films !! I offer it to anyone who loves good comedy and definitely recommend it to D or Jack Black fans. You should also buy this album, the songs are so memorable and fun, there is also Top Notch on the music.
