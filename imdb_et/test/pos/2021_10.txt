I love this movie, especially because of Mark Wahlberg and secondly, because the end justifies the means. There is something about this movie that sucks you and lets you feel all the emotions the characters feel. Jen Aniston is the girlfriend of this movie. It looks at Rockstar's lifestyle that so many hardcore rockers lived that day (maybe they have become smarter today). It takes the rainbow of emotions and has many fine facets that allow light to pass through. Like a diamond, this film shines. You won't waste your popcorn on it. Semi-chick flick but my husband enjoyed it too. Some laughs are also thrown away.
