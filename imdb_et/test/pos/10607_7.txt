If you've ever seen a Bollywood movie, you know they're longer than many song and dance courses (each of over five minutes) because of most movies. Fortunately, it has less of a song and dance routine and is suitable for the length of a "standard" movie. Don't get me wrong, I like Bollywood movies, but tend to move fast through song and dance parts. I bought this DVD because I'm a fan of Ian Bohen. Although his role was not as great as I had hoped, he still had a lot of time on the screen. And his character was much more than his other roles. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a good movie. Like most Bollywood films, at least one traditional Indian culture is a contradiction / conflict element. But true love wins over accidents and the happy ending is for everyone.
