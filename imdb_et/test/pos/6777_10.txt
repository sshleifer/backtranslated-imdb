Many Americans are lazy and have even appeared on our DVD. Many of us do not want time to read one and a half (or more) subtitles, so we decide not to see many foreign films. One movie that is totally worth your time, regardless of the daily task you might think, is reading "Green Butchers". This is by far the best foreign film I've ever seen, and the top American films I've seen lately. This is a difficult situation that was spoken by a very simple and funny dialogue. The depth of character in this film is AMAZING. The Svend and Eigel Roads (Damage When Wrong Written) Bring each other's contradictory people into remarkable! The actors were well cast and I very much hope that the queue is weighted ... it needs very little Bjorne and what-face ... just give me a trip to Svend and Eigel along with supporting the characters and the amazing dialogue! I tell the author of this fine scenario: Write more! The story itself is quite twisted, but you will find yourself in any way rooting off ... without regret. PLEASE check out this movie!
