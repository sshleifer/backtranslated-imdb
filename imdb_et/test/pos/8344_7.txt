This film is probably meant to be a teaching tool for young, evangelical Christian audiences. To do this I give him 7 points out of 10 points. This is a decent film to show the youth group, but I don't think it would be very good. For all other audiences, I would appreciate it much lower. <br /> <br /> The reviewers who saw "It's a wonderful life" were right in this respect, although I didn't think about it before they mentioned it. I was reminded of "Chick Tract", these little 3 "5" gospel comic books. If Jack Chick has ever made his films, it would probably look much like "Second Glance". It has a strong Christian message of prayer power and the influence of everyone in the world, but this has been somewhat hindered by Christian stereotypes. Christians are all very nice, somewhat passive and clean, while all non-Christians seem to be bad people. <br /> <br /> An anxiety angel plays a big role and she is the hottest, happiest movie. She is the most unfavorable angel I've ever seen in every movie and the biggest negative. I don't know if the directors are going to get out of their personality so badly, or if he just hit me that way. (I admit that he reminded me of someone I know.) Dan loves a girl from the world who is not at all kind. Why he never fell for him is what I would like to answer. <br /> <br /> But the film has positive Christian values ​​and your youth group is entertaining when they see something healthy with a good lesson.
