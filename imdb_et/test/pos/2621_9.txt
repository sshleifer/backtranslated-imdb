Prue and Piper bring home Dr. Griffiths to save him from Sauce Assassin Shax. When Phoebe looks in the Shadow Book to fight the demon, Prue and Piper will fight and pursue the streets of Shax to destroy her. But they are filmed and exhibited in television news such as witches. They become a national sense with the people in front of their house. Phoebe trusts Cole and goes to the underworld of Leo to ask him to invite Tempus and restore the time when the fanatical wife Piper dies. The source suggests to Phoebe to stay with him and in return he saved his sister. Phoebe accepts the deal and the time is restored until Shax attacks Prue, Piper and Dr. Griffiti. <br /> <br /> "All hell loose" is a good but inconsistent episode. When Piper died and the Three Power was destroyed, why should the Source recycle time to save him? But this dramatic show is definitely one of the best in the third season and let the viewers consistently wait for the next episode. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Voltando no Tempo" ("Back in Time")
