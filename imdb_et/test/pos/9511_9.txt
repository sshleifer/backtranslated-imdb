I've never looked at a file in a language that I don't understand just because I wanted to see the movie and I couldn't find it in English. I don't know how much I miss, but it wasn't much. Probably only specific details that sound silly until you see the emotional level of this movie and how characters interact. I want to mention Diceman from Germany that there is no reason to feel that he is "sucking" in commenting on the emotional strength of the film. As I said, I do not understand the Japanese language or at least the very small amount I came from reading a very long novel - probably my favorite whole magazine that I couldn't put down and took the next day off just to finish reading the job! I don't know if there is an English version of a duplicated or subbed version, but when the movie is, but if I loved it. The film was incredible in Japan, the better the icing on the cake!
