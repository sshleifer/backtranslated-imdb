Oz is by far the best show for love on television. Better than Sopranos, yes, ER, yes, CSI, absolutely. Uncompromising, courageous and completely distracting but deeply moving. Oz missed us from any imprisonment that someone had ever created on television. Tom Fontana did a really great job in writing. No subject is taboo. Rapeseed, drugs, murder. Oz is proof of how good a TV can be. It follows all the characters from different backgrounds and all different races, but always comes back to his eternal Tobias Beecher, who is in jail for killing vehicles. We see what we don't want to see, pain, death, chaos. Oz interferes with you, makes you shine, makes you look, but above all, it is your mindset. Oz is seeing really great television production
