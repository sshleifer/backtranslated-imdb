I love a movie that interferes with the edge of the seat, laughs, style, good acting and a bit of independent parody. Hitchcock took it all the time and "Le Cercle rouge" makes Jean-Pierre Melville the same. I was sorry when this long movie ended. <br /> <br /> I agree with the English commentator, who found one of my compatriot's Sinoinic remarks. I love French movies, Italian movies, English movies, Indian movies and fewer and fewer American movies. I also feel that the writer who posted the film is not even a good copy of the American gangster film, but that point was completely. But I think it's like jazz: do you get it or not, why waste time trying to explain. <br /> <br /> Just look at "Le Cercle Noir" and be prepared to be delicious.
