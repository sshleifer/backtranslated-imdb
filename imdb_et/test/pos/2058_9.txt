I enjoyed this movie tremendously. I'm really into movies where women kick a lot in the ass, so this movie was already my hopes for some decent entertainment. My hopes were fulfilled and the film was overrun by less than 20 minutes. Action, humor and the content of this movie easily made it one of my favorite films. It was the presence of Sam Jackson and his indisputable screen, Geena Davis, as I have never seen him, demanding your respect and firm withdrawal, even if you don't want to give it. <br /> <br /> Gene plays Samantha Caine, amnesia, who desperately remembers something from her past but quickly realizing, the more she discovers what she wants to forget and eventually consumes until Samantha is so much and Charly is all what's left. But now, can Charly and Sam, two completely different women, exist in the same body? We have symbols that appear in and out of a film that grows Sam / Charly on both sides, like Sam Jackson and Craig Bierko. Craig is also irresistible like Timothy, a sexy bad guy with no conscience. <br /> <br /> This movie was completely cast and worked great, top and wonderful. You look at impossible cases and praise it when it does. So it is worth your time. Look at it, you won't lose.
