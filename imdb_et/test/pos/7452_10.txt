I don't have much to say if it is a great finish in the story. Most people have said that there is not enough land and just an eye candy. But think about it, everything was explained in FFVII so you can't add such a big story to the plot if it destroys it. They did the best they could, and I think it should be taken more than the final FMV. The last fight. <br /> <br /> Graphics - 10/10, absolutely amazing <br /> <br /> Story 8.5 / 10 - don't think they could expand it further. And the things they could have put in there were smart enough I thought. <br /> <br /> Signs 9/10 - Well most of them have already been explained during the game, but could not match it for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Heli - is because I am a metal fan that I loved fighting music .. and the piano just comes straight from there. This is a great ST and I wasn't disappointed. <br /> <br /> Tilt / Replay 10/10 - enjoyable every time. <br /> <br /> In general - 9/10 (FF Fan View 10/10) <br /> <br /> I personally think it's necessary to fight it out. The plot was already in place. Action was needed as much as people complained. I loved this movie every second. It was a pleasure to visit the FFVII world only once. <br /> <br /> Remember this. Most of the movies that have been made of the game have been directed by film directors, who I think is a big team of game groups. Don't think I've seen a better game for the movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you, I think you did it right!
