I have been able to capture and impress this independent film, even though there is no excitement on the plot. All involved were doing very well. Amy Madigan played part of the guilt of a mother who is tired but with good will and decided to make up for her younger daughter. But in this process, he has forgotten his older sister, who is more interested in playing with his Savant syndrome that is brotherly and lively in the world. <br /> <br /> The men in the movie are very powerful in their secondary roles. Christopher Lloyd shows us in his very underrated role why he has such versatility. He plays a teacher who is dedicated to his profession and literary research, but is still hungry for a reasonable relationship. He and Madigan are very well connected in their scenes, but both know that their friendship is nothing more. Their speechless goodbye is not only a brilliant, exemplary lesson for aspiring performers. <br /> <br /> And a small role, Fred Savage is fun to watch. <br /> <br /> You can tell why this movie was based on the game, it is probably very good. It's not particularly exciting on the screen, but it's still very thoughtful and powerful in its nuances.
