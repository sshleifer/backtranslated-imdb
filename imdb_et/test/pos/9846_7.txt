Big James Cagney, who is top-rated in capital letters, doesn't appear until the second third of the movie, and is likely to have less time on the screen than Dudley Digges, who plays the boost of the eee-wool reform school. But when Jimmy arrives as Deputy Reform School reformer, he breathes his arms and jumps into the feet of the legs and spits out all the usual dialogues, and awaits the panache. Its crisp antique psychology, one of the many efforts of the Witnesses to affirm their place as a "socially conscious" studio, is not working deeply: Digges is bad only because the script requires him, and there is a nice idea that juvenile criminals are becoming expanding children if they have just autonomy. But it's done in this free and fast style that the studio specializes in, and it's never boring. Frankie Darro, who ran into all kinds of screen problems during a short term as Warners' favorite Rotten Street Kid, is the perfect JD - a beautiful, charismatic toughie with pug nose and anger filled with hate that can withstand steel. No child actress can touch her today.
