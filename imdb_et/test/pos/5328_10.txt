I looked at the external comments of this movie (Ebert, etc.) and they were all pretty negative. But after reading many of them, I noticed that they all did the same. The critics were upset that the film focused on the senseless murder of an autistic child. Surely this is a disturbing picture. Critics, such as Ebert, want a traditional detective story that reveals why murder happened and blames the guilty. They want to blame and solve. Well, this status-quo theme is what the movie parodies. Just like society, the critics wanted a very quick solution so they could go on to their next tragic opera. Maybe it's not easy to answer here? There's a lot more that happened then what's on the surface. The film does not try to rationalize what is happening, but rather to understand why. What seems to me to be such a reviewer is that everything they watch is Spacey and Cheadle, both big (and generally). But there are other great performances besides the two current Hollywood icons. Gosling provides an incredible result that only one of his extreme talents can really offer. Gosling can somehow make the autistic child killer sympathy. It irritates many, I'm sure. But when you watch the movie, they see what Leeland's motivation is, it's wrong, but it's not bad. Malone is also one of the most confused young characters in her game. In principle, killing a child in this film is not the main theme of the film. The main theme is life itself, and how people deal with it, highs and low, and sometimes they try to help others cope with their lives (which doesn't seem to work very well). There are many good and bad in this world, and how we handle each of them directly affects how much more good and bad is happening, and sometimes it can confuse good, which can lead to a whole host of evil. I think this is sometimes one of the most memorable films and it has an end to the latest film history. I firmly believe that people should watch this movie openly.
