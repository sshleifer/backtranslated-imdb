I enjoyed an older doctor who several years ago, so when the new came out, I just had to review it. I was so pleased - characters, story, updated look, I started trying! Starting from season 1 (for 27 old fans) to season 2 (28), it continues to improve. It is also beautifully associated with old examples, although you don't need to know older exhibitions to enjoy this newer version. <br /> <br /> Although there are cast changes, I highly recommend Who Who - together with Chris Eccleston AND David Tennant. <br /> <br /> I like being so deep in the characters. The doctor seems to be more sensitive in this series, perhaps because he is the last TimeLord. The amount of emotions at Chris and David's show is truly remarkable, and I felt their pain, anger and adventure with them. <br /> <br /> Billie Piper (Rose) brings a very human element to every episode, although she is much bolder than I would be. With his talent, Billie goes a long way in the industry.
