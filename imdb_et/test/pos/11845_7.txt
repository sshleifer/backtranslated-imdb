"Seeing Other People" is a brave romantic comedy couple named Ed and Alice (Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson) who are equipped and plan to get help soon. They live together, but both have doubts about their relationship. Alice realizes she has so few sexual relationships in the past, she can just marry Ed because she never knew anything else. So they agree that they will fool around for some time to test their relationship. <br /> <br /> The film balances the upcoming issue - focusing too much on "What if?" Can it really be the opposite and only feel more restricted? When Ed starts sex with a college girl, he begins to become addicted and almost forget about Alice - if he understands it, he scares him. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of this movie before, but I enjoyed it. It is not very well done and it is definitely a low-budget indie feeling - but it is much better than the most romantic comedies that are in the mainstream today. <br /> <br /> Check it when you get the chance.
