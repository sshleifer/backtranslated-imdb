This is a mystery to me, why am I not stuck with this masterful 50's capri film? So far the exclaimed Noir turned to me, but I'm sure I'm glad he wasn't disappointed. Jules Dassini's American films have not been seen for many years, but on this basis I will probably be back in the "Brute Force" and "Night and the City" soon. <br /> <br /> Jean Servais, a name that is not known to me, but a face that is quite familiar with its world-fatigue and frostiness, has recently stopped for a long time in prison and as it is the way of these films (hey, no would otherwise be a story) would not solve well straight life. The opportunity is: a simple multi-million dollar gemstone that can be done at night without fear of some men discovering it. Tight filming of the robbery, half an hour of complete silence, is what people naturally remember most about the film and indeed it is quite remarkable; but I liked the semi-finished place of the final shootout when the robbery has gone because of a big mouth of thieves; Paris's magnificent sharp sides are black and white; and Servais, targeting both Eddie Constantine and Humphrey Bogart for their free but brutal performance. <br /> <br /> It may be a bit too sentimental in the end, but it is one of the classics that really live in reputation as pure entertainment, even if what he has to say about the human condition is not exactly deep or thoughtful; George Auric is in turn a modernist, romantic and jazzy score.
