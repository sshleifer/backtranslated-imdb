Although this movie may not be the next Evil Dead (hell who knows it may be, it's just one year). Don't expect a $ 10 million movie. cuz you have to be disappointed. Wait for you to entertain, laugh, and enjoy the experience. All this movie is much better than many, if not all, low budget horror movies out there. I've seen movies that spent more than 10 or 20 times on this movie, and that has turned out to be 10 billion times worse. Efforts far beyond this film outweigh the limited budget. Movies are for entertainment and this movie definitely does. In fact, this movie can even open new doors to you when you watch a movie. It is available on Netflix if it is not a local video output. So look at it, then decide.
