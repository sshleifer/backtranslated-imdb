First of all, I tried with Jennifer years ago when I was out of town when it appeared on the television in the middle of the night; I fell asleep before it ended, but it stayed with me until I had to suppress it. His appeal is that, although there is not much to it, it creates an intriguing atmosphere, and because East Lupino and Howard Duff (at that time a real man and woman) show tempting and low-key chemistry. Lupino plays a female who is involved to sit on a big California municipality, whose previous guardian - Jennifer - was up and down. (Jack Nicholson's shades in Shining, though in this case Lupino is not going to go or go crazy). Duff is a city man who manages estate finances and looks to Lupino who decides to play. She is becoming more and more involved, not to say obsessed with her predecessor in an old dark house full of shrinking stairs and locked cellars. The atmosphere and the romantic byplay are the best part of the film, because viewers will probably find the resolution a bit devastating - there is not so much (except for the little tail tip that awaits Brian) of De Palma's movie codes). But it is well done, and again it will stay with you. Optional: This is a movie that introduced the song "Angel Eyes", which was part of Ol 'Blue Eyes' standard repertoire.
