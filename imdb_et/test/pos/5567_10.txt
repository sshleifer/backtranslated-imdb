Farscape - is one of the Sci-Fi Show that restarted my interest in Science Fiction. <br /> <br /> But Farscape is so much easier and simpler for Sci-Fi. Comedy, Drama, and more :) Working is great. Fortunately, Farscape also missed it and showed that it is not dead yet in the wars of the peacekeepers. I hope Farscape will be in the future :) In my opinion, the problem is that some of the exhibits are muppet. You have to look behind it and see what the beautiful Farscape is. <br /> <br /> Farscape sets a new standard on TV, and I think it's really hard to prove that new shows can be equal or better than Farscape. I love this show :) <br /> <br /> SaphirJD
