RETURN (2009) ** 1/2 Dominic Monaghan, Larry Fessenden, Ron Perlman, Angus Scrimm, John Speredakos, Eileen Colgan, Brenda Cooney. An uneven mix of horror and comedy, the valentine of Roger Corman's and Hammer Studios' 60's horror films, with two cretinous grave robbers (Monaghan and Fessenden) for a final punishment through guillotine, but not before their stories can be recalled in setbacks. An amusing and pair of well sprinkled bunches, but really a mess of the B-film, trying to persuade you to be a classic classic to a large extent thanks to the pain of the genealogists Perlman and Scrimm; good rental for Halloween.
