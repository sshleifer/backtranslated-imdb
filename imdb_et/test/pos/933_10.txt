The last part of the Kieslowski trilogy, based on the colors of the French flag, finds the director's peace with the metaphysical and transcendental nature of the cinematographic image. Radishes are very important images, but also an obvious but clever color code. However, Kieslowski's red is the pursuit of empty aesthetic attitudes based on "cinema du look", a multi-layered, tightly drawn meditation of fate and love. In red, love and destiny are intertwined, but complex concepts dictated by so many human beings as invisible parallel connections that stand out through us. You realize that Red is really an allegory, Prospero restoring all sorts of gestures in Tempus, but that's more than his story. Red requires countless views, and in every view, something new is discovered that appears to be already immune-drawn. The blue and white elements are referred to by Red, which viewers enjoy.
