I got this movie a week after Ichikawa Kon's death - I think if there is one way to mark the passing of a big director, he raises him a glass of wine, watching one of his biggest films. Ichikawal was one of the best career in Japanese film, but since he never had a distinctive style or theme, he often seemed to be neglected compared to his close ages like Ozu and Kurosawa (he was a little younger but not much). He is one of those directors who defy the author's theories - his likelihood that his wife (who wrote this and many of his other film scenarios) is responsible for film quality as well as he was. But at the same time he was as good as every Japanese filmmaker. Above all, he had great technical skills that allowed him to speak complex stories in an accessible way. But on the subject, this film can be easier - war is hell. Not really, its serious hell. <br /> <br /> Fire in the normal way does not follow the usual rules of the war genre. There is no real start - we start as a bad Tamura who is a normal private sector (although it is supposed to be more thoughtful and educated than most others - one stage shows that he understands English, but he breaks when he asks others telling him how he knows it) is being hospitalized because his unit is already in a terrible condition. Soldiers are defeated and starved to death. They are no longer an army, but a group of towel racks by the refugees who have been hunted by the local population, and ignored by the Americans who have been roasting larger fish. Hunger and despair drive soldiers to madness and beyond. <br /> <br /> In a typical Ichikawa style, it's not just gloomy - its strange funny parts (of course, very black humor). <Br /> <br /> The high points of this movie are my highlighted items and live photography. The characters of the total disappearance of all of their humanity, but also of humanity, are too plausible. This is a rare film - one that refuses to erase itself, even if you want to forget it.
