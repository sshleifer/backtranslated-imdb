"Think like a dinosaur" was a well-produced and performed show by the Outerlimits series. The actor (Enrico Colanton as Michael Burr) plays an impressive and convincing role as a protagonist. In fact, you can identify with him and his "introspective" feelings about what to do with the girl he has fallen into (because he has been disappointed and disappointed for two years and feels hopelessly as long as "Kamala" gets empty of his life. He fears him and let him know that all this is in order, which comes to both sides, so something bad happens and he (prototype) comes back ... And his (clone) is sent to the other resident's planet, though -Dino and Micheal has not yet found it when they make this Michael decide whether to kill or let him live, yet what happens to him before his meeting (horrible) was very much related to what happens to his wife, his wife died similarly. and all that should have been done and you are in custody 50/50 of what is the right thing. So the equation "balance" is just one. <br /> <br /> 10/10 We highly recommend this example to watch.
