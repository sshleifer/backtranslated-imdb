Oh yes! Hollywood doesn't remember how to use a good old formula, and when the lightning strikes, it's a pretty wonderful feeling. It rarely creates a Hollywood masterpiece, because lately it seems more concerned about hurrying faster and getting the most reward or getting too many chefs involved. Usually, good scenarios are the result of a talented writer who completely controls his property, understands his material, and is a good writer. Then there are few important elements that are often ignored by marketing genes that are so often lacking in creativity and vision: a good actor. <br /> <br /> A good actor can make a difference between a mediocre, semi-mature, and fully realized film that may not be an important and relevant film, but one that contributes to its genre and may eventually become a classic. We get very little romantic comedies and we are the people who are starving for them. "Sex in the City" sexy humor has been buried in the romantic but turbulent relationship between Big and Carrie, and people pulled on "Mamma Mia" because of the romance she played skillfully with Streep and Brossnam. It may be silly musical, but it touched us because it was played with intensity and conviction. "Nights" offers us more, with great work with a woman who works great in romantic films, Mrs Diane Lane. From our childhood performance we were able to assess how her talent, along with her grateful soul, gave us the opportunity to read the story to the heart of the protagonists. A couple of years ago, he collaborated with Mr Gere, giving us a tortured, romantic and sexy presentation as a woman who is not too sure about the consequences of her "Unbelievable" work that should have been collected by her at least the Academy Award. He is back, doing more work in this romantic jewel than a woman who has given up her romantic prospects, and suddenly she realizes that there may be another way around the corner. <br /> <br /> ms. Lane makes this film pulsating with intelligence and passion. His facial expressions convey the volume of different emotions he characterizes. We can read disappointments, longing, despair, anger, hope, loss and choice that stretch out the many types of marketable products Hollywood is constantly pushing our throat. Here is a mature performer who has a gift for designing real emotions and that allows us to connect with the material so that we move on to the experience. <br /> <br /> ms. Lane is such a triumphant joy to see when she passes through the first scenes of the movie until the end. His discoveries become ours when we celebrate the power of hope and love with him. She can bring back the unforgettable joy of a loved one, like a teenager, and she will never let you think of her character as stupid or irresponsible. His eyes are expressive gems that can move even cynically to the public. He is one star that can do miracles with just one glance. He has the classic feeling of these big films yesterday. His work recalls the passionate and intelligent work of Hepburn, Davis, Garson, the women of everyday life, which made them memorable because they created complete characters. <br /> <br /> We admire those great actors who create real life legends and pay for it. Half of their work is the mystery of the images they induce; but as much as one might think of you, there is a role such as Lane in this movie, which is a more impressive achievement because it is created from scratch, giving a personal impression and being able to reach a height without the support of prior theater material, such as games and the legend of the legend that life is in the silver screen with respect. Lane's character is one woman whose experience can be none of us. He represents our dreams and emotions with great quality, class and just the right amount of mood. This is a remarkable achievement and we should be grateful that we can still find such remarkable performance today. one can only say that in my humble opinion, each of his films in this film is one of the greatest performances ever made by a living performer of cellulose. Thank you, Mrs Lane.
