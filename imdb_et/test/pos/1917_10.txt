I saw this movie on TV and loved it! I am a real disaster fan and it was great. Some very interesting people were cast. Connie Selleca is always great. And William Devane is in his own league. He can play both comedy and thriller in the same movie as some others. The story is also great. An interesting idea is the idea of ​​being able to follow what is happening and using this schedule to prevent a global disaster. And this film brings it out so that it is almost entirely credible.
