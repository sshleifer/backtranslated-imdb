World War II veterans come home and find it difficult to adapt to civilian life. This great drama is directed by Wyler expertly and filmed by famous operator Toland. Despite its almost 3-hour length, it doesn't drag one minute. The Sherwood script has very human characters and a great dialogue. Andrews is perhaps his best role when a man tries to make ends meet. Also good is Wright's young lady in love, Mayo as Andrew's trampy wife and actual veteran Russell as a man who lost both hands. But the best prizes will go to March and Loy as married couples who face the challenges of getting to know each other again.
