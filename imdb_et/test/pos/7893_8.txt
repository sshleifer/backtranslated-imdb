When Archie Bunker was armed, he could be "Joe." But "Everything in the Family" would have been quite short-lived because the censors would never have allowed him to follow that movie. Joe is a working class who is racist and bigot and has a big mouth, especially when he's drunk. One evening, he meets a man at the bar, Bill, who has a drink to relieve his indignant junk boy and his daughter in jealousy, and lets him go to Joe. What happens is that Bill's daughter lived with a junkie, and she has been hospitalized after an overdose, and she goes to the apartment to collect her stuff, but she doesn't expect her to actually get into a boy who's coming out of the big drugs. In the fight, the boy kills randomly and Bill doesn't want anyone to really know. But he lets Joe slip and when the newspapers and TV ads come out, Joe sees them, puts 2 and 2 together, and suddenly this guy is his hero. He grabs him later and Bill is, of course, concerned that Joe is going to blackmail him, but not for the money he wants with him. What is in some way almost worse. Now, Bill's daughter escapes at the clinic where she is, and slips back home and randomly checks what happened and then ran, and most of the rest of the movie consists of Joe & Bill's invasion of "underground" to try and find her. It is based on a rather shocking ending that was completely unexpected for me and ends with the right note or the wrong comment, depending on your point of view. A sort of decent, but bad life in the early 70s, mostly from the working class's bigot, which does it for everyone, but it's not a bad film and it's a good watch. 8 out of 10.
