It is quite surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as Hollywood had black-and-white problems on the collective heads. The film deserves a strong stance for taking this stand, for extraordinary action for mostly less well-known productions, and for a super-intelligent script that doesn't break the audience or easily take out white racism. Plus, the movie's rather modest budget and fast work hours make it an amazing job! <br /> <br /> Juano Hernandez (an extraordinary actor who played a number of roles supporting the era's films) is a proud black man accused of murdering a white man in the south. People could feel less for details - they are just hanging. And despite his commitment to the law, one lawyer in a city that has agreed to defend him, also assumes that he is guilty and does not really want to know - just push the hanging until they can blame him and then blame LEGAL! Luckily, the young white man (Claude Jarmin) starts to marvel at Juano's innocence and begins to seek the truth. At this point, the best character of this great drama is introduced - Elizabeth Patterson (an old lady who later played Mrs Trumbull I LOVE LUCY). He steals the exhibition unilaterally as a white person who has not only a conscience but a will and a determination to stand for a black man. At one wonderful point in the movie, the mob tries to kill him to kill him, but he is very firm and pushes them back. There is much more to this rather complex but intelligently written story, but I leave it to myself. Look at it with your children if you have the opportunity - it opens up an amazing dialogue on how far racial relationships have reached in the last 50 years. By the way, probably in 1949, the great year for Hollywood, which finally deals with racial prejudice, has been published by Twentieth-Century Fox as "Pinky" - the same effective and strong film on racism, racial marriage and even rape! Watch both movies when you can.
