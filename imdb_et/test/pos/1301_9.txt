I watched it because my friend told me it was good, and I watched this video so I was actually watching it. I watched it and the fucking scenes are really good. If boys can't fight in real life in such a situation, they will definitely deceive me. I have to say that there is not as much struggle as I want, but the struggles in the film are quite remarkable. They don't show much, but you can say it's violent and cool. But there is also a plot that moves between the headlines around the triangle of love, although it is a little twisted. Tae-sung is a carefree guy who seems to love to rush and fight. She is the head of her school and she is the winner of the Good-winner who is the head of her school - a little playboy, a hot-headed and a rich boy. Then there is a Han-kyung, a girl who doesn't have much of her, her father just died and she moved back to her mother, the man she liked, looking for her old friend - and then she meets Hea-win who goes to her school and Tae -sung who calls him "nun" (older sister). Finally, he discovers that the Tae song is his brother, the fruit of one father's thing, and he loves him despite their blood relations. In the meantime, Good-win falls on him and he takes his boyfriend. But he's torn between his boy and his little brother who admits his love. All in all, this is a great movie, but if I were really depressed after the end and I just couldn't think of the devil, are all the Korean films I watch about fighting / death / depressing things / incest? Because it was certain when the old boy and the wolves were bullied. This is a very good movie, but people have to be ready to look.
