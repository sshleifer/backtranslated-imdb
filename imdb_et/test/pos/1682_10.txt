The plot line is the bottom stomach of American politics. While the theme seems to be normal, what the film does is an unusual way to tell the story. <br /> <br /> Characters are played with conviction. You know the innocence of the leadership and its innocence. The politician is the prince of double talk, a true snake. <br /> <br /> Camera performance is impressive. This confirms the nuances of operation and dialogue. Music for music. <br /> <br /> The story uses tweets with a parable where the message is filled with double quotation. Writer / director is a very funny strategy. The impact lines collide with the last scene. <br /> <br /> The film was like a book of good mystery. Something was "going on"; you knew it was bad; you didn't know exactly what it could be - you had doubts; And when evil was revealed, you let out your soul, which you did not notice you were holding. Unfortunately, shaking your head. <br /> <br /> The story is well written and well spoken. 3 joy to a young writer / director.
