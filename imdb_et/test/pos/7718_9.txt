just got back from seeing this wonderfully funny movie. <br /> <br /> This is part of the reason I loved it because I can draw attention to people and places I knew ("I go there every day!", "I work there!" there are drinks! ',' hey! this is our postman! 'etcâ€¦) but still if you want to make a bit of "apologize" (excuse me for pun) - this is just the right answer. love is knit inside the plot. <br /> <br /> Preston (where the movie is set) has recently been made a city, it is good to see the work where there is a place and adding a sense of ascension - it is also an excellent representation of many cultures in the north . <br /> <br /> Fabulous!
