Behind the nostalgic music we see a young boy out of the train. He arrives from Yugoslavia to meet his father, a man he didn't see in a decade. At the train station we meet a man. So he never smiles. <br /> <br /> So we start our journey with "Four Friends", a powerful and amazing film by Arthur Penni. You may ask why I started my review in this way. Well, that's how the movie box describes the movie. Perhaps you have thought that the film is a story about the boy trying to fight with this emotional man and eventually disappearing on his cover and revealing kindness. <br /> <br /> Well, when you bought it, I have a bridge that I want to sell to you. You see, modern Hollywood is making this movie. Penn has always been an outsider and has never used typical clich√© storytelling. He always says interesting stories about people (his credits include "Bonnie and Clyde", "Chase", "Alice Restaurant" and the underrated "Mickey One") and "Four Friends" are no exception. <br /> <br /> A typical Hollywood movie focuses on who is called Danilo. But Steve Tesich's script only focuses on it for about 4 minutes and then gives up. We meet an adult Danila, who is playing Craig Wasson (whom you can recognize as "Body Double" and "Nightmare on Elm Street 3") and his friends, Tom, David and passionate Georgia. The film takes us over the sixties. Fewer films focus on events. But "Four Friends", these events take place, but Penn and Tesich are more interested in character research than in the plot and I think this film is better. We know events; we don't have to live them again. <br /> <br /> I know I haven't described much of the plot, but I don't know if you can describe "Four Friends". This is not one of the "high concept" movies that can be described in one sentence. It is a film of many moods and textures. It is also a truly emotional experience. The last twenty minutes of this movie took me to tears. I'm not ashamed to admit it. In rare cases, the film has the power to make me tear. Action is the first step, especially Craig Wasson, who seems to be one of the least-used participants working today. It's so hard, emotional, and Wasson pulls it away. He should have accepted it as an Oscar. Another great performance is Jodi Thelen, who has an even harder role than Wasson. But he does it very well and gives Georgia some dignity that most Hollywood actors would not have (they would be too scared to even try; they would be more concerned than giving a picture, not high performance); He also served as an Oscar. <br /> <br /> "Four friends" did not get much pressure in 1981. Perhaps people simply had no emotional ability to cope with it. And clueless leaders could not push it to another "American Graffiti" (it lacks the wall "Four Friends"). So they'll die. Too bad because it is one of the best films of the 1980s, a tenth, where more and more slippery trash was created and such a great art was without home. I ask you to give this film a chance. <br /> <br /> **** from the four stars
