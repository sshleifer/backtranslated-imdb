When you think about golf games, do you think of Caddyshack, but what about kids? Go straight to this movie! The uses of Disney have been proven to make a movie that adults and children enjoy. Acting in this movie is, in my opinion, quite good and the leading majority is very young! This movie is also surprisingly filmed very well and uniquely, seeing all the corners of the golf game. I think this movie should give some of the Academy's awards for editing a movie or something like this, because the entire movie's stream is the upper limit. Although the end may be a bit predictable, it makes the film itself well! It also shows that you do not need to swear, nudity or violence to do a great golf game!
