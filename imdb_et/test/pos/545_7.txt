I thought somewhere, but here was a good movie. It stands for two wonderful actors, Susan Sarandon and Natlie Portman, which when I heard they were with the film, I don't want to watch it. In general, it was a pretty enjoyable movie. where I felt like they were trying hard and there was really too much material and material, but there was nothing in the movie that I absolutely hated. unredeemed Thora Kask and all the small happy / sad moments are relevant and effective.If you want to watch this movie, go on, because although I do not recommend it, it is not something you should avoid, and 5.9 seems to be unfair in my opinion.
