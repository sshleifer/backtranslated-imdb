I saw it because my cousin is one of the wedding scenes. I read somewhere that Oz and Rudnick wanted to have fun movies, but the climax comes straight from one of those movies. Also, some humor is somewhat diffuse, Joan Cusack was too up for me, and someone is a stranger to the Oscar. Nevertheless, there were more than enough funny moments, such as a kiss, a wedding that is not, and a scene with the principal to enjoy it. Kline is always good, but for me the real surprise was Selleck, whom I am not a big fan of, but amused myself nicely here.
