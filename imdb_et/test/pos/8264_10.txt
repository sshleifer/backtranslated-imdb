I managed to record this great drama, both parts, when it first appeared in the Masterpiece Theater. I loved it but lost it. Then one day, the old tapes went through it again. I saved it on a DVD and watched and --- WOW! I still love it! The wires are great and my only complaint is that I wish we had seen more Kesters! What a man! And Prue. He is so strong and wonderful ... he lives in an age and age where his effort and how he deals with it is considered to be regrettable and miserable. Even his own brother tells Prue that he doubts that he will ever have him. * sigh * Unfortunately, my copy is not the biggest, over the years, and I would like to have it on a professional DVD if it ever happens.
