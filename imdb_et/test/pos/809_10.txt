In better civilization, this and many other David Suchet films are released in theaters. Plots are fabulous (no, I wouldn't have a clue who would have done it, but the hints were all there if I had been more imaginative - the best mystery), the production values ​​were amazing, they worked (Edward Fox from Sarah Miles, Lysette Anthony, Megan Dodds and Of course David Suchet as Hercule Poirot) just perfect, dialogue is wonderful, music and tension and tension just wonderful. <br /> <br /> One of the joy of these Hercule Poirot films for a man is how many beautiful women in them! Here were two - sexy of your Megan Doods and the stunning Lysette Anthony. <br /> <br /> You can't rent them wrong - they're just wonderful - just like a wonderful dinner in the most wonderful restaurant, you can imagine - with your mind constantly working, because it's all there and you struggle, but keeping in mind constantly thinking , you can keep up with everything - and the settings are great. <br /> <br /> I can't think of movies that stimulate thinking more than those of Hercule Poirot / David Suchet. It is impossible to praise them - and I had never seen it before a few months ago and I didn't read Agatha Christie.
