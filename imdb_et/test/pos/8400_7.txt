This mini-series is a sensible sequel to the original wind. If it is viewed from its own (not immediately after the original), it will appear pretty good. I'm sure most of the viewers question Scarlett and Rhett's performances, but it seems unlikely that anyone else could have done better. Many of these characters are new to this story, so comparing these cases (Rheti's mother, Uncle Henry Hamilton, Will Benteen) is not a problem. No one can be Vivien Leigh or Clark Gable. <br /> <br /> The best part of the whole production is the beautiful landscape of Spring Charleston and Ireland. Look at it alone. Obviously it was a big budget television seminar. It will follow the book for a while, then Scarlett will be a brand new plot for Ireland. <br /> <br /> Actress is plausible if nothing special - as I know about Roger Moore's Sean Connery by James Bond.
