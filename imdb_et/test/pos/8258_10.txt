Please why not put this fantastic movie on DVD, I've been looking like a previous writer for years, whats on hold or show it on television. so underestimated is one of the most romantic and beautifully written books I've ever read, and I believe I've read some. I think it was read on radio 4, but I can't find it either. Why not try to do it again, I promise it is a top consumer, people love these different stories, so please either free it and take us out of our misery, or though we doubt it could be improved. Has anyone read that the same author has seen or seen the film with Jennifer Jones, it's great, but not to the same extent.
