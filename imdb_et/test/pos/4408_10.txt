I had to see it on television when it was broadcast for the first time in a few decades. I thought it was great, and as I remember so much, I've been right now. Although I've lived in and around London, I can't call myself Londoner and I don't know it well at all - who does taxi drivers? When the viewer understands the premise; that there are a group of men who are trying to learn seemingly unlearn-able and ascend to the status of demigods, but the rest is a sheer joy. The characters are well contrasted, their family relationships are equally different and the film's events are so different. Don't think it's a documentary - it's pure drama and knowledge is one of the characters. I've never seen this movie before or after. Look out!
