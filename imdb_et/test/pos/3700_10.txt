This is one of the best TV movies you will ever see. Performance, writing and product values ​​are top-notch. Performances are passionate about Beverly D'Angelo as an older woman with a teenage daughter and Rob Estes who is just as perfect as a young boy-boy. The best part of this movie, however, was how it showed the consequences of sexual abuse, not the end of normal happiness. This showed that abuse can take place in good families; involve good people; and wrecks live. It's thinking provocative and fun. Congratulations to all those involved in this extraordinary film. <br /> <br />
