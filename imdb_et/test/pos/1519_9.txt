this movie stayed with me for this endless eye-catching eye because after that ... the movie doesn't snob me that some people seem to be here, but I thought it was an amazingly well-functioning and powerful creature when there were little nuances in the selection . I admire movies that can effectively restore the sense of performance, creating an inconsistency in eeriness that works well with this flick. I am also a big fan of alan rickman so it can be my prejudice. personally I found that the lack of spatial landmarks is good - it can actually be everywhere and probably too. I say go easy, which was a great experience for me, and probably for everyone involved in any political activity.
