When I went to see Bon Voyage, I waited for a good, skilful multidram on Grand Hotel (1932) and Les Enfants de Paradise (1944). It was better. With a few exceptions, no character was totally good or totally evil - as in real life. The show was great, especially for those who played Frédéric, Raoul and Camille. Photography was amazing because it created the period perfectly and managed to beat Bordeaux during new public works, but led the June 1940 appearance. Costumes and make-up were accurate. There's so much in this movie that it's worth watching for another. It's exciting, funny and ultimately touching. N.B. - Be sure to watch it in a high-quality projection theater. It is on the widescreen and in the theater where I saw it (Montclair Clairmont), the first 30 minutes of the subtitles were in the bottom, but the actors' faces were a little blurry! It was corrected, but the film's joy was reduced.
