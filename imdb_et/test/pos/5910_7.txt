Everyone knows that Lindburgh managed to succeed on the first transatlantic flight. So how can there be any tension or intrigue in this movie? Well, there is. Don't ask how, but there is. Partly because the director has told the story, but mainly thanks to Jimmy Stewart's in-depth entertainment, we draw the story the way it would be for the first time before our eyes. Despite the fact that half of the movie is filmed in a narrow cabin, it is as dynamic as all the activities there. So if you are afraid of seeing this movie because you think you already know the story, hit him. I think you are impressed.
