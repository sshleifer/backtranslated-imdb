Some people do not know the magical elements of ROS, but they make this series apart, and the fact that the producers actually decided to dress the clothes and armor actors - not anachronistic feather caps, multi-colored tights and plate armor! <br /> <br /> But I am actually writing to comment on an earlier poster article. Michael Praed did not leave ROS doing Jules Verne! There are 15 years between these two series. Yes, I agree and Michael can also agree that leaving ROS was not a good step - but it was a coveted Broadway role that tempted him in 1984 and then with his megabucks paychecks.
