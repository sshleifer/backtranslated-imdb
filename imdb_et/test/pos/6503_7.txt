This film is primarily for those who have little or no hip-hop, especially turntableism, as it was directed before the movie. It was cool to focus more on the expectations of the bay because NY has always received all the credits, but come under control of the bay of Q-Berti. This film did not introduce anything new to me, but it changed my belief that it was a sketchy outlook to distinguish between tables as a bona fide tool. This movie should convince anyone that it is viola and clavichord.
