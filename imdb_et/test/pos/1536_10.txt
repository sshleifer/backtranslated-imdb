"Closet Land" says a powerful story and has many different exquisite elements. You can read a lot of things before the movie's plot, but you don't have to do it. All you need to know is that the film is a question of questioning. We learn a lot about the interviewer and the person being interviewed. We also learn that the world can be a dark and scary place. Especially if you have absolutely no control over it. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the film's warning (although the film has many different aspects) of what happens to people's freedoms when they do. look differently and ignore the injustices surrounding them. <br /> <br /> If you have about one and a half hours and you know where to rent it, I suggest you do it.
