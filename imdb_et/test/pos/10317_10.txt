Without wishing to repeat what everyone else has said, just say this: <br /> <br /> Almost everyone says they loved Curly the best ... but I put BRIDELESS GROOM SITUUDE on other short pants. <br /> <br /> I think it's the most fun from start to finish, and it's the most traceable. <br /> <br /> Uncompromising singing student ... Christine McIntire's "Cousin Basil" routine and of course Emil Sitka JP is highlighted, but only around Stooges' impeccable timing and great writing! <br /> <br /> Nuff said.
