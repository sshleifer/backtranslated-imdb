This is a musically extraordinary film. It made me feel awful that Rodrigues died in 1999 before I was able to live with him. To find out that he did an excellent Lincoln Ctr. a concert in 1991 and what I could have been there, but it didn't hurt over the words. <br /> <br /> I just bought my first Amalia recording. Although the musical recording is fantastic, this film can see his face and its enormous expressiveness and passion when he sings these terrible sorrows is wonderful. A similar sight to Mary's face when she cries out Jesus in her hand. Looking at her on the film, I reminded me that I was witnessing a similar extraordinary performance by Mercedes Sosa in the mid-1990s by Lincoln Ctr. When I was listening to Mercedes, I felt that I was in the presence of a tremendous spiritual and musical force that contained fantastic power. Some of the musical segments of "Amalia's Art" concern, for example, Caetano Veloso, who respect Amalia and sing one of her singing solos in front of a packed concert hall. The musical segments also deliver the incredible international sweep of their musical repertoire and its bonds. fans all over the world. There is one segment in which he claims to have played in every city in Italy where there is a stage! <br /> <br /> In the second part, Amalia talks about her bout. mouth cancer and how he got to suicide at the hotel in NYC. But despite Fred Astaire's film videos, he gradually convinced himself that life was worth living and turned to killing himself. Amazing! Later in the film, he admits quite boldly and directly to the interviewer that although he could have conquered the world musically, his personal life was one of pure sadness. He admits that he has never been happy. It's amazingly sad to hear, but quite well. Fadosse (which he translates into a tradition of "bad destiny" or "bad luck"). Also, someone wants to hear more about their personal life: what was it that made him so sad? What were his frustrations? <br /> <br /> "Amalia's Art" is a bit disappointing in some other key areas. My quibbles: Show 20-30 full-length songs in the movie to give only English translation for the last thing that seems to be waste (if the movie wasn't just for a Portuguese audience I can't imagine). To see deep pain in her face when she sings and doesn't understand, it's lyrics. On other disadvantages: There is almost no biography about the background of the Amalia family. It's one 20 second. fragment w. his song w. his mother (it's totally big). One short reference to his parents who are moving fr. countryside Lisbon. I would have loved seeing the village of the film material from where it came from. Such interviews as they are almost only. Amalia herself (and some close friends). He is a good but not a big subject. There are no interview topics for Fado or Portuguese culture and society experts so we don't know the depth of our musical roots. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, this is a great movie that all Amalians are interested in. look. But it is not a perfect or final job on this issue.
