A group of teenagers decide to take their sleeping party to an abandoned school where a terrible massacre took place 27 years ago. Unfortunately, the person responsible for killing still kills the abandoned school hall and is not satisfied with their presence. <br /> <br /> This movie isn't like the most modern servants we've seen. It is much darker, much more tense, not a sensible splitting killer, etc., and I liked it for these reasons. It's not great for making a movie. Operation is below average. Writing was pretty bad and full of clich√©s that occasionally contained references to American horror movies, some that didn't even make sense (like ..... Have you seen Scream 3?, Asking a girl. I have and had nothing to do walking through old school doors so that it is in no way related to this film). But hey, this is a slip, they are part of the fun. Also, this film is heavily exposed to underuse of characters. There were six main characters (except security guards) and, frankly, only three or four were used. Two characters (a symbolic black man and another girl who was not labeled enough to get a label) hardly talked about: I would have an estimated five or six lines between them. Also, girls (except one) were not well formed to distinguish them from each other. They could have replaced each movie each other each time, and I wouldn't have noticed that difference. Stimulation, however, works well when horror starts right from the start and rarely ceases. The atmosphere is well used and the direction shows some really cool moments. . . although the overall look is a bit cheap because I assume it is a low quality camera equipment (and work). The end, although I liked the idea they were going through, was pretty bad. It seemed rushed and without explanation that it was effective. How much time it took to look around for not looking for something, they could take a little more time to come to a conclusion to make sure he didn't know any random event without good reason (which is a lot of mistakes) for modern horror movies). However, ignoring some unpleasant questions and trying to focus on the first 98% of the movie rather than finish it is actually a pretty good modern slasher that should be checked, especially if you are a fan of Spanish and / or Mandatory Slasher elements: <br /> > - Violence / Gore: There is good blood and gore, realistically made, but not buckets. Violence is very well done, not excessive, but quite brutal at points. <br /> <br /> Sex / Nudity: A little bit and a movie with the hottest girl. <br /> <br /> Cool Killer: Well, security guards are hardly considered "cool", but this guy is pretty bad. His horrible smile cooled. <br /> <br /> Fears / Tensions: The relationship is top-notch. . . very tight, very well done. There are also some extremely terrible moments that blend jumps and a spooky atmosphere. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: None at all, really. <br /> <br /> - Awkward Dance Scene: Of course: Between a couple of men and half an unwanted female return. <br /> <br /> - Cinema Classic Quote: "Another Trophy". <br /> <br /> Final decision: 7/10. It may stretch it, but fans of the 9th session may want to control it just by the same tone and atmosphere. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
