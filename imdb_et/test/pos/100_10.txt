The best short I've ever seen. Some commentators suggest that this may be prolonged due to the density of knowledge offered. There is irony and little merit in this commentary. Acting is all for Noonan and he carries his ungrateful character perfectly. Perhaps I would have preferred the narrator to be less "recognizable", but the borrowed gravity is perfect. It is short for those who read, for those whose "bar" is high and for those who feel that living in a culture that stands for stupidity and banality, can create the opposite and bitter defenders of beauty. Beautiful short film. FWIW: I was delighted by Picasso's reference because I believed Picasso was just another whore of little talent; As I think most people - until the day I saw some of the drawings he did when he was 12. Picasso was a finer opinion maker and a brilliant artist at the age of how many artists will ever live. I immediately realized why he had to proclaim his art.
