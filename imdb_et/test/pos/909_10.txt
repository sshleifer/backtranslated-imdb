Transcendental, Complex, Sharp, Emotional, Powerful ... I can think of 100 adjectives to describe this fantastic art and intelligence work, and I still feel they were inadequate. All I really want to say is that I'm against this movie. Applause for Krzysztof Kieslowski, Zbigniew Preisner, Ir√®ne Jacobile and Jean-Louis Trintignant. Mai "Rouge" lives forever.
