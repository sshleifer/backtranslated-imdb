Screamers is an Italian fantasy film (L'Isola degli Uomini Pesce), which was purchased by Roger Corman and published through his New World Pictures. Of course, Corman must deviate from his initials if he has one of his shortcomings (Dan T. Miller) who manages some additional material before he is released. <br /> <br /> L'Isola degli Uomini Pesce is a very entertaining Dr. Moreau Island. It is 1891 and Claudio Cassinelli is on a mysterious island where there have been few recently convicted offenders. Claudio comes over stars Barbara Bach and Richard Johnson. Johnson plays dirty Edmund Rackham: a man capable of manipulating a scientist Joseph Cotton to transform a local local population into amphibian deep-sea diving creatures (they look like a junction with the Black Lagoon creature and deep) to convince Cotton that mutations have been created with the highest scientific and humanitarian motifs . <br /> <br /> Discovering the lost city of Atlantis, Rackham uses amphibious creatures to loot his treasures. Sexy Barbara Bach plays the daughter of Cotton, who has a psychic connection with these mutations. In one memorable scene, Bach takes a midnight swim with these mutants that have only a thin white cotton dress that leaves little imagination. Claudio discovers that one of the convicts has become friendly and then all the hell is broken. <br /> <br /> Filmed at the same time and in the same place as Zombie 2, Richard Johnson didn't do it even without having to change the dresses between the movies. The house where the tests take place is the same house that Johnson uses to conduct experiments in Zombie 2. Talk about economic film making! <br /> <br /> The extra material contains some bloody sketches (path to Roger!), and ridiculously poor Cameron Mitchell, who is doing his best pirate imitation. All that is missing is a parrot. <br /> <br /> Spanish title: Le Continent Des Hommes Poissons
