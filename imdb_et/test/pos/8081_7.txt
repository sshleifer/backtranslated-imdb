I like the phrase "British post-war suburban paranoia" used by one of the observers. It describes so well such films as John Mills (1947), The Long Man (1952), "Big" Images ("Scott of the Antartic" (1948) and "War and Peace" (1956). > <br /> In this clearly "Eric Ambler" style, John Mills, who played Dr. Howard Latimer, allows his friend Charles to see (not seeing) meet a visiting German actress at Frieda Veldon (Lisa Daniely) airport. Happy "reporter" Jeffrey Windsor ( Lionel Jeffries is in his consultancy room at this time and offers him an elevator, but when he watches the actor, Windsor tells him he's already waiting for the car! (Something bad happens!) Howard is behind his day and doesn't think about it <br /> <br /> The next night he will find his job when he arrives home, moreover, he finds his friend Charles unable to wear him yet in New York and Windsor does not seem to exist. speaks to Mrs Ambler (Rene Ray), referred to by her doctor George Kimber (Mervyn Johns), about her recurring sleep with a dead body and a square base with brass candlestick. This is a nightmare for Howard, but of course, when interviewed by Detective Inspector Dane (Roland Culver), he denies all the conversation knowledge - the candlestick is later found in Howard's Daimler launcher. <br /> <br> Howard is low, visited by Robert Brady (Wilfred Hyde-White). He calls himself a "friend" - he has a photo of Windsor, which he wants to trade with boxes. Frieda gave Howard at the airport. Howard returns to the apartment, Charles rings and when Howard is on the phone, an unknown attacker looks out and steals matches !!! Who can trust - who has nothing to hide !!! <br /> <br /> This is the top thriller - not in the same class as the "October Man", but John Mills does what he does for the best ordinary men who have reached the impossible mysteries !!! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
