My husband got OBWAT DVD for Christmas and it was the best gift! We look at it every time we have to laugh and we have seen it 12 times so far! The landscapes of this movie are beautiful and the music is outstanding! We also bought a soundtrack and we play it in our vehicles and at home when we ever need me to pick it up and every day! If someone needs a recommendation for a good gift for film students, this is the film! The stars are fun, charming and their facial expressions are too funny to describe! Fan of George Clooney, but now I'm a fan of Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar) and John Turturro (Pete) and now I'm looking for them in other movies! You have to see this movie !!!
