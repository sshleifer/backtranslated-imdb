I saw this movie for the first time in a video store and as a fan of Bam Margera, I had to rent it to see what it was all about. Since I have a big and stupid (mark the word stupid) sense of humor, I found this movie completely fun. Some parts are pointless and random, but it makes them so amusing. You have to think that films like watermelon face and watermelon head are funny to evaluate this movie. I was really impressed. <br /> <br /> I was also surprised by the actor. These people did a good job. Something Oscar worth, but well enough to pass the amateur level. Teenagers and young adults are likely to find this entertainment due to modern slang and used situations. I wouldn't recommend looking at it with my parents and vice versa. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was great, the script was fun and the story is really something you can communicate with.
