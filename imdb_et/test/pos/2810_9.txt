T.V. Thriller is surprisingly good. I didn't expect too much of it, but I'm happy to say it's one of the best. It is fast paced and offers a variety of shows and interesting events. <br /> <br /> The story catches you right from the start and with many hits you can't help but find the movie very interesting. <br /> <br /> Thiessen's character background is difficult but it becomes a horror when his wife is a lot worse than his childhood friend's father. <br /> <br /> The "stranger" concept and its actions are disturbing when you think it is a common disease in society. The serial editor does not respect society or even his family, and this film shows the disease and crime perfectly. <br /> <br /> The beef in my movie was a futile situation when a Thiessian character returned to his returning husband when he was released from bail. By that time he knew what he did for his young relative (played by lovely Allyson Hannigan). But this is just a typical Hollywood scene that causes more problems. <br /> <br /> The peak point shows that Thiessen is following his wife when he plans to rape another, so he calls the police who come in time to defeat him. The end tells us that the man was sentenced to 99 years in real life. <br /> <br /> Actress is also pretty good and Tiffany is great and proud as always. The direction is also very good.
