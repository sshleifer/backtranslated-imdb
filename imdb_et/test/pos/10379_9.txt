Don't know why some people complain that this movie is not comedy and at the same time too unreal. Had it been realistic, there would certainly not have been much comedy. I also don't think comedy has to make you twenty times laugh. There was a lot of exquisite humor, sweet feelings, and Kim Frank was just a dreamy character. There are a lot of people in real life whose facial expression does not change so much that Kim Frank is doing his best. The end was quite unrealistic, I would say, but happy. It's a light-hearted film with a feeling-good ending. I liked. In fact, he loved it. A serious part was with Krueger Schwedt, and I'm glad they didn't show what happened to him. He showed how he was, when he came back, hinted at it quite clearly.
