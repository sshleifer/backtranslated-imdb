I always wanted to see this movie and when I finally came, I knew I was a nice surprise when John Boorman's name appeared on the screen. Known mostly for his epic films (he directed the first Conan and now wrote in the apocalypse), which is assembled into the classic Hollywood structure, it fits well with his catalog. <br /> <br /> I can't express how perfect timing meant that Myanmar (Burma) would once again experience monks and student uprising against a military "junta" government, which is the same (leadership has changed, but is essentially same). From now on, this film has more than ever been inspired by recent events on TV (IFC).
