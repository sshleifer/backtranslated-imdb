This beautiful film was very refreshing. The director kept the focus on the main topic without being in the side plots (medical family or other hospital patient stories) that are so typical of Bollywood's assembly products. He kept the narrative easy to understand and made sure that all the actors are true to the characters they should portray. Grandfather's rustic ways in the clinic, the surgeon's cold and unemployed behavior, the enthusiasm of the social worker gave the film a real feeling. I am also pleased that the director did not fall into the temptation to add songs or special effects and reduce it to Anand or Safari. A couple of scenes at the end of the movie, such as a boy who visits other blind children and a blind worker, and also the last scene where the boy lures for splashing sound and stretching the birds will definitely make his eyes blurry. /> <br /> Many Bollywood players do not realize that members of the Oscar Committee appreciate the simplicity of the film and the reality and brevity of the film more than glitz and glamor. Shwaas is definitely a better name than Lagaan, which dealt with a topic that is already dead. No MPAA member is going to suffer in 4 hours of jingoist drama and much of the song and dance. <br /> <br /> I look forward to more film director Sandeep Sawant in the future.
