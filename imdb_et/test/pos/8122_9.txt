I enjoyed this movie tremendously, thanks to sharp scenes (both humorous and ironic, some even "tragic"), plausible performances, funny dialogue and heartfelt transformation that is similar or rather may be heterosexual and / or homosexual and your desires to fulfill the obligations. I am aware of this paradox: homo-n heterosexual .... this is something the film does to the end but never uses a caricature. If you are as open as people seem to have been the ones who made this movie, then ultimately it is not important to you if those who are in each other's arms are of the same sex or not. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Smith" from the matrix gives a marvelous turn as a gay-house-salesman who has a "strange" appetite here, but that's not the only thing to admire. enjoy .....
