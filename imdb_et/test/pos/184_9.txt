I watched this movie on TCM last night, all excited about having seen it (twice) in its memorable 1957 Toronto edition. I told my wife, who hadn't seen it before, to see an exciting long track, without a cut, where Veronika sees her on the bus to find her Boris. In a hand-held frame, which is sure to be before the modern Steadicam, it pulls up the bus from the back and the cranes (involuntarily) and the darts between the tanks to cross the road. Then I remember that without a cut we follow him close to the garden when he looks through his peers, deliberately looking for him, but can't find him. But we will continue to follow Veronika as he looks for the faces of the recruited recruiters and their emotionally talked women, all the extras, and each of the pearls of Stanislavskia. How did Kalatozov and his cameraman Urusevsky wonder about this extraordinary sequence. But what did I see in this version? After crossing the streets away from the tanks, the scene ended sharply and cut back to the scenes in the apartment before the soldiers and their families continued on the fence. It seems to me that this movie was not only restored but also re-edited. What's down!
