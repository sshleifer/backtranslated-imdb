Opera's murders are not as real murders as they are the symbols of past events and Betty's own broken personality. In fact, Betty is the same person (man) whom Suzy Bannion is suspirias, only ten years later in life (Suzy was ten guys who interacted with another ten boys who had a lighter version of their background). br /> <br /> It helps to think of Betty's luxury apartment in the military barracks bay; he spends most of his time in bed in his bedroom next to his stereo, and his other apartments seem somehow strange to him, as if other people are living in these other rooms. <br /> <br /> Dario Argento's movies sync with a lot of Rock music and Funk (Dario starts syncing right at the beginning of his movies, with the flash of the eye in Opera and the start of the drum roll at Suspirias). There are also standard films that Opera (and Suspiria) syncs. For example, Opera syncs with the Judo Priest Record Album, called Priest ... Live (just like Suspiria), and Suspiria syncs very well with Kiss's album called Kiss Alive II. Movies such as Rosemary Baby, Exorcist, The Image, and The Vampire Happening are synonymous with Argento films that deal with the same subject as Argento films. They synchronize with many others that Betty is a man who has been the victim of sexual torture since birth (even after a certain mother according to Anne Rice's novel Lasher). <br /> <br /> Anyway, big budget movies are occult works that transmit secretly collected spy information, all synchronized with symbolic / alchemical.

The memories of sexual torture have been lost to this person through extreme sexual repression, and the vague memories that remain are a large, square, deep hole in the desert, and this memory is of no importance due to the lack of a conscious trauma. trauma loss, "also a" buried property ", is depicted in the 1975 film" Image. "These sausages, located in the attic of Suspiria, are a remembrance of each individual in the first three years of life (toys in the attic). The reason why Betty (or Suzy) is a female character is that the individual mirrors of Christina Marsillach are a man who has been trained as a female role since birth (all Simpsons cartoon synchronization with Suspiria); The X-Files episodes sync with Opera. It has even made your body "beautiful" as a woman is. Behavior changes genetics. Later, "Death Proof" deals with the same ideas and the same person. <br /> <br / > Almost all of this person's life is reflected in large budget films, recorded albums and books from 1966 onwards, and father before 1966. Scorpions album titled Virgin Killer is an album that is suspiria sync, starting the cover of the album that acts as a symbolic mirror image of the fall of the skylight.
