Several views have been made for me to fully appreciate this movie. At first I was struck with stylized kits, but I found that the rest of the time was slow and boring. I thought that such a sensational subject needed treatment by Ken Russell to take it over the top. I now find that Mishima's widow's execution is an asset. Some of the bolder aspects of Mishima's life are repeated and dramatized on the topics of his novels. I think it helps to get to know the novels - that's what finally changed for me. I still feel that the film may be a bit tougher and warmer, but it is truly unique and deserves serious attention. Love the fact that Japanese characters speak Japanese - not English. Philip Glass's score is mesmerizing.
