It was one of the first color films I saw in the cinema as a child. This is good to remember. Girl Liz Taylor, who later became a beautiful woman, played with a small and great actor Mickey Rooney. The content of the film plot is good for all ages, good wills and behavior. The good ethics of Velvet's parents, especially his mother, are something to be considered. Our generations should be well educated and this film can help this goal. Velvet loves these horses and competes with them and Mi Taylor (Rooney) brought him to an international horse racing competition in England, where he won a young velvet, but was disqualified for being a woman.
