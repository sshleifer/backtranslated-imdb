I turned my attention and enjoyed the very generous expression of Julianne Nicholson. I have no words to describe how much I'm fascinated. All actors and actors played well. I noticed, in particular, that a solid good character is consistent in predicting the future - Andy Richter, who played Carli. I think the idea of ​​showing different friends and relatives with different opinions and several consultation meetings is like in the real world. Jay Mohr, who played Ed, the future spouse, also played very real behavior. But I want to emphasize once again the very rich repertoire of expressions that Julianne Nicholson is capable of doing naturally for me was enormous. In fact, the subject that this film deals with seems to me to be very important and concerns the meaningful thoughts of many people. I've seen this movie many times and are not boring. It rises again and again in my mind.
