"Hollywood Cavalry" is a lightly fun 1939 movie with two clips from the 20th century Fox list, Don Ameche and Alice Faye, which contain a couple of jokes. <br /> <br /> The film is about Max Sennett's type, Michael Connors (Ameche), who brings Hollywood actress Molly Adair (Faye) and makes her a great silent comedienne, eventually making her more dramatic. He gets his star extremely successful with him. She is totally shocked by her job obsessed with running and marrying her and her leading man (Alan Curtis). He's so shocked that he digs it. She and her husband are leaving and are still becoming more popular, while Connors Studio is losing money at an alarming rate. Before you know it, he's out. Molly wants to help and asks Connors to guide her next movie. <br /> <br /> There are many Keystone Kop types of pictures that are pretty funny, and some fantastic hits from Buster Keaton, who's wonderful. The film also features "The Jazz Singer" when the speakers take over. The joke is, of course, associated with Rin Tin-Tin, to whom Zanuck wrote. In one scene, Rinny coaches her as a potential contractor for Connor's studio. Connors throws both out of his office. Some of the scene later, Rin-Tin-Tin has shown that this is the # 1 box. The role of the famous German Shepherd in this film is played by Jr. Rin Tin-Tin, the father of Jean Harlow died in 1932, one month ago on his 14th birthday. Fortune smiled at him even at the end. <br /> <br /> Alice Faye is very beautiful and does a good job, as does Ameche, who turns energetically. Mr Edward Bromberg and Mr Stuart Erwin offer very good support. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie is not sure what it is - history, comedy, romance or drama. "Hollywood Cavalry," however, is quite observable.
