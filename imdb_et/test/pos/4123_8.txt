This early rock and roll-star Buddy Holly (1936-1959) biography is the training force of Gary Busey. The highlight of the film is Busey's productions, where he plays the guitar and sings Holly's songs. He brings this kind of energy to performances that Holly's own filmed performances are almost inferior. Busey's infectious toothy grin lights up on the screen, creating an incredible and winning personality, and his Oscar nominee for the best actor was well-deserved. <br /> <br /> The film follows Holly's career from growth in Lubbock, Texas stardom and New York and his premature death during an air strike. One of the things I found interesting, when it was true, was Buddy's ambition - he had a big plan to go over to recording and performance. As young as he was already a scary businessman and definitely wanted things to a higher level. We never know whether it would ultimately be a business sign of its early success, such as the Rolling Stones. <br /> <br /> The words of many Holly songs are quite adolescent; read "Peggy Sue" or "Oh Boy!" and you see what I mean. Perhaps it largely explains his popularity among adolescents, but his instrumental and performances certainly show his influence on groups - both the Rolling Stones and The Beatles have recognized his importance. <br /> <br /> It is clear that some freedoms were taken for the dramatic effect. For example, I doubt Holly ever pulled out of the Nashville producer or that the audience in New York's Apollo Theater was so quick to dance in the aisles. If you are interested in getting closer to the truth, see the documentary "The Real Buddy Holly Story" (1985), produced and managed by very relaxed and engaging Paul McCartney. It includes interviews with Holly's family, friends and bands (Holly's musical brothers have not even been mentioned in The Buddy Holly Story). Members of other bands, such as Keith Richards and Don Everly, also offer opinions and stories, and there are shots of old Holly performances. McCartney's production can be independent, but it makes a great companion to "The Buddy Holly Story" and maybe it should be seen by anyone looking at a fictional story.
