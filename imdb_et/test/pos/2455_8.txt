This film has a very profound look at the relationship between a mother grown in a Christian environment and a look that has everything. He and his son, who just came back from Vietnam, are colliding with very tense issues. The relationship does not have a close connection and it is a very precise description of what it is like to live with someone who is wrong and only looks at the surface of the questions. Kathy Bates does a great job of portraying the women of the wrong faith who are their cruelty, unforgettable or just do not want to face it. Jeremy's anger never fears and it causes him and his feelings to be a very disturbing conflict with his father's love. This is a very honest look at some family dynamics after a traumatic event leading to one despair.
