A great movie that includes Anthony Wong, which is definitely its title. An erotic but increasingly violent way when dreams are bought crazy from an occultist, who quickly become somewhat nightmares when a witch enters them to manipulate the poor Mr Wong. Well-filmed and very fast moving is a story of serious magic, herbal medicine, power and corruption, but it also takes some fine sexual scenes and very bloody violence. Now again, there is little sense of humor to watch you again and the whole thing makes 90 minutes the most enjoyable. Great performance everywhere.
