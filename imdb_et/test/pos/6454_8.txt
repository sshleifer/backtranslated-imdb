I saw this movie last night at the "pre-code" film festival and I have to tell you that when Gary Cooper turned his head closer to the introductory, the whole audience declared. She was just so beautiful. <br /> <br /> Cooper looks aside, this film shows the art of Rouben's Mamoulian director. Wonderful scenes disappear, creative camera corners, symbolic hints - Mamoulian simply explores the director's environment and renewal. <br /> <br /> It was Sylvia Sidney's first role in Hollywood, after her success in New York, and she is as beautiful as Gary Cooper's leading lady. It's nice to see her in a harder role than many of her - so often she sees she's afraid someone will hit her. <br /> <br /> There are many familiar faces in the film, including the wonderful Wynne Gibson. The most prominent is Guy Kibbee, the best known for playing fatuous rich men as a ridiculous and sloppy man. <br /> <br /> These pre-code movies are not nearly available on VHS or DVD, so if you can't find a precedent near the festival, try Turner Classic Movies! As for the reviewer, who believes that Gary Cooper was too stupid to consider the dialogue more complicated than "Yep" or "Nope", he should consider Coop's action in films such as "Mr Deeds Goes to Town" or "Meet John Doe". Although heaven knows someone who saw that good should not be smart.
