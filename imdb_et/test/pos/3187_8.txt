I'm trying to find a copy of DVD / VHS from "Isn't it shocking?" I was 7 years old when I saw this movie and I lived in the city where it was filmed. A couple of elements from my family were used as props in the movie and a couple of scenes were used by a couple of my friend's homes. Filming took place in and around the city. I've only seen the movie initially and I would like to get a copy so I can now show my family a movie. I've done extensive online searches, without luck, and I was wondering if anyone would have any ideas for a copy of this movie?
