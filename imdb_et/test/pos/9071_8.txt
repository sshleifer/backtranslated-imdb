A very short-sighted, surprisingly intelligent film about five medical students who relax themselves and then revive to share their experiences of death and beyond. Joel Schumacher manages some skills, creating very shameful scenes and particularly beautiful scenes. The vision of death is not what viewers could expect, nor what awaits us all - thanks to the scriptwriter Peter Filard, who really did that story. Although the creativity of the story is impressive, there are many holes, especially in the logic department and credibility. Despite the fact that Flatliners is a good effective film, which is sometimes very surreal, and an actor that brings together four very talented actors and William Baldwin together. This core of participants is acting and reacting very well to each other. Keifer Sutherland, as the leader of the group, does a very impressive job - one who has to die with the idea and be born again. He also manages to portray a man - a young man - with a harmful, destructive secret from his past. Kevin Bacon is the most pragmatic and skeptical of the group. Oliver Platt is really good as the voice of mind and human fears. Platt has some very good lines and plays paranoia well. Yes, Julia Roberts is here and very good. Actors do best when they play each other and make us believe they are so good friends. I had a lot of impressions of Flatliners, but more than anything affected me the most. The scene where the dog cave around the street, but one of those powerful images that had emerged, like many "rebound" scenes.
