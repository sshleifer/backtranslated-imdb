I saw it in the 80s and never forgot it, even though I've never seen it before. <br /> <br /> I don't know if I see it now, it seems dated, but remembering the story and comparing it to some terrible contemporary movies I've seen in Zone Horror. it would be very good. <br /> <br /> I still remember that his coffin slides out and opens, and all the corpses have changed and a blue flash. Having seen hundreds of horror films and remembering it, it must be good.
