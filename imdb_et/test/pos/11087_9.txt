this movement was intriguing and absorbing; but this story was somewhat difficult and sometimes difficult. While the two main players did a great job, Senn Penn saw his being for every fiber and stole every frame of this very memorable movie. Later, the films have shown that he is not just one role, but also comic flair Sweet and Lowdown. Surprisingly talented and not easy, what I thought he was.
