After Sarah's waters looked at Tipping the Velvet, I decided to look at Fingersmith, the characters were so good in both performances, although there was no Rachael Stirling in Fingersmith's custom. <br /> <br /> The story was generally a good choice, and the twists and turns of the characters were amazing! Great at only Rachael Stirling! <br /> <br /> If you have two girls to enjoy romance, this is not one of the best movies to watch. <br /> <br /> It takes Tipping The Velvet with a different spin, but just as good. <br /> <br /> Recommend it to everyone!
