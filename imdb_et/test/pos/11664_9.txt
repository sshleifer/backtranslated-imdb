"Dead Man Walking" is one of the most powerful films I've ever seen. I find it hard to believe that someone can feel indifferent to a movie or its message after seeing the film. Tim Robbins does not try to put his ideas and beliefs to the viewers, but is able to make a film that is usually sympathetic to both views of the death penalty - is it a murder or not. I have always known where I stand on this issue, even as a child, and this film - despite the fact that it does not actually take anything - made me even more convinced that it could never be a murderer * someone *. <br /> <br /> Sean Penn is absolutely brilliant in depicting Matthew Poncelet; Even if Nicolas Cage did a great job of "Leaving Las Vegas", I would have been happier if Penn had won. Susan Sarandon is also brilliant and she deserves the Academy Award. And Tim Robbins definitely deserves this movie: 9/10!
