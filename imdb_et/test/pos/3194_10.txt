I'm the new conversion you say. I downloaded a DVD from my local library. I've been to the samurai after watching the last samurai. My father said he looked at Shintaro when he was a child. He said it was pretty good. We're up to the 3rd series. I love it absolutely. It takes some time to practice Japanese speaking English, but I really enjoy the same thing. It is a bit strange to look at small breaks when ninja stars are thrown into characters and remain in a tree or wall. I wasn't used to it, but I'm now. But I think it has been a technology in the 1960s. I've noticed that Shintaro is friendly, friendly, ready to help those who need it, he is very humble, in most cases he is not a big comment (he just says he's better than an enemy ninja). I admire Shintarot for these qualities. It's really interesting to see how Koichi Ose is a sword fight. It's amazing. This series is for anyone who is against the samurai.
