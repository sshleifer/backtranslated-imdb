What do you think of the actor's son, not the actor. You're not going to become an actor just because your father is a superstar - it doesn't work, not in the UK, somehow. <br /> <br /> Macbeth (this version) is a small budget for Scotland Movie. You can't compare it with the Polanski version, because Polanski has a worldwide budget. <br /> <br /> Jason was active in the whole school, but his great fracture was in 1985 when he grounded Robin Hood's role in the UK's "Robini Sherwood" TV series. Since then he has appeared in many films, including "Shanghai Noon" and "Rings Lord 2". Since then, Jason has moved behind the camera to form the production company Unconditional Entertainment. Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ray Winstone. <br /> <br /> And this is not related to Sean Connery's son. If you think Jason said to Sean, "Dad, I want to be a Macbeth in the movie they're going to film," and Sean said, "Certainly, son, whatever you say," and called and got the role of your son, you're wrong. In fact, Jason Connery has been cut off by his father's will. Seeing how his father is Sean Connery, this is a huge change that Jason is losing. The reason for this decision is probably Sea's strong feelings that his only son should learn to take care of himself. Jason even threatens to change his name. <br /> <br /> --------------------- --------------- Being the son of Sean Connery, < br /> <br /> "I understand that I am always comparable to my father. It is always an innovation. Should I justify my whole life?" --------------- --------------------- <br /> <br /> So stop the jackass and blame him for not acting just because he is Sean Connery son (big deal!). <br /> <br /> Look at Jason at the Bullet in Beijing and take a different view on your ability to act.
