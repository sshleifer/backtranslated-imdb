PREVIOUSLY IS A DOCUMENT FILM. ----- There was so much to consider when watching this movie. It was a great documentary about the trial of 15-year-old black boy Brenton Butler. He accused the white tourist of killing Florida. This shows how the police took the testimony of the wife of the deceased wife about the description of the woman who killed her wife. The man seemed to want to change things to join what the police said was that the young man was wearing. Police little to investigate a crime. Patrick McGuinness, a Brenton lawyer, is thorough to help his client. He talks to the viewers what he thinks and the strategy he uses in the police to show his inadequate investigation and beating against his young client to testify. The camera goes to McGuinness where Brenton was interviewed. McGuinness also takes space to monitor pictures and sound. He asks the policeman on the billboard and asks what Brenton has heard from one investigator and argues about their own words. McGuinness examines with Ann Finnell every place where the police should have gone, and the things they should have done, but not. The film shows Butler as a loving Christian family who believes in his son's innocence and belief that God will put Brenton free. They visit him in prison and pray with him to encourage him. For Brenton, attorneys, judge, and all those involved in this case, the group's prayer scenes are. I'm white and I was surprised that the black high-ranking police black people treat other black people. It was very disappointing to see that the black-and-white police were busy when they thought they had their husband. The police have a hard job and I believe most of them are honorable, which they don't like in this movie. I think this is a great movie for everyone in the judiciary, including judges, police and lawyers, and even potential lawyers to watch and learn from this movie.
