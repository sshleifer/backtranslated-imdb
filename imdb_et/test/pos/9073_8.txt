Flatliners left a noticeable impression on my head. The story is fast paced and leaves you constantly absorbed and on many occasions quite tense. About five prominent doctor doctors (especially Julia Roberts and Kevin Bacon), one of whom has developed a mechanism to stay dead (or lined up) for a few seconds and then back to life. The procedure is quite complicated, including numerous medical knick-knacks injections, electrical shocks, oxygen masks, and various esoteric medical terms. I suspect that doctors will create all these words that they should never be released. But they follow KISS (original version of the engineers: Keep It Simple, stupid) (extended version for doctors: keep it stupid, easy) philosophy. If there is a risk that some retrieving medical readers can euthanize, let me continue. He hopes that it will respond (and become famous) through applied science. She slides for about two minutes and then goes back to our world, which was quite shaken. At the time of his death, he has a vision of an incident when he was a young man who left the strongest impression of his life. He killed another boy when he was a child, and he still feels responsible. <br /> <br /> To achieve first flat success, others will follow suit for anyone who extends their flat line forward and further to test how long it can be dead and to experience life after death. <br /> <br /> At the same time, monsters from the past and the future will come back to haunt them after their apartment experience. The first plane worships a young boy who tortures him alone. The other, who in the camera all the women she slept with, sees the TV playing all her video. The third one is haunted by a young girl she was teasing at school. The fourth haunted his deceased father, for whom he is responsible. The main focus on flat lining is that all your life goes through your eyes, "dying", no matter what the stage, and you mostly missed the strongest impressions of life. Because they didn't die, these strong impressions have somehow been restored and become the center of their lives. <br /> <br /> All of them have somehow agreed (and deleted) their earlier demons. All but the first, who understands that the only way he can move forward in life is with a solid liner. During this flat session, he sees himself flat lined for the first time and also sees the boy he killed trying to kill him this time. This time the boy kills him for a few minutes and has been looking for revenge. For a few minutes in the movie, you will wonder if he can come back. Fortunately (as most of us like happy endings), the boy releases his past and comes back to life.
