This is an all-inclusive great movie. A mobile experience that is full of real life emotions. Here you have to learn about love, gender, work, religion and American culture, regardless of their sexual preference. <br /> <br /> Although this film is also a scary accusation of the system of Mormon (the latter-day saints) faith, any conservative belief can easily take its place. But it is a bit ironic that homosexuality is currently condemned by the Mormons. Here is the faith devoted to generations that believers practice polygamy! And these true believers abandoned this practice simply because the federal government was forced to join Utah. Talk about a unique form of hypocrisy! <br /> <br /> The sex scenes depicted in the unrated version are delicious and surprisingly short. There is nothing here offensive to open minds. <br /> <br /> What this movie does is that homosexuality is completely natural for those who are gay because heterosexuality is for people who are straight! Although love and sex are obviously different needs, its absolutely beautiful, outside words, when both occur at the same time between two adults! Deep erotic love is one of the most valuable gifts in life! Congratulations to the filmmakers for the good work done!
