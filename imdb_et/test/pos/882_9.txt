Jewel Thief is a rare movie - a complete story for your story, but nothing for presentation. The young man, Vinay, who was perfectly played by the newly-born Dev Anand at the age of 40, is alienated from his police officer and finds a job in a jewelery shop. Soon, random people will come to him and call him Amar. Using just a few moments, "doppelganger" has been created. She then arrives at Shalin (Vyjayantimala) and states that she is involved with the doppelganger. He is accompanied by his loving brother (Ashok Kumar), who is so convinced that Vinay is actually Amar, who makes his shoe off and proves that he is not Aamr, the six supports. Jewelry artist's super cute daughter Anju (Tanuja) is totally in love with Vinay. In the midst of this confusion, there is an open Jewel thief and he steals his will. We are slowly learning about Vinay's meeting with a super hot nightclub singer (Helen!) That thief is an amar who is a doppelganger. Many beautiful women (Anju Mahendru, Faryal) are after the hero. The police force, including Vinay's father, has completely caught up. Vinay slowly falls on Shalin / Shalu and his brother seems to bless the union. The action moves to Sikkim because it is the place where Amari's next throw takes place. The rest is for you to see - duplicates, girls, men who hang Vinay for every word, thought he was their boss Amar, a loving brother sister duo - nothing seems quite right, and it takes a printed story (and Vijay Anand's direction), to make this story very fun. There are many moments in the film that you don't know until they taste in the finishing touches to the Sikkim Palace Dance. <br /> <br /> I was not a big Vyjayanthi fan, but he is here perfectly competent, although his chubbiest. He can confuse the story, but it is best if he is sad or dancing. Tanuja is funny and I loved her in this movie. I wanted him to get this man. Dev was fine, Dev. If he did not like a man with congenital abdominal injury (one shoulder always lower than the other), I would like to ask who imitated him! Yet his style, charm and charisma were. Singing Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara, only Dev could look for a cool fish with a large plastic fish attached! Ashok Kumar was just fantastic - Dada Moni didn't attack the whole movie and turned it into a single history book. <br /> <br /> SD Burman spun magic with numbers like Baithe Hain Kya Uske Paas (Helen's blood red cock imitation dances on the bar), Aasman Ke Neeche, Rula Ke Gaya Sapna Mera and my personal favorite seductive number Rael Akeli Hai Bujh Gaye Diye. <br /> <br /> More twists than pretzel who want to be guessed, but entertained and entertained - then buy or rent a Jewel Thief. Better to buy it, you can go back and watch your friends again. It's a keeper.
