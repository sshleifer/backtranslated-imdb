This movie is one of the cinema's history. It was not made for a modern audience, so some people today think it is outrageous or dirty. I found it absorbed all the time. Cherkassov has exactly the right presence for Alexander Nevsky as he did several years later when Ivan Grozny (Ivan The Terrible) played. The music was beautiful. <br /> <br /> My one complaint was a bad sound that was quite distorted. Although I only know a small Russian language, it would have been nice to be able to choose more words than 100% of subtitles. I watched this library with an old video tape. Maybe there is now a DVD version with enhanced sound. I would like to know if the actors used Arabic Russian or even the Slavic of an old church. The subtitles were strangely worded and I find it difficult to say whether it reflects the parent's way of talking or whether the subtitles were just somewhat poorly made.
