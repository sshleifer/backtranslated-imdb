The ruthless mercenary Bruno Rivera (Paul Naschy in top-notch form) puts his pregnant partner / girlfriend Meiko (well played by Eiko Nagashima) to get exclusive stockings of stolen diamonds. But Meiko can seriously wound Bruno before he gets. Bruno runs up with a kindly wealthy doctor, Don Simon (with a fine performance by Lautaro Murua). He also draws attention to Simon's two hottie daughters: the fiery Monica (luscious Silvia Aguiler) and the sweet Aliciale (nice by the Arabic Azucena Hernandez). But Bruno will soon realize that there is something very wrong in the isolated place and plans to escape as soon as possible. At the same time, the bitter Meiko tries to find Bruno so that he can accurately specify his revenge. Naschy, who wrote and directed both letters and letters, sees one of his strangest, most complicated and perverse horror vehicles that this little one has seen strange. As the story evolves, uncomfortable plots and a mysterious atmosphere become strange and nervous, eventually leading to a truly amazing surprise. This film also benefits from graphical goreic moments (be a memorable queue where one poor guy is alive by poor pigs eating pigs!), Alejandro Ulloa's slippery cinematography and decent nudity and soft heart sex. Roxana Dupre's good moves, such as the dirty servant Raquel, Pepe Ruiz, as in love with the playboy Don Seraf and Julia Saly, as Teresa. A pleasantly gloomy and valuable shock.
