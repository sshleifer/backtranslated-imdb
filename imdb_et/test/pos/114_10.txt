I admire Deepa Mehta and this film is a masterpiece. I recommend buying this movie on DVD because it is a movie you might want to watch more than once. And trust me, you still find little meaningful details after you look at it several times. <br /> <br /> Characters, except maybe Grandma, are all very balanced, black and white. Although you follow the story from the point of view of the two main characters, there is empathy with other symbols. <br /> <br /> I think the rating of IMDb is too low - probably due to its politically controversial content.
