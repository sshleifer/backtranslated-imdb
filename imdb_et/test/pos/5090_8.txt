Quiet historical drama based on Anne Boleyn, a newly arrived woman waiting for a king who is trying Henry VIII's passionate eye, a bad tempered king of England who loves holy, drink, hunt, meet his court in Jester, watch runners and follow the circle after the young ornaments, who jump out of the cakes and choose attractive women around the castle. Well, he has soon canceled his marriage, married to Anne, and tells him that his holy duty is to produce a male heir. He will fail at this point and will soon see another one waiting. Meanwhile, Anne spends the entire movie looking for hesitation, distraction, or even tears. He just can't get to a happy camper (or is it just a bad act?!). <br /> <br /> This movie is a definite entertainment that has an absorbing story that keeps my interest for two hours - I liked to see a very proud medieval costume that was here in the fancy sepia-toned print. Emil Jannings is quite striking and memorable in her eighth king Henry imagination - she really seemed to be Henry's eighth. I'm not so sure that the actress who plays Anne in the performance seemed a little up. The DVD on this movie has a nice, nicely made piano point that is perfect for this story. A pretty good movie.
