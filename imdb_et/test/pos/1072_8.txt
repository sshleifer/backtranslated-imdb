Our reviewer, Toronto, told you what is known about this movie (except that it needs editing - handheld technology really gets old, really fast). I saw this movie last night in Menerbes, France. We are in the Luberon Valley, covered with vineyards and, of course, wine producers. They were all there at Salle de Polyvalente to show off. Although my French hesitated, I got the content of the movie, but I noticed that the audience loved the interviewed "old" producers of terrorists. one communist village in Languedoc. He laughed a lot. It is ridiculous in France. There is no doubt about what part of the war of terror globalization is! SM
