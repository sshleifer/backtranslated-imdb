Hey I think this movie was great and it was great graphics and I was so happy that they used the ultimate fantasy 7 I think the game was the best I ever played, this is a great movie and I loved it. they should use the ultimate fantasy 7 on the ether again or the fantasy of the final fantasy 10: Tyler Sheena hope you can send me back if you have any details if there is one more. It is animated, but it looks quite realistic and its awesome fighting scenes that I have not seen in the movie for long-lasting struggle. The game of the ultimate fantasy 7 is also really great for not good graphics, but its truly fun and challenging
