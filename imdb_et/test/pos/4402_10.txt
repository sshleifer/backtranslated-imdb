Not a fan of Coen Brothers or George Clooney, anyone can see skepticism in the theater. Once again, someone in Hollywood dares to create something else. This time, these were zanie (due to the temporary lack of a better word) Coens, who makes "his thing" one of the great works of literary history. Who would have ever thought it was Homer? I don't know where this movie fits in Hollywood history books, but it's in both me and many other DVD or VHS libraries. This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again. The story is perfectly written. Clean and entertaining, with a pair of Gumpesque Brush Celebrity, great Clooney, Turturro, Nelson performances and a short but fun Holly Hunter. Born in Mississippi and raised elsewhere in the south, I would like more people to kill us. They even use the southern soundtrack of rural areas. You won't do anything better this weekend, watch this movie! <br /> <br />
