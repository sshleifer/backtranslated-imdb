Anne Frank's diary is the most widely sold literary book in the world and for good reason. Nonetheless, I was thinking of this documentary about my life, which carries some details where the diary was left out, I thought, "Just another documentary about Anne Frank." I found it to be competent, but not extraordinary. It was my dissatisfied attitude because I was already well aware of Anne Frank's story; most of what the documentary told me was not news to me. <br /> <br /> But everything changed when I received the documentary until the end --- when I saw Anne's movie clip Frank. The emotional impact of seeing this material, which only took place for another or so long, did everything in front of it, a thousand times more real - but not just everything that was in the documentary; all that I had previously learned about Anne Frank became more real, personal, to me. I was always moving my story, but when I saw this material, I felt that it was stronger and deeper and deeper than any other film experience in my life. (I knew in advance that this documentary contained Anne Frank's real-time film footage, and I even saw the film on television, but it was a completely different experience when watching the documentary. Here it breaks it.) <br /> <br /> I understand now that many people still don't know the story of Anne Frank; it is an obstacle from time to time to witness such ignorance as a witness. I think you yourself: "How can I NOT get Anne Frank's story?" In this case, ANNE FRANK: REMEMBERED together with reading your diary is the best place to start. This is a story everyone should know.
