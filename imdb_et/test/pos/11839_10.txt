Can he find satisfaction with his new role at BACHELOR FATHER? This 1931 film, in which he gives a powerful result, marked the arrival of MGM of older Sir C. Aubrey Smith. one of Hollywood's most valuable characters. Sir Aubrey watched every thousand parts of the Duke or General or a statesman who he played so often with a large hook at the corner of the nose and beetle. The British community's renowned leader in Hollywood, Sir Aubrey, also won the Cryquet game in Southern California. He remained very demanding in the entire city studio until his death in 1948. <br /> <br /> The ultimate star in the movie is Marion Davies. The best was remembered today as a preacher of media man William Randolph Hearst and the most famous residence at Hearst Castle at the most famous castle, he was really a very talented and beautiful comedienne. For some years Hearst tried to make her a queen of MGM (with her own manufacturing company and a large bangalo dressing room), but there were already several kings in the studio - Dressler, Garbo, Shearer, Crawford - and she finally moved to Warner Bros. Miss Missies gets fun and clown and her scenes with Sir Aubrey are entertaining. <br /> <br /> His love of interest is played by Ralph Forbes, a beautiful young British actor who started looking for the cool movies (THE TRAIL OF ?? 98) when the quiet days ended. He had all the main characteristics of stardom, but unfortunately it wasn't. Celebrity came to Ray Milland, making one of her first screens to appear here. Halliwell Hobbes and Doris Lloyd also seem to be useful.
