Best British comedy movie ever! Over the years, English comedy television programs have become films and they have floped: "Have you earned?" "Fathers Army," the list goes on. But the popular dark humorous BBC TV show; The gentleman has not only been able to create a movie that hasn't been able to flop, but has also managed to be the best British comedy movie ever! With its dark and terrible twists in the Gentlemen's Apocalypse League, British Talent is the best! His intriguing demonic story, written by a gentleman (Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith and Jeremy Dyson), fits with Gents (and the guests) with an excellent example! I hope that this is not the end of Royston Vasey, not after the great success! Don't think that if you haven't seen the gentlemen's order, you don't understand what's going on. It's all well explained and at the end of the movie you are happy with the result, but you're still hungry for more ... Mmmm, Special Stuff.
