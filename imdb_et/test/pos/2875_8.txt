Well, I'm a few days late, but what the fuck ...! Anyway, the word that best describes my reaction "Look not evil" was .... SURPRISE. The film is really pretty good. There's definitely a lot of blood, gore & action in the movie that has a modest amount. It hears back in the late 70s and early 80s. Think "Madman" corresponds to Leatherface's Norman Bates dash and you get a good feeling for this flick. Although SNE is thin (most horror films) for stains, he does it with methods of violence / killing, gore, arrest, and the fact that Kane is doing a great job of disturbing Jacob Goodnight. The title of the movie stems from the fact that Jacob simply sucks the eyes of his victims with his fingers and holds them in large jars. Why ?? You just have to look at it and see it (pun intended). Of the other horror films, there are the most cinematographic elements, especially Psycho, TCM, & Madman, but they are not bold. Finally, SNE does not really go to our territory, where we have never seen before and what has got, SNE is not "Pyscho" or "TCM 74", but it is definitely an imo. <br /> <br /> BloodStone Recommendation: Take a Bloodstone rating from Matin√©e's "Look No Evil": 7.5 / 10
