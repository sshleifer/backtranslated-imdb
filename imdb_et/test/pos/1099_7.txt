That was a nice movie. It was an interesting story that was done quite well in the later part of the film. The story reminded me of God's city. But it is done in a more beautiful way. That was what I really loved: the tones of surrealism. Some pretty interesting cinematic works (through a wooden camera) I am not sure if it is culturally correct, but definitely expanding to South Africa. The actors were good (for the first timers, most of them anyway), I especially liked Estelle's character, which made this movie very enjoyable. However, it is interesting that it makes you ask about your life. Do you really do what you really love? Or do you agree with the norm, the conventionality around you. Definitely worth a look.
