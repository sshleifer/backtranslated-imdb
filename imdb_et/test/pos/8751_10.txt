Includes spoilers that I had previously saved when it was on PBS but could never watch it (probably due to having to sit 5-6 hours for Masterpiece Theater, BBC TV style ( not music, all the settings in one room, the look of a flat-screen TV ...)) But after watching the movie's traffic (what I thought was pretty good at that time), I couldn't dig the Tray-tape to see what they might otherwise have lived after 2 2/2 hours. <br /> <br /> Boy, my preconditions for this TV series were wrong. It is so much more than traffic. The characters are better for their actions to be more plausible. And the whole Pakistan-related sub-block complements everyone's views throughout the supply chain, from the farmer to the end user. In traffic, the Pakistani story was rewritten and reduced to a good police officer and a poor police officer. <br /> <br /> Alcohol and other forms of medication were considered a much more meaningful discussion and discussion, while in traffic they mostly changed references that were irrelevant. The same social issues that were transmitted at Traffik were declared realistically as famous sermons. If in the traffic, these stars emerged in the form of an extract, as they did in the films of the weekly edition of television. <br /> <br /> There was no bad guy vs. a good man. Trafficking, even a reseller, is depicted as a junkie who sells his habit to support instead of "moving with me" on the road with a type of traffic. <br /> <br /> The only part is that since I did not monitor the traffic much before this viewing, it was difficult not to compare the scene by scene, and although the scenes were not the same, I knew what the result was already. Thanks to God for a Pakistani story that is different enough to allow me to think about it completely and think about what scene it compares. Though I was thrown out, I thought the drugs were melted into ceramics in the form that Helen brought back to Germany (as in the traffic line.) Thanks to God Traffik, it wasn't hokey and far drawn.
