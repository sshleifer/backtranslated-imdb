The Chi-hwa-seong (Painted Fire) describes the life of Korean painter Jang Seong-ubi in the changing political landscape of Korea since the late 19th century. <br /> <br /> However, this movie center's themes are artistic creation through the desire of the artist and the expectations and demands of the audience and society. <br /> <br /> Jang Seong-ubi is masterfully played as a complicated character, who becomes a hardened alcoholic tortured soul of the young innocent excitement. This characterization reflects a young avid artist who finds it increasingly difficult to rely on the spirit of artistic creation in its own right, without the creative fire coming through the drink, the erection and the desire. <br /> <br /> While this development of symbols continues, the emotional complexity of Jangi is gradually being played through the film in an ever-rolling manner in the finals. Interestingly, movie editing is equivalent to its ever-changing and seemingly wild emotion or the artist's fire, as scenes change smoothly from one time and place to another without the usual "clues" to the audience to make such a scene change. For example, many scenes would seem to be in the middle of a conversation in the middle of the second place and place. <br /> <br /> The visual styles of the movie are presented beautifully and they also vibrate from black and white landscapes. Colorful and lively environments that are parallel to Jangi's paintings with plain black ink on white paper or paint. Colors enter the film at points where the artist observes nature and especially women who are then reflected in their paintings. <br /> <br /> The artist's individual desire to create a theme and society's expectations and demands arises through a variety of points, including class distinction, government domination of the artist, accepted standards of the artistic elite, and the basic aspirations of common masses. Instead of creating his own original works, Jang finds himself mostly in masterpieces of other East Asian artists. So the question arises whether the holiday deserves artistic value. <br /> <br /> I would like to be more familiar with the political events of the period in order to understand vigorously how they linked the story, but which is not comparable to the present time. The role of the GOK in artistic expression and / or censorship I cannot comment. <br /> <br /> In general, film and filmmaking have worked very well, often breathtakingly. A great movie to see and think about.
