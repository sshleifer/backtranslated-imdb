I got this movie from eBay mainly because I'm gay and I love Til Schweiger. But this is one of those films that, when you look at it for the second time, you never say to yourself: "Oops. I forgot about this boring part. I make a popcorn." He doesn't have that part. This is a very liquid and constantly interesting film. And yes, Til Schweiger is worth it if nothing else. But it's a great movie for even straight guys.
