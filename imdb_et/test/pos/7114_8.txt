This is another Universal fun full of fear fest.Many people want to compare it to House Of Frankenstein.Even though it is similar to the cast and the same director can stand on its own. (It seems that Erle C Kenton directed most of the Universal 40's horror movies). <br /> <br /> Land Recall: Baron Latos will appear at Dr. Eidleman's home to look for his "vampirism" to "cure". Larry Talbot (who somehow lived in the Frankenstein House) on the door of good doctors looking for their misery. After an unsuccessful suicide attempt, Talbot and the doctor found a Frankenstein monster. In order to make things more difficult before biting dust, Dracula infects your blood with your doctor. Your doctor will become a bloody manic at certain times. <br /> <br /> Carradine really gives you very good performance than Dracula. He does not chew the landscape as he does in later roles. It's hard to repel when he appears in the top hat. The captain / carpet is traditional, but the hat has to go. Where's the hat going into the bat ...? <br /> <br /> Onslow Stevens provides an excellent overview of your doctor. He has ruptured his basic kindness and the rising blood disease he has now inclined. This is a very underrated performance. Chaney lives with Wolf Man in the fourth appearance in this role. <br /> <br /> Monster won't be given much time to do this. finally (using some Ghost Of Frankenstein movies). At least in House of Frankenstein, he was up and around a bit. <br /> <br /> Yes, it stays in the basic universal pattern, full of anger in the village mob running amok with flashlights. But it's not a bad way to spend an hour and ten minutes.
