Tom Fontana and Levinson are relatively somewhat enthusiastic about creating and editing TV channels. Ozit was terribly treated. In this country, the finale went well 3 in the morning, before it was strictly considered an alternative view for those who were not familiar with prime time waste. <br /> <br /> For the first time I got to Oz until the end of the first series and since then it was impossible to watch. My man Adebisi may be the most scary villain, Beacher is the perfect anti-hero, Eammon Walker Saeed, acting class. Of course, there were tough things - some common evils, but in essence Ozil was a soul. Augustus talks about the developing plot with Insight pearls, while the struggles of Beacher, Mcmanus, Saeed, Rebedahl, etc. are better than before or after. Compassion Violence Wisdom Tragedy Intelligence Pain Pleasure Brutal Love and Hero Oz Passed the Spectrum of Human Emotions - All Inside Max in Prison! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say these Thursday nights with a big Vids to follow Oz's 2/3 of the way back in 99 years were the best TV I ever see. Beacher Attacks Vernit In The Gym There is a moment when I don't need a video - a small screen that I never forget. <br /> <br /> Imagine what Oz would have done in the same way as the Sopranos 10-hour time block and all the ads? Good thing that I am now over, for those who have been caught, are considered to be privileged for those who are not television ... ... and you deserve it.
