I've seen so many bad comments about Supervivientes de los Andes that I felt compelled to resist it (or at least try). First, of course, that it seems dated, it was made in the 1970s with a very low budget, but it is part of its charm. I like modern movies, but also appeal old films for what they're worth. I don't see this desire or see movies with modern treatments and effects; besides this, almost every film-like film of the film buffer (who does not like El Santo's movie or 9th space, regardless of its overall quality) likes it. In terms of speed, it is only a tool that covers (again) low costs and I think that continuous dialogues are in the order of better character and situations. Of course, Alive has a better FX, but I do not despise it for the very reason, and I do not know quite attractive English-speaking people for Uruguay and for me, which gives the Supervivientes de los Andes a plus. It's like even if Canoa, since the 1970s and in a real event, would be better off due to the advancement of technology, but I think I would stick to it, based on the emotions that are offered regardless of the date of production. for the first time I saw it on television and today I don't think it has lost some of its main force. Of course it has been a long time and I've seen tons of better movies in every movie, but it doesn't diminish its true value. This is not a bad film and I will not hesitate over Alive. Just skip it.
