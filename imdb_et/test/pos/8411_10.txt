I've always loved the wind "and I've seen it many times." But its end did not leave me not only "hanging", but also depressed, hopeless. Finally, Ripley "Scarlett" took us to the very credible and satisfying end of the original story (the "start"). <br /> <br /> It follows that one of Scarlett's obvious intelligence (as originally written) would eventually grow up. Although, like most people, I fell in love with GWTW at Scarlett, I was tired of his constant intimate infantileism with anxiety, and I was disappointed that Mitchell didn't show Scarlett that obvious intelligence to even emotionally grow. Fortunately, someone finally did. (After all, it is not a nervous immaturity, which contradicts his beauty and intelligence precisely why Rhett finally gave up?) I think Ripley did a great job of describing this long-running process, and Whalley-Kilmer did a great job of portraying it . Joanne WK has all the fire, greatness, and intelligent sparks like Vivian Leigh, and she's certainly at least the same, if not more, beautiful. <br /> <br /> There was, is and always is only one Clark Gable. But if I had to choose from the thousands of actors I represent my biography, it would definitely be Timothy Dalton. Dalton has the same elegant charm that Gable did, which is important for Rhett's character. I can't imagine someone else who could come close. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, both Joanne Whalley-Kilmer and Timothy Dalton were perfectly cast and the only actors who could play Scarlett and Rhett. I think both of their performances were fair not only to the late actors, but also to the spirit of their characters. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the whole cast. Julie Harris was his usual pleasant presence and Jean Smart was a divine kick! Even Ashley's character was nicely played by Stephen Collins and his relationship with Scarlett was completely plausible. <br /> <br /> The story changed a little bit in Ireland, but so is life and I'm still finding it fun. <br /> <br /> All in all, I enjoyed the fruits of Ripley's imagination. I wish I would write it! <br /> <br />
