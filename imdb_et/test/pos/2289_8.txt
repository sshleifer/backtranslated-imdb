Many believe this film is a baseball film. Such people are disappointed because it is about a baseball player, but the film is not baseball. <br /> <br /> Some think this movie is a romantic comedy and is disappointed because the relationship is not really developed. This movie is not a romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> This film is about culture. The American American Major Leaguer and the traditional Japanese baseball manager cannot succeed because they can't really understand each other. After they succeed in passing the cultural barrier they succeed. The player in the team mentality and board will become more of a Japanese individual in allowing individual achievements and they will meet in the middle. <br /> <br /> Baseball and Romance are subject to criticism from two cultures. Many who do not understand the Japanese way of thinking leave it behind and think it is a baseball or romance film and sees a clash of culture as a mild comedy. It's not --- the clash of culture is the gravity of the film. Based on my experience and understanding of Japanese culture, I think this film worked well, that it did not romanticize and exaggerate Japanese culture in its imagination. <br /> <br /> In general, I believe it's a pleasant and relaxing film to understand what it really is.
