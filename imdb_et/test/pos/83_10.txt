Channel zapping one night I just hit this movie and it hooked me from the start. It tells a sad story about an adopted child, Adam, whose mother left after birth. The film takes us through our childhood and makes us very worried about Adam's past. I will not reveal more, but it is a very comprehensive film and it will definitely put you on. That was one of Jimmy Smith's best roles in my opinion.
