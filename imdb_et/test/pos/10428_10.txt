I'm a big fan of this movie and I found the TV mini series "Children of The Dust", version fans should look for. The DVD version of this movie will be cut at least 20 minutes or more. <br /> <br /> I also recommend viewers who enjoyed this movie, review the book, have more rounded lines with Corby / Whitewolf and Rachel, more black history and Buffalo remnants. There were two lines to the series or movie: <br /> <br /> Sidney Poitier only shows that she has got better with age, talent just grows, and there was a wonderful look between chemistry between her character Gypsy Smith and Regina Taylor. I also liked the Billy Wirth / Joanna Going storyline, which seems to be playing well. <br /> <br /> Billy Wirth is of course the "Indian Vision Model". The look, the attitude, the dream of every woman who wanted to be one of these novels by the local hero. I also worked for me. <br /> <br /> This story could have done much more, but it gave the viewer a brief glimpse of racial problems in the 1880s, taking over white local training, the lack of a black pioneer in the western cities. Michael Moriarty (Maxwell), as always a great actor, is a very caring and confusing teacher, not sure if "white" should interfere with local culture. <br /> <br /> For all who enjoy the characters and watch them change this movie for you. I thought Poitier's character and the Whitewolf chemistry of the orphans were moving very well and thought that Wirth and Poitier worked very well together. While working with Poitier, Billy Wirth did some of his best scenes. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I went to my nerves if you just wanted to stop or shake her or give her an "alarm and adult" call. In general, it was a great entertainment night. <br /> <br /> Look at the two versions of this mini-series if you are a fan of what you really see.
