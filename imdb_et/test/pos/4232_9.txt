I'm from Germany, please excuse your writing style. As I've seen Chucky 4 for the first time, I was a little surprised, I knew Chucky as a normal 80's, but Chucky's bride was very old. First of all, there is a very good work by director Ronny Yu, whom we still remember in the Ghost Ghost. His visual style is comparable to Francis Ford Coppola. Also, the voice of Chucky Tiff is very impressive. I also liked the scenario, especially the scene where Tiff casts the Champaignbottle ceiling. <br /> <br /> I give it 9.0 votes for funny, gory and progressive entertainment. If you have comments on my opinion, please send me an email. MFG Schawez
