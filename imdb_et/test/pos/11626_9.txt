Sigrid Thornton (SeaChange) was apparently born to play the role of Cato Philadelphia Gordon, a story that is often compared to Margaret Mitchell's American Civil War classic Gone with the Wind. Waters (Heaven Tonight) is undoubtedly his best role for his love and two leading wonderful Australian casts, arguably the most well-known and loved Australian minicomputers. It is a great production in the whole circle, though do not try to catch it all, and it is worth remembering that it is a great image of life in the Federation's pre-federation. Rating: 8/10
