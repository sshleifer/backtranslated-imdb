This is my favorite movie ever! <br /> <br /> I remember when I was younger and since then I've been in love with it. I rented it so often from one of the video shops that used to wear it, and when we moved, I couldn't find where I went back so far to see the movie again! Finally I found it for sale and bought it and watched it over and over again .... great movie! <br /> <br /> Since then, my first DVD I got after getting a DVD player ... Well, I got them at the same time, the quality of the DVD is better than I couldn't believe it! You have to see it!
