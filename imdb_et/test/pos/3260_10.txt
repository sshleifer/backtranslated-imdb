Several years ago I saw this movie (perhaps on television?) And loved it. So I decided to rent this DVD for the second day to see if it was still in my estimation. It did. <br /> <br /> Sydney's notorious king's cross in the district (where prostitution, drug abuse, and sex shops flourish) speaks of the story "Jimmy" (played by Heath Ledger). Jimmy is a young man ... maybe late teenagers or loved ones who haven't had a stable family background. She is at the edge of society and works as a sex club "toutina" (encourages people to enter the store). He is aware of the sub-world called "Pando", a local great cross at the cross. It is Jimmy's hope that he will find himself on Pando radar and get in with him ... with a short cut upward on social mobility, he hopes. One night, Jimmy meets the beautiful young Alex (played by charming Rose Byrne). You just know that there is a love story between them. Even this evening, Jimmy first turns to Pando (played by Bryan Brown). Pandol is "work" for Jimmy. This is the door Jimmy is waiting for! <br /> <br /> In the event of too much exposure, it would spoil the many surprises that this movie saves for the viewer. Stylishly, if you like Quentin Tarantino or Guy Ritchie movies, you should be consistent with what to expect ... twists and black comedy. <br /> <br /> What this movie is so big about is Australia - "It is not just Tarantino or Ritchie, but a true Australian contribution to the genre. <br /> <br /> The exciting aspect of this movie is Sometimes it is the characters who you do not know what the hell they are doing in. Finally, all these "loose ends" are beautifully linked together - it's like a celluloid Moebius strip. <br /> > The highlight of the film is the character of Bryan Brown Pando.Pando loves puzzles and it is nice to see that he is playing with his games. This is a little information about what is so pleasing ... his music taste, starters! <br /> > Heath Ledger's films I've seen (Dark Knight, 10 things I hate for you), this is perhaps his best role, not taken with "10 things." If you are a Heath Ledger fan (Ledger recently died of a tragic , accidental death), this is the chance to see him in his biggest role in Australia. Byrne is a great chemistry, so on one level it works like a nice love story. <br /> <br /> This movie contains no fear of Tarantino and Ritchie's underworld films. but it has some adult themes ... scenes that will surprise you for their cold and beauty. In this sense, it is not an ideal movie for very young viewers, but it is not a film for which gore-hounds are also excited. Finally, I have to say that it is good that Australia can make such great movies. Films in my home country can usually be creative. This film has strong features where many Australian films have weaknesses ... st. it has a great story, a great actor and a great script. Here in Australia we need the most popular and high quality films. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. Other Australian films I loved are: <br /> <br /> Breaker Morant (10/10) Mad Max 2 (10/10) My Brilliant Career (not yet viewed by me) Proof (nr) Devil's Playground (No) My Voice of the Year Broke (No) Bad Boy Bubby (No. Great Dark Comedy) Dishes (No. Great, charming comedy)
