It's interesting, it's hard to find a movie from the early 1970s, where Jan Michael Vincent is a young man who doesn't do it at sea. Dressed in "baby blue" gear to bring them home, unsuccessful recruits are sent to the pack. Vincent stops at the bar and enters a very young Richard Gere, who has just returned from a Pacific tour as the "Raider" marine environment. Gere's character is already tired and pondering about desertification, and he exploits Vincent's innocence, stealing his "baby blue" uniform from his drunk and beating him on the street. Vincent's character, Marion, takes Gere's clothes and suddenly becomes Marine's Raider. Marion pulls her way to Wyoming and stops in a small town like Norman Rockwell. In a local caf√©, she meets Rose Hudkins, who is catching her eye. Staying at Hudkins' parents, Marion attracts all attention from the cities. Hudkins suspects that Marion and how the "Raider" on the sea could be so innocent. The story also highlights Japanese camps, as cities go hunting for 3 refugees. During this hunt, Marion hitting randomly. But there's still a happy ending that got me a little bit. I would have preferred a little more drama! Anyway, it hits the top of the JMV's 70's shows. BUSTER AND BILLIE, BABY BLUE MARINE and WHITE LINE FEVER In the mid-70s were amazingly good JMV performances. At the same time, he was a star of activities as well as a heartbeat! He made many high-quality films during his career, and continued to do so with Airwolf, an excellent TV show in the mid-1980s. He does a great job in this "Hedge", quietly observing how people treat him (in his uniform) when he travels across the country. He must have done some stunt work - at the end of the movie there is a harrowing river scene - and it seems he is the man who throws me under the river! But really, at the height of his popularity, this film would have done so much more with JMV's talent and appearance. The innocence can only be so interesting. The evil, as studied by "Buster and Billie", is much more dramatic! Anyway, Glynnis O'Connor is as happy as Rose. The whole look of the movie is like Norman Rockwell's land. Outdoor scenes are proud to be filmed in Canada.
