Not sure how I stumbled on this film, but I'm so glad I did. At first we were stripped of the fact that it was with subtitles, but even my dyslexic brother, who hates to read (especially at the weekend), enjoyed this movie. I found that the script was fantastic and the way it was put dead was only added to the pee pairs on my couch. It is not quite sure if this is a really funny Danish language, because comedy seems to be subtitled and the translation is not clear. I haven't watched a lot of Danish movies (or any of that), but judging from this movie, I think they are not limited by the same political correctness as the rest of the gang (gawd blessing), which makes Eigel's character's breath fresh, because let's be honest that special needs are funny. There are so many great liners in this movie that shake American sitcoms.
