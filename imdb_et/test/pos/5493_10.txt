FOR THE FUTURE, I think it is an excellent, relaxed and action-oriented action / drama / thriller! I thought the agent Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) and Agent Raines (Rene Russo) felt joyful in the presidential evening. Like Leary (John Malkovich), he was a sick man who loved playing with Frank. However, he seemed to be at the end of the movie with a nearby tuxedo. One of the things that surprised me was the growing attraction of Agent Horrigan and Agent Raines. Before I sealed it up, I would like to say that the whole cast and the team did a great job, I loved this device and I didn't get enough of it. Finally, for all Clint Eastwood fans who haven't seen this great, fine and your seat / drama / thriller, I highly recommend it.
