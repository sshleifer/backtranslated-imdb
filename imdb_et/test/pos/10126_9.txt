It's a movie you love or hate. I love it. If you are looking for temporary, great special effects, action, complexity, cynicism, etc., this movie will not find it. It's a good movie, sentimental, positive, exaggerating. The heroes of the film are Coach Jones (played by Ed Harris), a man of strength and honesty, and a Radio (Cuban Gooding, Jr) man with intellectual disabilities who finds the opportunity to contribute to their world. I think I didn't find this movie as "sentimental hogwash" as so many did because it seemed to me very real. I know people like them. I've seen jocks who think that vulnerable people have fun to choose from. I've seen honest men standing for vulnerable people. I've seen people who think high school football is a serious business. I've seen people who know what's really important in life. None of these people could have been the people I knew. I laughed; I cried. I missed the movie, remembering there are people in my world like Coach Jones and Radio. If you don't have those nice people inside, you may not like the movie. If you don't like a movie that shows the better of human nature, you hate it.
