The last American Virgin (1982) was one of the few teen comedies I really enjoyed. Theme and action was much higher than normal what Hollywood (and still is) these days. But for a while, smaller studios made films about teenagers who had not softened or softened their tones. The men behind this production were Cannonist friends. <br /> <br /> Three teenage buddies are trying to lose their innocence in high school. They do something or something to achieve the goal of their dreams. A sensitive group (Andrew Monsoon) that is the right girl to find when her two best friends take everything they can. One day a child finds his perfect girl (Diane Franklin). But fate plays one of their unpleasant tricks. His best friend moves in and wipes out of his feet. After tapping her, the sensitive boy helps her get back to her feet and pays for her abortion. She still has feelings about her and tries to win her heart. In the meantime, his best friend is falling into a very violent way to get her dream girls. However, he is trying his best to love him. The night comes when he asks him a question. But his heart breaks when he sees his dance with his former best friend. In tears the boy leaves the party. <br /> <br /> What I enjoyed about this movie was that he didn't pull the strokes. Instead of being filled with unsuccessful situations, it was very realistic, honest and cruel. The film is full of funny moments and hysteria. I have to recommend this movie to fans of teen comedies. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
