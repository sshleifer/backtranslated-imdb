I've seen it only once - in 1986 at the "artistic" theater in Minneapolis ... but I remember it as I saw it a thousand times in the morning. Funny ("Sawing for Teenagers", playing Scrabble with all "e" tiles), beautifully animated (removing eyes, shaking their back, then putting them back) and poignant (the end of the world, scam) for the necessary human race. Calling this just a comic is like calling a big GATSBY.
