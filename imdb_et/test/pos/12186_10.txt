I remember this movie the first time I saw it, but it has grown for me. I love costumes and creates actors, humor, cinematography, soundtrack. Scenes are very rich and moving very fast. Every time I watch it, there is something new that stands out in my eyes. Aaliyah as Akasha is probably the only thing that destroys it, but not enough. <br /> <br /> This Lestat movie is also different, it's not the same. You can see that the character Armand has been given similar qualities to Lestat because I assume that Anne wanted it in. But there's no reason to throw this movie in the trash because it's not like books, it's exciting.
