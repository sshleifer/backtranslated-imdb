I understand how Barney might be annoying for some, but the hate he gets is very ridiculous. Barney was just made from the beginning and simplicity is not bad, especially for the young people he attracts. Personally, I find this exhibition very underestimated. Barney & Friends, in my opinion, is a very educational exhibition and even 17 years after this debut (and nearly 21 years after the character's debut in the home video) he proves again and again that he still likes small children. Maybe less than in the early 90's when Barney was Hannah Montana at that time, but she's still classic. Like Barney's fan, I feel I should protect him in a way that doesn't seem like spam. How purple boy teaches things can be very simplified and unrealistic, but should you rather hear them about war? Be grateful to some (costume dinosaur, but still) to let the kids comfortably and have children. In that day and age, I feel like we are rushing our children to grow up and Barney says you're still a child of heart. In addition, many of Barney's lessons about current episodes of plagiarism, being honest and yes ... even death, turn to everyone, not just his target audience. Moreover, our children must learn to be kind and respect others for who they are, and he will help them do that. In short, Barney may be annoying for some people and I fully understand why, but I cut him somewhat. All of her and her friends (along with HIT Entertainment, her manufacturing company) are trying to help children not only learn the necessary skills, but also have fun and look at the positive aspects of life. If more people listened to their children's favorite character and look through their eyes, then we would not be so negative about him and even his life.
