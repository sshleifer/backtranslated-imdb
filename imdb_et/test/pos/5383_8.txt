Bravestarr was released in 1987 by the American animation company Film behind He-mani: Universe Masters and She-Ra: Power Princess of Power, 1983 and 87, respectively. The drawing of the multimedia was about an Indian cowboy named Marshall Bravestarr, who has the strength of the bear, the wolf's ears, the speed and chewing gum and his trusted sidekick, the talking horse named Thirty-Thirty, who carried the weapon called "Sarah Jane" and Deputy Fuzzi and Judge JB to protect New Texas from evil Tex Hex and his bands. <br /> <br /> Futuristic Texas, it was and still is one of today, one of the few cartoons placed in a certain city in the US, so in the southern thousands of years of light. Considering this was done in the 80s, the creators did an impressive job of trying to restore the western look of nature, but the Sci-Fi-based perspective. Bravestarr did not just raise morals and good verses and taught children lessons of life, but also highlighted the issues of culture and community and that we should not take things and life for granted. And despite the fact that it was an action adventure competition, many of the stories, themes, and issues that it discusses resonate with children and adults in a way that makes sense for them. In addition, Marshall Bravestarr was one of the first (ethnic) minority backgrounds to influence television. <br /> <br /> The sound effects were amazing, the music was great, the theme song was just as memorable and the animation was great. The characters were well designed and the stories were diverse and taught the children the moral and importance that was right and wrong. Something that cannot be said about today's cartoons is, unfortunately, unfortunate. <br /> <br /> Although Bravestarri overshadowed He-mani's success, it is still a favorite of many 80's cartoon fanatics. Suffice it to say that I preferred Bravestarr He-me over the story lines, the variety of characters, and that the depth of the situations and problems the characters had encountered were rather realistic and contrasting. For some reason, they resonated more with people because, like "The Pledge", where a child dies of drug overdose, it was important that there was no happy ending - in the sense that the children are watching this episode. the devastating consequences of drug use and that no one should underestimate the dangers of drugs. <br /> <br /> The brave, brave and sometimes thoughtful, bravestarr is definitely brave, brave and thoughtful. Classical classic classic for years, he dared to take risks, but eventually it was well and really paid off. Many cartoon fans remember this as one of the most interesting and best 80's cartoons ever and correctly. <br /> <br /> 8 and 10 out of 10
