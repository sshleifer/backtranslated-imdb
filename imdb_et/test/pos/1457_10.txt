(Mild Spoilers) Frankie Machine was a bad hand in life. At the card dealer's illegal gambling in his Chicago district, he was interrupted when the police attacked the community and imprisoned him for six months. <br /> <br /> Although Frankie was treated for her heroin addiction in a prison hospital and learned how to play drums as part of her rehabilitation program. Frankie is now trying to get out of prison and back in her old neighborhood to unite her life by getting a union card for the music association and then working as a drummer in the band and putting her old life behind her, but rather she's back with Frankie "In Golden Hand" at all time. <br/> <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger is a 1955 Horror Dependency film with Frank Sinatra that gave his life like a drug-dependent card with a sharp Frankie Machine, a golden-scarred man. Frankie tries to escape the life she was leading, but she has this monkey or better yet, on the back of a gorilla that just doesn't let her. Warm performances with supportive pain, starting with Frankie's friend Sparrow, Arnold Stang. The Sparrows are trying to get Frankie back on his feet, because for him, the clothing that puts him and Frankie in the slammer, and almost back in the jail, until his former boss at Schwiefka, saved him. <br /> <br /> There is Frankie's psychologically and emotionally exhausted woman, Zosch, Eleanor Parker, who sees her detention with Frankie sliding and slowly getting crazy and suicide. There's Frankie's drug dealer Louie with Darren McGavin in one of her first role-playing players, who is just fine with Frankie when she's addicted and Louie goes on her way to make sure. <br /> <br /> There is a joint owner of gambling that Frankie is working on as it is the top card dealer Schwiefka, Robert Strauss, who likes Louie, who is on his way to getting Frankie back to work, even though he is arrested again for Frankie's hopes new and better life fall away. And then Frankie's neighbor and friend is Molly, Kim Novak, who is almost impossible to get into her addiction. It is that he goes to "cold turkey" and almost gets to die, trying to capture the habit of one of the most harrowing sequences ever put on the film. <br /> <br /> No unrestrained movie, with all the participants taking "Man with Golden Shoulder" into one of the most realistic classic films from the 1950s.
