This documentary was my first introduction to Peak Oil theory. An exciting concept that has many frightening consequences if it proves right. I had no idea that the consequences of oil depletion would come so quickly that literally my breath took away. This film obviously opens the eyes on how strongly American lifestyle depends on "cheap oil" - a term used throughout the film. Many topics are common healthy thoughts and they do not go deep into any of them. But you probably never put all the pieces together like this movie. Interviews with authors and energy experts are all very interesting. I don't think this movie is meant to scare people. It is only meant to inform people about what to expect in the coming years, and maybe encourage you to think about tilting 100 meters of work and leaving lights all day. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I could no longer look at cars and buses in the same way. A great documentary, everyone should see it.
