Love and war took place on the other side of the Iron Curtain and looked very enthusiastically, love was as strong as in the West and war was often more enjoyable (if I should say more realistically?). <br /> <br /> This movie is as much as war and love when it comes to the melting of the K-era Soviets. It also reminds us that the best war films were not necessarily made in the 1990s with hemoglobin rivers and millions of US dollars spent on special effects and market participants. <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic of Soviet cinema and one of the greatest human tragedies: war. <br /> <br />
