For some perverse reason most known, the IMDb tables are reluctant to look at the big Billy Wilder as a credit card writer in at least two (this and Ninotchka) of their classics when a buff can detect Wilder's hand at work. As it happened, for the first time he represented Charles Brackett (who gets credit) and it was a great start. One commentator has noted how satisfied these types of movies are with old-fashioned cinemas and I could no longer agree. Paris is one of the smallest Revival houses in one or more of the constant Lubitsch retrospective, and I am pleased to announce that it played a very grateful audience throughout the age, although I doubt if any of them was actually alive when it first appeared in 1938. The famous Wilder schtick, who is cute, is especially delicious here as a millionaire, but careful Cooper tries to buy half a set of pajamas at the Riviera department store and meets with sales resistance until Claudette Colbert turns up and agrees to buy another. The gag has been milked even more after the store's chain of command has been exhausted, and the driver will call the owner who is in bed and expose it to the top of the pajamas. The film is full of outstanding words that are balanced with a verbal spirit that makes it almost perfect. Claudette Colbert is just terrible and gets strong support from Edward Everett Horton as an impoverished father. In the fourth bill, David Nivenil is a funny "business" like Franklin Pangborn and if Gary Cooper is not lacking in his role, because he does verbal dexterity and sophisticated individuals that Wilder's scripts demanded well at this stage of his career. You don't have everything and what you do is perfect.
