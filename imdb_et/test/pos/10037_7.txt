This movie is entertaining, but it is not historically reliable. If you are looking for a movie and think of yourself "Oh, I want to know more about Custer's life and his last stand", don't rent "They died with your boots". But if you want to watch a movie with older western movies, a little romance and just a good story, this is a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the first day of Custer (Errol Flynn) at West Point. Everyone loves his charming personality, which allows him to get the most out of it. The film follows its career from West Point and his many battles, including his battle in the civil war. The movie ends with his last stand at Little Big Horn. Between the battle scenes he finds love and marriage with Libby (Olivia De Havilland). <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn is arrogant but shouts well to George Armstrong Custer. Olivia De Havilland plays the lovely, sweet Libbit very well, especially in the flirting that Custer and Libby meet for the first time. Their chemistry on the screen made you believe in their romance. In general, the impressive factor, especially the comedian role played by Callie (although stereotypical), was played by Hattie McDaniel. His character will definitely laugh. <br /> <br /> Heroic war music highlighted the excitement of battle scenes. Beautiful costumes set the tone of the era. Sometimes the script was dirty even though the movie was still enjoyable to watch. The director's depiction of Custer was a hero and history shows that it is controversial. Some are watching this movie and see Custer as a hero. Others watch this movie and learn to hate him. <br /> <br /> I'll give her this 1942 Western movie.
