In a world where it is possible to list indisputable and misunderstood topics indefinitely, this powerful film of 1995 takes the top of this list; moreover, it does this in an objective and realistic manner, with sensitivity and sensitivity, which makes it a truly excellent film from someone's point of view. And to add some irony to it, even the subject of this film has been misunderstood because it has been misunderstood that it is a movie about the pros and cons of the death penalty; this is not. At the heart of Tim Robbins' "dead man walking" is a topic that is probably the most misunderstood and justified, because it can be the hardest thing a person really has to do - and really - understand. And this is what this film really means: forgiveness. True forgiveness; does not apologize for the evil crime or the perpetrator of the act - does not say that what happened is okay, but find the strength to go ahead and do it by choosing life. <br /> <br /> Director / Screenwriter Tim Robbins is the sister of Helen Prejean who compiled and gave the novel a loyal adaptation to discuss his involvement with the deaths of prisoners whom he has earned his faith in God over the years. As crowned in the film, his life-long pursuit began not only for the sake of justice but also of human dignity, beginning with a simple letter from a Louisiana prison prisoner in the state of Louisiana. Sentenced to death for attacks and murders, Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn) condemned anyone who listened to his letter to her sister Prejean (Susan Sarandon) who soon found her territory where she had no knowledge or experience. And Robbins has succeeded in briefly taking his sister Prejean's emotional and turbulent journey, keeping it without any slander sentimentality, which makes it not only real, credible, and credible, but also makes it an exciting and thoroughly emotional experience for the audience. Through the cinema media that was once a personal, important emotional experience for Sister Prejean, she becomes one of those who see this movie. <br /> <br /> For her soul-like, angry nurse, Prejean, Susan Sarandon won the Best Actress Oscar. Sensitive and emotionally deep, his performance is incredibly touching and real, especially as his sister Prejean bears the natural weakness and vulnerability he has diligently hardened with the strength he had to continue on behalf of Poncelet. (and actually it is five years since its beginning). Regardless of your views on the issues studied in this film, Sister Prejean is undoubtedly a person of heroic proportions, which Sarandon is uniquely personalizing here; and it does so without the use of excessive melodramatics, but rather by keeping it real, by subjectively and humbly examining the human race of man in a highly credible character. This is an extraordinary result, which is undoubtedly Sarandon's best career. Sean Penn, who has been nominated as the best actor for depicting his Poncelet, has also achieved career opportunities (he lost to Nicolas Cage, who won Leaving Las Vegas in his performance). Penn is an ideal part in every sense, just never been better before or after. He actually represents Poncelet as a real person, not as a monster capable of committing the crimes described here. Not that it makes Poncelet less despicable; just the opposite. It really makes it confusing that someone who looks like a man who could live next to you would be able to do such things. And this is Penn's performance strength - it's so annoyingly real, with depth and nuance; you have only your eyes to find the shortcomings of a soul in difficulty. Amazing performance and - as good as Cage was in "Vegas - Penn should have taken that Oscar. <br /> <br /> In another stand-out performance, Raymond J. Barry is memorable. supporting role like Earl Delacroix, father of one of the victims of Poncelet. With limited screen time, however, he develops his character so that you can feel empathy with him and his mother Prejean, because it is through him that gives us an overview of how difficult and seemingly insecure his position is. , at least on the surface. Barry presents Delacroix in a way that provides the necessary balance and perspective story that is ultimately extremely effective and helps to emphasize the film's message. Clyde Percy), Celia Weston (Mary Beth Percy), Lois Smith (Mother of Helen), Scott Wilson (Chaplin Farley), Roberta Maxwell (Lucille Poncelet) , Margo Martindale (sister Colleen) and Jack Black (Craig Poncelet). It is doubtful that this film will change one's mind in one way or another, but it was never a goal; it was meant to be a thought-provoking, emotionally engaging film that's exactly what Robbins has achieved with "Dead Man Walking." Regardless of your personal point of view, this film has an effect and hopefully opens up ideas for the true nature of forgiveness. Because, as we see through Earl Delacroix's character, true forgiveness is not something that he simply decides to do, but is a task that can become a lifetime work. And it's probably one of the hardest things to do effectively in life; and you come out of this movie, recognizing those people like Sister Prejean, who are committed to life for the needy and filmmakers, such as Robbins and Sarandon, to bring him to life for millions of people who would never have known him. I appreciate this one 10/10. <br /> <br />
