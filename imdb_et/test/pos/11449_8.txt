A large number of unpleasant and extremely unpleasant teenagers go to the horrible, distant, lost old corpse near the cemetery, to participate in anything - going out for a Halloween party, hosted by the embarrassed occult obsessed mate, Mimi Kinkade, and her empty boyfriend bimbette friend Linnea Quigley. Loutish, profane, beer-guzzling, sex-happy dipstick dimwits keep accusing jokes (a very bad idea, because demolished old diving has naturally said that demonic spirits worship). Of course, this bad unwanted s√©ance awakens those who are decisively evil and hostile to the evil spirit, who kill and hold most of the children, making them ugly, despicable, scoured, boiled, murderous, deaf, who traditionally destroy a very long, dark and tormenting evening of pure fear. . <br /> <br /> Yep, it's essentially your next energetic graphic and uneven wall-to-wall cheap shocking "Evil Dead" that is full, closed, not easy to escape with claustrophobic single self-finite configurations, terribly excessive spraying pieces , incessantly pounding hum'n'shiver synthesizer score. - Face Manic Care Cushion (expected longitudinal speed-generating hyperactive camera work, smooth, smooth tracking shots, camera-angled corners, even camera dolly, which makes a graceful sliding 180 degree drawing eight). Luckily, Kevin S. Tenney keeps the slippery, firm and stylish trend fast with the extreme and derived procedure. moreover, Tenny gives the film an attractive polished look and effectively creates a pleasantly energetic and enthusiastically grotesque horror-boogie carnival atmosphere. <br /> <br /> But Steve Johnson's marvelous and imaginative make-up effect is the real star of the show. The bleeding highlights include the disgusting fat dragon Hal Havins (who played the same irritating obesity ** holes in the immortal "Babesis Slimeball Bowl-A-Ram" at about the same time) whose tongue bite, Quigley's entire whole lipstick tube with his chest (yow!) and the fall of the bachelor's eyes, while he loves him (double Yow!), the libidinous teenage couple who goes aside, doing exactly what you think in the church (the chick with his neck when the dude is cut off), Kinkade put his own hands on fire and one of the most disgusting scenes in the movie, the average old man has a slit in his throat after eating an apple part sewn with razor blades. Similarly, the trashy'n'thrashy rock score also smokes. And then Kinkade is an incredibly wild, sexy and unimpeded demon dance, a sparkling number, accompanied by flashing strobe light and amazing jumps that Kinkade himself choreographed. Okay, so this general does not mean anything more than a totally useless and pointless, though quite nicely installed and nicely vulgar tricky buggy terrible, but if you're in the mood for an entertaining brain-dead lower fears it will cheerfully crass and juvenile dross will do the trick just fine.
