I really enjoyed this movie thoroughly. For one, it did not have the extraordinary effect that big budget films have. Action was decent in this respect, only you can say that this bat is duplicated, but if you get over it, and that you can't change languages ​​in the DVD version, it's cool. The plot line was very unique, you are taking a situation that is very common in the world, especially in Frankfurt, which I have visited many times, and you take garbage that often happens in that country and you have a recipe for disaster. I loved how the hordes of rats went everywhere and how the idea that when you brought the garbage is the last thing you want to do, take it up, the rats don't get what they want, they are essentially the next garbage, So you are asking well if the dumps are on a strike that pits garbage, private entrepreneurs, any army wants to quarantine from the city. , then throw a mayor who wants to keep the budget on the cover, and align his pockets, you have a realistic movie and a female manager is also happy to look at the screen, a very decent movie I thought I wanted more like this, another small nitpick is Frankfurt's image, what could have been done a little better but for the average viewer who has never been to Frankfurt ... i was born in germany and i was in Frankfurt many times .. it won t question but everything is great.
