Roy Thinnes and Joan Hackett are great in this 1970's melodrama. Lush settings, haunting music, and plot twists make it a really interesting movie. I had seen it when it first came out of TV. Once again, when I had a VCR, it was once more, but I had no way to do it. Does it like VHS if someone has a copy. In addition to the (which has worked beautifully) I feel the story is unique and it is quite true to the book MRS. MAITLAND QUESTION by Margaret Lynn. I would say that this was one of the biggest neglected films of the 1970s that were made on television. I've given number 10 to the film because it's made so much originality. There is a real sin and a romantic air that has a spectator sympathetic to the culprit.
