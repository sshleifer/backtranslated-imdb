A terrible little movie that marks Mary Astor as a getter working as a hard-working paper company, but if the owner has to sell for health reasons, she'll have a scheme for employees to buy a business jerk (Robert Ames) as "before", though she is the brain. <br /> <br /> Of course he will be a great success and he will become his executive secretary, basically everything and teaching him in class. She loves relaxation, but she never stops when she fools with a fool. He is being pursued by a married but separated man, Ricardo Cortez, who is not free. But when society reaches Ames, everything goes to hell. <br /> <br /> Astor is just as great as a too smart woman who almost loses a big mistake after losing her husband. Ames is good as a jerk (but what does she see?) And Cortez is good but there is not much to do. Kitty Kelly is good when sidekick, Dolores. Charles Sellon is the original owner, Cather Dale Owen is a child of society, and Edna Murphy is funny as Daisy. <br /> <br /> Looks good.
