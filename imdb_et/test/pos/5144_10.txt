what a refreshing change in PG movies with teenage girls jumping into and out of bed, young high school boys counting how many girls they can "grab", kids drink, drugs, etc etc etc. Hiaasen has written so many books that are pleasant but hardly classic literature. but he has finally written something that high school kids want to read. And this movie sends a message to the children that maybe they can make a difference, maybe they will hear their voices. The landscape shot in South Florida is beautiful and natural and REAL. Who cares if it is predictable and small. That was FREE OR see how well it happened. It's a good family film .......... rare breed.
