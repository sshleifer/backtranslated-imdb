This movie proves that there is no need to look at the Hollywood budget. What's stuck with me is how a team from different places couldn't afford to do something without wealth because they believed it. I think anyone who makes low-budget movies can be related to certain scenes, such as actors who just don't get one line that the police are bothering about and most of the crew will disappear after the first week. Nobody received a fee for telling a lot of people who had to drive cross-country and long hours. After watching Stuie, sell your personal property, use your money and trash to make your house movie, which I am a little curious about how close his wife may be. Good work for everyone.
