For a long time before Terri Schiavo brought the issue of "vegetables" to the public, it was "the day of the death of Joe's egg". Alan Bates plays Bri, a school teacher whose daughter is almost completely cut. She and her husband Sheila (Janet Suzman) are trying out all kinds of dark humor to try and live, but they can't get out of the facts. At one point, they even consider euthanasia. The question of what surrounds them and their friends is what has ever become of this situation? With this film, Alan Bates continued the strip of really good films, preceded by "Zorba the Greek", "The Hearts of King" and "The Fixer". We can say for sure that he is skipped.
