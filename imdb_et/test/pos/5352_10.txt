Having just come home from my third observation that they are rabbits, I decided to jump to IMDb and see what others thought. I noticed that many Brits loved it, while in America it just didn't get it. It's not really a shock, because America doesn't get what English is. <br /> <br /> Wallace and Gromit are very English. Middle English, in fact, is the tip of eccentricity for a good measure. The film is much like our two heroes; simple and modest. It has a nice and gentle primer so kids don't disappear, but there's enough beef to keep adults entertained. There's some light inspiration (which seems to have offended the gospel - oh noes, drama!), But for a short moment there's nothing more rude than the bottom. If people ignite the plasticine by the anus, you know the confusion of the world ... <br /> <br /> One quick note to them (all American I have seen) who think Chicken Run is a better film: Chicken Run was made for a sense of humor , and I think it suffers for it. The rabbit curse is witty, English and intelligent. Thomas Tank Engine's film was broken because it was made for the Americans and I'm glad Nick Nick wouldn't let it happen to another UK institution. <br /> <br /> In summary, you can keep your chicken going, your Shrek, your Madagascar - such crude oil, crass, butterfly comedy just not comparable to the enemy and grace that is in the curse of Wallace and Grome's passion for rabbit. The English nucleus and long time remain Wallace and Gromit.
