Although this movie is set in sophisticated English language classes, it is a simple story of a broken couple. It has somewhat outdated air, which is the adaptation of Nigel Balchin's 1950 novel "A Way to the Wood" (once very popular and now forgotten). Julian Fellowes, who, despite the academic award for the Gosford Park Script, is a somewhat anachronistic person, wrote the script and directed (the first time). With the DVD version, I saw Julian have the most enlightening comment. His main focus was on getting his characters right and he's generally successful. This was helped by Tom Wilkinson's two outstanding performances, such as James, a sewn city attorney and Emily Watson with her attractive wife Anne. He also kept briefly; runtime is only 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> James and Anne have a town house in Chelsea and a comfortable former mayor in Buckinghamshire. Anne is a few years younger, but they're kids. Outwardly, they seem happy, but James, one of the morals of nature (unusual for a city lawyer), is a control nation. Just down the road is the aristocratic Hon. William Buel, who is not for middle class morals, and he is more than happy. But there is a complication, a traffic accident, in which an elderly cyclist is knocked on the country lane by ruthlessly driven Range Rover, like Hon. Bills. Soon James, Anne, Bill and the widow of the victim (who is James and Anne cleaner) will be secret to hide what really happened. The main focus is on the corrosive effect of all of it in the relationship between James and Anne. <br /> <br /> The third person in this game, Bill, plays Rupert Everett. From the point of view of casting, it is a bright and better way for a part, but somehow it doesn't get quite well. This is partly because he should be ill for a while and he looks good if he should be sick and vice versa. Part seems underdeveloped. Interestingly, John Neville, as Bill's father, with just one important scene, is able to create his character beautifully at the time he has. <br /> <br /> The world of five-star hotels and top-class restaurants has emerged nicely. As Julian Fellowes says in the commentary on the sound, these people can convince themselves that Edwardia's age still exists. But at the bottom, there is a film about what pulls the pair together and tears them. Nigel Balchin went through a book writing about the breakup of marriage and Fellowes has made a good air for transferring the atmosphere. As he says, his relatively free adaptation, but the central theme is the same.
