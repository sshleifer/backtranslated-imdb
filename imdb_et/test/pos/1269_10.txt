A great debut for Batman Begin's director is the film about a man who follows other people as inspiration for the characters he writes. One man he follows, decides to go further and the man turns out to be more than he wanted. <br /> <br /> Using the production of non-actors and his uncle, writing production and otherwise making the film completely self-produced, almost budgeted and independently produced, this movie is much more than you wanted. <br /> <br /> For everyone who loves Memento and sophisticated turns, shock and timing, it's definitely a movie for you.
