I always had the concept that Korean films were all about comedy and drama, but "Christmas in the fall" has changed my position. This movie is so simple. It has no melodramatic scenes or top comedy scenes. No scene where the actors cry aloud. Not even a scene where the actor and actress kiss, not even a simple kiss. And this film can reach viewers in the way I know. The ending of the film was unspeakable to me. I even cry, but my eyes were red. This film left me with a feeling that I cannot describe verbally. <br /> <br /> I don't think I can recommend this movie to everyone, but I recommend this movie to people who want to watch a real movie. 9.4 / 10
