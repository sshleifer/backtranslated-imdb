Almost every commentator has mentioned the way some interview footage has been placed over the concert material. This is true and this is the biggest mistake of this movie. But it is not so often or so bad that this video is not seen. If you are a Black Sabbath fan, you must see it. After seeing Black Sabbath in the seventies and early eighties, I saw them in 2005 or 2006 when they also saw the title of OZZfest, like this video. The concert was amazing and very similar, so I rented it first. It's almost the best geezer-rock out there. Look at it.
