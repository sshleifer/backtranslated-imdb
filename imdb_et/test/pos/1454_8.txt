I've always enjoyed Frank Sinatra's music, and just recently I wrote a story about my life story. I've been fascinated by the life and legend of Ol 'Blue Eyes. But I've never seen my movies. So I wanted to see if his action was as big as his song. Well ... it was! I was blown as a result of this movie! He really does a tremendous job of restoring the heroin addict Frankie Machine, who is trying to re-assemble his life and listen to the local band drummer. <br /> <br /> The direction of Otto Preming is also great. I haven't seen any of you in his movie. I read his biography from IMDB. He seems to be one of the leaders wrongly misunderstood, and people had contradictory thoughts about him. It seems that the person who likes the cult lovers most. I didn't see enough of my movies to find out if he was really brilliant, but now I'm curious. I want to see more of my movies because his man, "Man with the Golden Arm", appreciates this talent. I also loved the music of this movie. The result certainly includes music I remember when I ever hear it. This is when you know you have a high score. <br /> <br /> Supporting performances are also good, including Darren McGavin as a local drug addict, Eleanor Parker as a Frankie wheelchair woman and Kim Novak as her lover. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see how filmmakers investigated drug abuse and not modern experiments in films like "Trainspotting" and "Requiem for a Dream." In 1955, the mere mention of the word 'drugs' was the cause of the controversy and, if you watch the film, they kept the subject very discreet. There's only one scene where Frankie actually gets heroin, and they showed their face reaction more closely, not to see the needle graphically in their veins. But it gave her a message without it seemingly watered. In such a powerful drama that has such powerful performances and directions, you don't have to keep drug abuse to intrigue your audience. <br /> <br /> The "Golden Army Man" is a dramatic pearl that all movie films should look through. It's really amazing work! <br /> <br /> My score: 8 (out of 10)
