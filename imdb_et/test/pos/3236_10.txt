VHS - I've been watching it and loved it so much every minute that I have now ordered a DVD that I just want the movie to last longer. I never worry about what other people think I would prefer to set up my thoughts, and do not fully agree with the negative comments and do not allow others to spoil any film of their enjoyment. Do your mind and don't let others put you away! I have all of Jane Austen's BBC series, but that's my favorite. I see that a new Northerer's monastery will be released in 2007, which I buy when it comes out, but it does not prevent me from looking at the Norther's monastery that appeared in the 80s.
