All comments on this movie so far are negative, but I have to say that I found "The Net" interesting. Few movies can keep me on the edge of my seat, but it wasn't done. Another plus is that most action / temporary movies are full of language, but it was small. I found this to watch a pleasant movie. However, I'm a bit biased, a big fan of Sandra Bullock. * with the eye *
