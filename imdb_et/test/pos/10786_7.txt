Barry Champlain is a radio telephone receiver in Dallas whose unconvinced ideas on many social issues are disturbed and offended by many of his callers and listeners. Is Barry a media messiah who is looking for the truth, or social inaccuracy to attack his audience? <br /> <br /> It is an intense, provocative character unit of a person who has almost no redemptive qualities that at the same time seem to be truly deep in philosophy. Although Stone has written and directed, it is really a piece of Bogosia all the time and it offers amazingly sharp and piercing performance that cannot be achieved. Barry is sometimes one of the most unthinkable characters that suffer all around him, especially those who care about him. But at the same time he is also strange, empathetic, hypnotic, sage, even lovable. Bogosia's claws are a burned frame where his green eyes are constantly moving around when they are constantly looking for an answer to some mystery. The film is essentially an angry, in itself a fair attack on the brutality, injustice and banals of the whole world, culminating with Barry's three-and-a-half-minute rotating single image, giving the ultimate I-hate speech, but the boy punches the punch. Support is great, especially Greene as a former husband and Baldwin as a boss. Robert Richardson's sharp photography can keep one radio studio interesting, and Stewart Copeland is a tight score with a moving coda that includes this exciting phone music, The Penguin Cafe Orchestra's phone and rubber band. If you don't know Bogosian, look at his amazing talent in this flick - like his companions, Bill Hicks and Denis Leary, he is someone who rarely appears in the mainstream media because his writing is so. I find Stone's variable; I do not care about his great advances, but if he is more commissioned and more objective, like this (or Salvador and Nixon), he is much sharper and more arrested. A great original image of a picture based on Bogosiani's inspiration, inspired by Alan Berg's real story, a host of Denver radio broadcasts who murdered neo-Nazis in 1984.
