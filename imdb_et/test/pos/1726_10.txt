Unlike most people who have commented, I was born after the last episode of Sylvester Mccoy and could not compare the beginning of the two centuries. I enjoyed it thoroughly when Christopher Eccleston took control of the continuation of the TARDIS and the series. Since then, I have seen the existence of old Doctor Who and some great episodes, but as a doctor, it is necessary to continue with the series needed for regeneration. A great 21st century doctor who thought Martha was great, almost to a doctor, and if Jack's appearance is something he should go to, he's great when he enters the 4th or 5th series. <br /> <br /> Talking about Jack, the Torchwood spin is also great and you should watch both programs (although it's definitely more suitable for kids). However, if you insist that it is not the same and just not a doctor who please, please just put it in your basement. <br /> <br /> 10/10
