Of course, this does not mean that a couple boom mike does not mean anything? The Lord, Rudy Ray Moore and D'Urville Martin really put it together, isn't it? I laughed a lot, as often happens in this type of movie, but I don't know what I had to laugh about because I laughed at so many other things. I'm not saying the movie was bad, but I say a little more editing would have done wonders. I'm a big fan of Blaxploitation, so I don't think it would be terrible, but I know that "The Human Tower" was a lot better than that. I think those who can do this movie may need 45 or two Colt. I mean, it really helps noticing the odds when you look at it again.
