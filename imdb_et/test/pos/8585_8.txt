Being in Belgium, I am interested in the history of Congo. It has been our only colony for years (Rwanda was a Belgian protectorate but not a colony) and it is part of our country's history. Nowadays it seems very popular to say that what the Belgians did to Congo were wrong, especially in the 19th century. I'm not saying bad things didn't happen. Of course they did, but then it was not abnormal. Do you really think French or British were much nicer in their colonies? No, they weren't. During our King Leopold II, it was "normal" to use Congo to gain personal wealth. It was his private property (it was not part of the state) and he tried to make the most of it. Of course, there are terrible things like cutting hands, and yes to today's standards that are unacceptable, but these days it was normal. And this has to be said that it has never happened in recent decades ... I know many people who have been working in Congo for years declaring independence in Congo. It is true that they had several black servants, but they are very good people and I really can't imagine they have ever been badly treated. Because as far as I know, they have always respected them a lot (I don't say that all the Belgians did it). In fact, if they were not so old now (almost all about 80 years old), they would like to return to Congo. <br /> <br /> It is a good thing for this film to give a historically accurate vision of what happened in recent years of Belgian leadership and the first years of Congolese independence. The story is not so black and white (maybe not the best words in this context, but how else to explain what I mean), as I feared it would be. It does not say that all the Belgians were wrong and all the Congolese were good. This shows perfectly how the Russians and Americans, both of whom received more eyes on raw materials such as copper, diamonds, bauxite, rubber, did not receive haste in the haste of the Congolese Belgians. , ... and get Congo in their political "camp" and not everything their independence was interested in. It does not only give a good idea of ​​how Lumumba became more powerful, but also how Mobutu played a double role. This shows Belgium's reaction that some of our compatriots have been spoiled, threatened and even murdered (my father was one of the paratroopers sent to the Congo to rescue the Belgians). This gives a good overview of the political problems Lumumba encountered because Katanga did not want to be part of the Republic of Congo, the role that the Belgians had in the murder of Lumumba ... that is all part of this film. <br /> <br /> The story seems to be very accurate and the characters look like real. This film has given us a very good idea of ​​what life in Congo is like in the late fifties and early sixties, and that should be seen by anyone interested in the history of the country. But it should also be shown in history classes, especially in Belgium, as it is part of our history that should never be forgotten. I'll give it 7.5 / 10, maybe even 8/10.
