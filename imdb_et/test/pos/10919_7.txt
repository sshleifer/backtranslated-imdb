In & Out was a funny comedy with good productions by Joan Cusack, Tom Selleck, Matt Dillon and Kevin Kline. The idea that Kevin Kline is gay was very funny. If I were him, I wouldn't want to say that I'm married to my family, friends, and his wife. Very rarely would it ever have happened. I also loved when he danced around when the radio spoke to him. I would say that In & Out was a silly comedy that had a lot of laughter and crap. This is the recommended comedy, and Kevin Kline was amazingly amazing. Trust me that you like this movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
