I remember this movie when I was very young and many times on television. I've always liked it. I've noticed that one scene is in the opposite film when printing on a local TV. This is where they hide behind a stone ball (it looks like Vasquez Rocks near Los Angeles), watching the Indians. If you look carefully, you will notice that all soldiers are left! It's just a short segment and I have to admit that it took me years to notice it. <br /> <br /> With history, there were often expeditions to save Indians from white prisoners. The direct connection to the final battle scene is the battle of Beecher Island. In this activity, the Indians surprised a group of volunteer scouts equipped with recurrent carabiners (Spencer carabiners, not Winchesters), and retreated to the island and prevented several charges. In the last ship, they killed a Roman nose, one of the most famous Indian leaders. I have no idea if the script writer remembered this, but it fits quite well. <br /> <br /> There are a number of Guy Madison movies that I hope to get out of the DVD one day and this is one of them.
