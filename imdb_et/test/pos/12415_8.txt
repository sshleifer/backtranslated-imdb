Two college friends - one close joke, another rude slob - drive through the road. On the way, they face a cruel vehicle that looks like an army tank with a monster truck trying to drive its car. They flee for it, but only irritate the mysterious and dangerous driver more than one of them takes the leak at the top of the hatch during a rest. Later, they will be adopted by a sexy hiker, who will reach his life-threatening situation. MONSTER MAN is an extremely fun horror comedy that has both good moments and some good things. The two main characters and their constant beating are fun to watch all by themselves, and at the end there is a TCM-like procedure that was very well done. Definitely worth a look.
