As Salinger's "Perfect Day for Bananafish" ends with pride in suicide, this film opens when the legend of the star-center swimmer dies, Matt, who shoots his head on the home screen with a revolver. But Matt Travis's death is the key to opening another miracle, his brother Timi's door, who never seriously worries in his life with the question "What am I going to do?" <br /> <br /> When he finds his brother dead, his head breaks down like a fallen watermelon, the Travise family will vomit their secrets one by one. The film focuses on Tim. He is the victim of bullying, domestic violence, family alienation, heartache, sexuality and friendship. Tim opens his wounds with physical bruising, but these are not the only injuries to his person, as we slowly understand, because the script painfully opens the origins and results of Tim scars. Anyone who loves her hurts her. Hirsch plays the character quite well, revealing a frame in the visual expression frame of his body, which is the amount of contradictory emotions within the soul of a child that nobody knows and knows very well, without knowing and knowing his depth of soul and gorgeous talent. <br /> <br /> The two siblings who share the doobies, curved the red, spinnable playground base, asks Tim, "What am I going to do with my rest of my life?" The scene is designed from a familiar, repetitive film image: a comfortable playground where Tim probably feels at home is filmed from the eyes of the birds, as each character seems to be comfortable sharing with Tim, and we look at those intimate moments he shares the red spinnable playground bench, with the pencil carved by the pen. graffiti. After Penn has boldly agreed to pass it on, Penny says to him, "Tim, well, the secret to life's success is to find something you love. And you have to do it for the rest of your life? Hell that you're good because if you are not, you probably can't. "This simple line of Penny advice is the central theme of the movie, the responsibility of the talent and the chance of failure. Why does one person have a talent he can't do, like Matt, who hated the attention his swimming celebrity gave, but no one noticed Timi's talents? nobody ?? because nobody asks him? Not even us. The film makes us realize that we don't know Tim and we thought we did it when we first met this beautiful, sad, boy; Our intimate understanding of Tim, when it is progressing, is reminded that not everything is as they seem. This is the other side of the film, their failure, who should? parents, friends, teachers? whoever? notice and see the gifts of the people they love. Even his mother, Sandy, played by Sigourney Weaver, sees Timi's gift, despite her love for her son. Weaver does a dirty work for a medieval woman who strives for her own inner demons when she tries to play a role of home and support. When Tim is bullied in school, he rushes to the boy's trailer, threatens his life, "You can tempt, torture, hit, drink with me, I can forgive you. Christian, you know, I can forgive and forget, but you confuse me with the child, and does God himself shoot down the heavens to protect you, for as long as I live, sleep at night, just dream of making your insignificant life on earth in hell. "After traveling with the mother of a paper cup, she looks around and looks at the trailer. boy and his stunned mother, comment, "nice trailer" and leaves as fast as he came. Weaver appreciates his ability to match the joy of visceral spirit, which is acidic and witty. And Timi's father, who was played by Jeff Daniels, is blind to his son, treating him like a stranger, not telling his family that he took away from his office, spending his day in the city park, hopeless, carved with a soul and sleeping in Matti's bed high school letterhead. Jeff Daniels is doing an excellent job of believing that he may be as bitter as cute, because we grow to see that even an intuitive father can show his love for his son. In an emotional scene, Tim stands against his father. Just when you think his father will hit him, he grabs him against him. He won't let him go, says Tim, "I'm your father and you're my son and I'm okay here, but you have to talk to me. I don't know how to do it myself." Right here at the moment of the movie, Dad tells his son that you have to tell me what's going on inside you, you have to tell me who you are; I want to know who you are. It is in this scene that the film reaches the cathartic moment, the visual movement Timo, who is angry and alone, to his father, who grabs him when he breaks and cries, exposing the hidden emotions under his shell. Tim experiences this father's cleansing moment as a catharsis, especially if you think he has been treated for a long time, when the film involves abuse, manipulation, neglect, violence and betrayal. I recommend this movie.
