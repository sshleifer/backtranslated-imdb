This movie is definitely a matter of style, but the style is good and definitely more than unique to make "Cell" memorable and above average. impressive kits, costumes and make-up. Yes, it's a real eye clip to look at everyone. The film has some completely dreamy sequences that are definitely odd, but also very beautiful and imaginative. This movie is the perfect combination of art-type film and a typical Hollywood thriller available to both genre fans. <br /> <br /> The story itself is always a long way to go. That is why the film is not always a pleasant and pleasant look, but as I mentioned earlier, it compensates for style. The style allows you to track up to the end and give the movie the best moments. Vincent D'Onofrio is too little used in reality and this film shows his talent once more. I'm not particularly happy about casting Jennifer Lopez. I know he can act in some of his films, but he wasn't really good at playing the main character of this movie. His character was not strong enough and was overshadowed by Vincent D'Onofrio and Vince Vaughn. I still felt that Vince Vaughn was also unsuccessful in this film. He didn't fit well with this role and no, I don't say that because I'm used to seeing him only in comedies that are now a day. The rest of the support cast is good and still gives the film some credibility. It fits well with the film and gave some extra mood and atmosphere to the scene. Still "Cell" is a totally traceable film and maybe even a little bit must be seen in its style, originality and creativity. <br /> <br /> 7/10
