Take a young liberal idealist Christopher Boyce (Timothy Hutton) placed a secret classification in the government's front company, as his father's position he set up with the office drug dealer Daulton Lee (Sean Penn), who is police and needs a new source of income and you have a recipe for espionage. Sean Penn played the role of a punk drug dealer who had some singing froid, apparently not so sure about such dirty types. Gall Penn bears him unique in every situation; he even suggests that the Soviet Union drives him drugs. <br /> <br /> I've seen the movie over and over and every time I see something new. It seems to me that the big problem with the US spy organizations is its affinity, which leads to a manifestly inappropriate candidate for the renting temperature and the tendency for the government's leading company. <br /> <br /> I remember when Falconeer escaped from prison and led the authorities to chase the wild goose. I see that, despite his escape, he is now released. It is unfortunate that Soviet citizens no longer accept anger! Cheery Cherio!
