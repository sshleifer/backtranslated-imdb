"Sweeney Todd" is, in my opinion, one of the few "perfect" musicals. Like "My Fair Lady" and "West Side Story", it has an excellent, intelligent result. It offers two leading and multi-supporting characters an interesting role. It has a timeless theme, revenge. It has a lot of humor and it is as powerful as it is presented on a simple or large scale. <br /> <br /> "Sweeney Todd" speaks just about an abused man in an industrial period in England. It shows a person's inhumanity to a man, as Sweeney in his own words: "There are two types of men. In an attempt to correct his lie, Mr. Todd set a plan for retaliation. With the help of Mrs Lovett, who owns Mr.Todd's hairdressing salon in the meat bench, they decided they had "those who serve them below". <br /> <br /> I was lucky to see the original Broadway version eight times (six Cariou and Lansbury, the other two Hearn and Loudon). I saw revival with Bob Gunton and Beth Fowler and several other concert versions. <br /> <br /> Although there are few technical aspects of this production, I believe that this filmed version is the best. Lansbury and Hearn were the two best in these roles and they have a great time to play each other. <br /> <br /> Very good support for Ken Jennings and Edmund Lyndeck. Although Betsy Joslyn and Cris Groenendaal, as young lovers have absolutely no chemistry and are basically illegible. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
