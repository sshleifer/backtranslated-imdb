The length of the CGI movie has just been released this year, but although it gives kids a lot of fun, it's hard for Alvin fanatics and followers who grew up with the 60s and 80s versions of cartoons, probably The Chipmunk Adventure. Best animated film based on Alvin and Chipmunks that has ever been. <br /> <br /> For beginners, animation is just as fast that character designs are as they should be in cartoons - unlike film. is just a delightful look. there is no celeb voices, no cgi effects, just pure quality 2-d, hand-drawn animation and colors are fantastic- bright, bold and beautiful. Jokes and humor are a typical black standard and the narrative is on the spot. Indeed, The Chipmunk Adventure is all that a live action movie should have been, but not. Alvin, Simon and Theodore compete with Chipetts, Elenor, Jeanette and Britney in balloon balloon competition and along the way kids meet with any problems and dilemmas they have to solve in their own way. And no helmet film is complete without the odd transfer of classical rock and pop hymns. <br /> <br /> The Chipmunk Adventure is designed for both children and adults, which is another advantage over the CGI movie, as the 2007 edition will feature some new admirers, the 1987 film will appeal to both young and older Chipmunk fans. . Bagdarasian and Karman offer helium-like voices in the film trio. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is for fans of comics, who themselves show that you are not disappointed. When you see the live action version, you feel that this movie is a much better effort. If you haven't done that, you should go and look at it, or even forget about Jason Lee's movie and, alternatively, stay with it
