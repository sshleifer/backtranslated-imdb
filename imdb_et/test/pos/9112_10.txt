I'm a huge tenacious D fan, and I think it's not the most fun movie in the world, but the most entertaining. It's not a laugh-a-minute, but that's not what D planned. I went to a movie where I saw all the HBO plays, I remembered both albums and made it even more enjoyable. Many internal jokes from previous Tenacious D albums and HBO shows. Since I knew a new album, I knew 40 minutes of the movie because it's a musical comedy. I'd say it has the best of every movie for 5 minutes and the best of the movie for 5 minutes. Hands down. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie now!
