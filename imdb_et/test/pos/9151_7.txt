Most of the quiet movies I've seen have been serious in nature, so it was fun to see the comics. The "beloved Rogue" place and some scenes resembled the 1923 "Notre Dame" instead of Paris Street scenes and "King of Lolls". John Barrymore depicts Francois Villon, France's biggest poet, in a testimonial that ranges from a virtual slapstick to a romantic offer; The "wine wine" bit early picture was quite amusing. <br /> <br /> It seems that the times will never change and it is interesting to see that the film makes a remarkable observation almost a century ago - in Paris it is stupid to be one night, while everywhere is always one. While it was true that Conrad Veidt appeared in the film, it was a bit surprising for the viewer, I only saw him in Major Strasser "Casablanca", strangely one of his latest films. Like King Louis XI, he is astrology, cunning, but dubious monarch, and it was a little pointless to see exactly how he reminded Brad Dourif's Wormtounge character from the last chapter of the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy. Not exactly that the king of France could trust. That is why the supremacy of the Duke of Burgundy (Lawson Butt) seemed even more plausible until Villon rose several times to put both rulers over. <br /> <br /> I found it interesting that online cards were extremely free, they were only used when it was indispensable for further development of the story. But without them, it would be a nice curious nugget. Villon seems to have made his exile in Paris at Lame Flea Hostel! <br /> <br /> The printed image was of exceptional quality, the first film to be released on Mill Creek Entertainment's 100th Action and Suspense movie DVD. This is something that is something of an eighty-year-old movie. It's nice that silent films now find a wider distribution in this type of commercial format, making them accessible to a completely new generation of movie enthusiasts. <br /> <br /> One question - did it look like Conrad Veidti's King Louis chose his nose or inadvertent gesture that was just safe from the cutting room?
