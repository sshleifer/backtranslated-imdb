Waste electrical and electronic equipment is still fun! Like most of my friends, we had seen this movie in HBO when we were young, and then we had copied the copy ever since. When they finally released it a couple of years ago, we had a Midnight Madness party ... and the movie got up well. Of course, this is pure cheese, but it's still fun. If you didn't see the World Championship when you were young, you might not understand your value today.
