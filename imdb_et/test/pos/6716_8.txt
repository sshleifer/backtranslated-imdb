"Lifeforce" is a real bizarre customization of Colin Wilson's novel "Space Vampires" written by Dan O'Bannon & Don Jakoby. The joint American-British space exploration team is making an amazing discovery: an alien spacecraft, located at Halleys' Comet, and containing three units that look like humans, one of those female beauty (oh-tempting Mathilda May). br /> <br /> They take these discoveries back to their spaceship. Big mistake. <br /> <br /> It turns out that these creatures are living a life of life and like American colonel Carlsen (intense, sharp and committed Steve Railsback) and British S.A.S. Colonel Caine (firm Peter Firth) looks at horror, vampire infection is over London, with the Earth's destiny balanced. <br /> <br /> This picture is definitely not imaginative. From time to time, it moves a little slowly but offers so many strange and fancy ideas and striking visions that are hard to entertain. The first film by Tobe Hoopers, directed by Cannon Films (followed by remake of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre II" and "Mars Invaders"), makes him truly unique. The sci-fi, vampire, zombie, and end-of-the-world catches contain elements I have never seen before. <br /> <br /> Railsback and Firth support strong British actors such as Frank Finlay, Patrick Stewart, Michael Gothard, Aubrey Morris, and John Hallam. Mathilda May is very memorable as an enchanting, puzzling woolen shirt; it certainly does not hurt that he performs a lot in his scenes. It is also worth noting the disturbing music score, which is nothing more than the "Pink Panther" composer Henry Mancini. <br /> <br /> It may be ridiculous, but I found it fun too. It is amazing and lively entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
