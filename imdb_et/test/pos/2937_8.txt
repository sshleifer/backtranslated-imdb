Yes, I look at this example. Because my girl is watching this, of course. Well, at least, I'll tell my friends. But as someone here never knew me, I can say that; I love it! This is a great trash TV. First, there is a panel; Tyra herself, who doesn't leave one chance to talk about herself, but she needs to be taken seriously because she is quite a businessman. Then Jay Manuel, a sober gay, very serious and amazingly professional, and Miss Jay, the extravagant one, the "Queen of the threshold" and the fucking funny man and Nigel, who is independent as the only man in the panel. Secondly, the show is an in-depth look at the low industry and we have to give it to the manufacturers to show us an inner view that can be both informative and entertaining. Finally, the edition is great; there's just the right mix; Girls living in the Ego house, their impressions of sets, competitions and judge. All of this slides smoothly with just better competition. There is no length. The panel consists of capricious, double, extrovert, and rapid attack; Woe to those who offend them! But it is said that if one competitor does not move to their toes, their rating is usually fair - I think. <br /> <br /> So give your brain a break; If you can't beat them, join them and you'll be happy to watch this reality TV with your loved ones. It makes the desire more, somehow.
