Well, it has to be said that Monster Man is a huge mess of the film, but somehow there are several different genres and a cluttered plot to make one of the most enjoyable modern horror movies I've ever seen! The two biggest styles the movie mixes are the "Road Trip" style teen comedy and the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" style, which is an unfortunate horror slit and although one gets quite often the other way; director Michael Davis is able to keep things moving because the constant change of tone means we're never quite sure where the movie is next. Things start worrying when we introduce two characters that are both irritating in different ways. Adam is a nervous virgin, while Harley is a greasy mouthpiece "A-hole". They both go over the desert to attend a chick wedding, both of which were liked by high school. After a couple of strange events, they take a hiker-hiker and find themselves somewhat away from the manic of the monster truck for unknown reasons ... <br /> <br /> The idea that someone is pursuing someone else in a larger vehicle is hardly original, but the way the monster truck is here is one of the biggest assets of the film. The truck itself looks terrible because it is both haggard and rusty, and the fact that it bounces around the screen makes the exciting activity exciting and tense. After a while you start to practice and when Aimee Brooks enters, things start to look. The movie's teen comedy side really works pretty well, because Justin Ulrich is always on hand to offer some entertaining dialogue tools and scenes between dorky virgin and a warm female hiker are interesting enough. Just when you think the film can't get things in any way, things are strange in the last third. Without spoiled things, the Monster Man has an end that cannot be seen in the future, and with a twist it is a big surprise. Some people may feel that the sudden turn has ended - but I thought it worked quite well, because it fits with the film that nothing really fits here. - But if you are looking for fun entertainment, the Monster Man should arrive!
