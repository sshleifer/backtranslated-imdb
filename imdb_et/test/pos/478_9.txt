I tried it at Chicago IndieFest and I have to say that you're more fun than other reviews and even a website would make you think. Not HA HA Wedding Crashers funny, but sick, twisted, I can't believe he just said it was so fucking real funny. . It's never a moment when you think I'm watching a movie and he's an actor. He's too damn real for words. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are 2 scenes that I still overcrow, and I won't give them away, but in one it is a bathroom telling how much it gets paid for a particular service and how "fantastic" it is. (I almost do not know how many people in the public secretly think the same!) <br /> <br /> In another, he talks about the definition of "sex" for teenagers compared to adults, and if this is not the most beautiful dialogue I've heard in the film, I don't know , what is.
