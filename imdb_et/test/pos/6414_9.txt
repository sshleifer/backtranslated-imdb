(The film's mood description can be considered a spoiler because there are not many deeds in fact) <br /> <br /> Excellent ... <br /> <br /> Is it a special interest for me for dystopias and utopias? Is it for the film atmosphere. Or is there anything more magic? If so, it is definitely a human ... <br /> <br /> This film is undoubtedly an artistic / artificial (depending on the taste). I can imagine that most of the people who hate slow films (and those I didn't enjoy for the second time) are one of the slowest I know about) during the movie. Yes, people can't slow down and pass time - and watch it without feeling they're wasting it. This piece can be taken for torture or treatment ... <br /> <br /> Topic surface? Lack of communication - even if we live in rabbit cages - next to each other - but not really together? People are tired, sick, and unable to describe it - just don't want to meet, touch, talk, get in touch ... as if they were gone. The large apartment building seems to be insignificant and the rain is constantly falling inside the strange melancholy. And sometimes it has to be something abnormal, unexpected, some unwanted disintegration as a concrete floor that allows us to reach one another. <br /> <br /> One of the possible ways to see it is: Don't explore the inner world of the characters - look at the entire space inside the movie. And ask - why is it there? Where do these depressive conditions and moods come from? Do they have a place, they have no right to be here? And look for the answers (if you need them) between the walls of the block and the halls - instead of just being in a transparent idea. let the film borrow us - inside the learning theme - yourself - and finally return us safely to our more colorful and "more common" reality. <br /> <br /> Then you will - like me - get the feeling of a true, potential, and pathetic hope that we are still human ... and this state of mind may help one to live a lot in this world.
