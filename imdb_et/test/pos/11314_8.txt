Before seeing this picture, I was quite skeptical, I don't like the movies on the agenda, and I don't appreciate being afraid to think like a writer. I was afraid it would be like a 2-piece mini series "10.4" with a far-fetched concept, a small connection to the real world, and a very poor performance. In the beginning it says: "This film is a fiction, but the events and information on emergency planning in the UK are based on extensive research"; and the general feeling is that you are not selling ideas, but that you are being taught civil society awareness. The message to be transmitted is obvious from the beginning: it is coming and we are not ready. The use of real places and a scenario that may not only happen - there are plans when it is - all add to the disturbing effect of the film even on the most cynical viewers. The film's perspective is the perspective of society and it stays away from the heart-breaking personal moments that do not convey the message, so that no Roman-Juliet drama we are used to.
