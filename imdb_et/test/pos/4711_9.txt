I'm afraid I have to add a long list of people who have been stubborn, that the film does not feature STILL on DVD (Sep 2007). This is one of those mysteries that makes your mind confused, especially if you think that the amount of DVDs available today includes materials that should have been hit for years. However, I have a great digital copy of VHS in English with subtitles and Nicam Stereo, so my feature is more fundamental than disappointing that the movie can't be viewed. As far as the film is concerned, it is an excellent, good-quality overall, more than a satisfying soundtrack, a lively plot that includes alternation, emotion, sadness, frustration, good feelings and exotic surroundings (for Europe). If it is true that the film fits into reality in Burma, I have no idea that it is less important, it is important that it is entertaining, it is successful. One of the main characters will arrive soon, and I testify that I have a heart in my mouth when I cross my last heart. Unfortunately, we hear so few countries like Burma and this film gives at least some insight into the country. Has the situation changed since 1995? The events later this month seem to respond "no" to this question, and the set regime seems to be as cruel as ever, not even to save monks' monks, let alone women or children!
