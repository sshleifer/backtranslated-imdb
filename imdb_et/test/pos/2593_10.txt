One of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons is Elmer Fudd's hunting and Daffy tries to shoot him at the Bugs. Needless to say, Bugs has its own agenda. What's more, "Rabbit Seasoning" makes interesting use of verb and pronouns (warning: it can just hesitate and royally confuse your speech). <br /> <br /> I think that my favorite movie costumes are costumes. worn by Bugs and Daffy. One of them seems to have been in 1952 (especially in the comic book), but they pull it out as they always did. All in all, it just shows the geniuses behind the cartoons.
