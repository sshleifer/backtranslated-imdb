With awesome mini-series. The original TRAFFIK stole me completely from what it was. Much more interesting than the American remake, the original TRAFFIK is an amazing majority of well-known actors in the North American audience. Juliette Binoche is primarily a recognizable actor who plays a government official with a drug addict. But this is not the star of the film (although I enjoyed the American version, I felt that the famous Americans were dim in the picture). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I saw the American version before I found the original BBC mini series. Of course, there were no picture filters, lush spots and big names / directors. But the sharpness and grace of Europe (through the drug world) congratulates the threat that this film is going through. Problems like getting drugs drugs, giving them more, a bad anti-drug campaign, and the resistance of foreign governments to destroying their drug cultivators from inside, all make TRAFFIK brave, ambitious and terrible all at the same time The truly incredible part of the movie comes from Pakistan. My God, I never knew how bad this problem really ended in Europe ... even all over! Actual education on drug problems, in addition to how they affect the human body, you must follow both this and the American version. Everyone shows one very clear and undeniable fact. Countries that are world leaders are culture that has led to death and suffering for many. Medicines are worse than war. They work in shadows, in the darkness of any "successful" society.
