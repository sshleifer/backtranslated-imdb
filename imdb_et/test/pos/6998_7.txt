This movie goes bad. Incredibly, the corn monologue is followed by a wonderfully made, truly amazing spacecraft. Then things will go down again if you realize that the survivors are all a) bad guys (except the docking pilot and the psychopath), and b) almost all of them fit too well into the role of the monster animal. Hell, half of them don't even speak English, impeding the audience at all. You feel as if you look at the "Deep Blue Sea" that corresponds to "The Silence of Stables", from which a good bit is deducted. And unfortunately, the whole thing is trying to "fall off with the Hannibal Lecter on the planet during the daylight". Vin Diesel is a great actor - but he's not Anthony Hopkins and he's frankly bothering the smart hyper-yoke psycho. There is at least one very good scene that includes an unexpected survivor, but besides that, you could cut off the first thirty minutes or so ... <br /> <br /> But then things change. I can't pinpoint exactly this moment, but soon the movie will get a lot better. It also seems less fragmented - the scenes start to follow each other consistently and Vin Diesel becomes much less annoying and soon he will be an exhibition-stealer. By the time the first monsters appear, the movie is really very enjoyable. By the time the night falls, it's great. Exciting, terrible and exciting. And even the development of the character of most of the main characters is well done. If you can just sit with the poor bits, then for some great entertainment. <br /> <br /> Moreover, visuals are eye-candy and I honestly admit: I love the color and tone of this movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10 (could have been 9/10 if only ...)
