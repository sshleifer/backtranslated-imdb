Dresser is one of those films that is so perfect that you really struggle to find something they don't like. Written by Ronald Harwood (a former legendary legendary Donald Wolfit), this creates energy and true love life behind the shoes. <br /> <br /> Like "Sir", it is a terrifying actor and main focus. plays, Albert Finney is pleased to see - complains about the lack of rain "blow, winds ..." a little "King Lear" or talk to his faithful director Madge (Eileen Atkins, good as ever) about the old times. When he is Norman's camp teacher, Tom Courtenay gives a fabulous presentation, turning around "Lear" and calling, collecting a bottle to go to the pub or a bad fool, Mr Davenport-Scott (often mentioned but never seen!). <br /> <br /> In entertainment support, Edward Fox is Oxenbyna (a typical arrogant second leader), Zena Walker as his Ladyship, Lockwood West as a substitute and many others. <br /> <br /> This film has a great energy that brings its stage-origin greasepine, it is true, but not so well-behaved. Very well done.
