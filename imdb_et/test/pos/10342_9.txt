Through the channels I had the luck to stumble at the beginning of the movie. I have to admit that it took my attention almost immediately. I love older movies and that is or should be classic! One of the most wonderful rarities of this film is that the protagonist was not only a woman but also a bad girl. I highly recommend this movie!
