The movie is really cool, I thought. It stays well with the original game and some of the battle scenes are depicted in such detail that it is incredible. I thought the film might have been a little better if they gave you a little more information before the end, but try to find out what's going on, what's the hook of the movie. <br /> <br /> CG is beautiful, I don't think they could have done a better work schedule. Every little detail, the way they move, how their swords look, everything is perfect. The way they see characters is almost like real people. <br /> <br /> The music was great and I found it fun to hear how much of this original game remixed. new tools and effects. <br /> <br /> Everyone and everyone, I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a fast pace and good story. I'd definitely play the game before watching the movie.
