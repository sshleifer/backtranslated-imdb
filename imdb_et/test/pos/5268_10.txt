"Hail The Woman" is one of the most mobile movies I've ever seen in my life. I watched it twice and threw my eyes out. <br /> <br /> This quiet movie masterpiece deserves a much wider audience; Unfortunately, the only survivors are printed so badly scratched that most people do not look at the whole journey, and they miss the gem below. This film could use digital restoration to help bring about this beauty, but I doubt it will send someone out because its main theme is the spiritual restoration of the family unit before Christ and it is not politically correct today. But it is still a powerful topic for those whose hearts are broken because of family pain. <br /> <br /> Cast is great, especially Firenze Vidor, who literally burns like a daughter of Judith; Essential Madge Bellamy as Nan, a poor girl who gets pregnant and is discarded; Theodore Roberts, who is the oldest dominant father who will destroy everything with pride around him; and the beautiful Lloyd Hughes, when the son of David, was afraid of his father, but really life himself. <br /> <br /> It's a nice movie, especially during Christmas. You will not regret that you are patient and look at it as a whole, despite its deterioration.
