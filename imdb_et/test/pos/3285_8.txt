It was a pretty good episode. Although there was nothing "hidden" or "Cartoon Wars", there were many things to do. Al Gore's character and the "super-grain" thing of this bizarre hell was funny. But the scene that made me respect this episode was that everyone agrees that it was one of the greatest moments of Cartman / Kyle. When Cartman is superstitious for Kyle, he steals his gold (which is, of course, a fake!) And he comes in the face of his face. Suddenly, Kyle wakes up and has such a crazy conversation where Cartman tries to act like everything is fine. Cartman, who finally made a treasure, though predictable, was pretty funny.
