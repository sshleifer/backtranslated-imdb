Glenn Ford is hired by the owner and charming stable owner of the screwed bank, Edger Buchanan, to steal counterfeit robbery while the banker hides a real looting. In the case of Ford, there are no two examples, but two run with a happy second choice, leaving Ford killing to kill what it didn't. <br /> <br /> Columbia Pictures' first color feature, Desperadoes, is a fantastic set of suits and costumes designed to take full advantage of Technicolor's process of raising tons of well-staged Western spectacles. <br /> <br /> It has irresistible young Glenn Ford (third bill, but essentially star), and main Randolph Scott led great character actors in colorful roles, including scene-stealer Edger Buchanan, who is good-natured but slightly insecure, is not as stupid as he looks and has quite a few memorable features. quite a complex script effectively mixes amazing sequences of action, melodrama and comedy led by Charles Vidor. It is the great western parts of the nineties and is recommended.
