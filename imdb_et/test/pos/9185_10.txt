Last night I was happy to see Hitch. I was stunned and surprised. Will Smith did the role of phenomenal work, which he did not always associate. He proved once and for all that he did not have to hold a gun to be the big actor of the film. Kevin James was also very impressive. I admit that I always like the "Queen of the Queen", but that role brought her more light, and I hope she will see much more on the big screen in the near future. The film was funny and divine, and I recommend it to gold as the best film you could ever imagine. The comedy, romance, and drama mix was full of me. It is nothing more than most "chicks flicks" in terms of tears and sadness, but has its own and I think both men and women can enjoy it. I encourage all couples to see this movie especially, but even if you are not related to someone, you can get some great ideas from Hitch. <br /> </p>
