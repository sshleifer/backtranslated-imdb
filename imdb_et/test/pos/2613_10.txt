It's spoken, triggers a happy, alcoholic ASS COP! I've seen the first and second episodes. Art and animation fit very well (note facial expressions, lol). The main character is a gun toting, a sign of wearing, a few cheek cheeks, shooting whoever he thinks to be offensive or "guilty". So far, episodes have had simple and subsequent plots that work very well with Assy's research. Don Sanchez, Assy's partner, plays an astonishing blow to A.A. random and random "I have a hunch". Assy lines are very funny and clever, for example, here is one: "I have one month and I got your email address, don't hit me" * bang * "looks like your input is just a new message." Assy Mcgee the headquarters think tank is so far, consistent and commendable. For sound, it is perfect, the sound effect and the voice is 9/10. Assy sounds like Sylvester Stallone, who has all grown up, Don Sanchez, police chief, mayor, all in the voice that "Fit" is there very well. I recommend it to anyone who wants a couple to laugh before they go to sleep because Sunday night is done by an adult swimming. Very funny, imaginative, visually different comedy. 10/10
