Although this film is false from the point of view of homosexuals, this film illuminates viewers about myths and inaccuracies about AIDS. Despite the frustrating theme, this film depicts the warm friendship of two boys and makes you laugh and cry. Well done by everyone, especially Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro. The language is quite strong, although it is suitable and is an entertaining and intelligent film for the whole family. But remember that Kleenex is ready!
