I was given a DVD of public enemies and was expecting it to be the 2009 version, but it wasn't - it was! Of course, it wasn't the biggest movie I've ever seen - but NOT with the tool - but the devils, it was worth more than 2.8 out of ten! When I saw that it was a debilitating rating in IMDb, I was wondering what I was going to do, but since the disc was in the player, I started watching it. As other observers have pointed out, public enemies are not in themselves a historical film - and I noted that, unlike the 2009 version (which I have not yet seen), IMDb is not classified as such. <br /> <br /> Come on! It's stories based on some real person - that's all! When I want a lesson in history, I sit on this computer and read Wikipedia or something else. Ma Barker (the real name of Arizona - or Arrie-Barker) was never accused of any crime and - as other commentators have already pointed out - he has probably never been involved in his sons' activities. They sent him to the movies "working"! (I hope he was not as critical as some of those who watched this movie!) \ TTheresa Russell never had a too simple task of depicting a woman from the age of 17 to his 52-year-old death a girl who runs home from the tempered mother of four hoodlum sons. I think he did it quite well. The funny little smile he used in more than one scene was classic! OK, I agree with some critics that the direction of this movie was down to par. Theresa should have forgotten topless shots from the director - they didn't give the story. Perhaps some of the larger stars would have managed to inject some of their experience into a poor direction, while second-class students were not quite as brave. Who knows? <br /> <br /> Although not necessarily blocking, it was worth more than 2.8! I have all my DVDs in a personal database where I can get them before viewing the IMDb score (although sometimes it affects some changes later). I take what I get from my own, rather than keeping a movie against the same genre, and what I felt was fun, that 6.8. (Yes, I accept that this practice usually depends on my mood, but it is not the case for those who vote for IMDb?) However, you can imagine my surprise when viewing IMDb and I saw the bad score he got here . <br /> <br /> Due to surprise, I decided to read some other comments to count on a low rating, and I noticed that they were quite polarized. I agreed with those who said the movie was worth watching and concluded that some people are just hard. Well, since some were absolutely outraged, why can't they get out of there and make some better movies? I look forward to the interesting gems they have to have! On the other hand, if they can't do that, why don't they just close?
