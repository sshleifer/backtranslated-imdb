It takes time to adjust the sound of the Pioneers' Sons, but enjoy it thoroughly. If the soundtrack were played by an orchestra like Max Steiner or Dmitry Tiomkin, he would lose his folkloric character. Music controls the film, everything seems to follow its rhythm. The whole cast is great. The caravan is run by young men Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. Ward Bond is Mormon leader and Joanne Dru is an actor of flirting. Ford was able to do what would be ordinary in the West, something completely different and original, which shows us music, dances and above all people.
