Fortunately for Bill Murray, this is such a lightweight project because he has to do a lot. Meatballs are a story of Northstar's low-rent camp and how his advisors deal with both campers and each other. Then there are many prosperous competitors over the lake called Camp Mohawk, which culminates in a two-day Olympiad. All this is Bill Murray's clowning and making a very memorable film debut. <br /> <br /> The film is sprinkled with medium-sized laughs, smiles and more than a couple of guffaws along the way. The biggest laughs come from the nerdy camp director games. Three of them involve advisers who move their beds at different places during their bedtime. Morty or "Micky", when they all call him, wake up the road, turn some trees up a few feet above the ground and finally float in the park in the middle of the lake! There are also some funny moments about advocating each other, but this is a PG-rated movie with little rage. <br /> <br /> The movie has a serious remark that involves a shy chamber called Rudy, who plays Chris Makepeace. Of course, it is taught to Murray how to open the child and the trust she needs to lead the marathon at the Olympiad. The sentimentality of Rudy's situation seems to be largely hindered. Note that when Murray first sees a child sitting alone in the grass after the bus is retreating, he says to him: "You must be a short depressed child to whom we ordered." Makes to think whether this line was actually in the script or Murray was just ad-libbing just when the cameras rolled. In other words, Murray could also say to Makepeace, "You have to be the actor we hired to play a stereotypical lonely child you see in most summer camp movies that don't fit." But before it's all over, Murray's performance makes this plot device more tolerable. He seems to have a very good chemistry with Makepeac. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with two rival camps. Very few events we show are even a little believable, but "it's just not important". It's a pretty good movie on many levels. Don't let the absurd 5.6 estimate that this movie is now intimidating. Murray keeps you laughing. Just warn ..... avoid the sequel !!!! Especially with Corey Feldman! 8 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
