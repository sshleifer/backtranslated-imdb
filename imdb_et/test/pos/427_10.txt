I see only three Hack episodes starring David Morse, and it seems I would have left 37 episodes! well if ITV 3 shows them in chronological order. I just looked at "Misty Blue" (episode 38). I've really enjoyed 3 episodes, but then I'm a fan of David Morse, (esp. Elsewhere). Anyone who reads it is Hack great. I'm sorry it's on ITV 3. The cast is strong, although I can't get used to David playing the bent police, but we all know he's a good man who was wrongly accused. I see that Gary Cole has guest stars that happened to 'Midnight Caller'? Just don't know if Hack is available on DVD (yet). Lovin it. Greeting.
