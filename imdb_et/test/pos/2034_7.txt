I've been waiting for this movie to be released because I heard this concept two years ago and I wasn't disappointed. I'm not worried about the story because everyone else is, but I say it's just plain. The performances were great, as were the music and the main characters. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is: (1) The story was definitely missing; the movie was erected very sharply - in fact, writing in the second half changed quite loosely, as if the writers were not sure what to do with the plot. Since the plot was almost as important as music and deed, it didn't really affect the entertainment value of the movie, so it's not as big a complaint as it seems. <br /> <br /> (2) It's really nitpicky, but the music that the movie's characters were listening to was sometimes after 1985 when the movie was set. INXS Devil Inside had been since 1987 and AC / DC Are You Ready had been since 1990 among others. It bothered me a bit, because they obviously took a lot of time to have done a good time, they should have checked the copyright date of these songs to make sure they were 1985 or earlier. Again, not a big deal. Oh, I was thinking something else that was strange. The members of the Steel Dragon band were supposed to be English, but for some reason the band members played Dokken's bassist Jeff Pilson and Ozzy's guitarist Zakk Wylde, and both had a couple of talks with an AMERICAN accent. It was also lazy, but it was still cool to see the real musicians who played the musicians, so I'll forgive it. <br /> <br /> I can probably skip the whole day, but I don't want to give the impression that it wasn't a super entertaining movie. I will probably buy this DVD when it comes out, and I'll definitely buy a soundtrack CD just for six Steel Dragon songs (some of which were sung by the singer Steelheart if you remember them!). The highlight of the film was probably a big excerpt where Mark Wahlberg is lipsynching with a rock song on the stage, and suddenly Marky Mark and Funky Bunch play Vibrations. The surprised look of Mark's face is invaluable. Classic rock and roll-flick! Score: 8/10 for extreme entertainment
