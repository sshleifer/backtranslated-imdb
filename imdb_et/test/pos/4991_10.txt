Comanche Moon impresses me very much. Before I started to look at it, I didn't expect it to be as good as Loneome Dove. I couldn't believe how well the participants were chosen to represent all the characters. It blew my mind how well they played every role! It was almost as good in my opinion as Loneome Dove. It's hard to compare all the movies with Lonesome Dove. If you don't make this comparison, I'd give it a thumb. It was a lot of fun! I don't post many comments on this site, but I just felt like I had to get out of it. Amazing! I don't want to go out to every actor who was brilliant because I would probably need every single. My favorite was Steve Zahn. He hit Captain Gusi on the nail head. His ways were perfect.
