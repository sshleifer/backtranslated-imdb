I like the very wind and the lion. It was a good movie. I thought that because I was young and it was done so long ago, I wouldn't like it so good, but after I saw it, I was surprised how good it was. My family liked it, my friends liked it, everyone who liked it. I liked it because it showed how Germans, French and even Americans treated Arabs and people in Morrocos in the early 1900s. When I was a high school history teacher, I would definitely show it to my student, college. I'll give this movie 10 out of 10. My grandparents loved it so much that they bought it for themselves. My little 3-year-old cousins ​​even sit down and watch it. <br /> <br /> System-free
