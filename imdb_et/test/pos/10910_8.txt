Howard (Kevin Kline) teaches English at a small Indiana high school. Finally, he married Emily (Joan Cusack), a lot of his parents. The city is also abuzz, because one of his own Cameron (Matt Dillon) is nominated for the actor's Oscar. Everyone, including Howard and Emily, will be watching television awards when Cameron is declared the winner! In his acceptance speech, Cameron stated that he was able to play his role as a gay warrior partly due to the lessons he had learned from the high school he was in high school. You thought it, Howard! But Howard has never "come out"; he really believes he is straight! Are all the city and media members waiting and watching for events, Howard and Emily go and marry? Or is Howard truly gay and realizes he can't go through the ceremony? This is a great, funny and humane movie about gay and his situation. As a man-who-who-not-understand-he-was-gay, Kline is great and touching. The rest is equally good when Cusack is a sewing machine like a mixed groom and Dillon, Bob Newhart, Debbie Reynolds, Tom Selleck and other hands to rejoice in the audience. The costumes are very beautiful and the beautiful hearts of Indiana are beautiful. Even then, script, direction and production are very, very nice. However, the insightful, humorous and thoughtful look of the gay population is the best asset of the film, no doubt. For those who are offended by a gay movie, yes, just skip it. But for everyone who wants to laugh at the heart and get a better understanding of the gay situation at the same time, it's definitely the best movie.
