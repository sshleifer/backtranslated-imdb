I watched it on Sky TV late at night because I'm a Vampire fan. I have to admit that I was halfway with this B-movie disaster, but I was pleasantly wrong. <br /> <br /> The subspecies are about the Vampire family. When the Vampire Lord dies, his two sons, the beautiful and Noble Stefan, and his brother, the evil Radu, start war with each other at their birthright, Bloodstone. Bleeding is a type of vampire and it blows the blood of the saints, which gives the vampire who drinks it a very high level. <br /> <br /> Fighting Bloodstone unexpectedly brings three college students to the brother's territory during school trips and Stefan must protect them from his brothers Lusts. <br /> <br /> As I said, I went to the movie that wasn't waiting at all, but it was one of the best low budget movies I've ever seen. Sets and Locations (Romania I think I've been for a while because I've seen it) are very nice and the music score made the film fair. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors were enough, but his Anders Hove as the evil path that steals the movie (and all subsequent queues). Hove's performance as a twist Vamp is truly breathtaking and tends to make the movie just okay, pretty d @ mn good!
