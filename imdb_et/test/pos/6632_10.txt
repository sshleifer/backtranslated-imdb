Emergency is the high point of the Master's career. Ingmar Bergman penetrates an existential study of a couple on the island of Gotland who is engaged in long-term war. Liv Ullman and Max Von Sydow give a painstakingly detailed performance in this spare drama. The intensity of the film is based on Bergman's attitude, which focuses on the minutes of his two characters, intimate relationships - both musicians who have achieved it - trapped in a landscape they no longer understand. We see how the external pressure of war aggravates and corrupts their relationship. Both characters are forcing the material circumstances of war to betray their ethical sense. In one of the most powerful episodes, Bergman forces us to think about the manipulative power of film material, showing us the interview with Ullman's character, which has been re-edited and distorted on one side of the conflict due to political influence, and used as evidence of war crimes in a brutal interrogation scene. <br /> <br />
