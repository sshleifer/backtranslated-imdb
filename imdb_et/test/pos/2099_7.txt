Like the second poster mentioned in Ch. 56 (local Boston TV channel) showed it several times on Saturday afternoon. They tied it to the first stage of "Ginat Majin's Return". <br /> <br /> Now I haven't seen it ... but it never left me. Beyond the frightening duplication and faded color, it was a pretty good fantasy. Technically, this is not a horror ... until the shape of the end of life. It's almost a village ruled by an evil man. There's a gigantic stone shape that villagers pray to help them ... without results. But things go too far, the statute lives and destroys bad guys ... but then goes after the good guys! Well done some cool special effects at the end (LOVED how he gets rid of the main bad boy). There was also a fascinating forest that was also interesting. <br /> <br /> Some masterpieces but unusual combo-fantasy / horror films. It is worth to catch - but not when it is dubbed the print.
