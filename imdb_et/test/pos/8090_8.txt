That was Charlie Chaplin's first talking film. Yes, his previous film, MODERN TIMES, was accompanied by some sound and talk, but it was still a silent movie. So only in 1940 did the public hear about the Chaplin movie. <br /> <br /> The film is incredibly famous and has a perfect reputation. While enjoying the movie, I was almost as impressed as Chaplin's other 20's and 30's mid-length feature films. This is because I felt very disturbed by some of Chaplin's terrible deeds when he played Adenoid Hynkel - especially when he gave his speeches. The stupid pseudo-dialogue seemed to be similar to what would have been used by a less comedian (for example, three Stooges). In addition, funny Hitler playing is difficult for me. <br /> <br /> But when Chaplin played a Jewish hairdresser, he wasn't particularly funny (he wasn't really a funny sign), but he had a huge voice for reason and reason. This movie should not be remembered as comedy (especially because it is not really suitable), but for its excellent functioning and humanity. Hairdressing (embodying Hynkel) is great and almost brought tears in my eyes. Watch the movie just for that reason.
