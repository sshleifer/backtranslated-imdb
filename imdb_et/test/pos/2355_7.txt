I saw this movie for the first time in 1953 with my older brother. It was one of the three great Demension movies of this era. We saw it at least thirteen times and we were proud of it. Scott does the usual Western shooting, surrounded by Indian arrows rather than spatial sound. Oh, for those polaroid lenses.
