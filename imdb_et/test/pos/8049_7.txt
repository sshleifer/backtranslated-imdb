It is hard to imagine the legendary D.W. Griffith, got his way in 1914. This is an exhibition of Griffith's new style. <br /> <br /> The story focuses around the names of the settlers, Cameron Brothers and their families, including the young man (Mae Marsh). ) Sent from the East to live with his uncles and his young wife (Lillian Gish) who has just given birth. A group of Indians are trying to grab waifi pets and men by the people. During the confrontation, the son of the Indian commander (Henry B. Wathall) is killed. The Indian leader reveals his revenge and attacks Elderbush Gulch's small community. <br /> <br /> It is this attack, which is quite brutal and graphical for this or some other time, that forms the core of it. picture. Indians are killing peoples, women and children and driving them from town to Cameron Farm. A newborn baby is separated from her mother and all hell breaks open. Someone goes for help and returns to the schedule where there is a calvary. <br /> <br /> Battle scenes contain some graphical violence. For example, we see that a woman is scaled alive and there is also a sequence where we see a horse being shot. I've never seen an animal slaughtered so convincingly on the screen. Mr. Griffith became a champion of big battle scenes, the talent he used extensively in his epic drama of civil war, "The Birth of Nationality" that appeared in "Next Year". <br /> <br /> Although it has a few 29 minutes, "Elderbush Gulch's Battle" is still an exciting and historic movie. See if you can see Lionel Barrymore and Harry Carey a bit.
