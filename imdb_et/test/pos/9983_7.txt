Disney Buena Vista Pictures offers a great talk-based sports drama by actor Bill Paxton. Photography is great, but the story is sometimes missed. This film is about 20-year-old American golfer Francis Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf) and his competition in 1913. What a story; a one-time lifetime chance of allegedly incapable of playing with the best golfers, including British masters Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) and Ted Ray (Stephen Marcus). End of manure that ends in the throat. Also, Peter Firth, Elias Koteas, Marnie McPhail, Robin Wilcox and stealing the show are Josh Flitter, who plays Eddie Lowery, Ouimet's caddy and best friend.
