Sheba Baby is always likely to be underestimated because she has the usual r rating that the Grier movie gets from a regular r rating. All that pg means is that Pam doesn't take her up, she'll take her top off every other movie she's had. it is more exciting than Coffy, more action. it will slow down, but by the time it is on the screen, the excitement has started. like the Dolemite d'urville martin is the one who is trying to become the father of Sheba, but he doesn't have it. he hires one woman's war against martini and his crowns. The best scene is a stupid pimp in my car, which I still have to laugh at. I thought it would be stupid because it would be a rating of pg, but I was wrong, it replaces sex with violence and in a blaxplot film that may be just good!
