Walter Matthau is great as a "philandering" dentist, Dr. Julian Winston, whose frequent rush to girlfriend Goldie offers textbooks about the dangers of lying. Goldie Hawn's Toni Simmons was sure to win the Oscar. Ingrid Bergman's work as a stiff starch sister, Stephanie, also concerns viewing when she slowly and nervously exits her shell. It's a great movie to watch in spring or any time. This is very underestimated; I've never heard of it until I found this video store and what it is!
