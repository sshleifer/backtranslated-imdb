It's a quiet movie. It is a simple story of a writer who cannot start a returning story to his home town, but he participates in a friendship with a strange parent whose life externally represents the writer's inner state - a museum of unfinished ideas, outdated equipment and "useless" people. <br /> <br /> The soil has no extraordinary circumstances or great movements. This is a movie about internal changes. Being stuck in their lives that do not develop much, the main persons can help each other change, stop leaving and achieve something, or at least make a difference, and give their life a desired and long-awaited new direction. /> <br /> On the side of making a movie, I can only think of one weakness that could also be considered a feature - we do not get a lot of character descriptions or insights into the inner world. The thoughts and events side is very narrative, and we have to think about their true feelings, which are quite hidden, but still you see them, and it will make your mind work, trying to understand them, impressions they are not empty below - the actors hold definitely firmly internal states that are suitable for their characters. It is close to real life, where you mostly don't know anyone well enough to fully understand them, and it turns us around and puts your feelings and choices ahead. <br /> <br /> For me, the most important thing is that this simple, almost flat story will leave you wondering later, about your life, your dreams and achievements, whether it exists or whether we are left behind in routine and enjoyment, leaving 100 % or just dreaming we can do more and move somewhere that we would like to be rather than just leave the feed and other stories like "I'll do this one day" - don't move one finger to really happen, or "I'm good where i am ". because by habits is it easier to go than change? At least the impression that left me and it was very timely for me, which adds my appreciation for this far-fetched movie. I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves movies for the heart, but those who need events and activities should stay away.
