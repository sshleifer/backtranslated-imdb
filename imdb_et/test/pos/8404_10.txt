two different films that have left the wind and scarlet, which they never had to compare, probably all the gwtwi's original actors have died and deserved their own special prize and praise, which I loved for gwtw and have never waited for success or never live up to half the praise of gwtw, but my shock scarlett was as well written and acted like a gwtw scarlett on its own, deserving the same amount of prize that I honestly say, I don't know what I like better I think the script for scarlett was the number 1 perfect "sequel." Bravo! writer director and all actors Bravo! The descendants of AS rarely live for their name, it is equal to its predecessor. For those who do not like it, you leave this point and a great end to the phenomenal beginning
