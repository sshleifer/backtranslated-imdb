The 1979 HAIR film music is based on the notorious Broadway music of the 1960s, which became famous for its notorious naked scene. The music of the performance is not really much more than a group of skits, put together with some fun music; but for the filmmaker Milos Foreman (who won the Oscar, who led ONE FLEWI ON THE CUCKOO NESTI) and the writers have based the basic premise of the game and score, and created a real story to show the "user-friendly" exhibition on the big screen. In the film, the naive peasant Claude Hooper Buchowski (John Savage) goes to the army and decides to spend a couple of days in New York where he will meet with Treat Williams, Dorsey Wright, Annie Golden, Don Dacus, including snooty society. girl (Beverly D'Angelo). The story is divided into a series of vignettes, ranging from ridiculous to sublime, but it is all beautifully captured with smart NYC locations and imaginatively staged musical numbers (legendary by the legendary Twyla Tharp). Treat Williams lights up like a Berger screen, an unusual and free hippie who does his best to get Claude relaxed and fit the scene with Savage by Claude, who brings Claude a pleasant sweetness. Annie Golden is charming like Jeannie, a pregnant hippie who is Wright or Dacus pregnant, not sure which one is a dad and doesn't seem to care. Here is one outstanding musical number ... "Aquarius" is an excursion through Central Park, which includes dance horses ... Treat Williams interrupts the fancy dinner "I Got Life" ... "Black Boys / White Boys" Late Nell Carter and Ellen Foley, who misleads men's ethnic virtues, and "easy to be hard" is a powerful performance for one of the best songs of the original cast member Cheryl Barnes, who plays Wright's former girlfriend and mother for her child. It is a beautifully photographed, well-functioning, sung and danced psychedelic acid journey that needs to be seen and seen, triggered by several views, because this dazzler has to offer a lot to show it all in one endeavor.
