A fantastic series, one of my few favorites (Miami's two experts and the Tour of Duty are the other two, and this series is right there). <br /> <br /> These guys don't wear brown pantyhose - they dress more like foresters. All this series breathes reality, artistic license or not. <br /> <br /> It paints the image of paganism only to a small extent, as most villagers still have local deities, and there is Satan, worshiping nuns, and ores, witches and witches casting a spell. <br /> <br /> But most importantly, it is a series of times. Instead of a fifty-year version of centralized government and McCarthy persecution, this series has been well-founded in the 1980s, with the blindness of Thatcherists and strong environmental protection. Robin's defender is a worshiper of nature, called Hern Hunter, who often appears under the head of deer and has a personality (like Robin), the alternative version of The Green Man, Osiris (the Egyptian vegetation and the resurrection god), it is interesting to note that Robin is not in these series In The Hood, the person, but the concept of how old is killed, is called a new person from Hern - a person can die, but Robin In The Hood lives forever, so the concept of resurrection. <br /> <br /> Music and scores are truly outstanding and are being played by Clannad, Ireland. When I looked at it, I couldn't guess how authentic the medieval folk music of Anglosaxon would have been. :-) <br /> <br /> All of this is beautifully captured in Wales' lush forests that pass through New Forrest. <br /> <br /> The only thing below is that for both series, participants must overcome their skepticism and convince themselves that this is really a serious job. After that they get in and the actor is great! Michael Praed as the First Robin (the second was played by Sean Connery's son Jason), Judi Trott makes a beautiful and fragile redhead Marion, Phil Rose as a portly and truly cordial friar Tuck, Ray Winstone as a voluptuous and gracious Scarlet, Clive Mantle as a giant Shepard Little John , Peter Llewellyn Williams, a small John's bumpkin friend and companions shepard and Mark Ryan as former Hashashin / Assassin Nazir - all they give great performances. There are also big stable Bad Guys, Nicholas Grace, who are spices, Nottingham sheriff, and his aristocratic, worshiping sidekick (and Robin's side brother, as it turned out) Robert Addie as Gisburne Sir Guy. Truly cool is also fashion designer Richard O'Brien, as Gulnar, the evil Lord Owen (Olliver Cotton) magician (he appears at the end of the first series and later in the second). <br /> <br /> The Avon Bradford-based Tithe Barn stood for the Sheriff Castle. (Check it out under "Points of Interest" at bradfordonavon.ee.) <br /> <br /> So if you ever miss Xena or Hercules at all in mythology, medieval, romance - this is the real thing, so go look out and see it! <br /> <br /> Alex
