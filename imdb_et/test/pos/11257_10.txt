I saw this movie today (November 5, 2005) for the first time. I wanted to watch it because I saw the basketball diaries (Leonardo Di Caprio) and loved it, but it was much harder. I think it was a good thing about drugs. I was mostly emblematic of the character of Nick Stahls, probably because when I was crazy, I was in this matter, which I would like to help them get out of it. A promising student and an athlete who spends all his training and learning well, it is understandable that he wants to try a teenage life (this crazy side) and in his efforts that begins, his friend helps him addicted because he wanted to see what it is, and because of his dreadful family situation leading to his most tragic death. A really sad film, but one of the mistakes I noticed is that you don't get a good understanding of the family damage, but it is also a great result with a truly heartbreaking movie.
