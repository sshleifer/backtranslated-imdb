I think that the movie Posse by Mario Van Peebles is a very important film. This is a great entry point to history, many of which are unaware of. This is the story of the early black settlers, cowboy and infantry who return to the Spanish-American war with gold. The main character Peebles worships his murdered father's memories. The new black racism against settlers and infantry is being explored in this film with great pain, including Melvin Van Peebles (father of Marios), Billy Zane, Stephen Baldwin, and the great Daddy Kane. <br /> <br /> It seems that Peeples has tried to use as many significant black (and some not so notable smiles) participants as possible :) Maybe too much, some remarkable individuals (Issac Hayes, Pamela Grier) are just coming to the scene , others briefly like Tone Loc. Some people understand Peebles' efforts to expose their participants. A great director (for any director) works well and does a good job of telling the story of the classic "vengeance and the fight for justice". <br /> <br /> The most remarkable was the veteran story of the veteran. actor Woody Strode (from one time to the west), who was in his life, was in the context of a previous era that had not disappeared from memory. No other participant would have done better for this role. Read here as the basis for mini-bio Woody Strode: http://imdb.com/name/nm0834754/bio <br /> <br /> The film is doing a good job of balancing the action with a bit of sardonic humor. Dialogue was great as a little modern! And, as others have mentioned, the embarrassment of this period was not accurate. The sex event was a little much - it doesn't really need it. There are some historical inaccuracies, such as the bogus electronic trademark, etc. But Posse is a good attempt to hopefully open the door to more historical and creative works that reflect other untold stories and events. The actual photos of the actual cowboys were very nice at the end.
