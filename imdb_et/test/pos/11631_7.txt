I was a little surprised to see all the hate comments here. Of course, this is not the best show, but don't stop Barney's despair after fifth grade? Okay, all hate Barney. Okay, I think his voice and songs are annoying. Okay, he's a little creepy and strange. I'm 14 years old so I know well. But here's the thing. Children? They love this example. <br /> <br /> When I was two or three years old, my parents spent more time getting around the house when they did something else. Nothing got my attention for more than ten minutes. Seek this, so toddlers. Even the most afflicted cannot sit long enough to give their parents a break. There's too much to do and see and explore, too much to get into. And then Barney came. I don't know exactly what is about the purple dinosaur that is so amusing for kids, but they certainly love it. I know I did. I was at the show and wanted to watch it again and again. Yes, the songs drove my older nuts, but that they could learn their children, and being excited about something that can really get their attention is worth it. I learned my ABCs and 123, magic words and teeth brushing. Of course I grew five or six, but at least I was at least patient and gave my parents a break. <br /> <br /> My brothers and nephew all went through the Barney stage to grow, their mother's joy. I know what keeps Barney in the air. He's amusing. Of course Big Bird, Ernie and Oscar, and they're big. But at the toddler stage, more children seem to prefer a large dinosaur of songs. And that's enough for me.
