Notorious HK CATIII actor, Anthony Wong, is once (well ... not really once - he was a policeman DAUGHTER OF DARKNESS in movies and some others ...) not psychopathic weird at EROTIC NIGHTMARE. Usually, his role as a complete wackadoo is recognized in CATIII "nasties" such as "UNTOLD STORY" and "EBOLA SYNDROME" - this time Wong is at the reception end ... <br /> <br /> Wong plays the man who goes to the witch who promises him truly dreams come true. According to him, Wong's dreams related to the sex of mad asses with hot schoolgirls - but dreams are at a price that is more than money. Witch can manipulate dreams and sexy ghost, blackmails Wong out of her money and business, kills her family and finally kills Wong herself ... Wong's brother comes to town to find out what's happening and finally finds that his family murder is a wicked witch job but, as it turns out, Wong's brother himself is a pretty joke-witch, and with the help of the witch's abused spouse, the tables turn to the witch and his schemes. .. <br /> <br /> EROTIC NIGHTMARE is one of the most enjoyable CATIII movies I've ever seen. The lack of some other CATIII items like RED TO KILL, UNTOLD STORY, or HUMAN PEOPLE CHOP - EROTIC NIGHTMARE is a sharp and dark feeling. more serious films in the genre. More comparable with ASIA ETERNAL EVIL - more "carefree" CATIII entry that offers a lot of nudity and good gateway without being too comical. Certainly worth a look, especially for the genre enthusiast. 8/10
