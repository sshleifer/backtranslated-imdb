Good movie. <br /> <br /> I managed to sell it on a local DVD store. Â£ 2.99 seems to be good and that is. The thing is that the movie is called "Kill". It took a bit of detective work to find out the original name. In the UK, it has been rated 18 and rightly so, although the film standard depends on "selling ability". Having seen the last final match last 3 yesterday, I think it should have been 18. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is nice, Traci Lords is that the rating committee is stepping up to 18. Such shame. <br /> <br /> Traci is a great actor and should be given the opportunity to appear in bigger and bigger budgets. It is capable of making the B-Movie brand a subtle presentation. <br /> <br /> Long Live Traci Lords and his incredible talent as an actor.
