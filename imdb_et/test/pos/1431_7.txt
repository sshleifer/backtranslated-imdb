But pretty dated today. Otto Preminger made this film without the necessary proof of approval. It was tremendously bold and risky because it could have lost its investment and future. <br /> <br /> Film is not a wonderful book, and unfortunately it is hollywood. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra (and I've never been a fan of Frankie Machine's amazing performance. One forgets that this is Frank, the level of reality he brings with the drug addict, must be a believer. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak, forever proud and talented, does not disappoint the role of a committed bystander, always for Frankie. <br /> <br /> Supporting roles, especially young, beautiful and talented Darrin Mc Gavin , it's flawless. <br /> <br /> Eleanor Parker, who plays Frankie's wife, is hopelessly wrong. She moves irritably to melodramatic and is too up. Unforgettable performance. <br /> <br /> The bare, cheap settings are terrifyingly as if a clear layer of wind is on the horizon of all the striking painted cardboard, their unpleasantness is sometimes ridiculous from time to time. <br /> <br /> Music was sometimes irritating, disgusting so much as the nuance of every script (example: when Louie starts Frankie) to pull it out of its drawer), it came in a high decibel level <br /> <br /> 7 out of ten. appointment. It's worth seeing.
