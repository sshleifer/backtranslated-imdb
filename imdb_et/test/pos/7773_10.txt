It's mandatory for everyone, but especially for African Americans. It is time to have a film that expresses and shows African-American relations. It also allows other cultures to see in a fictitious humorous way how African-American relations are positive, and about their outcomes, rather than the unwanted stereotype that engages the African-American community. I love this movie you have to see !!
