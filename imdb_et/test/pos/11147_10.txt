This movie is extraordinary because Marlene & Raymond performs great performances. Working in this movie is the greatest strength of production, but the script, direction and editing deserve applause. There is an extraordinary chemistry that exists between the two letters. If you like Marlene and you like Raymond, you love this movie ..... (it's classic that is comparable to Casablanca.) <br /> <br />
