I just came back from seeing this awesome movie !! I can interact so much with this ... It reminded me when my sister had to go to college, we had to move from place to place and my mother was acting like Adele August! The boys may not like this film because it brings eyes to the eye. One of the best real movies I've ever seen! and Natalie Portman Rules! 10/10
