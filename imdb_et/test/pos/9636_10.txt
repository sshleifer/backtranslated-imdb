This is another classic Seagal movie. He walks, no, all the other Mega Seagal films cruise through the patriots. Nothing is even close to Seagal in this movie, except maybe the part where he has to find the cure for this so-called “break” and he starts to throw things at the laboratory, but it all works, I mean, let's face it, his lord Seagal to win. But his equipment in the film, the masterpiece, he has to choose for himself. It's great that everyone in the movie dies after exposure to the virus, but Seagal can't even cough. The end result when he kills a grease guy with a glass, genius, I bet Seagal thought about it. This movie is a clean and simple class. big plot, big characters and seagal.
