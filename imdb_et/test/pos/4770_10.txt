Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse's first fully synchronized sound artist debuts the screen in an extremely fun short description of "Steamboat Willie". Mickey is under the supervision of a staff member of the Peg Leg Pete (or Pete) in the steamboat. Mickey has been planning his long-time companion to Minnie Mouse on board the train when they loot, while Mickey is trying to impress Minnie. This short was fun and fun. Animators Ubbe Iwerks, Rudolph Ising and Hugh Harman helped Walt create a short. "Steamboat Willie" essentially marks the beginning of the success of Walt Disney Company.
