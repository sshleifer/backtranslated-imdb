First rent or watch this movie you expect in the B-horror. What this film gives to this cute fan of this genre is quite fun chewing gum through the nord taste. Sometimes the humor of Jackson's Dead Alive reminds me and the other Stuart Gordon sliding this little was found to be the most fool. <br /> <br /> F / x reaches some really horrible heights (the first time Ed meets his genius), but in general it feels that this movie was put together by an af / x team who decided to use any and all props , which is at their disposal from other films ... gremlins, devils, slasher films, etc., has a pretty good effect and worked on hallucinations. <br /> <br /> The pearl of the movie is humor. Gore works mostly, but laughs. It's in the heart of this parody and fun of it.
