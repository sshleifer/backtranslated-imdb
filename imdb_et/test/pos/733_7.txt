This film, also known as "don't look in the basement," is not really bad. It's a little known film that even died of fans of fear, but I found this movie quite fun. Don't do me wrong, it's not without his problems, but I think more people should watch it. The story that a hot nurse is going to work in a sanatorium is definitely appealing to me. I thought the vision at first glance was somehow better when the film went. Actually, the actors seem to have played their roles. There are some good, colorful characters, including a man who thinks he is still a soldier who thinks he is a judge, a child's brain adult and an attractive girl who wants to get so bad that he falls into his clothes when someone goes close to him. The title "Don't look in the basement" is as much of a story as "last house on the left" on this film. If you like movies of a spiritual nature, like me, look at it.
