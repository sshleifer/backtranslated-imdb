1959 was the landmark of the film world. Many of the great leaders of the classical era relieved the career limitations that were their best. Just a look at the headlines is instructive, in the north of Hitchcock, some like Billy Wilder's hot, Howard Hawks 'Rio Bravo, Douglas Sirk' Imitation of Life. Add last year's pair, Orson Welles's touch of evil, Hitch's Vertigo, and Nick Ray's breeze across the Everglades, and you have a pretty good summary of what was possible in the classic Hollywood style. <br /> At the same time, two films appeared, suggesting a completely new way of making movies. One was Jean-Luc Godard's breathless, the other was John Cassavetes Shadows. These two films had common things that were largely improvised, working with non-stars, handhelds, a small budget, and some youthful jazz. In some ways, however, they couldn't be further away. Godard was still the director of believing in style as a judge. He knew more about the film than most Hollywood producers, and Breathless was full of iconography of the classic criminal film. Cassavets, on the other hand, was an actor and refugee from the scene of the underground theater in New York. His first film shows him little impression of cinema and great belief in actors. Godard's film constantly refers to its own object, while Shadows strives for some kind of naturalism. <br /> <br /> It doesn't usually come because naturalism is a myth, especially in the cinema. But it seems powerful, kinetic, but lotting like cool jazz, definitely the main inspiration for this style of filmmaking. Ultimately, it is not together, mainly because Cassavetes actors are amateur beatniks, where Cassavetes style requires strong and creative actors. His later work with Gena Rowland, Ben Gazarra and Peter Falk blows it out of the water. Due to the director's technical inexperience, some dialogues had to be redesigned later, which loses the freshness of improvisation. It is still interesting to see such great moments (like a scene where Leila Goldoni speaks of her conviction of losing her innocence) as well as looking at a groundbreaking artist who finds her way.
