This movie is the most impressive Turkish film I've ever seen. Probably "Okul" is the first Turkish horror film. I have to say I was excited about watching the movie for some reasons. The first reason is that the story is impressive, I mean, at the end of the movie, you understood all the details of the film that makes the film attractive and the other reason is that no Turkish man made such a movie like that. This shows that the Turkish film improves itself over time. While the first attempt to make a horror movie, It was really successful. I recommend that you don't leave this movie ...
