Here in Germany, the "Queen of the King" is a great cult status! Almost every teenager (and adults) watch this sitcom. It's really awesome! Better than other terrible American sitcoms like "Full House" or "Set by Step" (the only series that are still OK is "Al Bundy"). In Europe there has been no American sitcom who was as effective as this really funny show! Kevin James and Leah Remin, like Doug & Carrie Haffernan, are the craziest couple I know, Jerry Stiller as Arthur is the funniest "grandfather" I know, and Victor Williams and (especially) Patton Oswalt as the deacon & Spence are the most different but funny guys I know. I look at it as often as I can, and I don't have enough good humor yet!
