First, I loved the documentary. It is a new school history / theory where the subject can reflect many social and historical issues. <br /> <br /> I take the camera and the dogs first. I hate the quality of the Blair witch, but I also understand the advantage of this random approach. In fact, I agree with other reviewers that it gives us unprecedented access. <br /> <br /> Dogs: Warning, I have a PhD in literature that I do not use as a profession, so some of my trainings may be entering: Dogs are a beautiful metaphor for a person's great aspirations and our need to find work to achieve them. Dogs may reflect their owners, as one evaluator suggested. But they also work for the film workers. While this may indicate a Marxist problem raised by one reviewer, I think it also shows how difficult it is to globalize work-related issues. No Mondov can be translated elsewhere in Italy. (Yikes! I am a Marxist heart and I hate to hear my cynical resignation!) This is a remarkable bait and switch. Dogs are family, employees are family. In the end, however, dogs are workers (the last scene with a poor farmer). Although you may disagree with politics, the art of analogy with the more open policy of the film is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Only Faulkner (from Alabama) was the film's power on the Hollywood market, which interesting stories would have been said.
