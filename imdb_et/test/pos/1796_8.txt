The four seasons merchant is a film about lack of love. The film begins with the main character; Hans Epp returns to the incantation of a foreign legion. He returns to his mother not to tell him how much he loves him or how much he has lost from him; but to say that he is worthless and worse, he would have preferred a man with whom he went to come back. This is the nature of the relationship with women, which makes this movie so nasty; the fact that her husband is higher than her is a symbol of her relationship with another sex; he is consistently humiliated by him, and his relationship with them is not as great as he could have. This is also shown by how he treats his wife for a drink. He lost his job as a policeman for the lust of a woman and even a woman; a woman who should love her never shows her any affection. Even in the end, her husband has more trouble doing what she and her daughter do as a state husband. <br /> <br /> The Four Seasons merchant is a very unpleasant film. There is no scene in the movie where someone is happy and not just that; but the film seems to be gently blissful when it is in the midst of its centerpiece. The film is certainly not recommended for anyone who has a hard time right now, that's for sure. Despite all the tribulations, the film never rises to the limits of reality; every event of this movie can - and probably - happen and it only works to make the film more shocking. The film is directed, of course, by Rainer Werner Fassbinder; German cult artist who committed suicide in 1982. It's just my second taste for my work, but just two movies make it easy to get the idea it creates. Both films are weakened and sharp - but realistic works of art. His character in this film is subtle; we only know the characters through these difficult situations, not through their character. This is a very clever way to show the audience that it is their surroundings that define the people in the movie, not the people themselves - and almost anyone who sees the film knows what lives in urban society, it's hard, most people communicate. <br /> <br /> The four seasons merchant is not just a forgotten movie; the movie's content is high and the style is low and it makes a very memorable picture and anyone who sees himself as a movie fan should experience it. I think I will give this film my highest recommendations; it's not sweet and it's not pleasant, but you don't see a more realistic depression image, and it's definitely a movie that will stay with you.
