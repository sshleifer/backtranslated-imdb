Wow! How to get started? <br /> <br /> This Sarah Waters third novel is one of my favorite films of all time !!!!! <br /> <br /> Novels (Seriously, NEVER read fiction), but the book is like FABULOUS as a movie! Or should I say that the film is the same as FABULOUS as a book? I LOVE THIS STORY !!!!! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'll keep watching this three-hour movie (2-part series DVD, 3-part series TV / book) for about a year and a half. . It just didn't look so interesting ... BOY WS I SO W WONG! <br /> <br /> I immediately put in rich and fine plots ... totally amazed! Just like a book, you can't stop viewing / reading. It grabs your attention for the whole 3 hours ... and when it ends ... you want it not to be. <br /> <br /> The story just flows so beautifully and you don't know where the time went. <br /> <br /> Lesbian sub-block was just on the cake! The parts I love the most are fine facial expressions and eyes / eye contact between two characters. You really feel your desire for each other and yet they can't act ..... until they have. <br /> <br /> It can be pointed out that the "lesbian theme" is an important part of the film, obviously the film is about a real unexpected love story, but it is definitely not about the whole movie. For me, this story is so unique and intriguing. I've never read or heard anything like that. Sarah Waters is a pure genius! <br /> <br /> The rotations that take place will take you to the edge of your seat. Seriously! My hands were twisted on my couch with my surprising plot, and I shouted several times ("OH MY GOD! NOT! NO! NO!"). /> <br /> The only negative thing I say about this movie is that I want them to add more to the book. But it is obvious that adaptation is limited in time so that they could not add anything I would have liked. How terrible it is ... I think I'm now cruelly selfish ... forgive me. <br /> <br /> Over the past 20 minutes, it seems a bit hasty. But they put all the important bits where even if you watch the movie and decide not to read the book, they are most satisfied with the result. <br /> <br /> Participants are just SUPERB! BRILLIANT even! Sally Hawkins (Sue) and Elaine Cassidy (Maud) are so big on the screen that they evaporate your TV. Just electric! Emotions ... despair ... the struggle everybody knows about them is apparently obvious to their wonderfully talented actors. Rupert Evans plays such a good bad as a gentleman. I found myself every time he appeared on the screen, but I love it because he's just so fucking cute and somehow still charming, even though you want to twist your neck. Imelda Staunton gives another great result when Mrs. Sucksby. He's such a warm-hearted actor you can't, but I love him ... even when he's playing, it's not so delightful. All the others cast were perfect! They represented the character well and were as I thought they were after reading the book. <br /> <br /> It must be for every movie buffer! In fact, everyone and everyone should see this movie AND read the book! You may not be disappointed! <br /> <br /> 10/10 about me! The rest of the same movie has been given by four other films. It is very rare for me to enjoy the movie so much that I will give it a 10/10. This is one of those movies. Fingersmith is truly a masterpiece!
