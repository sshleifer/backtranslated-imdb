The second (not animated) film, which only deals with people who still refused to surrender to the Roman Empire, is even more fun than the first film "Asterix & Obelix contre Ceasar". <br /> <br /> When the first movie was all laughed, because all the comic strips were so perfect in life, without losing their cartoonesque identity, this sequel (which is a separate story like all the comics) is even better. Of course, all the ingredients in the first movie and comic books are again present: Obelix still dies to taste the "magic drink" that gives his other tribal member such enormous powers, the emperor and the rest of the Roman Empire is still enemy number 1 but also new, refreshing Elements have arrived on stage. <br /> <br /> Not only very idyllic (most play in Egypt), but repetition of the movie. number one, some appendices are added, making all kinds of references to other films (Bruce Lee, etc.). Not all of this is a very new, but unexpected combination of a comic book known story (almost the same title as a movie) and references to things that have nothing to do with Asterix & Obelix. <Br In this way, the film builds on the tradition of comic book writers Goscinny and Uderzo, who hesitated to bring Laurel and Hardy to the stage and even collected the whole story for Kirk Douglas. <br /> <br /> If this doesn't convince you to watch this movie, I'm sure Monica Bellucci will play Cleopatra.
