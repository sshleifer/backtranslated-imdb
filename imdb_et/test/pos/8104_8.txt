This brilliant and innovative comedy packs a lot of moments that are priceless and at a great pace, though too long. Chaplin's satire, with several classic scenes, has a double role as Jewish hairdresser and dictator Hynkelina, Hitler's offensive image. Then the hairdresser misleads Hitler's tyrant and gets confused. Funny and extraordinary, which works like all the co-stars, Jack Oakie, Napoli (Mussolini-like), Henry Daniel as Gasbstich (Himmler-like), and Billy Gilbert, as herring (Goering). Chaplin's first feature film is perfectly captured from Karl Struss. This great movie contains a lot of fun scenes, the funniest ones are: 1) When WWI rides a soldier with a co-pilot on a plane without knowing 2) Dictator Adenoid Hynkel, who speaks too much, including a twisted microphone 3) Hynkel, who plays with a huge balloon of the world 4) A Jewish-hairdresser who shaves a man corresponding to the Brahms 5 Hungarian dance number 5, when Hynkel and Napoli try to keep their body higher than others in the hairdressing chair; Among them, Hitler forbade the Germans a film exhibition that was due to his satire and put him on his death list after his conquered American conquest. The film is marked by Paulette Goddard, the third of her four women was married in 1936, although no marriage was announced later, once stopped by the Great Dictator. The picture appeared in 1940 when Chaplin was a paternal feast, but with a brush with an American-American action house was a signal to the United States that he refused to leave Britain and he fled to Switzerland.
