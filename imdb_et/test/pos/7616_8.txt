I can't say I would take it for a romantic comedy because I found it funny. I found it to be loving, fun, affectionate and endlessly sweet, and although there were some funny moments, I found them bittersweet as a direct comedy. <br /> <br /> I liked it. Barrymore has grown as much as an actor, and it's always wonderful to catch him on the big screen, but it's also a small screen. In fact, I like it more and more in later viewing. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of romantic comedy, it may be a little lack of comedy. , but if you're in this romance, it's definitely here. <br /> <br /> This price is 7.8 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
