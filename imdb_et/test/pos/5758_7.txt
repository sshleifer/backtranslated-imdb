I had been looking for this movie for so long before I found it, I had seen it when I was younger and loved it, after my second look I still loved it and I still do. <br /> <br /> This is a love / anger movie if you like North, Young, Comic, then find it funny. If you don't like this humor, don't worry. I love this movie and I have grown up with these comedy programs because this movie is just putting my comic gene on the big screen. It's not a winner in any way, but if you just want a good healthy slapstick, that's it! <br /> <br /> The film lacks the quality of the TV series and is usually for movies, but it still has enough material to laugh at you, even though many jokes are quite similar to their previous work, so humor is a bit childish, not everyone taste, but sometimes you need it in the movie.
