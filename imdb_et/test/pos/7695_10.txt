I was @ 13 years old when I saw this very poorly rated movie at ADAMS Newark, NJ, I bought the program and later bought a soundtrack ... both are still .... I'm 55 years old now. and have not seen it so far (maybe once on network television, in the 1960s?) One of the biggest pains that have ever been put together, high score and output, please give the second generation this great movie ... This was my introduction to the opera and helped my understanding About Tolerance. Please ask the Gerswhins or Preminger family, release this classic soon!
