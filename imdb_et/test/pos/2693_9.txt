This is one of the most entertaining TV shows today. It hits 99% of the time. Usually after a couple of years after watching sitcom, the actors become comic as if they were trying to get the loved characters they were playing. These participants have, in my opinion, remained in their roles. Chemistry is still there, writing hasn't fallen, and I'm still waiting for it. Family dynamics still seems real, and after that time, there is still no way to seem to have the writers reach an empty bag trying to show it for another season. This is one of the few examples I look at to change the remote control in my hand quickly.
