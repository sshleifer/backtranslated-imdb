I'm not usually in a dark / psychological thriller. At the same time, the RECOMMENDATION OF THE GAME is really amazing work. The story, acting, filming, psychological issues, erotic quality and spiritual understanding are really quite complicated and convincing. Rose plays very precisely the complexity and shift of a psychologically disturbed woman. My partner was particularly impressed by the difficult way in which power exchange issues were exchanged. It was so intense that we watched that we found that we were leaving it for three quarters to get a "path" and I felt I had a shower. The story was thrilling, but we couldn't obviously handle all the energy with one straight shot. (It deepens on the bright and dark side of people, but doesn't leave you there). I thought for a long time about characters and deeper meanings. I highly recommend it. Be prepared for an experience that you may not expect.
