That day, I was one of the RNs in emergency, these roller skates landed from time to time. They were not well treated and some of them were brought about by their associative personalities, but we all knew they were a talented bunch of "wonderkids". I was afraid they deserved better care than they got. They were "attitudes" in spades. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I got this documentary from IFC tonight - it's back at 1 am and I look again! They were given little attention as long as the rich deadly child was able to tell their parents to drain the pool, and the movie really points out that as an attack point ... it was an amazing time and deserved to be saved. Stacy Peralta is praised for his praise, and for a long time these Z-Boysid memories and betting on roller skating can be a real sport. As for some of the "sour grapes" contained here, there have always been and always are "wannabees" and hangers who never do more than dream ... Z-boys lived it, breathed it. br /> <br /> Nice to see vintage movies and even a single girl "Peggy" who was so spoken as the only woman to win her respect. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the IFC, you can really take your youth's casual drug-free main trip and revitalize the heart's thrill.
