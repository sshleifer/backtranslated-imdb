A good, but not a big movie, "The Great Dictator" is Chaplin's first speaker. This is a good effort and sometimes a remarkable satire for Hitler, but unfortunately, the moments of Chaplin's glory here tend to use too much unnecessary dialogue. Yes, Chaplin, the silent master of the screen, simply uses too many words in this movie, and his tendency to write long speeches and non-dialogue parts is transferred to his other talkie films, such as (better) "Limelight". However, Chaplin was extremely brave even in making this film and his performance in two roles is definitely memorable. Paulette Goddard has no luminosity made in the "Modern Times" (his historical affair with Chaplin was cool), but he is always worth seeing and Jack Oakie just steals the rival of the exhibition as a dictator of Chaplin's famous creation, Hyn.
