If you have seen the Gill "Okkadu" telugu version, this story is very similar, but Gill has different songs and this is happening in Tamil Nadu, not in Andra Pradesh. Although it is a "Okkadu" remake, you will find that Vijay and Trisha make this unique film, Vijay and Trisha make a great pair. Some of the negatives were when Vijay's character strikes Trishas's character to buy her gifts, she never apologizes and still stays with her. Good activities and songs make this a great movie I recommend. <br /> <br /> I am giving it a 10/10, which is one of the best I've seen.
