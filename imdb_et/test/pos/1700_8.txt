I've never seen an "American werewolf in London", but this movie was a lot of fun. When I rented it, I thought it was a horror film, but it turned out to be a comedy with some horror. I thought the transformation sequences were nicely done, but wisely, the best scenes were those where the effects and lighting were built out of each other, nice. Transformations reminded me of many changes in werewolves in other films, but werewolves themselves are very beasts and not very dogs. Gore: I believe that there is too much in this movie that really takes off when there is blood in every frame, it is difficult to take violence seriously. <br /> <br /> J. Hurst (Grade 8)
