For years I have remembered the song "JUST A COUPLE IN A CASTLE" ("No twenty moonbeam square, just a couple in the air castle"). I couldn't find this song, but I remembered it was related to comic book errors. I found a reference to a movie on the web. I had seen a movie when I was only a 9-year-old Ligonier PA theater. I was glad to know that he was the singer Kenny Gardner Guy Lombaro (I'm a fan of Lombardo). And then to see that it was produced by Fleisher Brose, who made another very good full-length feature film, Gullivar's Travels (also remembered tenderly). The songs were also associated with Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser, one of the best. No wonder I remember a movie, song and colorful animation. As a complete music, this is a film to be remembered as one of the best early full-length musicals. Now that I remember it, the plot may not be a trembling of the earth, but it was very well presented and easily transformed into an abdimable movie.
