I originally saw the Flash Gordon series on PBS and thought it was fun and awesome, I ignored the special effects of rocket ships with sparklers and the big dragon monster with lobster candles, who care that it is 1936. so each week they would show a new chapter, Buster Crabbe played three times in Gordon, in all three series. In 1939 he played Buck Rogers, in 1933 he played Tarzan, who was fearless. It was a very busy actor. sexy dale Arden.frank Shannon as Professor Zarkov and Charles Middleton played evil in some mercilessness. Darth Vader looks like boyscout. The series were very close to Alex Raymond's comic strip. not to talk about guns and television. It stands out as the best serial release. The following flash game Gordon's route to Mars is 2 chapters longer, the next light Gordon captures the universe in only 12 chapters. mongo .., hawk-men, lion-men, shark-m et.function version leaves shark-men scenes out. for full effect you must see the full serial.i heard George Lucas was inspired by flash Gordon when he star wars.flash Gordon was a universal studio.and the music soundtrack is many universal movies like Bride Frankenstein, werewolf London, Drakula's daughter, etc., even nowadays rejoices Gordon continues to young and old people 10 out of 10.
