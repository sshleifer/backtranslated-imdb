The first time I saw "Alice in Wonderland? X-rated Musical Comedy", which was in the early 1980s, N.Y. City cinema with friends. I remember we really enjoyed it, even though we left to wonder why all the "good" were covered with various forms of colored patches and why the film suddenly jumped from one scene to the next, leaving us a clue ... what we just missed. Obviously this was a soft-edited (chopped) version that left me willing to see it again soon, but in its original comprehensive version. Well, for more than 20 years, during which I forgot about this movie and just a few days ago, when I accidentally bumped, I used this heavily used VHS copy (which had seen better times: a little wash colors, scratched sound and some bugs) but i guess what? This is the original uncut version and this time I really had a ball! Humor, musical and porn may seem like an uncomfortable combination, but in that case it really works and most likely the vast majority of the boring porn movies that are invading our screens today are really amusing and entertaining sex fantasies that won't deceive you. Direction is smart, fast editing makes the movie like a bird, all the familiar characters are loved or just funny, all the actors look good, the songs are memorable (worth mentioning "growing") sang Alice at the beginning of the movie and fun "What a nice girl like you in such knight like this "), dance numbers are well choreographed and staged (amazingly energetic Terry Hall proves that he can also" dance "and enthusiastically dance his courage ... Don't worry, he does what he was best known for. .), actor, singing, set, costumes are high quality and then ... Kristine "Blue Eyes" DeBell, in her first career role (and boy!) She really has some HC sequences! Personally, I think they are not absolutely unpleasant, on the contrary, they are spontaneous and quite irritating. She is young and (ohh!) So beautiful; With her new friends in wonders, she discovers her body and sexuality, she sings, she dances and ... what are you waiting for? She is also testing sex! The final order, when he finally loves his boyfriend, is exceptionally well photographed and directed, and this is the highlight of the film. I think his "physique du role" (innocent blue eyes and exciting smile) and his ability to act make these clear sequences more acceptable and actually enjoyable. There is a lot of sex in this (Wonderland) and everyone seems to be "busy" with the first busy boy or girls, which means a lot of hard action. On the other hand, there are some close-ups that are clearly "spliced", just to make "porn truths" really happy, a bit superfluous for my personal taste. Generally, however, sexual activity is not offensive because it is dealt with with a great deal of humor and it blends smoothly with music, dances and comedy. If you think that you and your partner can deal with graphic sex, look at it together. Take my word, then you have a good hour and a half (maybe extra extra steps ...) This is "Adult Entertainment" so be careful not to leave this video around with other kids videos. If your 10-year-old can get it, he may be entertained, but forced to offer embarrassing explanations as to why Alice behaves quite differently from what she showed or watched on Disney video in a red Lewis Carroll novel. I bet you won't forget it very quickly. It is a real shame that they no longer do it ...! I'll give him 10 out of 10.
