not really sure what to do with this movie. very weird, very artistic. not the kind of movie you look at because it has compelling plots or characters. more like a movie that you can't watch because the screen is terribly exciting. although for the first time I watched it not, she couldn't do it ... too distracting. takes a bit long but despite those who are interested in very dark films.
