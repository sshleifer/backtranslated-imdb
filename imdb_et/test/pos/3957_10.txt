"The Dark Place" is one of my festival favorites. I was completely interested in three strangers who were looking for a mysterious man who loved and betrayed each of them differently. The cast is great. James Franco is especially amazing as a broken boy from Los Angeles. The items in his magazine that we hear in voice transmission work well with visuals and are quite intense. The film has a powerful style. It pushes elements like the road and revenge drama into new directions. He also plays time and perspective in a way that scares the frightening atmosphere of lost love. Many sequences have a dreamy quality and the images are saturated with tension. Weird. Suspicious. Beautiful look. Definitely worth seeing. I really would like to see it again. I regularly check whether the blind spot is divided. I can't wait to watch the movie again on the cinema or DVD. <br /> <br /> Davide Pepe 13/08/2005 Bologna - Italy
