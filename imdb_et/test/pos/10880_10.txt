This is my favorite game on the Nintendo 64 platform. I've played many different first-person shooters and I've never really liked them, but there is a definite thing in this game that I can't put on, so it's an amazing amount. Perhaps this game is an extraordinary detail. Perhaps it is the liquid of the characters. Maybe it's gadgets and weapons. Perhaps this is the character of James Bond. Whatever it is, this game never seems to be old, no matter how many times I've played it.
