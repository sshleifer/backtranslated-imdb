I saw "Sweeney Todd" in Broadway in 1980. He celebrated George Hearn and appeared in most of the other cast principals who appeared in a national tour company video that was shot for television in Los Angeles in 1982. Release of Los Angeles output, although I have been in the video for years. Production and performances would hardly have been better, but the original tape time showed that the quality of both sound and video is below modern standards, even on recently pressed DVDs. Nonetheless, I will give another 10 out of 10 because the work is great and the amazing performance of George Hearns and Angella Lansbury. Even today, my most memorable memory of a live musical theater performance is the editing of Hearn's "These are my friends". "You drip rubies," brrr.
