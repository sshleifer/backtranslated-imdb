From the last awful Astérix movie and the fact that we only get the Swiss version of German in cinemas, I went to look at it quite a bit of fear ... wrong because I was happy to discover ^ ____ ^ <br / The movie is funny and modern gags, good animation, amusing interaction, good sounding (note: I can only speak German for german!), except for Abbey of the Vikings head (her name is great, despite not being very inspired by the voice of the actor) ... <br /> <br /> I just liked Justforkix (Goudurix in French, Grautvornix in German ...). He has a very amusing image of a citizen; but it is very nice, despite the teenagers ... XD Astérix & Obélix and their youngsters are fantastic and fun. <br /> <br /> It should not be compared to old movies, because this one is quite different ... What surprisingly doesn't do it bad. On the contrary. When they tried to modernize the last movie (twelve years ago), they blew it completely. However, this movie proved that it can be done easily ... ^ - ^ <br /> <br /> I came from the theater happily ... Always a good sign ^ _ ~
