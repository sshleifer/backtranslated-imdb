I rented this movie without hearing about it (or reading it). What a shame! This movie is intelligent, witty, fun, fast paced and realistically ridiculous. Characters can evolve without relying too much on clich√©, tired stereotypes. It was a refreshing look. I couldn't think that marketing would have helped to pull this non-mainstream movie into hungry-for-intelligent comedy. The quality of the dialogue and how easily the participants are so rare during the enormous inconvenience, heartache and comedy implementation are so rare. How is it that the National Treasure was for the first time in a box office for three weeks - it is so weak to mention. I think I'm just happy to make movies like "Vision .." somewhere out there.
