Leadership is brilliant, pain is remarkable (though I would have loved seeing a little more of Aaron Lustig (Y & R's fame) who played Paul Shaffer). I only have two little smiles about the film, as they are. One-Roebuck's Leno is great, but his state of play (i.e., when the episodes of one of his late shows appears) is surprising. Two - Spreading the Wrong Language. I'm ready to endure the unpleasant language as long as it's not used for free and somewhat, the movie was free. The language seemed to be used as a tool that reduced Bates' otherwise well-depicted Kushnick's sins when he used it often, and served Roebuck's Leno for good benefits due to lack of it (of course, if the characters behaved like that, bowed to everyone). However, the piece is great for television and video. I feel that this film had a big screen, but I would have demanded a bit bit selection and probably a second director (aesthetic feeling is Larry Sanders exhibition, good for HBO, mediocre for cinematographic purposes).
