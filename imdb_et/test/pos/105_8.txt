For a moment, set aside the cultural aspects of this film, even if it is a very important aspect of it, and let's just look at it as a very nice love story. Two people find themselves in a difficult situation caused by two selfish men. They have to live through their sad days without hopes. If each of these two women had been alone, imagine what life should have been adopted. They found each other and they fell in love. This love was almost irrelevant to all these social, religious, and cultural laws. They loved each other, found relief with each other, it was enough. The reaction of the people around them is just a small fact that they have to accept, suffer, and then they can continue their lives, their lives. Very nice.
