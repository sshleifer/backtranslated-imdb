Uzumaki is a visually stunning Film, and I don't think anyone can claim it. But, unfortunately, the story goes down somewhat. <br /> <br /> The movie is still a lot of fun. He uses a somewhat non-existent story to tell the wild style. The film works almost exclusively on the basis of its characters and style, but I think it leaves something unwanted.
