Obviously, the B movie ... B must stand for better performance and better message when we get a "A" picture in a big budget today. Modern-day movies for young women are certainly not meant to encourage the character to deep soil intrusive behavior ... or to increase the self-esteem of young girls who do not meet "feminine" standards. (After all, counterfeit and flashy, like this film, does not help to sell more products that depend on girls *, so they are not happy with their natural qualities or inner beauty.) <br /> <br /> Laraine's Day is Like a Mechanical inclined tomboy, who "limits" to the rooms and admits he can't flirt. He associates Robert Cummings with similar interests, a common sense of humor and honesty, loyalty and good friendship, which he gradually values ​​his own selfish glamor-sister (who only brings out his own selfish, careless playboy tendencies). <br /> <br /> Although Laraine is externally beautiful, it is refreshing to see more value in inner beauty and a true friendship that leads to the most complete romantic relationships. I want young girls (and boys) to get this message today. <br /> <br /> Maybe when Hollywood returns to B-movies with modest budgets and tries to have content with modest profits ... what am I saying? Instead of sacrificing the mindset to create something less sincere, it would be like a man who gives up sex with a sweet girl who really cares for her. It's crazy talking. Please, somebody is already inventing the time machine! I'm in 1940. <br /> <br /> I appreciate this movie higher, but the end is a bit too steep and perhaps there was not enough indication of Robert Cummings' heart change. (I like B-films being short and delicate, not swollen and self-conscious, but it might have taken more than 70 minutes.) It was also somewhat unrealistic for the widow and toddlers to be so affected by sudden death in their family ... or be so forgiving is the one who caused it. I think I think it is * nice * but a little more grieving or bitterness would have been only natural. Perhaps it is a deliberate choice to make this family act easy to lose in order to reduce the impact of the tragedy and make sure we * forgive those who are dead - because it is anyway the plot device, not the actual point of the movie. Still weird.
