Okay, I just admit that Loony Tunes's cartoon cartoons are quite offensive and I understand why Warner Brothers has taken them off the market. Today, the incredibly dirty and very stereotypical Inki is not politically correct. But the cartoons were well done and it is a shame that they will not be released with any explanatory prologue (such as Leonard Maltin, accompanied by some recent politically wrong Donald Duck caricature recently released on DVD). In other words, throwing out caricatures is to forget our history. In addition, Inki, Little Black Sambo and other racist cartoons exist, especially on the Internet. <br /> <br /> This Ink comic is our little hero hunting. At first, she runs a cute little robber, but later on she happens to be lucky by the lion - a lion that makes her over for dinner. But all of this is a weird Minah ... and finally you see why this bird is so important to the story. <br /> <br /> Cute, well done and smart. I like Ink cartoons. In addition, I am delighted to show them to extremely thin liberal friends to see if they have apoplectic and even heart attacks. Fun fun, people!
