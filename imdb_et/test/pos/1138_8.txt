Ten years before the healing of "The Matrix" and "Nad Live", this magnificent small-scale science fiction film was made. If you like the bizarre, unusual, intellectual challenge, David Lynch answers John Carpenter's style of movie that you love "Split". Design and cinematography are true geniuses. Look carefully at the opening of the artistic opening through the glasses of the wine and then immediately the scene containing the smart cards. The plot includes a man named Starker who lives outside of society who wants to dream of forgetting us. Like "They Live", "1984", and "Matrices", this is based on the assumption that all of us are constantly monitored by the shadowy Big Brother-type government agents who know everything about us and have invisible robot probes that patrol the city constantly. All this appears quite early on the plot. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Starker has invented a drug that, when placed in a water supply, awakens everyone from the illusion of reality. In addition to cinematography and the casual way the director makes his own shoe games budget, the other monologues of this film are featured. I am challenging anyone not to repeat, to remember and to quote the classic quotes of this film in the coming years.
