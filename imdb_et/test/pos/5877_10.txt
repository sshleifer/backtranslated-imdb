This great 40-year-old post-war classic tends to ignore them <br /> <br /> days. When it appeared in 1945, it was cleaned up at the Oscars in 1946, mainly at the expense of "It's a wonderful life". Both films were the best films, the best <br /> <br /> directors and the best actors. Frederic March, <br /> <br /> and Dana Andrews with Amateur Actor Harold Russell (<br /> <br /> Real Life Soldier Losing Both Hands in an Explosion), Playing <br /> <br /> Returning Soldiers , looking for life is very different from what they <br /> <br /> remember. Myrna Loy is a marvelous wife in March who has to keep her family together when she has been away. The tear jerking <br /> <br /> where March and Loy are reunited is great. All three men find that they have problems with post-war correction, not just with Russell, who comes with artificial hands and with his money <br /> <br /> (Cathy O'Donnell) is trying to be too helpful. Sam Goldywni is quoted as saying he doesn't care if the film does not make any money when everyone in America sees the movie, so they appreciate what these men went through. If any movie is worth 10 out of 10, that's it.
