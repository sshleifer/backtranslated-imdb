Perhaps it was inevitable that in the early 1980s, when slasher films were attacked, some good good could slip through the cracks. This is a big "rare" movie from Jeff Lieberman who secured his cult status with his memorable 1970s "Squirm" and "Blue Sunshine". <br /> <br /> Five young people go to the Oregon Mountains (this movie was actually shot) to do some camping and check out some of the land that one of them has acquired. Before long, they are being terrorized by a large number of killers with incredibly horrible shocking laughter. <br /> <br /> "Just before Dawn" is much more ambitious, "Arty" and intelligent than some movies. In reality, Lieberman polishes the characters - well, two of them - as much as the 90-minute film allows him. The film has real tensions and tensions, and in fact abstains from graphic gore, except for one who kills right from the start. <br /> <br /> There is a midfielder, including the Oscar winner George Kennedy, a woodcutter who is understandably slightly glowing because he has been alone in the wilderness for too long. Jack Lemmon's son Chris, future Brian De Palma regularly Gregg Henry, blonde headed by Deborah Benson (it's too bad he's not known as a performer, judging by his work), Ralph Seymour ("Ghoulies"), Mike Kellin ("Sleepaway Camp ") and Jamie Rose (" Chopper Chicks in Zombietown ") round off cast. <br /> <br /> Some pictures are interesting and the early music score is Brad Feidel (currently best known) for his "Terminator" theme is haunting and atmospheric. <br /> <br /> It is worth trapping with an important plot twist around the one-hour mark, although after about 75 minutes the hero and the tree and the killer are almost comic; it can really remind you of comics! One of the brightest touches is the final sending of the killer, which I have never seen in the horror film and will probably no longer see. <br /> <br /> I didn't give him 10 out of 10 because I can't honestly say I was scared. Nonetheless, this is an interesting split that deserves to be rediscovered. <br /> <br /> "This does not mean anything, son. These mountains can't read." <br /> <br /> 9/10
