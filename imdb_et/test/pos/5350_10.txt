In 1989, Aardman Animations introduced two major pairs at The Grand Day Out. In 1993, they fought the wrong penguin in the wrong pants. And in 1995, they had to save the sheep from the evil robot dog by shaving A-Shave. In 2005, they are back and they are going to fight something that had been in the past in a cute and strange way. In this full-length feature film, Wallace and Gromit work on the pest control business in Anit-Pest. There's giant plant competition, but rabbits eat vegies from their neighbors. Wallace and Gromit take care of this problem. But Wallace had an idea. He rinses the bunnies with his machine. After that, something is suddenly eaten by all the neighboring vegetables and it is great. This is Wallace and Gromid's task to save the day. As a fan of these two characters, I was impressed. He kept what the three previous chapters had to do, and instead of adding a lot of Hollywood actors to voice transmissions, they put their names and boys in the name, they did a fantastic job. Wallace and Gromit have not changed. Wallace is still a cheerful freak, as she always was, and Gromit is a quiet newspaper reading dog. Also, the script was not too shabby, like other family movies. There is one who really is a rabbit. The direction of Nick Park (head of the previous three chapters) is doing a great job with the tide. Instead of adding a Hollywood formula, he simply took the style of the previous chapters and added some dark fantasy to it. Well done, Nick. Rabbits are also funny and divine, but the funniest rabbit in the movie is the one with the Wallace mixture. The characters were not bad and they were not annoying, but they would never be Wallace and Gromiti. Animation is really fantastic and wonderful. I've never seen a clay-animated movie that is so amazing about Chicken Run. In general, fans of two great films (including teenagers) love this fantastic movie. This is a well-made film that should be awarded the Oscar next year. Hooray, Wallace and Gromit. 10/10
