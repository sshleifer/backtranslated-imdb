For those who appreciate the intersection of silent cinema and social commentary, this is a unique film. Partially respectful of German expressionism, part of the allegory, the film is full of visual symbolism and artistic style that rival something from the 1920s. Moreover, stunning attention is a tool for promoting periodic details and the visual composition of scenes as a story. In addition, the plot offers an interesting commentary on the role of the media in society and its impact on social voice, perception and opinion. Indeed, it is not so quiet that goes through the film, because it is the loss of voice and the loss of words in communication and thinking that inevitably follows. All in all, this movie is often not visible and the film producer said it in Q&A following it and leaves you with an idea of ​​its meaning the next day.
