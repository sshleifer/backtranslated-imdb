Funny funny comedy, the best director is Oz Scott. The list of eighteen TV icons continues and continues. Milan (who is a boss), mothers (family ties), stone (Mr. Belvedere), Robinson (night court), Jackee (227), D'abo (Wonder Years), Walston (Mr. Hand !!!). This is one of the funniest movies. Big lines, pointless subplots, cheesy, bad behavior. This is a group of high school kids who have to undergo drivers ed. The Night Court Mac needs them to complete their final exam or is fired. Brian Bloom's excellent results as a jerk / kinda cool man Riko Conner, but there is nothing compared to B.D. Wongi Kiki (pronounced kee-chee). A great movie of all ages, so bad it is good.
