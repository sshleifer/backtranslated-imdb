I am a big fan of Rupert Everett. I adore Kathy Bates that when I saw it, I decided to review it. The synopsis didn't tell you much. In some parts it was stupid, touching and in other parts was hysterical right. (Of course, there are many, but that's the point) <br /> <br /> If you like an actor, he won't look too dramatic, it's fun. <br /> <br /> I could mention that you see how Rupert is long. I thought I knew he was 6'4 ", but it seems that this movie is even more. He even seemed to be a little worshiped in this sense. The fans are an empty chest scene ... WONDERFUL!
