It is always a good feeling if the film sends the goods if you did not expect it. Dead Children / Bowery Boys found themselves in many uneven films and usually played a better role than Angels With Dirty Faces. Here is their presence associated with the murdered boxer story, giving them plenty of time on the screen without disrupting their core business. <br /> <br /> John Garfield is a lightweight heavyweight master Johnny Bradfield, Southpaw hitter who is much different from what he portrays the sports world and the press. When a newspaper reporter accidentally learns that Johnny is a party-loving female buyer, his plan in the column for this information interrupts the whiskey bottle by Johnny's head, Doc Ward (Robert Gleckler). Doc, in turn, talks to Johnny's girlfriend Goldie (Ann Sheridan) to leave with him in order to avoid legal trouble in dealing with the reporter's death. As both flee, the police chase in the fiery car wreck and Doc's body is misidentified as the Johnny gold watch he wore. <br /> <br /> Claude Rains receives Edward G. Robinson. t quite a working detective who has been relocated to the details of a mortuary a year ago after bad arrest. His character is Monty Phelan, and he has a pretty good momentum that the body in the car accident wasn't Johnny. He destroys his boss to hand over a closed case to him and is given the task of getting him out of the city and out of the way. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Johnny is looking for advice from his lawyer and winds up being screwed even worse when he gets most of his ten thousand dollar savings. On the way to the cross, Johnny Rancho Rafferty Date comes up on the Farm in Arizona, led by the harsh Granny Rafferty (May Robson). The farm is the legacy of the grandmother's brother, the dead priest of Brooklyn, and is now the home of a farm working on the farm. Billy Halop is the boys' nominee leader, and his sister Peggy (Gloria Dickson) becomes Johnny's romantic interest, now going to Jack Dorney's name. <br /> <br /> I get a kick out of the historical perspective of films from these pre-war ages. If Johnny and the guys fly to the farm truck happily, then they will fill the gas station for $ 1.28! Tommy (Halop) gets the idea that an on-farm petrol station would be a good way to earn extra money, and with that idea, Jack Dorney decides to take a stock marketer offering $ 500 to anyone who can stay with him. Clich√©d's assumption is somewhat side by side with Jack out in the fifth round, but by that time he has earned enough to give the fruit-growing company a chance to fight. Perhaps Grandmother Rafferty should have been in the ring, she just took out everyone sitting around her around the rings. As Johnny / Jack goes into the locker room, Detective Phelan is ready to take him in custody. Knowing that he can redeem his reputation with this necklace is whether Phelan is arrested by his arrest - you have to watch a movie to find out. <br /> <br /> I like dead end movies for which Leo Gorcey is responsible, but he doesn't have much to do here. However, he makes a big movie for the ticket taker at the boxing gate. Another idea - wouldn't it be nice if the pictures on the wall of the priest had been Pat O'Brini's pictures? <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a pretty good entrance to both John Garfield and Dead End Kids filmography, and is entertaining for five hours and a half. If there is one downside, there is not enough time for Ann Sheridan. The film may have been even more satisfying when the roles of Sheridan and Gloria Dickson were reversed because the screen chemistry between Dickson Peggy and Jack seemed more natural.
