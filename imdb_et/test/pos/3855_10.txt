This is one of my favorite Disney movies. It has everything you could expect in Disney animation: cute animals, great songs, nasty frog and lots of adventure. The story begins in Paris, where the aristocratic Duchy and his three kittens live with the manor in the manor. Life is perfect for them, until Edgar finds out that he is going to leave all his fortune on cats. She realizes that if she can even predict a fortune, the cats are away. A great, often forgotten masterpiece from the 1970s - a time when Disney's studio made a few animations - songs such as the title number "Aristocats" and "Ev'rybody Wanna Be A Cat", fascinating viewers young and old, with persistent jazz.
