Reiterates the darkness. Director Alejandro Amenabar creates life against all odds based on a true story version that one person struggles with controlling his destiny. Great Javier Bardem is interesting to look at his role in Ramon. His eyes and head movements leave no doubt what is happening in his mind. The dream and fantasy sequences are not used so that they prove to be very effective in explaining why he wants what he wants. Instead of forcing us to answer the question of euthanasia, the real question is what is love? Every time we see in love people looking for love or dying to be loved. The script is tight and keeps the movie moving despite being mostly shot in one room. Supporting casting is great and we really feel their pain and how each family member deals with Ramon. It's a pearl and deserves to be seen.
