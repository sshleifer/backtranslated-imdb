My husband and I loved this movie. At first, my husband was skeptical and asked how many points he could get through it. But after some of the main scenes she was completely sucked and finally she was convinced that it was one of the best films. Kathleen Bates is never so loving and the rest is just fantastic. Thank you for this beautiful movie.
