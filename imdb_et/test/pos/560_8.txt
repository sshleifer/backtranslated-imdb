This is an extraordinary film. The courthouse drama, it is persuasive when accused of the American legal system. For Brenton Butler, the consequences of this system can be devastating. This film highlights the fundamental shortcomings of the legal process, that it does not mean the detection of guilt or innocence, but rather of the one who is better in court. Indeed, the consequences of this case go beyond what the innocent person has been convicted or guilty of. Every citizen has the right to justice, whether he is a criminal or victim. But do they get it? The film is well paced, undervalued and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.
