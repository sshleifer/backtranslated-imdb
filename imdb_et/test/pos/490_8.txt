Okay, this movie is a little hacked on the side. Comics make it difficult to take notes and put them in movies of any reliability (Dolph Lundgren as The Punisher, anyone?), But it's trying very hard. I've never read the actual comic, but it's not really important. I mainly meet the film about my advantages, not whether it is a faithful retelling of someone else's idea. (If the film is not based on a true story that requires at least some truth and precision.) Why do I give this film a rather high rating? Because it's trying. It is trying very hard. In my book, which makes it a fair test for an entertaining film. <br /> <br /> Many films are made with a vampire, which is the main focus. Everyone seems to have a vampire story, be it cross, silver, garlic, aversion to sunlight. Some of these ideas are here. The story is a familiar ... a group of vampires who together embrace the world, with one person (mostly) standing on their way. Blade (Wesley Snipes) lives only to destroy the vampire masses who have moved slowly but surely in the world, and to share it with humanity. Humanity is mostly blind that vampires are around them. Vampires are even familiar, people who want to be vampires and do vampire dirty work to show how worthy they are finally "turned". <br /> <br /> Now that I mean, there are many elements in this movie that resemble the style of Roddy Piper's movie "Live". A hidden enemy, a hidden group of people who draw against them, a fight to save human nature ... all that is in Blade. <br /> <br /> Actress is not the best here. Snipes is, at best, just a little better than some of his roles; Relative newcomer N'Bushe Wright is not too bad; Kris Kristofferson is forgotten as Blade's Sidekick (he is the Bladesse by Chip on The Punisher). Stephen Dorff does the best work here, because the "head" vampire you just love to hate. <br /> <br /> I don't know, but I just loved the special effects of this movie. Blood-soaked vampire-style rave, until the inevitable struggle in the film finals, the special effects are not half-bad. There's definitely enough blood and gore to go around, but after all, it's a vampire movie, right? The different forms and types of Blade Blade are quite unique and are generally not used in modern movie films. Snipers have more sharpness when they are covered with a sword when they make a machine. In addition, there is so much thought that it will go to the blade if one blows. (Unless, of course, you're not Indiana Jones.) <br /> <br /> Generally, this is not the best thing ever done, but it's also not half-bad. As a bonus, the musical result and sound are also pretty cool. Tell me in which other movies can you hear super drum'n'bass like Source Direct or Photek?! <br /> <br /> My Rating: 8/10
