Great book, great movie, great soundtrack. Frank Sinatra in this movie shows that if he wants to work, he can act. The end is a bit schmaltzy, but by the time it is understandable, the studio wanted a happy ending. The graphical nature of the heroin addiction (a breakthrough in the period) is a plus. Add a great soundtrack and you have one big American movie.
