Cocky nurses play chicken with a process that simulates death, trying to get (hopefully temporary) life views. Certain plot twists and threads are little characters and occasionally overhead. But the underlying message - about the forgiveness of God and others for our true or perceived sins - is positive and unique in the cinema, and it is very good. The last sequence between Julia Robert and her father has been so effective that years after I saw it, I can still think of chills. Highly recommended.
