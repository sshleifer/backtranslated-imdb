I saw it last night and I laughed loudly across the film. The whole audience was. Bruce Campbell has made a fucking funny movie! I don't want to give away anything, but when the movie changes and gets crazy, it really gets nervous. Only one funny scene after another. My caps for Mr Campbell and his team to pull it out with a small budget. Bruce was introducing the film and making Q and A, which was treatable. Many of the questions people asked were pretty flat, but Bruce turned around and would be all sarcastic. He was great! Anyway, he loved the movie. Waiting for this DVD later this year. B Check it on the Sci-Fi channel in the fall. I highly recommend it.
