"Nobi" or "Plains on the Plain" is a movie that is so great on so many levels that it can't say good enough. My only regret is that I couldn't see this 1959 movie before. <br /> <br /> Being a movie-squeezer, I tend to watch movies based on their artistic value based on dialogue, exhibitions, photography, and even effort to maintain a costume-related period. Ultimately, I want to know if the film is "true" to reveal the human situation to think of me without being told what the director wants me to think about. <br /> <br /> "Plains on Fire" is a great movie because it is a portrait filled with realistic human reactions to the dying fires of a great historical catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa's film is condemned at all levels - as every good war movie should be. War is terrible, bloody, destructive. It's also a murderous psychic. At the same time, the essence of the "fire plain" is that it is an unicorn look at Japanese soldiers. It slowly shows them the collapse of the higher American fire power and the inability of their people to accept their war. At the heart of this madness is the fatalistic fatalistic code that encourages death. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see such an honest and brutal look at the bitter fruit of Japanese military malpractice, which was only made 14 years after the end of what the Japanese call "Pacific War". Ichikawa shows what the Germans called "warfare", a difficult situation for a common soldier. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa's movie is interesting because even today, Japan has difficulty with its warfare fanaticism. , the subjugation of its conquering peoples, the fight against its war against China and war crimes, which included not only cannibalism against one another, but also the cannibalism of soldiers and officers practicing allied prisoners. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa produces a harsh representation of soldiers as a result of harsh political decisions and the collapse of cultural pressure. <br /> <br /> This harsh investigation has been made skilfully by depicting executed soldiers as people who exhibit fear at different times, superbly laconic humor, a dialogue enriched by its spiciness, and a plot whose complexity is intimidated by the gloomy desert. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa's portrait is a looted and painful craftsmanship. Tubercular Tamura, played by Eiji Funakoshi as a nervous and delicate soul, is a good soldier who cannot abandon his humanity, even though he is so frightened and lost as his comrades. Before leaving for the hospital, which rejects him as a whole, Tamura gives the boss a hand grenade who, in recognition of his hopelessness, suggests to kill himself. <br /> <br /> Why Tamura was hopelessly sick - at the beginning of the movie there was no commissioning and militarily impossible unit. Ichikawa makes it clear that war is over and everyone is waiting for death. When Tamura leaves her unit to look for her hopeless physical and mental salvation, she sees her companions digging an air strike. They look like dead bodies watching their mass graves. <br /> <br /> Later, we'll see hospital hospital staff give up on all kinds of American artillery flooding patients. Pathetic patients who crawl their homes without trying to survive seem to be pathetic, serpentine creatures who are pulling themselves into almighty power. You know they're not alive. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa makes it clear that the only thing worse than a lost army is what has lost its honor by giving up its humanity and its companions. When Tamura enters the Leyte jungle, we meet noble, dying and exploiting. Cannibalism grows with its ugly head, as soldiers begin to eat each other rather than give up American "grazed beef". <br /> <br /> When men talk about surrender, propaganda about how Americans kill prisoners is against the world. A soldier who shows that approaching Americans are eating and caring for prisoners of war because, unlike Japan, they respect bold soldiers who are forced to give up. <br /> <br /> The Japanese people are going to die for the emperor long after losing resistance. Those who are ready to fight death will be killed. It's a war calculator. <br /> <br /> After being murdered by a murderous and cannibalistic comrade whom he had previously offered for his food, the fatalistic Tamura delivery is also a deliberate form of suicide. His death is a lonely picture. Has Ichikawa tried to tell us about the internal conflict of a normal soldier who wants to live, but who is still abducting his people's suicide codes? <br /> <br /> If someone watches this movie carefully, see that absolutism and fanaticism are enemies. Americans are depicted as technologically advanced people who want to use this technology in the form of unusable military force - a lesson that changed Japan's post-war society. Ichikawa's film is not so low that it shows America. Ichikawa refers to the sedimentary layers of Japanese destructive policies that create war and then resume it when everything is lost. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa does not mention nuclear weapons that fell on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. He doesn't have to. Destruction of the slow motion of the imperial Japanese army in the Philippines reveals the seeds of Japan's resurrection.
