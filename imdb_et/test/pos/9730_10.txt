This is probably one of my favorites, although I have first and have seen Curse, Legacy and vs Demonic Toys. Only better than it is PM vs. DT. Curse is the worst in the series than the first and then its legacy. I suggest people see it and DT. Those who say it stinks are so wrong, the story is well written and it's a sweet movie. This is a classic film that even younger children can watch and not be as frightened as others see. Well, this is my review, you can call me Gipdac (its easy to know where it comes from: 101 dalmatian series, you can watch it on Toon Disney at 4:00 am). Oh, and don't laugh, I'm a man, you see more of my comments on time. If you want to know why I look at it? I'm 12! Advisory word: Is there a spiritual meal, arrrrroooooooooo! I also agree with you on motter-1, but why people like others are because they are more exciting than horrors, and because dolls are more beautiful. You can also call me Gipdac.
