I was born in '68, who didn't have much parental guidance, as far as I was watching on television (as a 70s child). I always loved this movie (and the French community) and I always try to catch it when it was (checking the Sunday TV guide ahead of time). I bought this on the DVD a few years ago and since then I've been watching it twice and I have to say I still love it !! Roy S. was a great actor in the 1970s (jaws are my all-time fans, a marathon man, etc.) and although the 7th is not an Oscar-worth movie, it puts you in the right place (NY in the early 1970s, as well as the French Community) ) and give you some difficult signs and glimpse at the time the police officer. And yes, chasing a car is one of the best.
