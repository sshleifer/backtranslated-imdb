Of course, when he looks at the other remarks made, it seems that many people haven't reached the flick. It doesn't focus on the place around zombies, because they are not really zombies at all, they are a regenerated device for scaring girls for death, its main focus is on Meg Tilly, who wants to stop him from the job he died in first place and what you get , have a great fun with a fantastic end, it's hard to find a video, but every time it appears to HBO or Cinamax, check it out, I gave it to 10 and I highly recommended it.
