This is a very modest, very cute movie with a great rating by Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser, which has an outstanding number, we are a couple of palaces that are a fiction of the whole period and come down to the Penthouse Serenade as an opening assumption (Hoppity coming) may be inspired by Fred Saidy and Yip Harburg (Woody's Coming) on ​​the Finian Rainbow six years later. I fully agree with those posters who have indicated that this is the name to which it has been added by Disney, but which has now reached the "classical" status, not the fallen neglect. It is strangely inventive, never more than when the items that the "real" world has barely noticed are of much greater importance - in the pro and insect world. In fact, it's classic, though small.
