I wanted to love this movie. Everything seemed to exist for an enjoyable, if not revolutionary, film. It was set in southern France, seeing good looking and recognizable actors, and I was wondering about truly lively African costumes, proverbs and music. Despite that, I didn't love it. Movies should convey their meaning at first viewing, but "Secret Laughter" does not. The name and Matthew, as Long and Firth played (each played romantic wires and had to feel better), radiated as much heat and passion as dried fish. I deliberately used "dried fish" because it was one of the few - too few - strong lines and moments that were scattered throughout the film. The other winner was when the Name hit Matthewi around his apartment. He finds his book with his first name, and says, "Your name is Name. I never knew." Then he demands that he call him by his Christian name. I watched this scene closely when Matthew asked the Name to say my name over and over, knowing that until that time they always called each other with their surnames. I thought it was a turning point in the film and expected it to improve. It wasn't. Why does it seem that the Name and Matthew are always ten steps, even when "tell my name" scene? What does Matthew's Name like, in addition to his obvious beauty? And why would a sensible woman like the Name fall to the author of a comic book that keeps her marriage as something she can keep, how beautiful an exotic "adventure" comes from? And I would like to add that it was a bit difficult for me to have a romance based on adultery. Yeah, Jenny's a sorcerer, but when I was in her shoes, but I would probably fit into my Cruella tactic to stop my husband from stalking. Believe it. The story hints at the name of a painful past, but it never fully explores it. Some critics say that Firth seemed a little uncomfortable here and I agree. Because of his good interests, the actor called for a more familiar longing and passion, like this snob of the early 19th century, Mr Darcy (and their nervous Britons)! As for Long, who was "shining with Love Jones", he seemed more focused on his accent than playing his character. Even so many moments? among them is "say my name"? when he was in complete control and at times very well. But "secret laughter" is not without redemption properties and I found that it grew more with me. Nene was well illustrated as supportive and well understood, even if she did not fully understand Moti Matti's interest. I loved it absolutely when Nene was facing Mama Fola's scenes of these duplicating proverbs. My husband liked it, and it is usually the first one who sighs and complains on the screen if he does not like what is happening. She even smiled at the scene when Sammy asked Matthew some very honest questions about sex. So you have it. "Secret Laughter" was good enough to recognize entertainment, like my husband, but as I am, it is a very keen moviegoer to need more than one look to evaluate what the director and writer were trying to convey.
