"Damn in the Dark" is William Shatner's favorite episode. This is also one of my favorite episodes. The program is a pure Star Trek because it deals with one of the core topics of the series: respect for other life forms. I don't think you could get a clearer example of one of the more interesting ideas in an exhibition. In this episode, Kirk and his team must face a monster that kills miners on a far planet. The story is an excuse to study the right that people must destroy beings that are an essential part of the environment. Today's concerns for environmental reasons make the exhibition more relevant than ever. Our beloved cast is very well written and delightful. One memorable sequence involves joining Spock with a monster. A lot of tension between Spock and Kirki (they want to solve the problem with different methods) adds fun. Shatner and Leonard Nimoy are doing their best work here.
