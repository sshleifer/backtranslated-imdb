The film, featuring Twins, Ekin Cheng and Edison Chen, shouldn't wait for a cinema masterpiece. But what you get is a fun movie that's easy for the eye and the brain. There are many Hollywood-style vampires (there are no Chinese bloodshed), girls, beautiful heroes and occasionally funny moments. And Jackie Chan. <br /> <br /> Of course, kung-fu relies heavily on wiring and CGI. Of course, the script reminds Blade. And, of course, the whole thing is instantly forgotten. <br /> <br /> But for a really enjoyable movie-fluffy piece, you'd better find it.
