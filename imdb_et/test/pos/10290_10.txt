I saw this movie again, I believe for the sixth time. No doubt I see it many times. This is one of the most brilliant French films ever made. Although the film is mysterious, what has happened to the writer and director Gilles Mimoun is still mysterious. For ten years she hasn't made another movie and it was her only one. The story and performance of this brilliant film is perfect, and it is clearly respected by both Hitchcock and Buster Keaton. At the second time of the moves, the same care is taken as a scene where the side of the house falls on the Steamboat Bill Junior for Keaton and is not killed only in customs. In this film, people bow and rotate unevenly, and if they had gone away for a second, they would collide. Thus, the aim is to reduce the occurrence of accidental events to such an intense level that you can not take your eyes off the screen even in milliseconds or leave something important. Peter Chase's haunting, though deliberately repetitive, music reminiscent of Hitchcock's Vertigo, and the entire film has the same etheric quality, but although Hitchcock had one woman with two women, Mimoun has two women, one of whom is a woman, thus turning two women. plot structure. There are references to other Hitchcock films, but it's Vertigo, which is at the heart of this film's inspiration. The theme may seem superficial to be obsessive love, but the film is really the magic of the events of daily opportunity, the invisible threads that are behind the carpet. Everything is highly accused of passionate love and desire, but the desire goes beyond that goal and fights behind and behind the goal. That's why it is so easily transferable to Alice Alice when it is understood that Alice is more mysterious than Lisa, and that is Alice who truly embodies the eternal secret. Finally, the movie Romane Bohringer. He is so excited that he expresses Monica Bellucci, which is really something to be pulled out, since Bellucci is a fallen beauty, while Bohringer is what English is called easy. However, even at this early date, Romane Bohringer was more than a "personality domination" art, where beautiful girls fell and did not notice, because the Romans are so excited that you can't take your eyes off long enough for pretty girls to look at . Most of us remember that I'm sure his father, Richard Bohringer, is in the opera Diva many years ago. I would look at Romane rather than Richard in the bath tub, but it seems to be exciting because Richard Bohringer is also enchanting and not even a woman. The Romans look like she can become Anna Magnan if she is a lot older, and that means she gets an Oscar if someone can write another "Rose Tattoo" for her. She has so much passion inside her that she could put on the Seine fire. Wouldn't it be nice if he and Julie Delpy knew? This movie was a great place for Paris. But where is this "square in Luxembourg"? It looked like a place in Furstenburg. Maybe I miss something. I have to watch the movie six more times, just to look at the timing accuracy and who brush the past, and make sure I'm right. The whole thing is like the ten giant simultaneous chess games that the grandmaster played in the dark. How exciting it is! Romanes, you can watch your window at any time! Mimouni, come over, we discuss the impossibility, the unlikely, the accidental, the synchronicity, everything that happens, what is invisible and how it affects the visible. And once again, we have the spirit of the Breton novel Nadja, embodied in a great French artwork. More! More! More!
