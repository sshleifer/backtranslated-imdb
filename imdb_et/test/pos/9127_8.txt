LE CERCLE ROUGE is a very good film, although it suffers a bit because similar movies have already taken place. In too many ways, the film resembles earlier films such as RIFIFI and GRAND SLAM and many others. So, while the director Melville and the actors did great jobs, it all seems to be the case of Déjà vu. That's why it was very difficult for me to give this magnificent film a higher score. <br /> <br /> One of the unusual aspects of a movie is how the attacks get together. Instead of the usual tools, Vogel escapes from prison and just meets Corey, a career penalty who has just been released from prison! Both are good matches, but both of them work in parallel with a large part of the movie until they meet, a smart touch. In addition, as expected, a large part of the film concerns the details of the planning and execution of the crime. I also appreciated how the film showed teasing in both cold and isolated ways - something relatively common in French criminal films, but rare among American films over recent years. <br /> <br /> In general, extremely well-designed and worth seeing ... if you don't mind it seems to be repetitive, you will see some exquisite action, direction and a lot of tension.
