A pretty stupid little movie you just love. <br /> <br /> Although it is sometimes a rhinitis and a cliche, it still works and makes good clean fun. Five teams are engaged in hunting predators and fighting with each other and their abilities to win the whole night - just because of the joy "is your best team." <br /> <br /> There are several screen debuts, including David Naughton's first film role after his dr. Pepper "Be a Pepper" and before his big 1981 hit "American Werewolf in London". Paul Ruebens is also in his first Pee Wee Herman-esquire roll before he learned about it. And last but not least, Mr. Spin City and Alex Keaton himself, Michael J. Fox, will get his first film role here. Fans remember Stephen Furst from animal life. There are no names outside, but all the funny characters. <br /> <br /> Doubts that he has ever made on a DVD, but there are still some VHS copies that are floating around and maybe even late, late to show sometime. If you do, it's worth a look. You can hate it, but it can also become a peculiar little movie you love.
