One of the most pleasant aspects of watching a movie is the loss of a movie. In order to wash it all over you so you can accept it and experience it completely. Every time I see it, "Egyptian" is such a movie. Over the years, it is the image critics who have loved hate. Many have their weak spots thrown away. But perhaps it is because of the tone that the film brings, not its most obvious qualities. It is forbidden, far away, perhaps dangerous; Beware of what's on! The haunting chords of the music on the 20th Fox logo guide us to the turquoise stars of other worlds. <br /> <br /> Strange! Archaeological! Decadent! Just as if we were going down some antiquity, where there could be big treasures mixed with insecure dangers. (You can imagine Darryl Zanuck telling you, "Make it ancient!" <br /> <br /> Hollywood's 'Ten Commandments' from the mid-1950s depicted the spirits of civilization, the phenomenal "pharaoh lands" of their nuts and bolts, while "Egypt" shows it all, from a glamorous tragedy to wondering. There is not much to say about players, but I think Bella Darvi will be redeemed over time. What a perfect face to the role, just under the symbolic painting. If he does not want to do something, it can be argued that in his role as a "duty" he is clearly in bed better than some poor helpless admirers. I think Curtiz struck her sado-masochistic relationship from the character of Edmund Purdom, censorship being what it was. Sir Peter Ustinov, in his memoirs, was quite kind to "Egypt", writing that it was "as lost in the great Aida". His pronunciation of the word "beer" I've ever taken. (One of the film's historically accurate references: Egyptian invented beer!) Henry Daniell, egads, the perfect result. Gene Tierney, the treasure of the screen. Bless DFZ for this "late" role. C'mon folks, don't be so tired Victor Mature! He's the son of a cheese producer! Who rose to Pharaoh! It seems like a unique American opportunity. One of the best moments: John Carradine's existential observations of the sand of time. And Purdom's speech is living outside the world at sunset. If this is not a class A epic, what is it? <br /> <br /> Of course, with everything else, music is sublime. It has often been observed that Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann created the most weighty points on one screen, which are perfectly harmonious, but each theme is well developed and alive. Newman, pressed for DFZ, called in Herrmann someone whom he could indirectly trust to take over half of the load. <br /> <br /> Benny, not the easiest man to work with, obviously respected Newman enough to really offer inspiring music. They alternated with clues, a brilliant approach. There is no spoiler about who did it, but Benny brings with him an edge, mysterious, awesome sound. Alfred brings perfection, longing, joy. Both are epic. Even when you look at the pressed TV edition, seeing the names of the two composers on the main credit is next to what the ultra-wide anamorphic screen fits comfortably, is vertebrate. <br /> <br /> CinemaScope Dean Leon Shamroy will not let us here. Green green and moody shadows (most likely distortions seen in terrible TV publications over the years) are perfectly accompanied by a multi-dimensional script (by Philip Philipne and Wy vet Casey Robinson, who must be accompanied by up to 20 by Curtiz). What is remarkable is that Shamroy, who was as much a filmmaker as Fox as a musician, would be a "Cleopatra" lens a few years later, but in brighter, 60s Todd A-O images. These old studio friends are my heroes. <br /> <br /> Who wants to be outraged by all the shortcomings and criticisms of such a picture? I rather give my spell and immerse myself in the richness of the sea to create an inspiring "End" update that is refreshed, moved and hungry more. <br /> <br /> And yes, we should cry for 20-Fox for a DVD release worthy of DFZ's legacy.
