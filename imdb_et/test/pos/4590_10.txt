We saw this movie in Austin, Texas, on Alamo South Lamar yesterday afternoon. I had a lot of laughs a lot! The scene of Albert Einstein's thoughts on humanity struck me over and over and I couldn't finish laughing. It's too bad that there's no more in theaters, I know a lot of friends who die to watch this movie! "Welcome to Costco, I love you." ... great work for everyone involved! Also, if you see it, be sure to stay on credit! I'll take my family to see it at the weekend! If you're a fan of OFFICE SPACE and BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD, then you have to watch this movie. It's classic and nobody knows it's over! So if you're in the mood for something funny at the weekend, be sure to check it out.
