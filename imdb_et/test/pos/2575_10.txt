I really think this movie deserves some Oscar! I really don't care what people say badly about this movie ... because it's really well played parts from Samuel L. Jackson and mostly Christina Ricci !! I'm his big fan because I saw him in Addams Family ... trying to look at all the things he does, and it's absolutely one of the best parts he played! I love his appearance (though people say he's not quite ... I think he's ... and I love his eyes)! There are a lot of things in the movie ... people say it's religious ... people say it's racism ... people say it's drugs ... people say it's nymphomania ... well. .. maybe there is a bit of it all! But what I really feel is that this film has a big eye-opening, what the blues is ... what it means ... and mainly when it comes from: life ... heart ... pain ... sadness ... and above all ... spontaneous feelings! I hope you see it ... if you are a person who likes a movie not only about pictures or the story he is talking about ... it's a good movie to see ... if you are not ... well ... look it anyway ... cant hurt so much and you will see Christina Ricci, who works so horny! She's a fox!
