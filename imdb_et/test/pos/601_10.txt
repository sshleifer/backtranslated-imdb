First of all, I would like to say that this film is the biggest thing ever happened to mankind. This is the best among the eminent Muppet movies and all the other films there! so BOO-YA jim Henson! <br /> <br /> This movie is the first Muppet movie and the best one. (Boo ya) This is about a frog (kermit) who is trying to make Hollywood. With the awesome friends he meets on the way, he comes up with some of the greatest, ever-made classic songs, including the "rainbow link". The movie was the biggest thing EVER!. If you haven't already seen it, go out of your computer and let you get to your nearest video shop tushy !!! (if they don't have a muppet movie, I'd complain about BIG TIME)
