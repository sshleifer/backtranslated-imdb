The Grave robber sits in his cell waiting for execution to be visited by a monk who wants to take his last words off as a descendant and a warning to the other terrible lives he led. At first, reluctantly, but with the help of his tongue to relax, the young grabber will soon tell his story, full of dead, Undead, and things that will fall at night. <br /> <br /> New York City Lens Horror Films (Filmed Partly on Staten Island, which undoubtedly led to Andy Milligan's spirit lurking) is one of the best horror comedies that will come around after a while. This is often a very funny movie that just captures your story in any way. The first rate is cast. Dominic Monaghan plays Arthur Blaket, who kidnaps his story. Ron Perlman is the father of Duffy, who receives the statement and perhaps the story too. Both men have a clear old time and it shows. The rest is just as good. Jeff Grace's music is great. Impacts are ideal for such strange stupidity. The movie is fun. If there is a problem with the film, maybe it will throw it into the net a little wider, so the result is too much. I don't want to give too much, but I don't think we need to mix a foreign body. Nonetheless, it is a lot of fun, and I am pretty sure I will be watching the IFCs in the theaters where I saw it for the first time, and later I am sure I will receive the DVD. > <br /> Worth checking out.
