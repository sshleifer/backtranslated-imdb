In 1961, this series appeared on local TV here in Southern California. Since then, I and many others are on the BBC for tape or DVD. Now, maybe, this is Amazon. I ordered it in January and now I arrived here on March 30th. It was a long wait (48 years). Was it worth it? So far I've just watched Richard II (I've only had a DVD since 2 o'clock) and I can really say YEA !!! totally worth it. Operation, direction and production are excellent and even better than you remember. Production takes place in B&W, but it fits somehow. The video is clear and very good, the sound is flawless. Additional proof of how timeless Shakespeare really is. <br /> <br /> I gave it 10 stars, although I've only seen one in 8. I'm sure when I saw them, I'll change my rating to at least 12. <br /> <br /> It is currently in stock in Amazon (US 1) at a reasonable price. <br /> <br /> Better stop now so I can look again. Next is Henry IV, part 1 of which is my favorite Shakespeare game all the time.
