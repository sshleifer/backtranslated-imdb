This is one of the best low budget B movies I've ever seen. I don't want to stand up and enjoy during the movie, but it was definitely worth it. Of course, the premise is that there is a bed that eats people, well ... eats a subjective concept, I think it really excites acidic me to breastfeed the victims to themselves and dissolve them in acidic goodness. The best part of this movie is that William Russ is one of the main characters. A typical family man started his career with this film ... and afro. There's a lot of nudity in this flick, so it's probably not for kids, but it shouldn't stop anyone from seeing this movie. I believe that at some point or some other time, everyone needs a small bed of death, it is best if it is earlier than later.
