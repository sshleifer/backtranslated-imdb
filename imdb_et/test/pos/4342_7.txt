Paul Kersey, DEATH WISH 3, is very far from the original text by Paul Kersey. When you remember the 1974 film, you remember that Kersey was "Conchie" during the Korean War and that he was physically ill after his first exercise. Ten years later, Kersey seems to have learned the unarmed struggle and how she can handle the vessel's weapons in her free time. But I forget about this gaff, because DW3 is the best of the aftermaths, small-life bags are shot dead, burned alive, their teeth broken and their deaths thrown into medieval housewives armed with sweeping brushes. Yes, I know that gang members are multi-ethnic, and they deserve some credit for it, but even if they're not racist, they still kill the deaths that deserve everything they get from Kersey and innocent citizens. Who needs a mayor Rudy if you have Paul Kersey, an anti-tank rocket and a number of old-age pension recipients to restore the streets of criminals. Paul Kersey Welcome you sir
