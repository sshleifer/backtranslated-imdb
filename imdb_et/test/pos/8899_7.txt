Asterix and Vikings are the first animated asterix film to be held for more than 12 years since 1994 "Asterix Conquers America". It is also an honor to be the first digitally-colored asterix animation that makes a much more entertaining story much more breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Each scene in this movie is in vivid colors with vivid colors. color schemes for their underlying comic books. The designs of the symbols also remain relatively close to the comic, better or worse, retaining the simple but unique look of the characters. With its simple character design, it allows you to spend more time and effort on the actual animation, which, by the way, goes beyond many other big-screen theater animated films. Label movements are very fluid and have a quality that looks far beyond what is usually a modest budget; there is always something that moves in every scene and does not prove the usual cost-cutting animations. Images from 3D computers are seamlessly connected to traditionally animated 2D art. If anything, the shade style makes 3D elements more like traditional comic books than CGI models. <br /> <br /> The story contains many of its elements from the comic book "Asterix and Normans" and is where its main mistake is. By adapting these comics, Asterix and Vikings take up too much freedom with their source material. The long-time fans will undoubtedly find a lot of the movie's story and its lack of source. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this story can be seen in a very fun way, independently, without comparing it to its source material. A well comic, well-written fun pepper is an amazing script. The funniest parts were numerous pop culture references and jibs in today's 21st century life. Mobile communication, the shopping channel, commercial airlines and even sports cars are having a huge impact. Excellent chemistry and casting (I looked at it in English by the way), although a few voices, like Cacofonix, really found irritating (but I think it's all part of his character). <br /> <br /> If there's something to criticize the story, it's a "asterix" lack. This story seems to be a Justforkix story about teenage romance and "aging" where Asterix and Obelix play only supporting roles. It gives a feeling of great unity, because the majority of the elements created are the usual clips of such teen films. Derivative instruments and clich√©s are sometimes only a witty comedy, and traditional "Astrix" elements (Romans, Pirates, etc.) can save this movie as normal mediocrity. <br /> <br /> Asterix animated movie collection, this is definitely one of the funniest, best scripts and most beautifully animated. The DVD seems a bit hard to come by, though ????????
