It is such films that should strive for. Funny, totally stupid, a bit sexy, without every female showing her breasts, biting without any "f-bombs". I've seen a lot of movies from Justin Long in recent years, I thought of the right role he could break. (Mac ads won't tolerate.) This movie can quickly accelerate it to list A. The rest of the team did their job perfectly, this is a great little movie with a good message. (But you don't have to buy a message to spend a good time.) Lewis Black is as usual, fun and Blake Lively is a fresh face. <br /> <br /> Take a few hours and watch this movie, they won't be wasted.
