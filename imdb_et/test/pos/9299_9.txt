I know there is no need to comment on other users' comments, but I say that many of the negative reviews seem to come from people who already knew quite a bit about the Manhattan project and were annoyed by things that were left out. (From his book "Smoking in bed", it seems that the original scriptwriter Bruce Robinson is another one.) I looked very little before watching the movie and found it to be rivating. Dwight Schultz is absolutely mesmeric as Oppenheimer - a truly magnetic, charismatic presence, inspired by a piece that makes me wonder why he is not given better roles and more leading parts. John Cusack and Paul Newman are excellent as always. It is possible to select different scripts or directions, but if it is a movie, it will be extremely intense and terrible from time to time, and usually give me four stars out of five.
