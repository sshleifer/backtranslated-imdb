When Wallace and Gromit hit their scenes in the short winning stage of the academic prize, they created a fresh new look. After two more short short periods of time, Aardman's dynamic duo returned this thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining movie. It has great voice sound, humorous jokes and good animation, because only Aardman could do it! <br /> <br /> In this movie Wallace and Gromit "Anti-Pesto", a rabbit removal company. When the word goes out "Were-Rabbit", who eats all vegetables in the city, there is madness. Of course, Victor Quartermaine, the city's beautiful, toupee branding huntsman, wants to get his hands on the rabbit to impress the beautiful Lady Tottington ... but can our favorite Aardman duet be recorded the day before the chaos occurs? <br /> Jokes, I should say, were fun. One point, the villain, Victor Quartermaine, showed the crack-crack, calling the characters to cry: "WARNING ... MOON!" Vintage Aardman! <br /> <br /> Characters are crisp and fun. Our favorite Aardman team of Male and Koost will entertain us only if they can do it by serving their second Oscar (remember "Grand Day Out?"). Helena Bonham Carter was terrible when the beautiful Lady Tottington, Wallace's love interest. Ralph Fiennes was especially funny and predictive as a clever, prince who carries the hunter Victor Quartermaine. But the one who really showed was a priest whose antics turned out to be a fun comic. <br /> <br /> Hats for Aardman to create another Wallace and Gromit masterpiece!
