CHRISTMAS IN AUGUST is the perfect movie. Perfect film of all humanity's shortcomings. It may look like a movie about death, but it's actually a movie of life. I just can't recommend this movie enough. And don't be afraid, dear readers, this is not a depressing film. As has been said, this film is the brightness of life, guided by the shadow of death. You laugh. You cry. You understand that life is fragile and short. And you miss a better understanding of how valuable life is. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 <br /> <br /> (more about www.nixflix.com) this movie and reviews of other foreign movies)
