RIFIFI (Jules Dassin - France 1955) <br /> <br /> It seems to me a very risky idea to try Hollywood remake of Jules Dassin's 1955 classic RIFIFI. By 2007, Al Pacino is likely to be in the lead by taking Tony le Stephanois. Risky business ... How do they pull it out? Ironically, Dassin was on a blacklist in Hollywood and he tried his luck in France and did that little masterpiece, some of them skilfully "The grandfather of all the capricious and throbbing films." In my opinion, it remains a unique classic that has been filmed nicely with one of the most memorable endings. Regardless of the film's opinion. <br /> <br /> Over the last few years, RIFIFI has become dangerous. However, this French noir-classic should not be forgotten. See this before the remake is there to get the ammunition to compare the two. <br /> <br /> Obscura Camera 9/10
