One of the most entertaining quieter comedies is Pudovkin's short "Chess Fever", a crazy mind about how a strictly intellectual board game can interfere with even the most carefully planned medium economy. Such a promising comic theme as chess found in this pleasant short sense of the earlier sales point. Two young men play the game seriously with an artificial background, with a painted set. This is the opposite of previous Lumiere shorts, such as "L'Arrosseur Arrosse" or "Repas du bebe", where human activity was deliberately designed in a natural environment. The difference in activities (natural = nursing child, watering in the garden, artificial = male) is likely to be significant. <br /> <br /> The main contrast of this movie is the background between this property and the calm, peaceful game. the acute passions that this latter causes when the accusations of fraud lead to the most dignified so-called. The intellectual game becomes a great physical residue, just as the artistic filmmakers' claims are forever proclaimed by the cruder. <br /> <br /> What is most interesting about the film is not necessarily a tipping down. , but how to film it, extending it long after the initial joke; this is how the camera refuses something worthy of the fight, instead focusing on the device when we try to walk around and dress. Refusing to change a film is cruel, so humor seems to have arisen from a fight other than a fight that reflects our need for physical contact over intellectual stimulation, let us go uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> What is particularly brilliant is abandonment, as these top-class valves are captured, picking them up as two different school students, as if they were in their ears. If masters can't wait to decorate their place, if someone has to do it for them.
