If you're an early Duke movie fan, this is Lone Star oldie good. The more you could ask than Duke, Yak and Gabby. Lots of head ridin 'and shootin' !!! I find it amazing that Duke's singing voice was Bill Bradbury, who is no other than Bob Steele's twin brother. It has been reported that Bob Steele was a high school classmate and friend of Duke, so that Bill Twilight might have been. Anyway, if you like a good, clean, early western film don't miss it. We do not have to think about hidden meanings or try to find out the main topics. Just sit back, relax and enjoy the western movie's simpler day and time. It's called Entertainment!
