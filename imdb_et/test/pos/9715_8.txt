The role of the economy in an industrially developed North American market must always be a theoretical engine for home-building. Individuals and industrialists such as Mercedes Benz and the Bavarian automotive factories (BMW) certainly recognized the possibility of the North Ameircan market with the number of fuel and cars purchased in the household. Such economic phenomena created the Speed ​​Racer concept. <br /> <br /> Following Japan's new constitution, the industrialization of the isolated island state of Japan once again has to look for opportunities through its economic partnership with its neighbors in the world. It also contributed to creating economic opportunities for European and North American markets, if not on the global market. <br /> <br /> Speed ​​is a young eager driver who knows no better result than his demanding father, Pops Racer, who has challenged himself as a better machine for his life to win the race. It was actually Pops Racer, who led his first son, Rex Racer, to the edge of his strategy of making the best use of advanced technology. As a mature Racerina, Rex finally understands her own inherent values ​​and becomes independent, but still feels the responsibility of her younger work. <br /> <br /> The exact relationship between Rex Racer and people like the inspector is never quite clear, but made it dramatic. Finally, Rex is accused of being a representative of a state or organization because he has the ability to be in places where there is no other explanation of how he would have known that speed was in trouble. Or the fact that the situations involved a certain type of illegal activity when his secret knowledge is used against an evil plot. This brings the speed to the racer along with clothing and dagger romance. <br /> <br /> A mixture of speed innocence and Trixy, Spritali and Chim Chim brings a comical human character. This concept is a form of good rhetoric to balance themes and plots as they are played from an episode to an episode. So, instead of a dry detective story, one story, Speed ​​Racer, international racing car ride, joy and coat romance, and human nature comedy will be put together.
