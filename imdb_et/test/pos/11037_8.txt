If you are very sensitive to extreme racial stereotypes, it is not a comic for you. But if you are definitely interested in seeing rare warfare animation, come in! <br /> <br /> In this cartoon patrol Popeye sea and discover what looks like a Japanese fishing boat. Two Japanese fishermen are trying to think of Popeye that they want to sign a peace treaty. But the appearance may be deceptive; a fishing vessel is a Japanese Navy ship! Next, moral enhancing propaganda is considered today. <br /> <br /> Be careful, the Japanese representations in the film are made in the medium sense. But remember that there was a war at that time. But I strongly recommend this drawing to those who are interested in World War II.
