I saw this movie from Philly to Denver. The screen was three in front of me and about 12 "x 10". So I'm really not going to watch it. But I like Malcolm in the middle, so I thought I was just a couple of minutes. The next thing I know is that I suck, I have a great time and I was delighted how good it was and how fast it seemed to be going. I agree that action is very good for this entertaining level. Being one of the older baby boom generations, I was also glad to see the role of Lee Majors in the film, as well as some other players who were famous (Jamiel?) "Yesterday" but who are not in the spotlight today. this is your main "child is spoiled, the child can even (and then some), and everyone will enjoy themselves in this process". No hard thinking, no big analysis. Just a fun way to pass time. <br /> <br /> 3.5.
