This is a good film, located in Vienna on the cab driver Toni (Donald Buka), who steals a passenger's identity when a passenger is seated at the back of the cabin. It gives him an identity because he is an illegal immigrant, but he has to play the role of a victim until he gets to the US with a ticket under the name of the victim. Mrs Manelli (Joan Camden) murmurs her, but she is accused of the mental problem of her husband, Claude (Francis Lederer). As a result, Toni is released from the hook. Claude doesn't want to get involved with his wife, but she runs away from her. There are several plot twists and finally Toni and Mrs Manelli are doing it together - they both try to get out of their lives in Vienna. Finale is tense and exciting. Do they go away ..... ?? ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the picture quality is not fantastic and there is a line that runs for a while in the middle of the picture. Everything is very good in their roles, especially the depiction of Francis Lederer Claude. The story is also important for Heinth (Manfred Inger) as Marie's (Inge Konrad's) cab owner as a friend and inspector of Toni's hometown (Hermann Erhardt). <br /> <br /> This is a good movie.
