As is often the case when Manga is translated into real action, there is little loss of translation. However, this is a very fun movie. The premise is unusual and it is presented in a quiet, undervalued style, so common in Japanese films (ha!). Special effects are small 70's bearings, but it adds a comic book to the movie. I wouldn't recommend this movie to everyone, but if you are familiar with other Japanese horror movies like "Evil Dead's Trap", then this movie you like.
