Meville's capricorn is not as good as his most famous film, tastefully stylish "Le Samourai (1968)". I don't even think this is the best example of a subgroup of beloved ones. The main thing about the film is its long working hours. Meville has such a tendency to focus on too many trivial details. He could have spoken the same story in a relatively short time, but for reasons that I do not understand, it seems that the film continues and continues. However, the film is never boring. Melville's direction made me and impressed me very well, especially Alain Delon is a very "cool" headache. The film's must-have color photography is great and Melville uses sound (or no sound) very effectively. From a technical point of view, the film is virtually flawless. Sometimes it feels like Meville is just out, but if someone is as talented as it is, there is little reason to complain. I still like some more movies (Jules Dassini's "Topkapi (1964)", but one name), but I can't deny that this movie is a good cellulose entertainment and a good example of what people refer to as "cool" cinema.
