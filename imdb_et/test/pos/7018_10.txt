I've seen this movie about 50 times and it never seems to me boring. I always look at it with my best friend and it has become a kind of tradition to watch it almost every month. every time we see this movie, we both get really emotional and laugh and we cry in front of the television and sing all the songs loud and finally we always dance. Watching the heart and the movie seems like watching our old friends on television. <br /> <br /> This movie is perfect! although I have to admit that the story itself is a bit cheesy, but characters, dance, music, and even where it all happens, forget it all and start believing that such things really happen and that the song "everything you need is love" there is actually some meaning. <br /> <br /> I'm really a normal person and not too serious my comment, but I just can't wait until next time we see Dirty Dancing.
