There's not much to say about this flick ... The plot is pretty simple: two police officers (who are also lovers) are using a brothel to catch criminals, "house", played by hardcore pornstar Chloe. As anyone can guess, a couple of plots are twisted and some vague alliances, but writing was just terrible, even for a soft porn movie. <br /> <br /> I've read some of the previous posts about Nicole Hilbig's accent (she's a female cop). Yes, it's hard to understand what he says from time to time, but I think I've put it. I did some sniffing .... I think he's from Germany, so his strange sounding accent. He even makes an impression, but ... he has a great look. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there were a couple of "back" sex scenes that were pretty for graphics for softcore films. ... there's a great job. The end of the triple scene was not so bad. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * <br /> <br /> I knew that a female policeman would become a part-time speaker at the end. He enjoyed too many three directions. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILER * <br /> <br /> I'm not talking too much about it, seeing it as a small budget, direct-video-cushioning. However, it seems that I've seen too many movies in this genre that have a similar story. <br /> <br /> Women: B (Chloe and Hilbig were okay candies): Sex: B + (scenes were short but good) Story: C (recycled plot, but whatever works, eh?) Generally: B-
