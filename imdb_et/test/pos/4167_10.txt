Surprisingly big cartoon in the same league as Batman: TAS and its delight, I enjoyed it in my youth and recently I was able to look at all of them again, with the wonderful roles of Tim Curry, Richard Moll, Tony Jay and Maurice LaMarche. The only thing I had with Rob Paulsons's voice seemed a bit too old for the character of the title, but it wasn't a big deal, because the stories were great and the whole thing was very timeless. Some people say it was a fight, but I found it refreshing compared to many series that just leave things hanging. Hopefully one day, they put it out on the DVD of this series, unfortunately it came out at a time when DVDs were not yet widespread, and it was probably only selling certain types of toys that I didn't find attractive despite the fun drawing.
