I decided to watch it for free on FearNet because I thought well, nothing seems enjoyable. And it turned out to be a rather amazing surprise! The film is a legend of four cities, spoken of in the anthology of four teenagers whose car breaks down in the middle. When they decide to build a campfire in the woods, they start talking about their spooky stories and movie transitions to story events. <br /> <br /> Honeymoon - A newborn couple traveling to RV in Las Vegas is terrorized when they park evil creatures in the forest, hunting for a full moon. (I don't break it!) Hook-Amy Smart and James Marsden (probably the most famous people in the movie except the beautiful Christine Taylor) are playing a young couple who come face to face with a manic with a hook. This is the best known short hand. <br /> <br /> People will probably be the most frightening and darkest stories of Lick Too. A young girl is chatting on the internet with another girl, but it turns out that it is actually a man who has become obsessed with her and goes home when she is alone. It was really chilling. <br /> <br /> The Locket-This is also a great story for Glen Quinn and Jacinda Barrett, who play a motorcyclist and a pretty quiet girl who is terrorized by the mysterious farmhouse of the ghosts of the last century. It was good, but it was the weakest of the scraps. <br /> <br /> The group around the campfire slowly develops its terrible experience between its segments between stories, and the end of this movie is surprising and really fantastic! In general, it is not frightening to bone-cooling, but it is certainly a very small guilty pleasure that horror fans would certainly be useful!
