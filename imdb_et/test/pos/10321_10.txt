This is the first three Stooges I saw with Shemp and one of my favorites! <br /> <br /> What I really liked about Shemps when he didn't want to be Curly after returning to Curly's move was his own character and what I admire! Shemp is my favorite third stooge, I like him more than curly, but I like Curly as much as I Shempti. Shemp is great, he's funny, he's stupid, he's SHEMP! <br /> <br /> I really loved the scene where he fell off the nickel, and Moe got to him to find it, and they got confused and really hurt! <br /> <br /> But what I really thought was frightening was when Shempil had his face on the broken phone glass, he looked like deformed Professor Snape! <br /> <br /> Poor Shemp, he was in this short time happens to him a lot of bad things, but it's just a typical three Stooges, they always have a lot of bad things! <br /> <br /> This short is another to be seen by the three Stooges fans! <br /> <br /> 10/10
