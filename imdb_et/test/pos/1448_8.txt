Frank Sinatra took this role, chewed it with the rest of the landscape, and - cut off his path. TMWTGA is gradual, the end is a jersey, some scenes need a little more cutting, but that's all. It's a great entertainment from start to finish, and when you look at it, you realize that Sinatra, the long-dead MOR crooner, was junkies, gangster card games and the entire US city trolley in his blood - he didn't learn it as a working coach. There are all kinds of drivers involved to keep you entertained and the (non-dated) soundtrack bakes all the way. The Marathon card game won forty years in Goodfellas, Sopranos and so on. So it wasn't faithful to the book? What's the movie? And I can't imagine it being remembered if Brando had opened it; the scenes with cold turkey would have been embarrassing, not nervous, convincing and moving with Sinatra. No one else has mentioned the poor, lazy, cynical police - absolutely on the ground! And Eleanor Parker would have forced me to hit me.
