To make it as simple as possible. This is a very good show. It is well written and fantastic cast. It's not full of blood and guts. And he focuses on the disgraced police officer and his relationship with his ex-wife, his son, his former partner (Andre Braugher), his childhood friend, now the priest (George Dzunzda), and finally the person who gets into his episode of hacking. Are you likely to have found something that happens in your city NO. Is it still a good story YES. And it's nice to see a man who is a good father, despite his mistakes. See more than one (2-3) and see why many of us are involved in this show. And thank you to David Morse for making this character so interesting. Another good job!
