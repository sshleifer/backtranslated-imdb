Wow. this movie is the voice of a climbing generation. Director Sam Keith takes us to the darker depths of the Human soul, where we find love, life, and excellence. The world's tired Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) monitors the brain's journey through its heart and anchors to find peace of mind in post-apocalyptic Colorado. Instead, Telly encounters confrontation with Don (Jason Bortz), the mechanism and the incarnation of the humanities. The epic film reaches climbax, which is a highly competitive intestinal performance that makes even the most intense dancers at amazing heights. <br /> <br /> This movie is all: Top-roping outside, Top gyms, Cut-off shorts and Sleeveless flannels, Awesome climbing footage (some so good, you see it 2 or 3 times!), Bear and Snake attacks. <br /> <br /> I gave a movie from 8 out of 10 because I wanted to see a little more romance. It seems as if the film had led a spicy, top-ripened sex scene between Telly and his new lover, but unfortunately it would not be suitable for a one and a half hour walk. <br /> <br /> Fans of Cliffhanger and Impossible II will find this flick to be a diamond diamond. In general, if you are ready to challenge your worldview on humanity and climbing, this movie is for you!
