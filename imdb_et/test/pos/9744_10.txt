Supposedly the best series ever made (there are still no arguments here) about the Earth Painting Flash Gordon, Professor Zarkov and the beautiful Dale Arden who travel to the other world of the missile ship to save the planet. Along the way, spellbinding, spectacular and action-packed chapters of Flash and his friends with new found friends like Prince Barin, Prince Thun and awesome King Vultan combine their resources with combat evil and armies of ruthless Ming Mongo and his daughter Priness Aura jealousy (now she's a car !). This series is not just the cutting of serials in terms of plot, action and budget - it is ahead in these areas. The product produced by Universal Studios has many earlier kits, such as the Frankens Bride and Opera Opera by Opera. Production values ​​are at their lowest point in 1936. The costumes of many of these strange men and women are truly creative and first-rate. We get summer men, shark men, lion men, high priests, creatures like dragons, steppers, orangapoids and tigers (oh!) And many other fantastic things. Are all these plausible and first-rate special effects? Not possible. But in 1936 most of them are very impressive. The music point is fantastic and the beginning of the chapter is well written, long enough to revive the viewer's memories of the former chapter, and expertly threw it. Director Frederick Stephan is doing a great job of doing a great job and creating a film worthy of Alex Raymond's phenomicomic. Finally, it works pretty well in the series. All too often, serials have names that have no talent that surrounds one or two former talents - here most have a certain ability. Don't do it wrong, this is in no way a Shakespeare troupe, but Buster Crabbe is doing the job as pleasant. He is boldly assisted by Jean Arden, Priscella Lawson and the rest by two speakers. But before I get to these two, let me add, as another reviewer said, that this series must be amazing when Hayes Office gets. I see more meat in Flash and Jean Rogers and Priscella Lawson than decades later. Shorts Crabbe (and, unfortunately, all of us Professor Zarkov ((Frank Shannon)) wear about as short trousers as girls can wear. The girls are in the middle of the strokes and are pretty beautiful. The house, but she's a blonde bomb. Lawson is also very shy and sensual and beautiful, but for me, two sets of acting actor Charles Middleton like Ming: official, sardonic, merciless and fun. "Little" Lipson plays King Vultan: potty, rushing, fun - a symbol of pure joy in life and all hedonism Lipson steals every The plot is curving here, there and everywhere - but Flash Gordon is the penultimate series, the space opera, and it is the basis to follow the scientific literature.
