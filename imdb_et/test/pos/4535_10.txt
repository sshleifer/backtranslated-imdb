St. Schnikey! This movie stones! Chris Farley and David Spade duo are great together. My favorite items are "Fat Guy in a small coat, Oh my gosh, room service and more scenes that will be remembered in the coming years. This movie has a great cult, I mean why, what proves that even 11 years after Chris Farley's tragic death and he's still popular He is playing Tommy, which makes you laugh every time you look at it, he is a big comedian and is gone. Mr Shovel reminds me of Dan Akyroid when Chris Farley reminds me of John Belush. , this movie must buy and be in every Snl fan.
