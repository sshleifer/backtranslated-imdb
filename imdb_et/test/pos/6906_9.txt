I saw it in SIFF and I loved it completely. There were parts where I laughed so hard that I couldn't catch my breath. Glenn McQuaid's script and direction are fantastic. I can't wait to see this talented young man. Performances make a movie. Larry Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan are just as admirable as Willy and his practitioner Arthur. Ron Perlman turns a fantastic result (as usual) less than a sympathetic prison priest. Bonus: Angus Scrimm as a Carefree Doctor! As always, it perfectly balances threat and humor. <br /> <br /> This is a comedy comedy style that is not really visible because Vincent Price made "comedy", "Raven" and "Theater Blood." The film is really scary at times, then suddenly comes back to a fun mode, keeping it You're out of balance. Some parts are at the same time frightening and funny. <br /> <br /> I can only see three movies this year at SIFF, but even if the other two are terrible, "Selling Dead" was worth all three. I'm looking for more movies about Larry Fessenden's Glass Eye Pix. He gives fear to the genre a great hit in the back.
