First of all, it's an art film and it's good. I loved the presentation and how it was shot. Very cool. Some scenes were some of the more graphical horror sequences I've ever seen. This movie did not frighten me not because of an upright or shock, but because I was afraid of death, that I will soon see something terrible. It happened in some places, but mostly in the beginning. This movie dragged and 74 minutes seemed long. However, if you're a movie, you need to see it. So far, I haven't seen anything like that. 8/10
