An opera song is an accident that leaves the door open to take over its role. Betty (Marsillach) is now the star of Mac Beth, but the man in the trenches has his own opera. He gets his punches from Betty's pairing, placing the needles under his eyes (so he can't close them) and murdering the members of the opera company in front of his eyes. <br /> <br /> Opera is definitely one of Argento's most ambitious films, such as mixing Shakesphere with Macbeth, of course, the fact that the opera in the movie is the version of Giuseppe Verdi's Macbeth, but also Argento, just like Shakespeare uses in the form of dead and accidents. And as the dunes surrounding Dunsinane Castle, predicting the victims of Macbeth, cucumbers play an important role in the fall of the killer. In addition, as in the old game, the murderer acts by inciting his lover. But I do not want to go so far as to say that OPERA is designed to revise either the Opera or MacBet phantom, the similarities are too fine. This is just a typical Argento masterpiece, and it gives it a fairly common thriller for a lively Gothic mystic tone. <br /> <br /> Although this film does not have such effects as a good metal strip simply does not fit into this film, and the latest scenes in this movie are a bit strange. <br /> <br /> All "Opera" is a bug, but still good.
