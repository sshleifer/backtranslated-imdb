I looked at the perfect storm and thought of another one of Wolfgang Peterson's film, which is much better - it. Although certainly not a true story, the fire is how to make a movie. It has a great story with great pain. Malkovich won a well-earned Oscar for his terrifying killer who was scared of the government he had earned too well. Eastwood is good because the tortured secret service and Russo are light on the eyes. If you haven't seen it, be sure to rent it or buy it the way I did. Surely this is one of the best criminals of the last decade. 9/10
