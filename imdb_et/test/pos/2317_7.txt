This film is confusing among those who should be assigned tasks that are expected to fail. Misfits successfully completes its mission. <br /> <br /> Fear arises. <br /> <br /> Like "Police Academy" movies, humor has come from boat kooky characters. I thought it was an interesting movie and I'll stop watching it when it is on television. No, it does not cause you to think about your relative role in space or inspires you to do great things to serve humanity, but it is fun enough for a 90-odd couple of minutes. In addition, Lauren Holly sees the navy in uniform.
