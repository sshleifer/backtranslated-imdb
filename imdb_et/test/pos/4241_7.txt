Chucky is back ... and it's time! This time with Jennifer Tilly and Voodoo For Dummies with a small spell. Well, at least with that installment, the camp is back. So far, this series was the most terrible. It has some good twists and some good activities. It was far from the series's most fun and successful, as inadvertently, a gap between pure horror and horror / comedy. <br /> <br /> Look forward to Chucky seed. It's hoot! <br /> <br /> "Jesus, the scene of music has gone to h3ll because I'm dead!" Chucky <br /> <br /> We need lightness when the doll thing gets older. The added comic element and the better scenes bring this one up to be the first quality when the idea was fresh and new-ish. <br /> <br /> 6.8 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
