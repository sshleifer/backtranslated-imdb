only one workout led zeppelin to its best and their absolutely best swings. each band member has the best jimmy on the page and JPJ with his bow and guitar, with his acute bass that bounces off and Robert sings for his tomorrow. I have to say, when we enter the first song where it starts to perform, there is something very special. this DVD follows zeppelin through its 11-year-old Carree, starting with 69 in the Royal Albert Hall, then in Madison Square's Garden 73, followed by a much older and more mature band in the 75's and finally looking for a band of their own. at the last English show in Knebworth 79. This DVD is a fantastic zeppelin showcase and if you are not your fan then you are after that. N
