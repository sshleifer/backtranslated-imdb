It's a simple fact that many of us are from the 80's generation who grew up in love with the eye-catching John Cusack comedies made by Savage Steve Holland. I don't like One Crazy Summer, a movie that I grew up from heart, as a kid who is my teen. The OCS was a follow-up to Better Off Dead, returning Cusack and Curtis Armstrong from this movie. <br /> <br /> Cusack is hard, after finishing the ball with Joel Murray (George) Nantucket in the summer for every fun on the beach. Hoops finds himself innocent in poverty with a blonde, a fine punk called Teddy Beckersted, whose father's father has patterns in neighborhood homes to build a giant apartment. One home that needs repayment of this mortgage is owned by Demi Moore (Cassandra). There's a sailing competition that can be their only hope of saving Cassandra's grandfather's home (.. she was recently gone), but Teddy has won it in recent years and Hoops fears deadly boats over water. But with the help and motivation of new Nantucket friends (like Bobcat Goldwait and Tom Villard as twin brothers of auto-mechanics!), George and budding Cassandra, perhaps Hoops, can fight their fears and win the race to rescue the neighborhood. Armstrong has a supporting role like kooky, son of mania arms salesman, General Raymond (.. a little pain inspired by SCTV Joe Flaherty), Ack, who uses his father's training to help Hoops and the company achieve their goals of racing. <br /> <br /> The memorable scenes include Bobcat, who is left in the Godzilla suit (!) that runs over the Aguilla Beckersted (Mark Metcalf, barely recognizable as Teddy's quite relaxed pop-up) apartment, with the kid. unsuccessful cub scouts who want to give first aid, George is a victim of poisonous flatulence, Bruce Wagner's nutty Uncle Frank's growing madness every time he tries to get better at $ 1 million in radio and wonderful Billie Bird than George's grandmother who actually pays the group after meals! Jeremy Piven as (you thought) brutish jerk who binds Teddy and creates problems for Hoops and his poses, Nami Kimberly Foster as a cookie (.. Teddy girl who tries to make Hoops when he's attending a dad ) and one and only William Hickey as the old man Beckersted, who does not pay his son and granddaughter a legacy when they lose a sailing boat race. Demi Moore is cute, but it's a Cusack vehicle, although Bobcat and Villard lurk in most of the scenes inside. Again a pleasant animation is scattered around the film from the Netherlands (Hoops is an artist, respectively). If you like her movies, I suggest you underestimate how I got to college.
