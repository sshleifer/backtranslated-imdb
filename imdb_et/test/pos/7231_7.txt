This extreme Troma movie is actually a very good movie. It is known as an epic and best and highly valued product. Their version of Shakespeare's game is extremely funny with the usual Troma nudity and gore dose. Troma has made very good movies, one of my favorites is "Street Trash" and of course Toxic Avenger movies. I have one Troma movie, "Terror Firmer", which has its goriest and nastiest film reputation. I enjoyed "Tromeo and Juliet" so much that I finally have to look at "Terror Firmer". It is a version of two disks with four comments and many features. "Tromeo and Juliet" is an absolute flush and highly recommended.
