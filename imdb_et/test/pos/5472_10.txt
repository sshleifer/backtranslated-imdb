For those of you who have commented on this movie before and hoped to see it again, I hope you did. It was broadcast today (November 28, '04) on the Lifetime movie network. I'm ordering Dish. <br /> <br /> Karen Arthur directed William Petersen and Barbara Hershey in this southwestern part of the Gothic style competently. Lighting, editing and dialogue made a big contribution to the film, and Hershey and Peterson excelled in the roles, playing sensitive, bold and intuitive characters. The screen shot was excellent as well as supportive cast. <br /> <br /> I did not know right from time to time that the story was based on the truth, and now that I know, I have to live as Santa Fe is hop, jump and jump from Tucson. <br /> <br /> As an engineer, I was fascinated by the unique design of the staircase and its designer and builder (who was he an angel?). But what is most fascinating is the story, and it's several plots. You will definitely have a strong feeling that God in His heaven was all about all of its history. For you who saw the movie, you know what I'm talking about. For those who are not, I will not break it in a minute ... <br /> <br /> Bon Holiday, <br /> <br /> Bob Shank Jr., Raytheon Missile Systems, Tucson, AZ
