When the 70s came to an end, rumors in the entertainment sector began to fly to Sean Connery for a possible return to his famous role in 1962 - James Bond. <br /> <br /> Cubby Broccoli was asked by BBC Barry Norman during his "Moonraker" production in Brazil about how he saw the prospects. Obviously, the manufacturer did not want to express his opinion. <br /> <br /> When "Moonraker" opened, Bond fans were outraged at what they thought was a cheapening of the character and jumping to the star. Wars' bandwagon much like "Live & Let Die" had made blaxploitation craze a few years earlier. Many publicly voiced the hope that Connery would return to show only Eon how to look for a real Bond movie. <br /> <br /> Years of legal battles. The original script, entitled "James Bond Of The Secret Service" (later returned by Warhead), was written by Kevin McClory, Len Deighton and Connery, has never been filmed and remains one of the great unaltered movie blocks. <br /> <br /> A new script was launched that is closer to the Thunderball. It was written by Lorenzo Semple Junior, best known as the man who put Batman in the camp. He also wrote "Parallax Views", one of the best conspiracy thrillers of the decade. Knowledge of the script needed a British touch, Connery brought Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, hit by British Likcoms "The Likely Lads" and "Porridge" writers. The title of the joke was suggested by Connery's husband Micheline. <br /> <br /> "Never Say Never" just before the Christmas of 1983 in a shower of critical praise; Usually, reasonable critics were so ecstatic on Connery's return that they ignored all other aspects of the film. Many used it to attack the Roger Moore series, especially against this year's "Octopussy". In fact, "Octopussy" is better in every sense. "Never" is no excitement and spectacle associated with Bond, sometimes it seems to be T.V. Movie. The story was made before and better in Thunderball in 1965, so "Never" was always the second best. This was also hampered by the fact that the official series was not included, meaning that the Monty Norman's James Bond Theme and the Maurice Binder weapon arm could not be used. <br /> <br /> Like Bond, Connery is great, stepping back to his most famous role. Bond was playing as an older, smarter agent. Barbara Carrera landed her best film role as a buggy "Fatima Blush", a lady whose love for murder is such that she dances after (so she thinks) killing Bond. Kim Basinger bears the word "Domino". Like S.P.E.C.T.R.E. agent "Maximillian Largo", Klaus Maria Brandauer gives cooling. However, the great disappointment is Max Von Sydow as "Blofeld". The posters gave the impression that he was a great character, in fact he only appeared in a few scenes. With a stronger script, he could have been one of the biggest ever Bond crooks ever. <br /> <br /> "Never" promised to be a return to earlier Eon bonds like "From Russia with Love" but didn't give it. The gadgets were there, but they were used almost apologetically. The Bond rocket motorcycle was a tired trick even in the 60s. The film tried to compete with Eon bonds for humor. Bond saves himself by throwing his urine sample on the face of the assassin. It's a nice moment when you find something in 'Moonraker'. But the lowest is Rowan Atkinson's introduction as Nigel Small-Fawcett, Foreign Ministry official. He gives the idea so amazingly terrible when he thought he was a footlights revue. <br /> <br /> Michel Legrand's music is terrible, the man never sees Bond in his life. <br /> <br /> Although the film was a financial result that will be reviewed years later, it is the weakest bond in the 80s. Connery himself was disappointed and did not act again in a few years. <br /> <br /> 1983 was a good year for 007 Mania, in addition to Connery and Moore's films, George Lazenby made a comeback on "The Return of Man U.N.C.L.Est: Fifteen Years Later Affair".
