After the terrible incident at the New York Central Station, the police arrest an innocent bystander (Kevin Spacey, "normal suspects") who believe him under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs. We understand why they think it, given how man politely informed them that they wear their dark glasses because "the light of your planet is really bright." And so Prot (as he identifies himself as a "goat" rhythm) is sent to the Manhattan Institute of Psychiatry, where tired workaholic, Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges, "The Big Lebowski") tries to understand this man's "mistake." br /> Prot is polite and co-operative When asked why he believes he is institutionalized, he actually replies that this is because "you think I'm crazy." After a few minutes he has satisfied his insatiable new ground hunger, it is quite straightforward for Prot to discover that he is an extraterrestrial land on the planet K-PAX, which lives at 1,000 light-years away, turning the binary system Agape and Satori, the constellation of Lyra. He also describes how his endlessly developed species are already light using energy that has passed the light faster, supposedly eon to the human race. <br /> <br /> Powell is understandably very skeptical about their resentful claims, though he is fascinated by them stub understand how Prot had to believe in such a thing. At the same time, Prot uses his time to monitor his co-patients in the psychiatric department, eventually offering everyone the chance to live and hope for him. On July 27, Prot later discovered that he would leave for K-PAX again and he could only take one person with him. What really happens on this date is no one sure. <br /> <br /> The dr. Will Smith With Prot ?? Kevin Spacey took the lead when Smith had to retreat from the movie. You can say that he had a lot of fun in his character, his complete transmission of the sometimes ridiculous dialogue ("Your production has been worth the trip"), which often brought true laughter. Many Prot words have undeniable intelligence, but logic argues that it must be misleading ... can't it? <br /> <br /> Does the audience drive between opportunities? In the first segment of the film, we almost accept the possibility that Prot is extraterrestrial (this is a sci-fi movie, isn't it?!) before being fully convinced that Prot is inexplicably impossible to know about the newly discovered planetary system of astronomy. Dr. Powell's final study provides us with a well-packed ground explanation of Proti's confusion, but it is just as quickly thrown away and we'll scratch our head again. The film rightly keeps its end open, leaving the audience to think about what they have just looked at and discuss them around them. However, do you believe that Prot is a stranger or not, two irresistible insurances remain in your mind: the universe is indeed an exciting place, and perhaps there are also greater powers that we still discover.
