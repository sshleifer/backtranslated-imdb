Wm as a fan. Faulkner from college, I was particularly pleased to see intruder dust and other reasons. My grandfather, named Clarence Brown, was a director, grew up in the Oxford area, born there in 1888. We participated in a week-long family reunion in Oxford in July 1964, just 15 years after filming. It still seemed mostly like a movie, but went through a breakthrough in civil rights as Ole Miss. In my memory this is a nice little college town in the summer, but I was just an 18 year old college teenager and white. I was just beginning to see the injustice of segregation and prejudice, but I had a long way to go. Anyway, watching the movie is worth it, but the filmmakers had to go there and make an effort, and I'd like to know more about this. <br /> <br /> Now the days are, Oxford is a bigger, more modern college town with all the things that consist of such things and hope to come back again to see how it has to change socially in the last 40 years. Juano Hernandez would certainly have had to apply for an Oscar this year, but Hollywood was still able to afford it. Other Faulkner stories are filmed to search and compare them. One of the best was Barn Burner's PBS treatment since 1985 or so Tommy Lee Jones. It really created the South White rural light that Faulkner so often wrote so sharply.
