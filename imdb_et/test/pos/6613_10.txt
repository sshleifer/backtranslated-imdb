This movie moved me at the age of 39, just like all the Dogtown footage and coverage affected me when I was 13. All those who criticized the self-promotion of the interviewed Z-boys have a laugh. It was their whole thing, "we are better than all of you and here is why .... (insert the footage of a carved image of a smoother pool)" It was a movie that talked about your story and it was their story whether you like it or not. It was their opinion about skating that wasn't important to you or me. I thought the film hit their attitude and impact just as I remembered it in the 70s. The reality is that they DID revolutionized their rollerblading, they were gaining momentum in extreme sports and they DID injected into a culture paradigm that reached every corner of americana. This film revived Bertleman's images on the ship and Alva and Jay Adams hung up for coping, which was the dream of California for all young young young people who just wanted to have fun and get a rad! When I watched this movie, I realized that it was these pictures that lived together every day until I was old enough to move and return to Caln when my family moved to Nor Calis for five years. Until I got back, my friends and I ramped up after the ramp, looking for every empty pool that was possible and imitating everything Stecyk covered about their boys. We are all educated and we now have a family and a career, but this film reminds me of who I was at this age and why I still surf. It is an inspired film that anyone who is interested in pop culture, extreme sports, 70's or even just good movie movies will enjoy it. If this is a cable, I can't change the channel. Weave to Stacy Peralta to make a beautiful work of art!
