This smart, moving and beautiful film is a study of how people respond to tradition (reminds me of William Faulkner's novels). <br /> <br /> Signs are all trapped in the weight of the roles they are supposed to assume and look for the opportunity to live in these roles rather than being thrown away completely. But if the story is developed by spouses who are trapped in love with marriage, pull together. Based on their friendship and the strength of their love, they give each other the courage to give up their roles. <br /> <br /> They have found that living in their traditions is not life at all, it is a kind of living death: without passion, without real connection with others, without fulfillment. While they know that their rebellion and freedom have to be paid, this price is much cheaper than the sacrifice required by a comfortable, predictable existence. <br /> <br /> The scenario is wonderful, wonderful. Near perfect!
