L'Homme Blesse is not meant for an impatient, adventurous audience. There are no explosions or drama is easy. Like Lynne Ramsey's films, the director works deeper with the mood than with efficient and incredibly mobile storytelling. Because it does not depend on free nudity or superficial pop culture. story, it's frankly one of the best gay gay movies I've ever seen (see also Francois Ozon, Pedro Almodovar). Nicolas Roegi's "Don't Look Now" gets a lot of bad news because it is sold as a horror movie. This film, like L'Homme, is more than what a box can believe you. If you have the mood to sit back and admire the cinema's subtle, transformed powers, you will love this movie.
