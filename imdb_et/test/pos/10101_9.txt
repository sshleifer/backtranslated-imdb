This is not so much an overview of two sisters, because it is a discussion of the details of some of the smaller parcels, so I don't want to read this review if you haven't seen the movie, because doing so will absolutely destroy a few surprises for you. <br /> <br /> Some Brain Two Sisters are far from original, at least purely superficial - some of its iconography is taken directly from Ring or Dark Water, while the story itself (especially what Brendt sponsor calls the "rubber reality" narrative) resembles movies such as Fight Club (the lead figure communicates with some of them created in their minds), Mulholland Drive (a character that creates an alternating reality of psychogenic fugue), as well as other lost road, Jacob's ladder, and basically every movie dealing with mental illness under the sun, as well as Amenabar ' i movies (others, Abre Los Ojos), Memento (especially with regard to the memory of the embarrassing nature) films. et al. Fortunately, these similarities do not damage the overall emotional impact of the film, and I personally found the extremely mobile and rewarding experience of A Tale Of Two Sisters. <br /> <br /> Many people have commented on "confusion". narrative, but I personally found it to be quite self-evident, even if it is partially depicted in a non-sequential manner. The narrative becomes confusing for some, because in the middle of the third party the story turns into a purely subjective setting (ie the perception of the reality of Soo-Mi) objective, at the end of which there is an explanation of the origin of the Soo. -I have nerve damage and later mental illness. The attention has been visually thrown to some people, but structurally I found it somewhat reminiscent of the above mentioned Mulholland drive (though we are not engaged in perception of the character through a dream, but with their own schizophrenic tendencies - something that in turn reminded me of another Lynch movie, Lost Highway). To be honest, I really do not consider the story of two sisters as a horror film as such, but rather a tragic story of family splitting and an honest picture of the nature of mental illness (and I hurry to add that fans of psychoanalytic cinema love this movie). <br /> <br /> This is also amazing with A Tale Of Two Sisters, and visually it's one of the most beautiful films I've seen on this side of Wong Kar Wai is 2046. Performances are also exceptionally fantastic and I look forward to seeing four leading parties in the future; not to mention the music, but then it seems that East Asian films with no big soundtrack seem to be a little and far between these days. <br /> <br /> It is very likely that some people will look at the finer artistic points of A Tale Of. Two sisters and just leave this "one more Asian horror movie," not forgetting their aesthetic beauty and honest psychoanalytic approach. But then everyone has their own. If you can ignore some of the platinum aspects of the movie and just take what it is in the heart, ie. an extremely tragic, heartbreaking story, then I see no reason not to recommend it.
