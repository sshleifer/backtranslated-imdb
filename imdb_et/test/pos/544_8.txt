This movie is considered to be one of the most recent dramas that Hollywood has brought to us when this film has been completely unsuccessful (especially given Natalie Portman's least appreciated results of the recent dramatic character), this film is almost unanimously leading the chemistry shared by both Susan and Natalie. They seem so natural during the movie that you are wrong with them for a real family. They go through the story of so many mother-girl conflicts that are difficult to keep up with. I feel that these two actresses' talented performances took place where the story was missing and almost too familiar (full of clich√©s) and really suffered the suffering. I would recommend this film mainly to those who like two actors or a general drama.
