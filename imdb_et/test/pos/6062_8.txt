"Rejseholdet" is one of the best new Danish TV shows I watched. <br /> <br /> The series is about a Danish police force unit - a solid FBI-style team that can help resolve murders anywhere in the country and the cases they work with, and the impact their jobs have on their personal lives sometimes they have to pay to be part of the top police team. <br /> <br /> It doesn't expect much when I started watching this series - I was pleasantly surprised, the series is exciting, sometimes fun, it's both drama and break, I love it.
