Finally, I got the chance to film and compare two versions of this movie that are currently moving around - first, a good old crazy, buggy Embassy VHS print called SCREAMERS, and then a new, fully restored Italian DVD by every new favorite media company, the stigma of Italy. <br /> <br /> American ads "men turned out" are as they all say, totally misleading and show Roger Cormanized, which would otherwise be a better fantasy adventure thriller for adults. The full Italian version is somewhat sprawling, well-designed and deliberately at a pace that takes "Dr. Moreau's Island" and there is nothing wrong with it. It is a proud, beautiful Euro Horror that has brain, good drawing, character development, location shooting, period costumes and sets, etc. <br /> <br /> But I have to admit that the 14-year-old chewing gum is still somewhere in my interior, a bigger competition for the more blissful, foolish and stupid version of Roger Corner that has a nice top-down, flashy but overflowing opening segment and then most of Martino's original film, though a somewhat shortened path to space for Roger's entertainment idea. Jumping was somewhat faster, the shock sequences approaching, and you see as much of Mrs. Bach's fantastic form as you do in the expanded Italian version. <br /> <br /> I still have little idea of ​​what a particular story is about: there are several plot twists and random signs that were somewhat difficult to follow. The local voodoo sub-platform didn't help much, and it's funny how everything culminates with another attack between a noble prisoner and a mad scientist. Maybe a couple of views are fine. I say this: Movie fans should use one of these PAL imports and see what is actually a movie, not just a dim old old video - widescreen compositions again show that Martino was eyeing the screen with interesting things to fill the screen. No one can get out of their heads, like SCREAMERS, but it is still an interesting thing, and once again proves that although his standards may have been quite limited to the area around the gutter, Roger Corman got a new good fun when he did it for him these are the better movies they had to be. <br /> <br /> 7/10
