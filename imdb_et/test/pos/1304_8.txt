I just found 3 DVDs in Wal-Mart at a good price of $ 5.50, so I thought I'd take another look. A total of 13 hours to view it (26 episodes). I was born in 1948 and saw most of them on television in the sixties. Many independent stations repeated these years. <br /> <br /> Better than I actually expected the time was natural for the obvious sincerity of the creators and the obvious gratitude and respect they give to all Allied forces. and women. More abstract and artistic than a straightforward documentary, but it is very true when describing the causes and end results of World War II. This war depended heavily on maritime transport, and the last victory was dependent on the ultimate mastery of the world's oceans. Allies were the ones who could do it. <br /> <br /> It was also interesting to see how they strike a balance between big events and individual soldiers and sailors. The score is impressive if it is a bit too big for today's standards. I read somewhere that Robert Russell Bennett helped as much as Richard Rodgers. I imagine that Rodgers gave all the main items and that was Bennett's task to make these pictures fit. Great work! <br /> <br /> Every ruler or potential manager must see it. A warning to tyrants that wars have finally won with ideals, determination and reserves to back them up. Logistics: Their quality and delivery are determined by potential winners. Allies presented and exceeded the material quality of the axes, attacked their sources in the process and secured their possible defeat. <br /> <br /> Sorry, the manufacturer, Henry Salomon, lived a very short life. IMDb's facts were quite nervous, I have to find out more about him. He still made outstanding documentary films before his earlier death. There may be more to say later. <br /> <br /> Trivia: I had all 3 LPs made from background music, pretty good. Unfortunately, the manufacturers decided to add sound effects to the latter, simply directing the novelty status rather than listening to serious music. Too bad because it contained many interesting but smaller topics. Dark things like 16-inch weapons, torpedoes, bulldozers, planes ... are just for kids. <br /> <br /> RSGRE
