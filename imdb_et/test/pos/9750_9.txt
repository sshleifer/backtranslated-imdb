it was a well thought out and well-photographed and directed TV movie that took the big object accurately and intelligently and gave it a movie that would look great on the big screen - the palette is somewhat muted on the TV. if you are looking for a war movie or "Bosnian lite", this is not for you - it is a common woman who took an extraordinary challenge to humanity. If you want to learn more about the conflict and how one woman's work influenced the world in a great way, watch this movie if it's your way. I do not see that many other TV films have dealt with genocide and ethnic hatred at this level. the story avoids the obvious demonization of "bad boys" and instead shows denial and daily hatred that caused thousands of deaths. I was moved in a number of points and not in some manipulative way of Hollywood, directing music and flashy mass-en-scene, but I promised to discover characters and characters. it is a bold film that lets the content speak for itself and keep the visuals underestimated to support it. <br /> <br /> Actors are doing a tender job to bring intense dramatic scenes to life. Scenes where the victims say before the war court are powerful and Wendy Crewson, Stipe Erceg and Heino Ferch are great. William Hurt's British accent is terrible - no one else has given him the chance to play the British and when he finally has it, he blows it! And while John Corbett's body was born to play a soldier / commando, he's a little too nice, though he does a good job.
