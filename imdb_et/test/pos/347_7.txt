I love almost everything Al-Adamson led in his late and varied career, but "Nurse Sherri's" stands in front of his head and shoulders, but it is true that Z-class races like "The Monster of Blood Monsters" and "Dracula Vs. Frankenstein". This movie is actually scary! Will I say you're going to jump from your seat when you look at "Nurse Sherri"? No, of course not. But the pastor of "Exorcist", "Ruby" and "Carrie" is one of the common films of the eighties. You don't get your finger on what's so horrible, but the film drips into the atmosphere. (And what ends! Don't worry, I won't break it for you.) Adamson and manufacturer Sam Sherman really pulled it off and it doesn't matter if the "sister Sherri" was a calculated success or a happy accident. Jill Jacobson is a pleasant, but not prominent, unhappy sister who has received the spirit of the recently dead cult leader (Bill Roy, who appears to be his short role). Geoffrey Land is good for his lovely boyfriend. Here are some of the blaxploitative elements (the profit was the bottom line of their cheap cut-off film), but they're actually dealing with a plot, not just a window floor. "Nurse Sherri" was a line of poverty that shows times (sets, special effects, etc.). However, the film has a heart, mostly a decent behavior and direction, and some real chills. Sam Sherman also saw Harry Lubin's theme music being used for the 50's / 60's TV series "One Step Beyond" at the end of the film, which definitely adds to the horrible atmosphere. The DVD contains two significantly different pieces of film (in the early version, there are a lot of R & D that is finished on the floor of the cutting room to do more frightening things), as well as a theater trailer, a TV show and a great comment by Sherman. Does anyone know what happened to Bill Roy? Besides John Carradine, he is the best actor I've ever seen in Al Adamson's film, and he plays the cult leader as he means.
