The biggest crowd ever saw a wrestling event in the United States took place in Wrestlemania 6. Over 93,000 people showed the Rolling Stones inscription to break and this event was not disappointed at all. Perhaps the biggest ever game was because Immortal Hulk defended his world title against Ultimate Warrior. There are over 12 games so you get tons of action
