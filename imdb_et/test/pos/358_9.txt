One of Chaplin's longest films until that time, Burlesque's Carmen is a smart and surprisingly complicated parody of what the "Prosper Merimee" was known as "Carmen". I was a bit confused with the difference that was in the IMDb list of the 1915 Burlesque in Carmen and the 1916 version. Based on running time, I assume that this was the 1915 version I saw, since 1916 is 20 minutes longer and what I have read is 20 minutes useless and unimpressive. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, it is clear that Burlesque on Carmen is one of Chaplin's most challenging and ambitious efforts so far, starting with the long setback that is being said between titles, the tragic love story of Carmen. <br /> <br /> Carmen is accompanied by a Gypsy band ("The band who puts GYP into the gypsy.") to attract a Spanish official to pull their smuggling. It's a clever band of Chaplinesque criminals whose leader Lillas Pastia has "learned to steal for 50 years, thought she might be offered a policy." In the side book, I have seen some almost insecure messages and jokes in Chaplin's earlier works, but obviously they are not quite clear as it is. At the beginning of the film, when the Roma band travels, there is a scene where moles and women load, and the title explains that "mules are those with long ears." If you don't know, I guess. <br /> <br /> Chaplin plays part of Don Joses, an unfortunate officer whom Carmen attracts. He is described as "a brave soldier and a woman's lover". Not exactly for Chaplin who removed all his doubts about his ability to play convincing comic soldiers a few years later with a brilliant shoulder weapon. And of course he didn't have to act as a woman's lover. <br /> <br /> This is, of course, different if it is a formal and disciplined disciplinary method of his polished army, which is of course confused. , some of his traditional blades are moving. He strikes me in a small position of power, trying to maintain the respect of his subordinates, doing it with a harsh, strong surface. <br /> <br /> Carmen will soon enter ("loved by all men under the age of 96"), and he will immediately flirt with Charli. I must mention that for most of the film, there is a surprisingly plausible original story full of jealousy and tragedy. Chaplin is bizarre convincing as a jealous lover who can arouse jealousy that I have never seen before. There is at least one scene where he is really small scary. <br /> <br /> Chaplin has some great eyesight in the movie, such as fun board dance and some classic sword fighting near the end. And the role of his boy's charm and soldier is certainly a winning combination, though there is another peculiar stunt that includes group men pushing a huge door back and forth, which was not very effective at first but just kept going forward and forward, probably about five times longer than it was worth. Although it was interesting that when it finally fell, it was obviously a film desire. I always appreciate such glances in old movie sets. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is a stronger part. It's a striking resemblance to Rome and Julia, but just when you think Chaplin is going to carry out a thematic experiment far from thematic style, it's a fun twist that is like vintage Chaplin like something I've ever seen. Nice work!
