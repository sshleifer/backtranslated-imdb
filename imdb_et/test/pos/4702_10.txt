Oh so beautiful, oh so tear and so intestine. <br /> <br /> Everything seems so superficial, so pale, so pointless compared. <br /> <br /> Sister Helen is not a true saint. <br /> <br /> He is a real human - faulty, raw and blunt, but passionate and with a golden heart. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing is that this handful of bad, unhappy people found meaning and laughter. <br /> <br /> Most of all, I loved how the documentary depicted the polarity of human nature.
