ALICE is a movie they did in the 30's and 40's. Never try to be an "event". Just want to entertain. And that is. I was surprised by Kiefer Sutherland. In a role that could be a cliche, he made it real. The plot has tips for ALICE IN WONDERLAND. A white dressed man goes through the hole and Kiefer falls down. Like ALICE, the plot does not tilt and rotates, but with freshness that you don't see in the small movies. I loved the direction, Sutherland, just a very fast paced and interesting movie.
