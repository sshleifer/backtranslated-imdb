It seems everyone wants to jump on wagons and say "Maha Go Go Go" .... The word is MACHA ........ Like "Mach" ..... Expressed land - also "... <br / > <br /> I grew up with this series in the late 70s here in LA on a late and very liar channel 56 ... Before that, Tetsuwan Atom (Astro Boy), from 1963 KHJ TV. was the first example of anime we got to this country ... I was an anime child and I followed it until the end of the 80s when it became badly animated ", a phenomenon that has only worsened." Nuff said. <br /> <br /> As for "Speed ​​Racer", I really enjoyed the basics, POV shots, the cinematic aspects of live action that have been skillfully adopted for animation ... It was quite typical for most Japanese anime ... Graphics Graphics Graphics Sometimes, note how obviously this series is inspired by Stanley Kramer's "Grand Prix" (1966), especially the United States Expanded credit. <br /> <br /> Yes, I have the original comics that the series is based on, so I know what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> What did we do with animation after John Quest like nonsense? ..... Th 'same ol' things we've done since the 20s .... Ho-hum! <br /> <br /> I think the real problem I had / had about how an anime was / was shown on American television is hatchet work on scripts, credits, etc. to "disinfect" the American audience ... don't go to other programs as we speak "Speed ​​here. <br /> <br /> Watch clowns like Peter Fernandez as one of the culprits here because he was 99% responsible for rewriting a series ... Not to mention Speed, Racer X and other voices ... between him and the fools of Trans / Lux (Think Felix, cat and mighty Hercules - they were!) Took a smooth, very sophisticated show and fell to the level of this Sesame Street. "... If I go, I'll dump it. <br /> <br /> This series dates back 40 years ago, but I had time to feel that this and other Japanese programs are stupid ... I think it's obvious when someone kills, but they either remove or shine it ........ Pleeeeeze! <br /> <br /> Good show - originally. Unfortunately, all the latest incarnations in the series are such that CRAPPY is "made in Korea", not to mention that it is essentially malicious. Even Japanese is ordering their animation now .. <br /> <br /> Try to look at Japan's original opening on YouTube ... It sends refrigerators up my back ..... If only ...... Oh well. Robert
