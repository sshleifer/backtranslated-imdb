In fact, the whole series is funny funny! But not always funny ... there are moments of extreme poisoning when one touches deeper aspects of human emotion. Time and again, the series is commented on the weaknesses of the long or, in this case, the eternal struggle of human nature and life. At the same time, the monkey is as clever as his fool, his arrogance and his dependence on his martial arts cause him in almost every episode. Pigsy is just general. Sandy has a philosophical mind. He has many witti features. <br /> <br /> English translation is a pleasure. "Ignorance can always be improved," Sandy pulls back, "but you can't do anything to help stupid!" "Who are you?" asking a group of passengers. "We're three King of Friends," says Monkey. <br /> <br /> It's not just for kids, it's a magical romp for anyone who can stop reality
