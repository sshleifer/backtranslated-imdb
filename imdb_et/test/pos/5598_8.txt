In this peculiar film, the end of the day and the themes of Satan are dealt with in a new way compared to Jesus. Jesus does not want to open the last two seals, and Satan is stuck in his quest to get another soul into hell ... Armageddon, Armageddon, and Jehoshaphat turn out to be the company! And life is a little hard to open. <br /> <br /> This movie is memorable with slanting, out-of-focus images, and light effects that are effective but sometimes irritating. And, of course, Donovan is great as a disappointed Jesus who is trying to reach an agreement on what the world and his people have changed! So, look at it if you have a chance!
