This film is well cast, often silly and always funny. Lemmon and Matthau are working for the perfection of their tag team. Brent Spiner is just a rebellion as a cruise driver's egoistic tyrant. From the first "rabbit krishna" to the last "you should pay fifty bucks for calling two studs", I thought it was a fun fun comedy
