Most of us who grew up in the '40s or' 50s were Westerners, but that was what escaped me until I saw the Men's Channels today. I loved the movie story, cinematography, as well as Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. with great casting in the lead with Ward Bond. Apparently, this film had inspired the later television series "Wagon Train", which again showed Bond, when the wagon boss rushed to the west. Johnson steals the film with his riding skills and it is nice to see that the actor doing his tricks like Ben is in the movie. Other characters include the beautiful Joanne Dru of Denver and James Arness's early non-speaking role, who later belonged to Marshal Matt Dillon's role as Gunsmoke. If you like movies in this genre, you can't do it.
