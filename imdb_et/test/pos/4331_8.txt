"Death Wish 3" brings back Charles Bronson's one-time vigilant Paul Kersey, now retired.yeah, just when the long Kersey is back on his old roads. But this time, not just a couple of bangs, who have taken over part of the city (New York again), this time their war, so Kersy Hauls looks out for big weapons (literally) that the body reads something to its competitors about Stallone or Schwarzenegger this movie is actually a bit fun to watch, especially for a couple of liners and of course bad guys die or creatively injured, which is always good. one, on this, obviously much larger scale, such as bombing your victims far, not from one fight. This film is a lighter tone than 1. 2, making it easier to watch. movie, its more esapism than anything. is also sometimes funny and pseudo-inspiring, but the hose scenes are gradually falling. they should have left the original "Death Wish" without the sequels, but since they didn't, they should have stopped here. 8/10
