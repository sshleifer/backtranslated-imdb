You loved the pictures of the airports - Dallas, Phoenix, Fresno, etc., Only a few buildings whose name is in the letter. And tri-engines and well-dressed travelers. Fast back and forth 75 years .... <br /> <br /> But what really got into my hands was a hammer and sickle emblem, and what seemed to be the Chinese ideogram next to the logo on the right side of the pilot seat body. Remember when a mutual acquaintance Neil and Jill meet that Jim becomes a general Chinese rebel army? What is based on a hammer and a sirel could only have been the revolutionary army of the Mao Tse Dung people !!! Don't forget the undies and beds without beds - has this logo and this reference been preserved during the Cold War? <br /> <br /> Additional Observation 12/27: This 30's film with the Soviet emblem may / must also reflect the influence and charm of communism in Hollywood and much of America during depression. Adds the historic value of this terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Also, I liked the American Dream aspects of two Winnemucca men who took at least part of the world by storm, Red-Blooded (literally and much for Jim) American Boys. <br /> <br /> Others have commented more than me on aerobics, etc. I loved it all. <br /> <br /> This pearl earned more than just 1.5 stars Osborne and Co, who rated it as TCM, but only for recording in the early 30s in American history.
