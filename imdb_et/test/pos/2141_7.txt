I'm a fan of the gate of heaven since its first release. I've seen it at least one and a half times and thought about it for a long time. So, with excitement and expectation, I took myself to the cut director to recreate. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I was disappointed to see it again and since then I've changed my rating. film. The gate of heaven touches on the majesty of parts, but in general there is no thematic and narrative continuity, and the passionate urgency of a truly excellent film. <br /> <br /> First, there are two technical problems: the sound quality is scattered throughout the film. , sometimes obscurity. Part of this may be deliberate - a way to mimic the chaos of history and confusion when it evolves. However, it is not possible to record in the main points what this character says. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is scattered similarly. The images lack the sharpness and specificity. The result is a certain amount of graininess and lack of sharpness in the image that can blur in the foreground and background. <br /> <br /> Structurally, the narrative is the key in everything, as Cimino can't quite think of the influence he has. He certainly wanted an epic. What about a pastoral or dramatic epic? The film is uncomfortable and convincing between styles and perhaps even genres. Sometimes it reminded me of Terrence Malick's "Heaven of Days" or even "Elvira Madigan", who is at an acute pace and in elegant scene painting. At other times, it threatens to become a powerful "western" that resembles "wild". In fact, the latter film provides an educational reference point for evaluating the "gate of heaven" because it shares the same time concern and uses the same ambivalent tone of nostalgia for a darker heroic America. <br /> <br /> This structural and thematic uncertainty is not helped by a poor quality script, which often sounds forcibly and at the ear. The result is an unfair feeling of periodic speech. <br /> <br /> Almost greatness of the heavenly gate lies in its set piece. Above all, the roller skating sequence is amazingly beautiful, one of the most enjoyable scenes ever put on film. <br /> <br /> The second set, which works very well when combining theme, mood and setting, takes place when Kristofferson and Huppert drive in a new rake by the lake and wash themselves under the guise of shadows. This scene combines a dirty temple, recognizable music, and monumental landscapes to convincingly depict the story of love that can just be at the heart of the film - and that could have been a scarce grace if it was continued more convincingly. <br /> <br /> Some critics have complained about the length of the movie. This in itself does not disturb me. A good movie can't be long enough. Recovered minutes are critical to restoring the lack of motivation and characterization from the cut version and are full of interesting images. <br /> <br /> Maybe the top of the Heaven's Gate is a brilliantly resembling soundtrack. Repetitive waltz and its different scores throughout (the whole band, the guitar, the solo violin, etc.) bring to the forefront the quality of excitement and create thematic continuity that is absent in narration. <br /> <br /> Despite the obvious drawbacks, especially the lack of an inadequate narrative, the film is great. Cinema leaves the cinema in a grand sense of supremacy and the desire for Cimino to look through the film - with wisdom from time to time - to correct it so badly.
