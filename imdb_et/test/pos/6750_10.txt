I think this movie was as good as it could have been. With only a 4-month and $ 52,000 budget - I'm surprised that it wasn't worse. If you don't want to take care of CG or special effects, this movie is great. <br /> <br /> Okay, the movie isn't so well done (I'm sure it might have been, but you're trying to do it in just 4 months), but the story is good and the movie is pretty exciting. <br /> <br /> Don't trust me when I say this movie is good because I find the King of 1933 good. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I didn't watch the whole movie ... I can send it here for a few minutes ...
