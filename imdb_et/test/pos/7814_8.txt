I tried it for the first time on television a couple of nights ago. I waited only a few minutes but found the movie interesting. Finally, look at it all and find it surprisingly convincing. The action of the three American leaders was pretty good, especially Alex Cord. He plays a pistol with a lot of vulnerability. Very different from how most of them are depicted in Western countries. He came to a number of situations where he was hunter of mercies. The final shootout between the three wires and the bad guys was very good, as was the scene where the doctor disappears from Clay McCord. Somewhat harsh but realistic. I have to admit that, despite my initial doubts about "western" spaghetti viewing, I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. I recommend it to anyone who likes the West.
