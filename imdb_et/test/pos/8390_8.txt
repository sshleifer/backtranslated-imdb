It just goes to show you how wrong you can be. I didn't expect such a movie. I was disappointed with both Kill Bill's films (though I preferred the other) and Death Proof (though it was better for shorter cutting of double bill release). I love Reservoir Dogs, admire Pulp Fiction, and I think Jackie Brown is Tarantino's most mature cinematic work - technically his best - including the last great performance that got Robert De Niros. Since then, it seems to me that when his films are okay (I have not hated them), he has taken water to reference, respectable, self-conscious jewelery. <br /> <br /> Then I read last year's Inglourious Basterds script - and I hated it! Of course this was some typical QT blooms and the opening stage was undoubtedly powerful. There were a few big characters. But on the page it was more juvenile garbage, which has greatly destroyed the size of the unusual generations of the title. It made me think seriously about not seeing the movie. Trailers didn't convince me. I only remembered when I was able to see a movie in London at Tarantino Q&A. I thought it would make sense to hear him in Q&A as I know from interviews how entertaining he can be personally. <br /> <br /> So little I had prepared the splendid joy and shine of Inglourious Basterdside. br /> <br /> Just Mr Tarantino's best work after Jackie Brown's triumph. <br /> <br /> Yes, references are there, but they don't disturb the story, they are not the driving force. Yes, Eli Roth is stunt pain, but he's working fine, doing little, but looking aggressive and not doing anything that would harm the film because I was scared. Though I admired Tarantino that he used Stuntwoman Zoe Bell himself in Death Proof to enhance the joy of the biggest stunt scene, his inability to act as a key feature of the film was. The same can be said about Tarantino's own performances in several films, especially Robert Rodriguez's "Dusk Till Dawn", written by Tarantino. <br /> <br /> What really does this job is how big it is. The spaghetti western vibe of a great deal of style, dialogue and performance is surprisingly surprisingly, without going too far into Kill Bill's drawing quality. Violence is so great. The cost is so great. Brad Pitt is so big! At the trailers, I was plagued by Hitler's moment and Piti's play, but in the context of the film they are fun. Pitt is really great, exactly what he needs to be. He is Mifune's Yojimbo's brilliant samurai, he is Robards Cheyenne from one time to the west, there is a great James Coburn vibe and of course the suitable Lee Marvin edge. <br /> <br /> Christoph Waltz (who I didn't know before) and Melanie Laurent (who I first noticed in Sean Ellis's brilliant British short film) are sensational, and I expect both to use much more in the future. Tarantino has obviously not lost his eye casting that seemed to have died in Death Proof. Waltz is equally big in his performance. Cooling, but theatrical. He's Fonda from OUATITW, Van Cleef, good, bad and ugly. And Laurent is suitably Cardinale's innocence, but hard, fighter. They both glare here. <br /> <br /> That every donor will have the fun he had, what they do, while they will not pamper themselves with fun and try to laugh enormously. The laughs - and there are loads - come organically. Only Mike Myers goes close to tilting the eyes and pushing it too far, but his scene has been just enough - with the help of the fantastic Michael Fassbender who seems to be drawn straight from Attenborough's Great Escape line. /> All actors shine and Tarantino throws strange prosperity, but those that work on the story. The introduction of Schweiger Hugo Stiglitz is a rebellion. After the sensational slow-burning opening and the glorious intro to those unscrupulous Basterdids, the pace never lets up and flies over two and a half hours. <br /> <br /> It also looks beautiful, marking it back to a true movie - manufacturing, not just self-conscious stupidity. Musical choices, as always, are inspired by Morricone. <br /> <br /> The movie is cruel and fun. After the summer, when almost every film is disappointed, it was a big surprise that a real fun and entertaining, but also inclusive and impressive movie should be like if I had never believed it in the form of a script. Welcome back to QT.
