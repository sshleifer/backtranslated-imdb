a very good episode, though not as devastating as the end of the 1st season. The idea to make this a great hit for Desmond's rebound, and Henry Ian Cusick was fantastic, maybe put the best results for this whole series, but my only complaint would be the plot of Michael's plot that seemed like a sub-block and thought three minutes after the previous episode that it would be more. But the strength of Cusicks' character and performance drew it. The plot development, as always, left more questions, then answers like those who are others, something we still don't know, and where they take jack, Sawyer and Kate. What was white light, what is its effect? Are Locke, Eco and Desmond dead? when the hatch destroyed them. If these were big mistakes because these three are the most interesting characters and the series suffers without them, and Terry O'Quinn has been fantastic in both series like Locke. Suitable for finale for better series than first.
