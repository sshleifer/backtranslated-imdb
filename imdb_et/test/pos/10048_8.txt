Although this film changes reality to make it more heroic and fun, sometimes fantasy is more enjoyable than in real life, and nothing can be more real than Errol Flynn playing Custer. That's the best movie about Custer. Max Steiner's music is great and the whole movie is playing Irish song "Gerry Owen", which was Custer's favorite. The movie should have more villains because they are trying to bring together all the bad guys Arthur Kennedys. Relationships between Flynn and De Havilland flow like no other film, and director Raoul Walsh, who has a lot of experience with external scenes, is his best.
