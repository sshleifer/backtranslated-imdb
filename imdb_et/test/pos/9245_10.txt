Nice doco Stuie! <br /> <br /> Although it didn't work with the original text, you have fantastic work and great viewing. <br /> <br /> It is clear how much you put it into everyone else. It's nice to see warts and all the results of the process without being "too nice". <br /> <br /> Loved It! An interesting view. <br /> <br /> Que pena, the "original" film writer, couldn't do what you have achieved. Great piece. Looking forward to seeing the next work. <br /> <br /> Keep on! Paully
