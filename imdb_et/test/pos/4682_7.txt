My reaction to the reassessment of this "Italian work" is probably hopelessly mixed with the events that occurred in my life when I saw it; This is the first film I saw after I had just gone back after 8 months of unemployment and after training. Money was still tight, but I didn't have to choose to see the movie in theaters and bills (or lunch) anymore, and the feeling of relief and gratitude was great. Consequently, the enjoyment of my “Italian work” was probably far from his real value. However, I chose it a few weeks ago when used on a DVD and looked at it again and I enjoyed it enormously. I've never seen this original (even though I've heard it is an absolute classic), but its contemporary colleague is closely watched if you have the taste of contemporary product values ​​applicable to older film surfaces and themes. <br /> <br /> What originally won me on this movie was the soundtrack - IMO Don Davis writes some of the most flexible, textured and phonetic pleasures. IJ opens up in a clever, witty, pulsating arrangement that combines strings, guitar harmonies, brushing, and quiet moments - it won me completely in the opening seconds. And the whole movie is like that - I haven't heard such a ringtone, chiming, pulsating soundtrack music, because Stewart Copeland left the police and started making a soundtrack for films like "Rumble Fish". Here are at least a dozen irresistible motifs with some pop music ranging from "all" and "inspired". For people for whom the soundtrack is important, this film is a joy. <br /> <br /> About Movie: I can leave or leave Mark Wahlberg, but he is the leading man here, and the film doesn't ask him to do anything he can't do well. He is the weakest "big" actor in the film, but that's because the rest of the cast cast is so strong, especially Donald Sutherland a bit. Mos Def, Jason Steadham, Ed Norton, Seth Green and Charlize Theron all become strong and fat free. Norton seems to be mostly calling (the rumor is that he didn't really want to be in the movie), but he's still natural even with half power. One of my casting and acting is a "wrench" character that seems to be a male model pretending to be an actor. His part seems to have bent on the film and he has little chemistry with the rest of the pain (though you can blame this part because of the size and nature of the part "late walking"). If I was cynical, I would like to ask who the actor was high to make this film a supernatural role in it? Nah, never happens ... <br /> <br /> Production values, camera work, stunts, plots ... all the chef pretty nicely and Gray and his production team pull things up quite smoothly (except for the "Wrench", see above) . The dialogue has a nice, light touch that rewards your entertainment and there are a number of satisfying major and smaller payouts along the way. (My favorite moment - when Norton's character tells Wahlberg's character that he's just surprised, Wahlberg goes on the cold cock of Norton's right cross and asks, "Were you surprised?" Hmmm, maybe you had to be there ...) > <br /> Of course, the film needs a certain level of "stopping the beliefs" to work, but if you just relax and go with it (and don't think too much of a safe underwater cracking mechanism or the likelihood that someone can successfully hack and manipulate LA traffic on your laptop) etc.), you have a fun ride. <br /> <br /> "Italian Work": It is a mild summer fluff, but it is very good what it is, and it is not trying to be anything else. It's not good enough for "8", but I'd give it "7.5".
