I saw it on television and recorded it. My daughter played it over and over again. I borrowed at work and everyone just loved it. It's just a great physical comedy. Bill appeared here in California (he worked and lived in New York) and staged a performance flight. I was able to see this great performance with my daughter and her girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Bill was given a federal donation and my daughter wrote a letter of congratulations and Bill was so kind to write her back and add a photo. <br /> <br /> People ask me and I can't decide if he is a comedian, an actor or a clown. In fact, he's all three. I really want it to be on DVD, my bird is gone.
