I have not read Anne Rice's novel based on this film, but who knows maybe reading a book is cheaper than renting an enemy queen and is probably better for your health. It is not that this film is necessarily bad for your health, but the book can be very relaxing and definitely more active in your brain than this film. You can read the number of Anne Rice pages you read on the one hand, but after this movie and interview with Vampire, I see that she really writes good novels. The plots of both films allude to a deep and intertwined vampire newspaper. <br /> <br /> However, Stuart Townsend's voice launches are much more annoying than Brad Pitt's vampire stories ever did, and you can say that DAMNED's limited production resources don't give Anne Rice enough meat. Although the interview decided to go with lace and elegance, QUEEN relies on low-budget special effects that are serious about taking seriously. It can be seen that the original novel had the potential for the film and that the production team paid attention to the wrong places. Costumes and the rock-roll stage could have replaced more blood and eerier soundtrack. <br /> <br /> However, I will give credit when the credit is due. The soundtrack is great. Korn and Disturbed took me to the hospital, where my nose like Butthead strikes. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with a very cool Goth-rock zoom & splice assembly, but after the first ten minutes, the degeneration is quick. It would be as if the film was so long that the director realized that there was not enough time and money to make Anne Rice's novel justice. What results are some mediocre vampire scenes and many cheese special effects. Unfortunately, the rights of the queen are not just as her John Carpenter colleagues can't impress. Where are the yellow contacts? Where is Blue Blue Makeup? Scene after the scene, I shook my head, remembering Salemi Lot and Fright Night when there was a small budget. <br /> <br /> However, the redemption features that store the garbage of this movie. Turns to Aaliyah and his soul forever in peace. He could have been a famous actor if his life hadn't been taken from us so prematurely, because he gave this film a decent performance with many nice dances. Did I mention that the soundtrack was good? Let's see what else to say? It wasn't too long. Anne Rice's novel could easily have been a three-hour film when an ambitious director like Francis Ford Coppola got it. The plot has a few turns here and there. All in all, this legitimate rock role played a role in the vampire films of the second level. The director of this movie led the new Battlestar Galactica mini-series if it tells you something.
