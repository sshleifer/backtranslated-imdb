I looked at it in the early eighties. Sam Waterson turned out to be a great actor. In fact, when he started the law and times, I was disappointed because it was not such a powerful role. Unfortunately, good roles do not pay bills. I wish I could find a copy of this rare series and look through it. It is both factual and entertaining. Everyone should see what actually happened. I was so moved that I bought and read the book "Pppenheimer-Shatterer of the Worlds". And he saw this man become an unlikely hero who could never be rewarded for his understanding. If you get the chance to watch this movie and see what Mr Waterston's presentation is really an audience. Enjoy movies!
