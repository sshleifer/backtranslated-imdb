Christopher Nolan's first feature film won the critics who saw it for the first time. The micro-budget is $ 6,000, a real-time student film. The film is filmed in black and white and the person you think is a friend of Nolan's film. That doesn't mean they're bad actors because they're pretty good. You may see Jeremy Theobald and Alex Hawi present in other projects, but unfortunately they have not been made since 6 years ago. about like Pulp Fiction. Writing is fantastic. This is a big twisted thriller, but as the film's time sequence shifts, it makes it even more interesting. I thought the last ten minutes, when everything was getting clear, was great. <br /> <br /> For a small budget movie that doesn't have any recognizable names at all, it's so good. It's better than what Hollywood studios offer and Nolan after three movies (it's better Memento and not quite as good, but still excellent Insomnia) as the most exciting talent of recent times. I can't wait for Batman. <br /> <br /> This movie is short and lovely and definitely a great watch. It is very professional and the twists are fantastic and completely surprising. I also thought that David Julyan's score was excellent, very atmospheric and had great quality. He has continued with other films by Nolan. In general, I would recommend this, I'm going to get all Nolan movies. This is a low budget. ***** <br /> <br />
