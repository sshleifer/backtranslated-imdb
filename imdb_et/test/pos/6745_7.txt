(Some Spoilers) Sweeping New York to a first-class railroad wagon killer, not killing with a gun or knife or club, but just for him or her immunity and breathing. A killer who is the same old or even older is the man himself. This killer has a name that he feels like smallpox around the world. <br /> <br /> Arriving in New York on a cold afternoon, Sheila Bennet, inside Evelyn Keyes, and like Trojen Horse, waits until she presents herself. Then like a tick where this fuse shut-off has exploded across the city in length and breathing. <br /> <br /> Sheila is known to be followed by a US customs officer who has been a tail after she returned from the US island of Cuba. Having smuggled illegally cut diamonds for $ 50,000.00, he had to be careful to get them to his wife, Matt, Charles Korvin, to cut them and sell them to unsuspecting jewelers in the city. <br /> <br /> Posting diamonds ahead of time Sheila knows that when diamonds are caught, she won't find them. What he does not know is that Matt is timing him twice when he interacts with his child's sister Francie, Lola Albrght. Worse still, he is going to look out of the city, leaving him with diamonds as well as Francie, who holds the bag. <br /> <br /> Although we know about the beginning of the deadly state of Sheila, it doesn't really come from "Killer, who's in the New York shelter", the crime rate / drama with US customs officers and NYC police looking for stolen diamonds. When Sheila begins to get sick and starts to infect everyone she's exposed to the film, the street-type horror film reaches a massive panic point. <br /> <br /> Both the police and customs officials, along with the city's health surveillance team, are fighting the clock to find Sheila before she infects the entire city of New York with a deadly pox infection she carries. Sheila discovered from Matt's boss Willie Dennis, Jim Backus, that he was giving up his work as a nightclub piano player and that he had a thing with Francis who knew what he was wearing. <br /> <br /> Against Francie in her apartment, it turns out that Matt was not just Shelia, but also his sister. Later, guilt is led by Francie's own life. Driving and knowing she's infected with smallpox, Sheila goes to her brother Sidi (with Bissell) who manages the Bowery flop to find a stopover. Just too late to know Sheila and Sid that stolen diamonds are the last of her problem. Knowing that she dies Sheila goes to the jeweler's Arnold Moss office, Art Smith, knowing that her husband Matt, who got into the old man's Moses bloody cellulose, slips into a ball, to get him exactly revenge. <br /> <br /> The Doucmentry-type drama, based on a real story with striking black and white photography, transforms this movie into the horrors of invisible and deadly pigeons that have unleashed an unsuspecting public that is worth looking at.
