... And there were quite a few of them. <br /> <br /> I don't like this comic as many others, partly because it was done during this time. I prefer many cartoons with Daffy and Bugs, fifteen or so years earlier. Many people want it, especially people who always find it funny, comic or not. The main plot is pretty well known to Looney Tunes: Elmer goes hunting, Daffy takes him to Bugs and Daffy arrives instead. There are also quite clever and very fun jokes entered (some don't fix the episode), ugly shooting and animation that is a bit mediocre. The plot is mainly aimed at jokes - every joke keeps the episode going. Looney Tune is not that unusual (of course, if you're pretty much a Looney Tunes boffin - or eager - like me, you know it already). <br /> <br /> For people who love everything from Looney Tunes and Daffy Duck, and like what I'm talking about, enjoy "Rabbit Seasoning"! <br /> <br /> 7 and 10 out of 10.
