I just saw this movie in preview and I can only watch it. It was about 90 minutes long and when it was over, I felt it could go on for hours. The stories of the main characters are so realistic and you really feel at home. The film consists mainly of dialogues, but I did not have a dull time. 18 people with really different characters and each of them worked so well. I had to laugh, I felt uncomfortable, was sad and still feeling good luck. All in all, this film, which shows the different people of our society, the way they interact and how love has changed and is now considered an economic thing. Dating becomes something that is similar to audition. The whole audience loved it. So please see if there is a chance. You love it!
