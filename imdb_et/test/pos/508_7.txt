"Blade" would be an extremely average comic book, vampire action / horror if it wasn't two minor flaws. # 1 I loved seeing all but invincible blades / snips that make their slicing and cube, but the whole "Yes!" The fist / punch was literally a drop. # 2 Bad, Don't Make That Terrible, CGI? even the 1998 standards. This is mainly in the last third, but some are scattered all over. Well, despite these minor violations, I really enjoyed this movie. All the participants did suburban work and the fact that it looks like another "matrix" that is fun, given that it came out one year earlier. So maybe "Matrix" copy "Blade". In any case, it is a movie for several genre-pleasing audiences: comic book geeks, action fanatics and horror / vampire peoples. So, we have Blade, half-man / half-vampire or "day-walker" and his achievements, Whisler (la "Batman and Alfred"), who fights with Undead, who is probably almost excluding people. Who knew? Human's rare work (Blade's more antihero) saves our sword ninja / vamp with a new infected (casual) blood worker / doctor. In the meantime, the vampires cause trouble, as the supreme power wants (you thought) and needs Blade somehow. This is not the most original concept when you read what I just wrote, but still very enjoyable. You want Blade to succeed, you do it, despite her imperfection and fashion. And you know what's coming, because it's a comic book action 1-2-3. However, watch it without trying to go too deep. For example, a Vampire SPF-1000 "Tanning Drink"? Really? What about the scalp? Isn't it still burning? Just like the money they burn for weapons? Okay, I'm going too deep. Again, sit back and enjoy the technically loaded fun.
