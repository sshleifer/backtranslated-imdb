The greatest tragedy man faces is that so often he can divine to become banal. As a result, there are so many tragedies. The death of Venice is one of the few films of patience and bravery to deal with this fact. It faces the eye and inspiration of these two most inevitable human forms - self-denial and disintegration. Undoubtedly, this is the biggest film that has no noticeable effect on the mainstream. Its harshly refined look, echoey sound, a blend of unmixed languages ​​and very difficult topics are impossible to copy: as much as his accidental production accident as his director's vision. The central performance, at the same time stiff, anxious and vulnerable to the space of expression and decadence, brings Bogarde, if not his generation's best British actor, definitely adventurous. We can keep sympathy because it desires it over and interesting, despite the endless close-ups and the Mahler score that plays him up Not on Friday night with his girlfriend, but definitely OK if you want to explore the limits of people's mental limitations.
