Written by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson. This space fantasy is led by Robert Parrish. An experienced American astronaut, Colonel Glenn Ross (Roy Thinnes) agrees with a manned flight to the sun. The mission is controlled by Jason Webb (Patrick Wymark) and his Euro Sec Space Agency scientist John Kane (Ian Hendry) accompanies Ross. Two are exploring a newly discovered planet that has the same orbit as Earth ... when it is always hidden on the other side of the sun. Ross is the only one who does this on earth and has a very incredible story. Special effects can be better than the story. However, it is fun to watch. Lynn Loring, Loni von Friedl, George Sewell and Herbert Lom are also cast.
