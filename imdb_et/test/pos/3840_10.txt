This is one of my favorite films. The story is just so fantastic and the characters are so good. Unlike other Disney movies of this era, this movie is not at all boring. 101 Dalmations, Peter Pan, Robin Hood, they were all good, but they lacked here. It's funny, creative and always a target. There's just something in this movie that you can't learn in books. However, this is never the best animation ever made. This title belongs to BRILLIANT Toy Story. But this is another respectful, immediately followed by Lady and tram. Just look at it and enjoy what is one of the greatest achievements of the cinema. And by the way, I'm not a little boy, it's for older audiences who want to restore their childhood. Absolute must!
