Of course, here are the things Coens and Elmore Leonard have done in the past, but what? If you want entertainment, wonderful and smart - "Judas Kiss" is almost perfect. Brides that are in an exciting position against the tongue do not get it (Talk about your sex and violence away from the straight line - keep your investors happy. It's an independent film making 101). As for the bunnies, I doubt it. This flick is obviously a love and budget probably not half of Mr Tarantino's salary. Maybe boys don't like as much as women. I thought it shook. Go to Coco!
