It must be one of Columbia's better post-Astaire music. In a picture produced by Arthur Schwartz and directed by veterinarian Charles Vidor, this image was brought to the map of Gene Kelly and confirmed Rita Hayworth's reputation as the main female dance partner of the cinema. He plays a slightly double role here, as he presents contemporary 1940s with Gene and co-star Phil Silvers, but also puts his grandmother, nightclub role in the late 19th century. <br /> <br /> Music should also be highlighted because it was the last project I think was legendary Jerome Kern (nowadays the most famous "Old Man River" and "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"), and his lyric was equally legendary Ira Gershwin. They gave a score full of charm and characterization. The music of the historical sequences is particularly remarkable, as it is so perfectly designed in the early 20th century idiom that was Kerni's original period. It's a bit like uploading one of your favorite bands in the 1970s, and listening to them makes the original style of that time. <br /> <br /> The story is quite insignificant, which is good for me as this film is as close as you will ever see in the Broadway music comedy style of the 1930s-40s golden age. Even film music aspects of the war propaganda of the 1940s give him extra charm when a talented trio sings "the road tomorrow" and even funny fun against American enemies and uses a period of slang like "gremlins". <br /> <Probably the most memorable force of the film is Kelly's dance "Alter-Ego Dance", which found that he is against himself and then dances like a metaphorical picture of a conscience battle. It prefers a large part of his later work and is in itself effective and memorable. <br /> <br /> Fans want to search for it for various reasons - Kelly fans will rarely see it outside of MGM, using a variety of regular MGM-like co-stars and music. Hayworth fans want to see that Rita is brilliant at the top of her fame and ability. And fans of classical Broadway music definitely want to hear Kerni's final score and marvel at the quality of Gershwin's words and the compatibility of their styles. This is a solid pearl of the Columbia music program.
