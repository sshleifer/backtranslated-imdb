this is a teen movie and though u watch wait for some nonsense stuff added here and there, but overall the film is effective very effective, it puts you in the issue and leaves you thinking the story is glove far drawn but is plausible and makes you feel good in the series, this do not like the usual done and tried on the way. the characters are pretty well defined and convincing. Justin stands out among all others and finally follows his speech, because he convinces someone with the speech he is just fine in this speech. She has to take on some more serious roles, she's worth more than just doing movies. etch this movie and release
