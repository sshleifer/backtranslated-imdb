I really enjoyed this movie, what it is: A funny little movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. Plot summaries are available everywhere so I don't go into details. Michael is not a complicated plot anyway. It simply relies on a great premise and leads the viewer to a wonderful journey. <br /> <br /> John Travolta as a chain of smoking, lady-loving, bar-beaten, angel eating pies is just perfect. And who doesn't love Sparky? <br /> <br /> Look at this if you want some laughs and good times. Highly recommended.
