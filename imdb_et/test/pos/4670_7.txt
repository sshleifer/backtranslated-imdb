Not a movie to see if you want to intellectually stimulate. If you want a lot of fun in the theater, it's still one. Lots of gentle catching (and really cheesy beating). Mos Def and Seth Green are very funny as comics. Exciting and creative heists and chasing. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron (sexy) are tempting leaders. And Donald Sutherland!
