Just looking at it then. It's pretty funny. The fighting is fantastic and magic is really cool! It's like a video game, with an amazing hand-to-hand fight. <br /> <br /> This movie is meant for fans: "For those who loved this world earlier, gather their friends again and devote their time ..." In addition to this malicious opening, the story was not very difficult to follow and Ihave never played Final Fantasy game, I think it's worth playing roles playing in general, knowing the genre can help you understand some of them, but I think that if you pay attention and accept what the movie throws at you, it's quite easy to understand. which is not explicitly explained, and if you insist that it should be, it is likely to be confusing and irritating. <br /> <br /> Watching a movie is like falling in the middle of some grandpa and putting as much puzzle as possible. this approach; you get stuck with the mystery and confusion that all the characters are over, but just as I said, just agree. If the weird red lion that speaks, turns up and starts taking the ass and names and the other characters say he is an old friend, accept it and move on; you do not need a biopsy rebound, nor say all-in. You are an observer here, something that is beyond your experience and unwanted. <br /> <br /> So: fantastic graphics and animation, great voice-acting, cool video games with story and characters, and maybe some of the coolest struggles you can see for a while. It is worth noting, and although it is for fans, it is perfectly accessible to people like me who have never played games.
