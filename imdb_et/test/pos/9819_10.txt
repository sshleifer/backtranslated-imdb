This is one of the few movies that I was advised to be completely brilliant, which is actually. If you give this movie a small note if you didn't really have that point. You could describe Foscat as manipulative, but what if it is really serious that he will get sick if the love he is sure does not respond. But what would you do if you are sure the other loves you, and it's "only" rejected by the fact that you're ugly. Don't you fight for it. At least I think it is better to fight for what dies in bitterness. And it reminds me that I, the man, at first glance, fully responds to Fosca's physical disability and does not look beyond the person he or she may have. This film faces me with very solemn questions of respect, trust, manipulation, and so on. How do I now if someone manipulates me or tries to contact me? What I think is the most prominent feature of this film is that Ettore Scola made it absolutely unbelievable that Giorgio falls in love with Foscasse.
