Although this film never gained commercial recognition, my experience has led to the conclusion that many pieces of well-made artistic expression often do not receive mass complaints. The story draws a little boy who steals a car and starts a surreal, dreamlike adventure that has very little basis for conceptualizing our time and space. Therefore, anyone who tries to look at the reality of the film is likely to be disappointed; it is not meant to be "realistic". However, it is meant to be metaphorical with a large symbolism that is obvious to those with special attention to detail. In addition, symbolic images are left open for interpretation, which can be said about many great works of art. Don't cover yourself (if you rent or buy this movie) - the film isn't what seems to be on the surface.
