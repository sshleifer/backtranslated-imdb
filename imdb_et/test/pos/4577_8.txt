This movie served better. Mike Judge's satirical spirit highlighted something that is too much in this country, trying to deny ... we can ignite it as a society. <br /> <br /> Can 24-hour Anna Anna Nicole coverage be more proof? Mike Judge paints a frightening future, where the stupid survives and evolves. Stop and think and laugh at you. Can you look at the world and not ask if we get blurred? Are we going through both the human trash and our own trash? (Beware of landslides). <br /> <br /> The movie is really funny. I'd tell you more about the plot, but I don't want to spoil it. <br /> <br /> So why release this movie with ZERO ad? Could it be that the fool has already taken over?
