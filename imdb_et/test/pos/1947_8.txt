Finally, I saw this video after years of listening. It's not an ideal movie, but it's a strange hypnotic - one of those rare specialty films that creates your own world. *** SPOILERS *** First, bad things. Burkewaite class scenes are torturing. Even if the subject is social research, this man is up. His calls are so overwhelmed that they are ridiculous. And any teacher I would never have had had their students grilled like this and tell those who protest "Shut up!" These scenes are short, but they break the mood and pull the viewer out of the story. Next, how the hell is Layne just leaving the police station, will it end? What happened to Samson's car after the city's first scene? He spends the rest of the movie, which is littered with Layne or Feck. *** END SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Ahhh, Feck ... this guy is great. Dennis Hopper steals the movie effortlessly. "Check in the post", "I love the company", "you are my friend" - each line is classic. He gives Feck an inner logic that makes the story work. Incredibly, he makes the audience empathy, especially when Samson talks about his (Samson) future. <br /> <br /> Crispin Glover, on the other hand, is sometimes difficult to take. At the same time, his scenes in Beetle are perfect - kids in high school always have something to do and buds do. Matt's low-key attitude is good for Layne - their friendship is plausible. Glover's motives are a bit much, but he's always consistent. He controls the plot and expresses the urgency that no one else is doing - just try to imagine this flick when Layne was as much a zombie as Matt or Samson - snoozefest! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** What makes the "edge of the river" uncomfortable is that Samson is not really bad in the usual sense. He is such a boring boy who became self-evident - in other words, like thousands of other boring boys. When he kills Jamie, he starts to get rid of it, which creates some tension when we wait for him to click again. *** END SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Part of this film's appeal is how activities remain with teenagers and their perspective. Parents are a comic relief - Clarissa's mother, Tony's father or overloaded - Matti's mother. This highlights how children hang with the attention that no one else gives them. It keeps the story focused on clicks and emphasizes that the only adult they can associate is Feck. "River's Edge" is a textbook on alienation. It tells you how inconvenient, mysterious and distracting a teenager is like any other film.
