I saw this movie for the first time in the early 90's and fell in love with it right now.Richard Benjamin and his wife paula made the film "Saturday 14th" in 1981. 1981, before the film, in 1983. this movie made me laugh several times.It also has a young m√∂lly ringwald, who later in the late 1980s continues with movies like a beautiful pink and sixteen candles.It is fun watching her a bit younger. not seen by many people .. i don't even think the average movie fan has ever heard of this movie. but when i came for the first time i was glad that i made this movie out of 10 out of 10 out of 10, as i think it is a fun movie for the whole family to enjoy.lastly i would like to say it is not available on dvd, so I picked up a VHS copy on eBay, so if your interested, you probably find one there. $ 20- $ 30 $ range, but I understood $ 12. I wish they finally released it on DVD.
