Picture it. Someone makes a movie about the Columbine or Virginia tech massacre, only the film is directed by a man who did it alone (I know it's not just me) and Sean Astin out of Goonies! a picture that terrorists cross the bucket with a bucket on doors and marbles and you must watch the movie. Unfortunately, this does not go all the way if the skateboard is on the floor for the evil Mexicans to travel, but on this side you have to give it over 7, but not 9, because it didn't go crazy enough. Unfortunately, he seemed to be a comic cheesiness, worthy of cult status
