I thought it was a beautiful movie. it's not my favorite of my movies - chungking express has this place - it's completely different from everything I've seen. it is slow (but not annoying) - it takes time and thinks about the characters .. there is minimal movement in the frame - the camera is wonderful. the actor is great. The film looks like a long warm relaxing drink.
