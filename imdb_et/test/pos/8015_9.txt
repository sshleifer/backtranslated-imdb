These were two movie films, which Troama decided terribly, so that in a desperate movement it became one film. Maybe Troama's bitterness helped shine comedy, but for whatever reason, it's a very funny thing inspired by commenting on Oliver Stone. Lots of cameos, much to use Lesbian Cannibal HoeDown song to add fun. Trey Parker, Ted Raimi, Julie Strain etc etc. <br /> <br /> One of the best recent Troama releases. Yes, it is all over the place, I know that is happening, the quality or lack of production becomes one of many running jokes. Go to it and you are on time at the right time. <br /> <br /> Behind the scenes, the best Troama releases are still higher than average. I really think that the anger they felt about these two tough movies helped them, but not the greatness, but drove them to "fix" the movie in a way better than any film they had originally planned.
