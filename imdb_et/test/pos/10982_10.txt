At a time when Hollywood thinks that louder, faster and more bloody are better, Heavenly Heaven is a comedic and touching look at something we've all thought of: What would I do if the heaven's burden fell. <Br / Interestingly, the characters did for many years to realize that money was not a difference in their lives. They all get what they were supposed to be. Unfortunately, in most cases, they were unhappy, despite their good luck all these years ago. <br /> <br /> Although Manna offers familiar Hollywood good and evil, or event generosity, events. vs greed that puts it on the film is that the good wins, making evil, not breaking it. <br /> <br /> I think the important message of this movie is that you can change the world ... even if you do it at one time.
