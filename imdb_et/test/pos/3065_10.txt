Just like all other Mel Brooks comedies, men's tights are fun. But if it is a terrible comedy, I think many don't realize that the reason why the movie is so funny is that the characters themselves work so well. Elwes is a well-known former British nobleman, Lewis is an ever-evil king (I hope it's all worthy!), DeLuise is a godfather of FANTASTIC, Roger Rees is a worried and cynical sheriff. Actors and actors are so loyal that jokes flow easily. Yes, we've seen this comedy before, but I think The Big Lebowski is the only one to develop the better character of comedy. Very very funny.
