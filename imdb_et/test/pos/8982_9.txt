Mike Nichols at its best. I was not a "Closer" fan, so it's refreshing to see him right again when this comedy is in the dark. Just one sliding tone could have destroyed this overwhelming picture, but Nichols and his very strong A-song cast did not make it a congenial but completely convincing congressman, wrong. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman as Normal is brilliant and brilliant - here's a damaged but extremely clever CIA manipulator, and it's in between Hanks and Hoffman characters, where comedy breaks. It is rarely ridiculous and intelligent in film music ... It occasionally hits a biting satirical edge that makes you laugh and cry in the world (often simultaneously). /> Another big plus is the length of the picture. The film is based on George Crile's book of the same title fat. The temptation of the Aaron Sorkin scenario (his claim to fame is "The West Wing") must have been a fat film, but what we get is a 90-minute odd couple of minutes with great consequences. <br /> <br /> This film is worth seeing and recognizing the exceptional balance between the darkest object and the brightness of its sparkling wine. and Wilson and the Final Consequences (9/11).
