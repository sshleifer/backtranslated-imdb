This movie was great! I love how it mixes dark humor with drama. There are times when you think it is not possible how you can laugh with the situation and you still have a surprising strangle. It has worked great, with great performances by Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Daniels and Emile Hirsch. It is well written with stylish and surprising. I'm not saying that everyone wants it as much as I did, but I give it the opportunity and rent it. The DVD has excellent special features, including unanimous comments from director Dan Harris and Emile Hirsch and Sigourney Weaver, giving you interesting information about the film. I hope my comment is helpful and you enjoy the movie!
