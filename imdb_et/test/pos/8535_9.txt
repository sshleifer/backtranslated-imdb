I honestly didn't think in the beginning that this film would make me laugh like hell and admire the great gore effects, the boy was wrong! From the beginning to the end of the movie, there were some big effects, including other titles like "Evil Dead" and "Gremlins". This movie could be compared to Peter Jackson's works of art, though this movie is not as funny as "Braindead", but I'm sure to wait for these boys to make another spray.
