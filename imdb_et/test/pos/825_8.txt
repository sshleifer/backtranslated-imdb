After 10 years, it is finally possible to say that our Belgian Action Star is back again. Personally, I found it even better than Wake Of Death, which makes it your best movie ... 10 years! Okay, it doesn't like his highlighting years like Timecop, Universal Soldier, Sudden Death or even his best efforts: Hard Target (one of the best action films ever made by one of the best executive John Woo). funny, it's better than expected. Bad guys are fantastic like Hard Target and fighting scenes are "old school". Real fans know what to expect. I have to say I gave it up, but Van Damme is finally back. Please, please ....
