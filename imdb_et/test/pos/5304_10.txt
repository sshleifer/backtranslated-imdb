The magic of Hayao Miyazaki continues with this absolute crowd of entertainment by Ponyo Cliff by the Sea, his latest animated movie that turns on ordinary sweetness to beat his socks. I thought the trailer presented a song that was quietly hypnotic, and I didn't have to wait for a call to make sure I got my ticket for the movie theft preview that is scheduled to open next week. <br /> <br /> For fans of Studio Ghibli movies, you probably know what you are, because Miyazaki is another winner in his filmography, fighting for new fans. I am embarrassed to say that I have so far only looked at my neighbor Totoro (eyes that Ghibli's DVDs) and love it for bits, but I think it would be the last pressure I wouldn't miss what I don't keep . probably these animated movies I would enjoy. <br /> <br /> Ponyo (expressed by Nara Yuria) is a magical goldfish that wants to know what life is outside of the sea, its continuous poison on the surface blinking water. Nonetheless, these ambitions do not work well against their humanoid father, Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji), who keeps some hatred against human race pollution, and also touches upon the minimum level of conservation / revenge. A happy day sees Ponyo being washed to shore and pulled by a five-year-old boy, Doi Hiroki, who lives in a house at the cliff with his mother Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko), while his father Koichi (Nagashima Kazushige) is mostly at sea because he is a sailor. And you can expect some setbacks for a small mermaid or children's splash. To say something more, it would be a violation of fun. <br /> <br /> This work of art is still simply amazing, although it is in 2D honesty knowing that every cell has worked diligently. At the same time, there are so many things inside the same frame that you are likely to be a recurring view to see them all. Certainly, it will win every 3D or CG animated production every day, given the beauty that comes from simplicity, not just from the art department, but from its story, despite complaints that it took Hans Christian Andersen's classic. Although there are ways to make this movie dark, it only suggested certain dark topics, but chose a film that is more suitable for more positive emotions, suitable for both children and adults. <br /> <br /> Love, between Koich, Lisa, and Sosuke family members, and especially between mother and son. What's more, it concerns the love of the boy and his new pet fish he baptized with Ponyo, and I tell you that Ponyo's self has enough brightness for him to win Bolt, WallE and Eve, just like all hands down. The characterization here is the upper limit, and it is not difficult for Ponyo to fall in love, no matter what form it is received, especially if he is a playful creature who does not hide his emotions - if he is upset with you, does he turn away or could wait that jet stream will start to fly from your mouth! <br /> <br /> Clony, at the sea of ​​Ponyo, is sure it will not hesitate for my top films. And the next time I go to Tokyo, I'm sure Hell will go to the Ghibli Museum to bring Hikao Miyazaki under the magical world. A highly recommended movie, so you won't get lost on this big screen!
