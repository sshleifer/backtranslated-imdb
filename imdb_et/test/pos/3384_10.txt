I really enjoyed the north and south very much. I think it's one of the best and rich TV series I've ever seen. The cast caliber is amazing, you have actors from the "cinema goldman", people like James Stewart, Gene Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor, Robert Mitchum and Jean Simmons with other actors who were new faces of the 80s like Patrick Swayze, James Read, Jonathan Frakes, Genie Francis, Philip Casnoff and Lesley-Anne Down. The story focuses on the friendship of two completely different men, Orry Main (Patrick Swayze), who is from the south and George Hazard (James Read), who is north. Throughout the series, their friendship is constantly threatened by differences in their backgrounds, especially with regard to the treatment of slaves in the south (especially in the Orry plantation), but when everyone needs it, they forget their arguments and go and help their friend. I really liked the chemistry of two men and was really interested to see if their friendship could survive the war. <br /> <br /> I liked how the series showed what life was before the war so that the audience saw what were the factors that led to the war that then happened, the destruction of the disintegrated people, and then the country to which the country was again build up. War scenes were very choreographic and very realistic for me. <br /> <br /> I think it's nice to have so many elements going through it, romance, history, battles that interest most audiences, something for everyone. I especially liked the romance of Brett (Genie Francis) and Billy (Parker Stevenson / John Stockwell), especially when he first came to his sister Ashton. The other romances were interesting because not everyone was the same, each of them had something else that kept me watching Madeline and Orry's story, to see if they would end up together. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best American small series I watched, the story was the right balance between romance and the more serious historical side that happened in the country at that time, but that's just right. The characters are very observable and the locations are beautiful and the music is especially good at the beginning and end of the episode, so it is good and works with the mood.
