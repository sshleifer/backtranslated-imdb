This mystery / psychological-thriller is, in my opinion, one of the best I've ever seen. All the actors give a great result, especially Jennifer Rubin Jamie Harris, who from the start of the nervous constellation turns into wonderful characters. You learn a lot about the real emotions of the people in this movie and a lot about the film itself. At the beginning of the film and with the game that he plays with the "acting coach", the film is interesting for the film. Mark Snow's music is probably the best result I've ever heard. You won't forget this movie!
