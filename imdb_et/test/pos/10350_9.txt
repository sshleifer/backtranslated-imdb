I'm so glad I filmed this movie last month on the BBC! It blew my mind so that the gut was silenced and real. David Tennant is absolutely fabulous in this, although his character is not always that simple or similar. The last scene in which he plays the song broke my heart, those eyes .... <br /> <br /> I think he made this movie dr. the success achieved for me. I just love dr. Who else and I saw him in depicting Tennants from a man who knows he has changed and is struggling to create some new identity and life. intense drama!
