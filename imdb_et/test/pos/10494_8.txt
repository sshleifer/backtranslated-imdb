I have to admit that when I first started watching this movie, I had no idea what was going on. So the start was a bit confusing for me. But it didn't reduce my movie enjoyment. The characters are more complex than they first appear, and this makes it a memorable film. At first I heard it was a real Hollywood movie. Although there is clearly no stereotypical "weapons and fists" element, talented actors such as Martin Sheen and Sam Neilli are more convincing than this. I see a movie that has more content than every day.
