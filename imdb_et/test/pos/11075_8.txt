From East PA, directly on the North New Jersey border, I still feel that it was a documentary more than a movie. I have friends in New York and New Jersey, and this film is a lifestyle that is now in the "lower income" area outside the "Big City" lifestyle. If you haven't seen this movie and never thought about what's really going on in the city jungle, check out this movie. Not really with big namesplayers, as if they were just those men who pulled out of the street and said that this action, which adds to the realism of the movie, is still FANTASTIC! Watch this movie!
