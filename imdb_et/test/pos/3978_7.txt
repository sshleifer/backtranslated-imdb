Great movie. The film was even better than the ads. And believe it or not, it was very inspiring. I really think somebody who leaves the movie at the end is inspired in one way or another. I laughed. I laughed very partially. Operation is above average, something special, but better than average. I can say for sure that this was the second most fun movie this summer (the first more fun is CLERKS II). So after that I give it 7/10 (high seven, but not quite eight).
