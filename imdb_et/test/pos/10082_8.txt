I've seen this movie twice, both times at Cinemax. For the first time in an unrated version that is best and secondly trimmed down (cut out all the sex and most nudity extract) that was entertaining in the usual sorting of beach films. The unrated version has a huge sex event with Nikki Fritz, a dude and a bottle of oil that is out of the world. Unfortunately, in the cut version, this scene is almost completely cut, as are all other sex scenes. It is fun to look at all the siblings of the larger stars (Stallone, Sheen, Travolta, etc.) who are trying to act, rated or not. We also get B-queen Linnea Quigley and Burt Ward (Robin's old Batman series).
