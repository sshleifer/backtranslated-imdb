I've heard a lot about "English patients" and I finally decided to get on the CD and find out what the whole ballyhoo was. What I discovered was cinematic joy and should, I repeat, "should" always be open minded. If you are a religious, moral passion, I am afraid that this is not a movie for you because you do not see the beauty of this cinematic masterpiece if you continue with the moral dilemmas created by this film. As I remember this movie correctly, I read this movie and read the review of this site and the views of the person I quoted were thoroughly talked about "that the protagonists deserved what they got". I agree with him about morality, but this is not the way to comment on this great movie. I rarely admit that I've seen such a wonderfully crafted movie. I hear background music in my subconscious. First of all, it is a love story and yes, it is an extraterrestrial thing (moralists warn) but can't focus on it. Instead, we focus on how the story was spoken. This is a setback and current mix. It has taken place in World War II and tells us about the survivor of the plane crash (Count Almazhy, played by Ralph Fiennes excellently), who is taken care of by a military sailor (Juliet Binoche) in a war-ridden Italy just before it began. to the end (defeat of axle capacities). A burnt-out healed patient struggles with the pain he remembered when he had English with Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas), who appeared in pre-war Africa. The past and the present intertwine so adroitly the story that you're sort of shipped the story and get a feel for the first hand viewer. The refugees in the desert and in Italy are beautiful. I'm romantic and I'm not ashamed to say I had tears after it was over. See it for someone you really love. The film begins and ends with the same desert where the sand dunes twist and curve like a woman's body and it was breathtaking. The sense of loss and sadness was so overwhelmed by the actors that it makes me think why God! Why do we have wars that destroy beauty and the most unforgivable, the destruction of innocence. Anyway, it deserves a lot of Oscars and I'm going to hunt for works by other director Anthony Minghella. This brings back the romance of David Lea's film genre. Arab Lawrence, also located in the desert.
