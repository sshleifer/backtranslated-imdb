This is a fantastic movie, and if you haven't seen it, you should go to a video store and rent it right away. First of all, it's great. This is not just about the current letters like Ryan Philippe and Billy Bob Thornton, but also the letters of your letters like Judge Reinhold. There are also many actors like Jon Bon Jovi, Ted Danson and Jamie Lee Curtis. Second, the story was pretty good. It was interesting how they made the plot of the stoner film and made it almost dramatic. It takes the drug situation in the United States and instead of giving it a comic look like "Half Baked", it has a real, lifestyle image like "Traffic". So watch this movie if you are a stoner, it gives you an insight into what you love, if you do not take drugs, it gives you a more realistic view of drugs if either side wants you to see.
