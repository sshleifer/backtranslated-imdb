"All men are guilty," says police chief. "They are innocent, but it doesn't last." Add this bit of nihilism to Jean-Pierre Melville's fascination with the idea of ​​a bull's code of honor, and you have Le Cercle Rouge. However, this scream code is not just a cliché; it is an imagination even when the movie's morals - realistic moralists from their perspective, most of the other romantic moralists - started to make films on this subject. Their theme is that it is not what one does but how it happens. We end up with the most frequent stories of experienced men who have their own sense of respect, stories where fate, fatalism and codes lead things. <br /> <br /> For most mankind, except for screen writers and film directors, it would be a serious life, living with children and being a good friend. This polite fatalism is something self-conscious. Le Cercle Rouge is, in my opinion, a classic film for people who can secretly enjoy the last absence of a bus. But if Melville's Le Samourai - Criterion Collection is, in my opinion, the dominant story of the style, Le Cercle Rouge manages a great combination of style with a strong story and powerful actors. The idea of ​​the film is, in my opinion, pointless ... but the film itself is a first-rate experience. <br /> <br /> Melville's hopeless story about the three crooks - Cory (Alain Delon), Vogel (Gian-Maria Volonte) and Jansen (Yves Montand) - is based on the little wisdom that may be attributed to the Buddha: to all the men to whom is destined to meet, cannot change their fate. Perhaps, because some think that Melville himself did not think about the wording. In both cases, we know from the outset that this film does not end happily, depends on the fate and coincidence of things for us and reminds us of the nihilistic philosophies that we discovered and loved in high school. When Corey and Vogel meet and then gather in Jansen's unique talent, we are a one-way ride to rob an exclusive, heavily protected jewelry story from Place Vendome. Tensions arise because we not only know that the French police are after Vogel, we also understand that some of the identified fraud is after Corey. The great joy of the film was to admire the work Delon, Volonte and Montand brought to their character, and the intelligent ruthlessness that Andre Bouvril brought to his character, police captain Matte. Melville pulled me as he worked out these characters and his situations; he built me ​​emotionally and released me when he brought me to his probable fate assessment and let me see that it happens. Melville sets his own pieces - escape from the train, escape from the forest, later shooting in the forest, meetings with Matthew and the man who refuses to inform - with intriguing possibilities. He builds tension in all these cases, taking his time; a rare feature in making movies and an even rarer feature. And Melville takes time to build Matthew as an individual. Mattei is a nice, experienced man. She's lonely. She is routine when she returns to her apartment - she greets her three cats tenderly, pulls her bath and, when the bath fills, she presents them with food. I don't know who Matte should meet, but I hope this is someone who likes cats. <br /> <br /> Nihilism is always creative among people and some critics. In most cases, I find it much more difficult to exclude nihilism and simply live our lives without harming too many people. (And it's even more difficult to show convincingly in the movie.) \ TLe Cercle Rouge is a movie that tells me a little, but it's a nicely put together movie in my mind.
