I had never heard of this movie before I came over because I was reading the shelves of the local rental house. Having just seen Harry Potter's last installment, I was interested in Rupert Grint and wanted to see more of his work. I was thinking of reading the description as "an overflowing, evangelical Christian servant" and identifying an evangelical Christian, "Oooh? It should be interesting." And so it was. I found Mr. Brock's story both in words and in pictures; and unfortunately too familiar. The contrast he led about Ben's parents' interpretation of being a Christian was an amazing commentary on how Christians see themselves and the effects it surrounds them. On the one hand, we have Ben's mother saying, "Whatever happens behind their walls, Ben, we are ambassadors of God. We'll show the world a smiling face." On the other hand, Ben is a father who discusses the truth in his sermon at the beginning of the film. At the end of his monologue he says: "The more a person parades his Christianity for the benefit of others, the less I am willing to trust the Christianity they claim. God tells us that true faith is the freedom to choose the truth. how do you express it, how, how, at your disposal, these things are not consequences, be they Christians or atheists, if not in your heart. "If only our churches were full of Christians who attributed this last definition to what it means to be a follower of Jesus, not the first. What a difference! As a Christian and a psychologist, I would like to have a perfect but authentic faith in a perfectly polished image in everyday life. What a tragedy?" that I always have to play a role, if really, I just have to rest in freedom to be completely God who has made me, I think Mr. Brock gives a refreshing glance at what this freedom sees in Christ. I recommend this film to anyone who wants faith fresh to watch.
