I'm not a massive Disney fan, but my 7-year-old son is getting into them, so we've built quite a collection and this is one of my favorites. We saw it a few weeks ago and we have to see it one and a half times! OK, as others have pointed out, not the most complicated or inventive plots, but there's more to the movie. <br /> <br /> Great characters, Phil Harris steals an exhibition like Thomas O'Malley, but Edgar butler is not far away. Music is great - my disabled son always asks me to lift him up and dance with him "Everybody wants to be a cat," it says. And "Thomas O'Malley" is just as enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I am not sure why some people in this movie have such a decline after cats. And yes, it takes some of his hints "101 Dalmations" and maybe "Lady and Tram" (It's been a long time since I've seen it, so I'm not going to compare them), and while "101 Dalmations" is in some sense better, the "aristocrats" are much more enjoyable. Isn't that what these films are? <br /> <br /> Apart from "Peter Pan" (now this is the 10/10 movie) this is my favorite Disney movie. My 7-year-old son loves it, his dirty 41-year-old father loves it so you can't ask for much more family movies. <br /> <br /> Great!
