The philosophical, meditative tone of the film changes it in its own way. I'll give it 10 letters alone. However, what struck me with a special force was what I take, perhaps wrongly, as an Art Direction. Many of the interior pictures have a rich combination of colors, apparently based on very few Munsell color models and complementary ones. This makes the film seem to be unrealistic for today's eyes, but for me it is very beautiful as aesthetic work itself. I think this film is truly unique for its quality and if for any other reason it is full, careful and digitally restored. Fox, are you listening?
