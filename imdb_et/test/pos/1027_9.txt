Like the previous comment, I saw it in 1980 and has never been able to shake the comforting story, great acting and dramatic musical score. It certainly includes some of Sam Waterston's best work. He and the writers depict Oppenheimer not just as an unjustly sacrificed hero he was - but also naive, alcohol and snobbish, a round portrait of a stereotype.
