MCBOING BOING is one of the caricatures that have been stuck with the head over the years and finally decided to study it as it was pleasantly surprised and surprised by the people involved in the production. When I remember correctly, we had to look at it at the UHF station and that meant using a UHF converter that was not part of a conventional TV to watch a local station to see a great day on those days that showed the show even more mysterious. I remember all the sound effects Gerald spoke about. Great memory 50+ years ago. I have to look at what other memories are hiding on the web. By the way, I'm trying to make a computer animation where johnl3d gets to the picture
