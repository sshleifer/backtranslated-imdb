Is the black youth with a mental challenge a catalyst for uniting the people of the city of South Carolina? The answer seems to be that, despite his unfavorable situation, James Kennedy understood much more than what he received for the credit, and went to a sporting event. The film also tells us how many of us forget people who have problems that can help when we have only patience Coach Jones showed a young man from his heart for his guilt. <br /> <br /> "Radio", directed by Michael Tolllin, is a formula film inspired by a real story. But the film is not a complete failure, because the director was inspired by the performances of his great pain. <br /> <br /> Trainer Jones is important to get a young man called a radio because his passion for collecting sports is a passion he finds in this slow man who has only been hard in his young life strokes. From a poor background, the radio lives with the mother who protects her and doubts the coach's intentions. School children see a radio mascot, initially winning a sunny placement for everyone because it is a good person without the body dreaming. <br /> <br /> The film owes much to Ed Harris and Gooding to Cuba Jr. Mr. Harris, one of the best actors of our time, is never bored with what he loves with his presence. He gets the essence of a coach who sees the opportunity to change something that disturbs him from the past. Gooding Jr. of Cuba is also a young man with a mental challenge in his best imagination. <br /> <br /> Support cast is great. S. Ephata Merkerson, one of her generation's best actors, is doing an interesting job for Radio Mother. Alfre Woodard, another good actor, plays high school principle in style. Debra Winger has only a few scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> "Radio", being sentimental, warms someone's heart because it shows how we see some people in our society, something we don't know and how quickly we need to evaluate them. Michael Tollin puts us in a lot of ideas in the right perspective.
