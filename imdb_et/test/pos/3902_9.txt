William H. Macy jointly wrote, supposedly, Donald E. Westlake's best and most difficult to find the novel "A Travesty". * Very * faithful story, movie stars Macy as an unhappy man who gets too far over his head after trying to cover up to accidental death. Costars Adam Arkin and James Cromwell in good support. The strength of the movie is in a complex twist-twisted narrative and exemplary, especially by Macy, who routinely and cheerfully breaks through the fourth wall and gets away with it every time. A good story with a lot of dark humor took me enough to see it three times a week after it appeared. Prepare for your critical faculty hiding and loud, double-sided "wheeeeee!"
