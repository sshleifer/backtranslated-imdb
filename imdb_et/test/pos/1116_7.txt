This is a great family film that deals with terrestrial people who enjoy their local interests mainly in horse racing. Lloyd Bourdelle (Walter Matthau) is a farmer who also raises a quarter of horses and has a young son named Casey Bourdelle who loves horses. Lloyd is able to raise an adult horse he calls after his son, Casey Shadow, and this horse breaks all speed certificates and is the winner of a potential million dollar win. Sarah Blue (Alexis Smith) is interested in this horse and offers a horse to buy $ 500.00, but this horse gets serious injuries and Lloyd gets a serious setback that disturbs the whole family. Walter Matthau gave excellent performance and is a great movie to watch and enjoy.
