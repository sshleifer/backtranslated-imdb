This movie marks Peter Lorre's extraordinarily nice guy who immigrates to America. Unfortunately, right after his arrival, he is in terrible fire and his face is burned terribly. Because she looks so terrible, nobody wants to hire her and fail, she's staying in a crime to earn the money needed to buy a mask to hide her ugly. Where exactly the film goes from here, you just have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I made this movie 8 because for the money spent on it, this good movie fear is a lot of good to keep it interesting. The film could have degenerated into a simple horror or criminal movie, but it goes beyond what offers some real surprises. In addition, Lorre shows a great actor that he is capable of more than just supporting roles. It's a great movie and offers more than most of the day's A-pictures.
