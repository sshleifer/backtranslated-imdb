This totally strange function is a typical and exemplary example of a satanic shocking 70-year-old horror. The events are completely confused and it will take quite a while before you understand what hell is going on, but the clotting environment will suck you right away. Immediately unspeakable about the strange content that shows a couple of terrifying children who turn toys into a real war machine, you just know that it will be an uncompromising and sharp shock. "Satan's Brotherhood" soon seems to be another installment in the alleged and unofficial "creepy little town that hides the dark secret" genre. A young widow traveling with her new mommy girlfriend and 8-year-old daughter stops in a remote small town to report a car accident they saw on a nearby highway. The villagers behave very hostile and require visitors to leave immediately. The city is clearly swearing in fear and panic, as local children disappear inexplicably lost and unnatural forces keep everyone within the city. Hillsboro is in the grip of a satanic cult, apparently dominated by the elderly members of the community. I really liked "Satan's Brotherhood." The story reminded me of John Saul's novel, but I don't remember the title. They also discussed the cult of older people who abused young villagers for their greed. The film depends mainly on horrible landscapes (like dolls and witchcraft), but a slightly more inclusive and coherent scenario would have been nice. The topic often raises many questions and questions, and Director Bernard McEveety cannot always answer us. The climax is terrible, very seventies (that is, shocking) and unforgettable. Beautifully shot movie.
