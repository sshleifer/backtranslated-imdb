This is an old, old story: children have a party in an old house, demons are fired, death and free nudity occur. You all know it, it's still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Many people (okay, many horror fans) have a pleasant memory of this movie, and it's always with the slight fear that you're watching an old movie to see if it's still as good as you thought it was. Fortunately, this is the case. <br /> <br /> He has something for everyone (well, all that happens to men, I think). From a fun title and a shop-based scam involving the cunning use of Linnea Quigley's ass to a "mirror" scene with demonic fun, it is a blast from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Girls are cute, boys are. . . . man, death scenes are well done with some good gore effects and unlike some era horror it actually keeps a good atmosphere and even tension. Don't be wrong with me, it's still fun first, but it offers some nice moments that should appeal to most genres.
