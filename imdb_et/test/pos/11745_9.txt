This film is based on Han Suiny's book "Many Spreading Topics" and deals with Asian and White Race Relations from Han's personal experiences of growing Eurasia in China. This background and beautiful Hong Kong settings give this love story a unique and quite bold atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Moreover, this story is a stereotypical romance with a memorable song that is perhaps more memorable than the film itself. Beautiful Jennifer Jones looks and gives an excellent Oscar-nominated performance for communism in mainland China. William Holden never seemed to play a romantic leader as a journalist covering the war-torn areas of the world. The action is top-notch and the chemistry between the two lovers provides some real moments of affection for the silver screen that melt those who are romanticly inclined. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is really fifty Hong Kong, especially on a hill overlooking a harbor where two lovers spend their most intimate moments. The end is a real tear-jerker. Some may feel sentimental romances, but for those who enjoy classic Hollywood love stories, this is a shining example.
