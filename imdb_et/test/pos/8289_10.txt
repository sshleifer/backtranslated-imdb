There's no movie I've seen more than Chipmunk Adventure that day, nor do I have more luck with the movie. It's not the biggest movie or even the biggest animation film, but for the 8-year-old girl in 1988 it was the coolest, most fun and exciting movie! Today I still have the same impressive musical number, each of which is an epic tradition of 80's pops with amazingly dramatic songs (I think Pat Benetar is a helium, only a catcher). <br /> <br /> The controversy has mixed Chipette's song "Gettin 'Lucky With You" with a brutally hinted tone that seemed to me a lot of innocence. Looking at it as a rational adult, I can fully understand the concern; You have three young girls with hostile harem equipment who are passionately declaring "happy is all". The chips were ten times sexual for this movie. <br /> <br /> But this controversial issue is not even close to hide the animated adventure of Chipmunks' otherwise fabulous feature length, I encourage older and childless adults to check out this movie. Especially if you were a child of the early 1980s / nineties like me. :-)
