Unlike the previous poster, I liked celluloid therapy. It seemed good and made the movie much more enjoyable. For me, it did not in any way reduce the content of the documentary. In fact, I felt that the slippery look made me just lose its content. The previous poster was fair to compare the style to the Nike van; this is definitely this look. But to my taste, it worked really well (and I'm far from a Nike brand fan). <br /> <br /> I think the documentary should be made. I can't wait to see these promising filmmakers.
