An extremely firing vision of a war situation where a pair of Vargtimmen (ok, they have different names and initial situations, but the actors are the same) remain in the cross-section of the two fronts. Depicting counterparts as bogus, supreme powers is often caught in supreme surreal images and draws interesting parallels to Orwell's 1984, even though Bergman, in this context, is slowly pushing for a growing marriage at personal level. That is why numerous fundamental and philosophical questions about the marriage of Eva and Jan are important and important, while the threat and threat of external tears open up the inner currents previously covered with laminates. An intense allegory of the weak facades of civil society.
