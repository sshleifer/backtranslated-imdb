Let's face it, you know what to expect after setting up the 1990 Corey Feldman movie, there are probably boobs, guns and cars. saying that this film has more than just naked women (I am sorry to say) that it is mostly killing people in a variety of unusual and, as the name suggests, often "mystical" ways. I love the mad horror and I love this movie. If you don't, you probably won't. But I think it's worth the most people who give it a go, it's not so funny that it destroys your weekend or something. All in all, if his senseless fun, a little body-loving and 80's childhood superstar in your mood, then you have come to the right place. its a cracker !!!!
