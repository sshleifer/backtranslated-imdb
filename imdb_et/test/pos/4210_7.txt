It is a wonderful very fun drama with great pain. Garfield is great as a boxer who hides the police with this dirty team Dead End Kids. The most important of them is the beautiful Billy Halop, who has very moving moments. Gloria Dickson, who died very young when she came alive, is strong and very attractive, like Halop's sister, and in the early scene is Ann Sheridan on the edge of the start. Mai Robson is very funny as an old grandmother, but Claude Rains proves here that even a great actor can flounder when he is lying (who thought he was making him a tough New York policeman?). <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley proves that he was good with or without a music list. The film is moving at a terrible pace and the order of the water towers is very tense and well captured. The end result is well-established and there is nothing surprising or original about the plot, but I found this very enjoyable experience.
