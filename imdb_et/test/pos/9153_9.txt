And there's nothing wrong with that! I warmly welcome the comments of Boblipton and Snow Leopard. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to find this movie on the US DVD - I've never seen it before - I convinced the Goethe Institute here in London to show it in their Conrad Veidti season some years ago - and long to see it again. <br /> <br /> Barrymore is busy, as in this movie, maybe due to his famous German actress. foil. And Face is so wonderful, stealer (does she pick her nose from one point?) This is one of the films that connects 'Dr Jekyll' '20th Century', 'Grand Hotel' or 'Midnight'; and "Dr Caligari Cabinet" or "Prague Student" with "The Spy in Bladk", "Contraband" and "Casablanca". <br /> <br /> Look at it!
