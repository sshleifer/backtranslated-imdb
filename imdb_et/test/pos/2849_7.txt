Renee Zellweger is absolutely brilliant as Sister Betty, one of the most charming, amazing and lightweight comedies of the year. <br /> <br /> When the soap opera obsessed with Betty Sizemore, he knows two mysterious murders (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), he clicks and thinks cast members are the cause of Love. He decides to travel to Los Angeles to find the famous heart specialist Dr. David Ravell (at the show). <br /> <br /> Because two strange pairs of Hitmen, Alkaline Rock and Pontifical Freeman create very fun chemistry, and Greg Kinnear has fun with his funny screen actor personality. Renee Zellweger turns to innocent, candy-covered and sometimes terribly sweet performances like Sister Betty. He expresses goodness, warmth and is irresistible. Although the script sometimes feels like sit-com, it sometimes fills incredible signs and understandable situations, Zellweger is so pleasant and completely disarming that it all comes together. <br /> <br /> Just a few black splashes of comedy to keep things interesting, Zellweger's triumph, brilliant supporting casting and a competent script, sister Betty is totally cheerful. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
