The brilliant thriller, which deserves much more fame, is Mitchum and Ryan fantastic in their main roles, as well as the supportive cast. A truly captivating movie diary, with some wonderful pictures and a great dialogue, is at the heart of a strong message of tolerance and understanding. Based on the novel on homophobia, this film is attacking post-war anti-Semitism and all the great intolerance and hatred. Although some may seem a bit preaching to a modern audience, it still has the ability to shock and work very well as a thriller. Credit to all involved.
