"Rock star" is not on the way to any "best rock movies of all time", which is the "heavenly staircase", but it will occasionally jump because of your "high" energy. The theme of the movie is a fan of the dead hard rock group, who actually becomes the singer of his favorite band. The story is based on a real story of what happened to the heavy metal band of the Jewish priest. If you think this movie is full of funny scenarios and intellectuals, then you have one more thing. But what "shook me all night" was the subtle work of Jennifer Aniston as a rock star dedicated girlfriend. I couldn't say the same rock star myself; Mark Wahlberg was much better than a porn star than a rock star. I enjoyed the 80's of retrospective journeys. It reminded me of my teenage years, where everything "smelled like a teenage spirit". I think the movie is worth watching, but for you to have a better time to watch, make sure you include some girls, girls and girls. *** Middle
