What makes "fire" even more attractive by looking beyond your magical art is the touch of femininism and rebellion. In my opinion, the character played by Shabana Azm is a symbol of Indian Indian women protesting against Indian society. The name of the film and the scene, when Radha walks through the flames in her kitchen, is a symbolic Hindu mythology by Lord Rama's husband Sita for a fire to prove her immunity for the narrative about the same film. The film can be a great inspiration for women, especially those on the subcontinent, to search for their freedoms and control their lives.
