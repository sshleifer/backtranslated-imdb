This awesome movie - I've been corrected all the time and ultimately so emotionally overcome! The two young male participants in the film were more than convincing in their performance because their friendship and support for each other was quite plausible and I thought that the comparison / contrast between their home life and health situations was very real between them. The success of this film was obviously teamwork for actors, EPs, manufacturers, writers, directors, and all the products I say, "ATTENTION!" Lost at the beginning of the movie (it was shown in HBO), I was so surprised that I really had to deal with the (though briefly) internet to find the title of this movie - something so big should have been known to me - a clear sign that this movie must be released again!
