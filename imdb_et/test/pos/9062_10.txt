Quirky, vulnerable, raw, honest and gentle. I'm not here to give a summary or a summary of the movie. I just want to congratulate this little movie with a GREAT LARGE EVENT. I see my hat for the filmmaker and that's great. If you want to know what's going on in the movie, look at it. Michael Parness, writer / director, has dealt with a very sensitive and emotional topic - suicide, compassion, comedy and empathy. I see a great career for Mr Parness. This movie works. Just from the horrible opening up to the offer and the honest moments between David Krumholtz and Natasha Lyonne. As with any movie, we have to stop some beliefs, but I found that with MAX AND GRACE I was easily transportable and completely convinced that it was "surreal moments". I just want them to postpone some of these moments even further. Mr. Parness has "already" given some great performances about this talented story. For example, the presence of Guillermo DÃ­az as a shelter patient was both hysterical and mobile. Columbus Ralf Moeller, former Olympiad, when scared patient ... perfect. I can continue and ... This standalone feature has a great budget for a Hollywood movie, but you forget STARS on the screen when you flow with this wonderfully written story. The actual star here is a brilliant scenario. Look forward to more with Writer / Director Michael Parness.
