Manna From Heaven is a light comedy that uses the exaggeration of human fiction to entertain the audience. Throughout the film, there is hope that goodness will go on the surface in every situation. The result is that the film visitor finds himself with this fool, smiling at his face, peace in his heart, and high expectations of the human being. Watching this movie was the most enjoyable experience. (I would like to say an exhilarating experience, but some would say it sounds!)
