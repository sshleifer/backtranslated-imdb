It was one of the films about the Civi War. My aunt played in this movie Justin and Madeline extra in the wedding scene, and my uncle was extra on the horse. The script was genuine and accurate. The costumes were tastefully made, seqence was fine and even the accents were good. I really love Patrick Swayzet and James Ried. They had the best 2 choices and had even great support. Homeland War is my favorite thing in American history and I love this movie. I've seen quite a few, and this movie and it's another North and South book 2 took the cake. If you haven't seen it, rent it. As soon as possible. This is quite a transmission.
