An obsessive love story where the characters have been extremely convincing. I think this film highlights the talent of professional participants. Especially for Vincent Cassel, who wouldn't be the first sign (during filming) that you think of such a role. And yes, he managed to bless the beautiful Monica Belluci next to the film during this creation. I can only say that this movie should have been released in the US instead of thinking about reprocessing. It's just so French, almost perverted .... and so true ... this movie should remain intact ... <br /> <br /> Director who should definitely get more projects because this kind of topic needs the right amount ingredients to avoid making it flop.
