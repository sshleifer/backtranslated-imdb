Vanaja is a movie of super songs. It is exceptionally well thought out, because Mamatha is a crowning jewel, a great production and perhaps a pre-production with the Rajnesh steering wheel, a fantastic way from the South Indian countryside through a 15-year-old eye. song and dance, traditional and modern, blend perfectly with the beautiful background of lush color flora and fauna, which form an excellent experience. What a terrible achievement of the debut organizer !! The casting was completely dead. I would like India to come out with more such films. This film remains one of my favorites for my entire life. 9/10
