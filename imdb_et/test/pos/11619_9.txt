First, this movie is not for everyone. There are scenes of extreme graphic violence and "distracting" images that, by their very nature, turn off many potential viewers. Obviously, its board reviews - SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY shared by those who have seen it. I'm among those who really liked it for very different reasons. I think it was very ambitious (and quite competitively drawn ...) to gather 18/19 year olds with no budget and little experience. I think every aspect of the film - direction, actor (though the character's performances are more similar to the production or free-form performance because it is because of the nature of the film ...) production, FX, score / sound design - everything is much better than many have seen films that exceed their children's budget and experience ten times. I have not honestly said that since Nacho Cerda GENESIS, the "artistic" style horror film has impressed ... <br /> <br /> First of all - I'm not going to pretend and / or grab all the graphic content of this movie - but knowing it was not a straight narrative film when I went there, I was not disappointed how it played. ATTENTION REVIEW is 4 relatively short vignettes that move around the right brain / left brain lust / anger / psychosis theory, retarding / compassion / "normality". For a brief summary of each chapter: <br /> <br /> OVARIAN EYEBALL basically has only a naked girl with an eyeball cut off her belly. I'm sure this is something symbolic - I don't think I paid much attention at this point and it blows quite quickly. The next "episode" - HUMAN RIGHTS - is a nihilistic, terrible, truly horrible story of a man who is both in love and his pregnant sister who gives his growing psychosis a shocking conclusion to this chapter. HUMAN BOOK is the best bunch in my book and it is probably under the skin. The narrative of the death contribution emphasizes the growing tension, as you know that something terrible is happening - but you are not quite sure what it is. Do it yourself and if you are interested in seeing this movie - don't do it too much. Come into the open mind and the iron stomach and I think you are pleasantly surprised, especially with this particular episode. <br /> <br /> REBIRTH has a number of people who are screwing the ground and blowing trees and things. . Probably "intelligent" interpretation of "rape" or something like that. Not bad, but it is also quite short and I missed it from the point ... <br /> <br /> And the right yarn / MARTYRDOM seems to be related to religion and religious hypocrisy and, with HUMAN RIGHTS, some of this function is "most heavier "images / messages ... <br /> <br /> OVARIAN EYEBALL is nothing to write home, mainly because of its very short working hours, but makes a decent segment of madness that comes ... and REBIRTH is such a short and not quite thoughtful provocative, but HUMAN BRAIN (especially) and LEGEND / MARTYRDOM are both on the wall and well done to make them more than compensate for other parts. I think the main reason I liked it is that "shocking", "repulsive", "violent" and "excessive", as it is, is done very beautifully and you can say that it was real labor. of love. Nothing about the film knows cheapness or haste, and even if the content is not completely decipherable, it is undoubtedly original - and that alone is a few points in my book. Not that every "weird art building" movie with an incomprehensible plot should be praised for this "originality", but SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY is a movie I think I will look at a few more times in the near future to see what other interpretations I will benefit from . Again, this film is not for all of ABSOLUEL - some very extreme scenes of murders, murders, rape, incidents, hoaxes, etc. It's definitely there to make the viewer look harder for this movie. I have to say that it worked for me and I look forward to working with Hussain / Cerda to be announced next. Check if you have a belly for it - 9.5 / 10
