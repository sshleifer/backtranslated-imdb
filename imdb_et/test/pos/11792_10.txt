Another brilliant imagination of Kiefer Sutherland, who is Mickey Hayden, a cop who deals with the psychic visions of murdered victims. I totally love movies in the psychic field and I was not disappointed with "Kill of the Killer" (AKA After Alice). I just want the film to be released for the first time.
