After 66 years, "Flash Gordon" is still an attractive sci-fi / adventure / epic feeling that many of today's adventures in science fiction are trying and unable to deliver. The only way to fully enjoy this series is to just sit back and choose nothing (hokey effect, dialogue, why Flash doesn't go to Princess Aura, etc.). And for your older people who saw "Flash Gordon" on the serial screen or on the television "back" if you want this fine series to remain attractive for future generations, take your kids / grandchildren to watch it when you're young. It worked for me (men aged 18 or over). 9 out of 10
