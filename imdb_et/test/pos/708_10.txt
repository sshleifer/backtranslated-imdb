The first time I saw this movie, I was a child. I was ten years old when it was released, but since my family never went to cinemas, I saw it on Network TV. I remember watching it alone? It was just another movie to find an illegal answer (Rocky was the first one) and there is not much more. I can't say exactly why; Larry "Rain" Murphy no longer deserves to win that Rocky Balboa or anyone else. I know I admire Murphy, not so much what he did, but how he did his time. Stoic. He does not need a stopwatch or freedom to find dignity. He ran because he got. He had no other reason. I have the rule today that when I see this movie on cable television late in the evening (this is the only time it's most exposed), I have to look at what I have to do next morning. Fortunately, it is often not like Shawshank Redemption or other favorites, so I still get a lot of sleep and I never robbed a man of imprisonment and personal victory.
