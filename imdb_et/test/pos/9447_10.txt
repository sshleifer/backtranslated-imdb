He's the man who was the fun movie I've ever seen. I laughed so hard that I cried. It was also very romantic. Channing Tatum is absolutely proud and can really act. It is not sure that he also has quite a few scarf scenes. Channing and Amanda have amazing chemistry and they were absolutely wonderful. I love this movie. When viewing, be sure to follow the last deleted scene. It was a huge mistake to cut this scene because it is one of the best scenes in the movie. I highly recommend this movie. Amanda has never been funny. And Channing will be a big star. This is the very first of this bright new star.
