This is undoubtedly the most stunning and amazing documentary I've ever seen! The images shown are completely breathless and stunning. In addition, it is a great learning experience. I am not one for educational documents, but it grabs you and won't let you finish. You're so gripped and entranced by what you look at to forget about watching TV at home! This series is available for purchase on DVD and I recommend doing so! All the evils and deaths of this world give this documentary proof that life is beautiful and sustainable and preserving.
