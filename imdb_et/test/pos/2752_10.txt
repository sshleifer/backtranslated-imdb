I saw Riverdance - a new show and loved it from the first moment! It is an energetic respect for Irish dance, full of brilliant dances, music and choreography! For managers, Jean Butler and Colin Dunne, I had a fine dance! Are they always shining and dancing. Their staging chemistry was amazing and their unity on the stage was obvious. They look like they were dancing with each other! This is my absolute favorite and probably always. Long Live Riverdance!
