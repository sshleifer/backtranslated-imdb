Wow, just hit this movie from Blockbuster and I love such gems. Although it was definitely budgeted and somewhat cumbersome in editing (i.e., accident, hospital scenes, second to last scene), I give the first 10-star staging effort! I loved ideas that provoke thinking, and if you are a free thinker and open to ideas outside the box, I highly recommend this movie. I think the filmmaker and writer Jay Floyd should pay some attention and opportunities to the film industry. On the basis of his credit, he can be another Quentin Tarantino.
