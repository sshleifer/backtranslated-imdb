After the atomic bomb hit Hiroshima, the dredged bodies are repositioned, the deformed victims are trying to communicate with relatives who cannot even recognize them, and one person after another dies of radiation disease. This black and white film, which is sad and frightening, is not without humor. The story revolves around the young woman, Yasuko, who was hit by black rain after the explosion. She is trying to get married, but everyone dies and people are worried that the same thing will happen to her. After finding a suitable mate (who has lost his thought after the war for too long), he shows signs of a radiological illness. This film is a big nuclear attack on Japan, it scares you and maybe makes you cry. Operation is good, not too dramatic, like many other ww2 movies.
