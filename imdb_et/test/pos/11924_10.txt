I've loved this movie because I saw it in the theater in 1991. For 12 years, Wil Wheaton was my favorite actor and youngster. I'm 23 now and I love this movie. The best part of this is who I am dating who loves it because it's a complete macho-man movie! It's done with enough action and chaos to keep men short of glue-glued attention. I want it available on DVD!
