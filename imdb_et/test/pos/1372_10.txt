I have to admit that I know some of the people involved, the predecessor of the planet, Evil Unleased, but it was more than 10 years ago and I had disappeared since then. I happened to look at the topic of BBC Scotland News and Scottish Cinema, which it mentioned and the comments of The Planet clips and its director Mark Stirton, which prompted me to order a copy of the movie from the DVD. <br /> <br /> Now, the movie shows, writing, directing and sfx is where there are some of the best, OK, it's not Star Wars, but I've seen a lot of Hollywood products that are much worse. It is very strange looking at a movie that is spoken in my local Northeast Scotland accent, but which will soon be over. <br /> <br /> Light spoilers ^ <br /> <br /> Planet manages a number of sci-fi classics; Star Wars, Alien, Pitch Black, Forbidden Planet and Predator, a handful of deep space spacecraft survivors survive by ships attacked and destroyed by unknown ships, they flee to an abandoned desert, one by one killing invisible attackers, only passengers, a mysterious prisoner, do it on the planet, The battle arises when a team struggles to survive. Planet is a great sci-fi movie that will definitely hide this limited budget, well done by Mark, Mike and all involved, looking forward to your next work.
