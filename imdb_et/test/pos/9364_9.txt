Crossfire is one of those forties films that shouts remake when, for some reason other than perhaps, it's time to do it as originally written. The story on which the film is based is the killing of a homosexual person. But anti-Semitism was undoubtedly a hot topic in the post-World War II days, with everyone's fresh, fresh Holocaust. <br /> <br /> The Lee server biography Robert Mitchum, Edward Dmytryk, interviewed the director and said that the film could never be done for hate crimes that were in violation with gays when the code was firmly in place. It might have been because the character of Robert Ryan is such an equal opportunity for everything that differs from his social norms. <br /> <br /> Mitchum was not in any doubt that he was riding in the movie. Robert Young was cast as the captain of the Washington police police killing, who grabbed the incident and, when Mitchum was another bill, he knew from the beginning that the film belonged to Ryan. But he was RKO's new star in his performance of GI Joe's story and Till The Time of Time, so he was there for box box insurance. Mitchum's part was Sergeant Sergeant and Friend George Cooper. <br /> <br /> Crossfire cannot be combined, although we don't see the crime, Montgomery is one who kills Sam Levene, a Jewish salesman. And for Young and Mitchum it turns out Ryan is guilty of the party almost as fast as the audience. The only question is getting evidence. Though he lost to Edmund Gwenn, the film played a role in Ryan's breakthrough. Likewise, Gloria Grahame was named short actor for the best actor, but she lost Celeste to Holm for gentlemen's agreement. In fact, Crossfire Gentleman's agreement rose and lost the best picture and best director Dmytryk to Elia Kazan. The best scenario is fifth, and Crossfire came again short when Miracle was on 34th Street. <br /> <br /> Gloria Grahame also had her own problems with her personal life. She had a big problem with her and then with her husband Stanley Clements, who was an abusive husband. He hung around the set, causing Ed Dmytryk a lot of trouble. Fortunately, Grahame's share was small. In fact, the whole movie was shot in a typical RKO economy style for 20 days. <br /> <br /> Robert Young has a particularly good scene where William Phipps is a young boy from Tennessy in Mitchum and Ryan's outfit who Ryan is continually belittles. The young is the most angry about the corrosive nature of hatred and how it affected his family as Irish Catholics who came to the potato famine years. This was one of Robert's best moments on the screen during his long career. <br /> <br /> Like a movie like Crossfire, it's time to be rebuilt as a story of anti-gay hate. Particularly Barry Winchell's recent killing and discussion of gays in the army. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that has reached and almost disappeared.
