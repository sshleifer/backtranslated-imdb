Many TV screens and memorable appearances of four contemporary mega stars (plus the Hope Davis screen) still keep Flatliner cautious. The plot is a non-academic study of about five medical undergraduate studies, which follows its mad idea of ​​discovering the mystery of death and learning what is after death, and then back to life. However, the story has not been as interesting as the idea of ​​the plot. <br /> <br /> Stereotypes are popular to have a regular teen script in Flatliners. There is Nelson, who creates the idea of ​​decoding death, beautiful but introverted Rachel, David, who fortunately cuts the Gordia knot not for school, female guy Joe and finally wise man Randy ("I didn't come to the doctor"). At school, kill your classmates, no matter how they may be. They join hands in a test where Nelson's heart is stopped and re-armed. Then they decide to continue this experiment in the strict faith of the night campus. Not long after Nelson's experience, everyone will compete to have the most wild and longest killing experience, risking their lives one by one. But soon they will realize that their experiences are affected by their daily lives. Afternoon visits will bring back their criminals from their childhood memories. By depolarizing their deep subconscious vigilance, they begin somatic fraud and visual hallucinations. <br /> <br /> When it comes to unconsciousness, director Joel Schumacher skips that every person has a subconscious mind that they are unaware of. This inner personality keeps itself unchanged from identity loss. If you lose or depolarize the personality of this subconscious, you will definitely lose your identity instead of updating your childhood memories. I wanted to add it to the film, which has already been mentioned through film critics of the 1990s. Of course, Schumacher's participants in this film made the least impact on it. Then why do they hesitate to continue the experiment after learning the lesson, as death would be undiscovered by God? David was introduced as an atheist, now he believed in God when he recalled a rebound from his childhood. After showing this 180-degree change in David, it is clear that Schumacher's film was both conservative and lily-liver; this is ultimately the reason why it is never considered to be scientific literature. Unfortunately! That was a good potential. He even tried to say death with unconsciousness, starting with the belief that death is so natural and it is only part of human life. <br /> <br /> More than what is in the movie, it was memorable to recall what comes with the film. Jan de Bont, as an operator who worked with Schumacher almost every time, creates a dreamy atmosphere, like the Gothic horror film. The blue color schemes across the wall, reflecting the faces of the actors, provide first-class lighting that fits perfectly with the film. Bont's skills were close-ups of university buildings, Catholic frescoes, wall motion cameras, and dynamic camera speeds. <br /> <br /> Flatliners became a cult film in a timely manner with its X-generation juvenile sociological portrait, especially through a futuristic editing style associated with scenario association sequences, as much aesthetically as part of the video music clip. These were times when the clips of accelerated and multi-sequential video music grew. This style was very rare during these years after pioneer Tony Scot's "The Hunger" (1983).
