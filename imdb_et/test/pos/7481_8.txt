I love this assumption, but it is a recurring value only for certain parts (of course, to the beginning). Some characters are a bit outrageous, but they are still fun. I think Ballping sh-t rejected it. I know that it was to show that Nick and Casey lived in LA and showed why Casey gave up his lifestyle, I just think the feedback story might have been better. It is also a smart and entertaining phone that speaks by phone, but again I think the story was sloppy. It really looks incredible. I believe that swordfish (another film by Woods) is more than a few on Thursday because the government keeps secret all the time and organizations that the public never knows. <br /> <br /> Thursday is the best Quentinesque movie I've ever seen. I think Woods is imaginative, smart, and he must have; but his work needs more maturation to get even the Natural Born Killer script (not Stone movie) level. How old is he anyway?
