I'm not a big musical fan, but it's one of the few I really love. Unlike many other musicals, such as "Music Sound", no songs are free. Every song is a social commentary, a boost to war, sexuality, reluctance, spirituality, and freedom. Particularly amazing songs are "Easy To Be Hard", "Aquarius Age", "Hair", "Flesh Failures / 3-5-0-0", "Walking In Space" and "Hare Krishna". Totally revolutionary and wonderful. I can't wait to see it live for a while!
