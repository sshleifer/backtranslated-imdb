I have to say that I didn't expect much about this movie, but it didn't turn out to be bad. Of course the most prominent was Aidani Quin's performance. I do not expect this beautiful actor as a hero of vision. The big thing is that he really builds his character (Annibal). I mean, it wasn't like Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis, he was sensitive and modest. For example, he is really upset when he kills someone. I also noticed that some clich√©s were avoided. If Annibal gets his training, he would have expected him to be rebellious and act like any average American in such a situation, asking what f *** is and refusing to cooperate. But Annibal is a professional sea officer, she doesn't give up and she tries not to lose her courage, where she succeeds quite well, except for a short break on Christmas Eve, which I think was very realistic. I am glad that Aidan Quinn had the opportunity to show his other side (actually two because he is also playing the cable), although the film was not so successful.
