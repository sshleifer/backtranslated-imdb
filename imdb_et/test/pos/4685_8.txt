A few years ago I saw it for the first time in the classic classic editing of the sixties with Mini Coopers and I remember it very well. Now, about two years later, it was shown on television and I just wanted to know if I would still like it as much as I could see in the cinema. Well, the answer is yes. <br /> <br /> The film is a team of robbers who is doing one final job in Russia, Italy. The plan is flawless and perfect. They flee and don't have to work for the rest of their lives. But there is one problem they didn't take into account: nobody wants to loot their ranks, but wants to keep it all, even if it means they have to kill the rest of the team. But everything but one survives and they are revenge. A year later, in Los Angeles this time, the surviving team members create a smart and despicable plan to steal gold and revenge the traitor ... <br /> <br /> The story itself is, of course, not very original because it is a remake of the original 1969 movie there are many good things that will forget you. This is a typical action / action film, but it is definitely one of the best. The activity is very nice, landscapes and Venice are real eye candies, the story is OK and the special effects are stunning. Even the actor is very good, something you don't often see on film. I have to admit that I really liked what I saw and I give this movie a well-earned 7.5 / 10.
