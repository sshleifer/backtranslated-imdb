An amazing, deeply moving criminal thriller featuring Andy Lau and Lau Ching Wan. <br /> <br /> This exciting cat and mouse can't miss the exciting opening order to an extremely satisfying conclusion. <br /> <br /> Johnny To, who once again works with the artistic artist Arthur Wong, builds another operator who carries his own modernity. <br /> <br /> Their images are strong and moving. Her cutting with extraordinary music marks is exemplary. You are in the hands of a master artist. <br /> <br /> Two sequences in which Andy Lau "hides" the police on the bus, pretending to be accompanied by beautiful beauty (Ruby Wong), To's unique Lau Ching Wan is strong and commanded as a harassed cop, while Andy Lau is a dynamic, deadly person who wanted his father to die. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie making, with some poor English dubbing in one scene with Waise Lee criminal.
