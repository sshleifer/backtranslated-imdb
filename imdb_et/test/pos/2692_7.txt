I need help identifying the Queen's episode. It starts with a scene where Doug talks to Carrie on the phone, and suggests that they agree to stop every "I love you" conversation. However, it is difficult to do and he will come back calling him back only "I love you." It is a very smart time and I think there are many relationships that have been going on for a long time. hinted and throw career reviews at Carrie to get your spirits up. <br /> <br /> I saw this episode recently, but it was probably a repeat. I don't know what network I saw. Does anyone tell me the title and season of this episode?
