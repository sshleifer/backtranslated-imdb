If you know something about the Manhattan project, you will find at least "Fat Man and Little Boy" at least the events surrounding this interesting event. In all cases, the film is a very realistic picture of these events, and in many ways it is almost too real (for example, some radiation poisoning). Paul Newman, as usual, is great in his role and always manages to come out as a real person on the screen. Supporting casting, such as John Cusack, Laura Dern, Bonnie Bedelia, and Natasha Richardson, is also quite good. However, this film is not one of the best examples of making a real story into a movie. Big movies can make a real story and use just enough artistic license to keep your audience for the whole movie. But it tends to be a bit overwhelmed, and some scenes (such as John Cusack and Natasha Richardson's love story) could have been completely lost without much loss. Nevertheless, there are enough interesting facts and tiny humor bits to keep the audience at least interesting enough to see the whole movie. It is not always entertaining, but in the case of large images, it is very accurate, exciting and leaves the audience to think. <br /> <br /> *** out ****
