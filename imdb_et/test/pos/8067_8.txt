Annie Rooney lives with her father and brother Tim in the slums of New York, where she constantly participates with many other children in the neighborhood. Annie is a secret Joe Kelly (whose little brother Mickey is a gang that Annie is constantly fighting) who is in a bang that is in trouble, says official Rooney. Kelly is sponsoring a dance where Tony plans to shoot Kelly to make her even stupid to look like a fool in front of her girl, but Officer Kelly is deadly wounded. Tim (part of Kelly's gang) has said Tony and his friend Spider that Kelly put his father in, so he goes with his revenge. Annie is learning about it and is going to stop her brother if she is on time. Very good combination of humor and heart in this movie, although the plot doesn't start up to the 40-minute mark on the movie. Pickford is enjoyable (though he was 33 years old, playing a girl no more than 12-13) and really gets into his character. Haines doesn't play Kelly as hard as she should, but she can feel her emotionally. Scenes where Officer Annie tells her father about the death and ends up really sticking. A whole mix of all kinds of children in the movie is fun to watch. Assessment, 8.
