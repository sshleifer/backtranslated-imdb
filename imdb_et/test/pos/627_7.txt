I've been waiting for 9 years to watch this movie just because I didn't see it advertised on TV. Finally I got it and it was expected. It's much better than your superfluous shepherd or previous summer garbage, because it's all at a fast pace, without pulling out, hitting through the house's cheesy music scenes. Only bad duplication lets it down a bit, but don't let it go down in some way. What lies below - a mortgage and a mess. Mute Witness - Low budget, not at all mortgaged and very good.
