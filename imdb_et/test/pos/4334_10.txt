The film is incredible, it has a sound that determines the tone of the film. The lines of the movie are great, such as "Nothing to good for out friends" and "It's time to collect Charlie's time." I can watch this movie over and over again and still laugh because the lines and activities are sort of. I feel when I watch this movie, I want to go out and shoot the bad guys. If there is a movie that you don't want to miss. "They killed Giggler's husband, they killed Giggler." They had no right to do it, he took care of our turf. " The lines remain in the movie. Deff. go out and not rent, but buy this movie that is worth the money, trust me.
