Mullholland Drive proves once again that David Lynch is a film director. Last night, I went perfectly to the history of cinema. The performances are amazing, the score is amazing and photography is amazing. David's ability to strain the elements of filmmaking as a unique and stunning film experience is unequal. When I looked at Mullholland Drive, I couldn't understand that we were truly blessed with David Lynch in this world. Cinema is also blessed because David Lynch's films show that one man's vision can be realized with great results. We understand that blockers are not the only way. We understand that a true filmmaker has the opportunity in this world and that we are truly blessed.
